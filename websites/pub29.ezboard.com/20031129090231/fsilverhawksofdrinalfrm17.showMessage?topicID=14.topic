<br>
The deep-throated roars and growls erupted suddenly out of the silence.  Shields raised and battle-cries answered the charging gnolls charging from the shadows of the dank cavern.  Frantic, hurried chants from thin-voiced robe wearers faltered in fear.  Weapons rang in metallic throng as they struck shield and armor.  A mailed human warrior fell to his knees, stunned from a blow to the head.  A dark-skinned cleric called out in prayer to his god, his hands surrounded with a growing bluish aura, only to go dark as a great gnoll guardsman loomed over him suddenly and brought his spiked mace down in a deadly arc.  Another mailed warrior was overcome and buried under a wave of dog-faced humanoids.  A ball of intense flame hissed through the melee and engulfed one of the charging enemy, hair and skin shriveling and burning hideously and with frightening speed.  For a moment, the battle paused.<br>
<br>
All too soon, the light died out.  Elation filled the robe-adorned youth, his chest heaving.  Just as suddenly it left and his body froze in mid breath.  A half dozen towering gnolls turned away from the smoldering carcass and turned a menacing glare upon him.  A wave of numbing fear washed over him and through his limbs even as his feet backpedaled down the ramp.  He was dimly aware of seeing his friends motionless forms on the earthen floor before turning to run.  A desperate gasp of air escaped him as he ran, looking back over his shoulder in fright as he fled.  The bloodthirsty cries of the evil horde rose up in a chaotic chorus behind him.  He was going to die, he thought.  This was not supposed to have happened.  They said they would protect him, the warriors had.  They lied.   They had fallen and now he was being chased.  They ran too fast.  They would catch him.  Why did his robes feel so heavy?  When would he feel their spears stick into his back? What would it feel like?<br>
<br>
The cave walls, dimly lit by torches, whirled around him suddenly as his head and body spun about, jolted harshly from running full into the blood red spike jutting up from the stone floor.  He came to his senses and his vision cleared quickly.  He was on his back.  His heart still raced wildly as he pushed up on his elbows.  Dark laughter mixed with the battle-cries as the gnolls rushed in for the kill.  He could not even move.  Paralyzing fear gripped him.  He was alone.  Deep in the tunnels of Blackburrow, murderous gnolls rushing upon him, his friends dead, and he would die here without anyone ever knowing what happened to him.  He'd thought he'd return with souvenirs of victory and make his parents proud.  In his mind's eye he saw them standing on the doorstep awaiting his return.  He'd said he would be back by sundown.  He saw his mother's worried face.<br>
<br>
Reality crashed back into him as a snarling gnoll growled in his face, fangs dripping, eyes hating.  The face moved away as the tall guardsman stood up from his stooped position, feet planted on either side of his legs, and raised its sword high with both arms.  Death.  The youth could only stare.<br>
<br>
The sudden crash of the silver-plated knight from the side into the midsection of the gnoll, knocking him over backwards with a powerful shield-punch, was like lightning in the night sky.  A blade like he'd never seen before, curved and shaped in the dark outline of a dragon's face, attached to the end of a long, dark metal shaft, stabbed forward and sent a yelping gnoll racing off into the darkness.  Another knight, shining in silver, taller and thicker limbed than the first, leaped to his companion's side and joined the fray.  He also held a long, dragon-headed weapon.  In his other hand was a shield with a spike at its center.  Side by side they stood, forming a shield between him and his would-be murderers.<br>
<br>
Their shields swung and cleared room in the thick melee for the deadly blows from their long weapons to fall.  Sickening thuds and anguished yells sounded loudly as the enemy crashed to the ground near his feet.  The gnolls towered over even these bright knights, but their vicious weapons hit only shields or struck glancing blows as the two artfully adjusted their stance continuously, giving no clear target yet always remaining between him and the enemy.  The efficiency in their movements, the precision, the quickness, the ease with which they blocked with shield, accepted the force of the blow, and struck back with their mighty weapons left him awestruck.<br>
<br>
In moments there was a tangled mass of corpses at his feet.  To either side stood the knights, not pursuing, only watching as a half dozen of the wounded enemy retreated into the shadows up the ramp.  One turned to him now and stooped over him.   The spiked shield was rested against another of those horrid, blood-red spikes sticking up out of the level floor.  A mailed hand stretched forward and gripped his shoulder as he looked up, still in shock.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you wounded?&quot; came the voice from behind the silver visor.  It was reassuringly friendly and in stark contrast to the voices of the gnolls.  Intense blue eyes shown through the eye holes.  &quot;Are you wounded?&quot; it asked again.<br>
<br>
The repeating of the question brought him out of his shock.  He hurriedly shook his head, gasping out a response finally.  &quot;No, they never touched me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why are you laying on the ground?&quot; the voice responded.  &quot;Get up and quickly.  We haven't much time.&quot;  The mailed hand upon his shoulder tightened in its grip, almost painfully, as he was pulled upward from the floor.  He grimaced instinctively from the pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Handle with care, my friend,&quot; sounded another, deeper voice.  The youth turned to see the other knight turning to face them.  Much to his surprise, the knight knelt before him.  The helmeted head bowed for a moment.  &quot;How may I serve you?&quot; the knight asked before rising.  Then he stood still before him, above him,  &quot;Sir Kirahann Tyrann,&quot; he said, &quot;at your service.&quot;<br>
<br>
The shorter, thinner knight picked up his spiked shield and hefted it in his hand, adjusting the grip.  &quot;Of course, Brother Kirahann.&quot;  He then turned full to the youth and bowed in practiced fashion much as the other had.  &quot;Sir Leafblade, at your service.&quot;  Without hesitation he reached out an arm to turn the youth around and usher him away, saying &quot;Now let us move away from here before the only service we provide is dinner for Lord Elgnub's gnolls.  They shall return, and in greater numbers.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was led through a maze of tunnels, Sir Leafblade always in front, Sir Kirahann always behind.  His knees felt weak and his body tired from exhaustion after the brush with death.  Heartened by the chivalric figures about him, he stayed to his feet and followed.  A few patrols were met along the way, but they were unprepared to meet the knights and were left laying mangled on the ground in pools of their own blood.<br>
<br>
He staggered ahead with them and quite suddenly found himself emerging out into the open, the fangs of the Blackburrow entrance passing by either side of him before his feet touched grass again.  He soaked in the fresh air and light of the day, raining though it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Next time Captain Tillin mentions a bounty on gnoll teeth, tell him to come out here and get them himself instead of sending starry-eyed dreamers and kids out here to die, understand?&quot;  The voice was Leafblade's and it held obvious disgust for the Captain.  He'd never heard anybody talk about the Captain that way back in Qeynos and was surprised to hear it now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brother,&quot; Kirahann said in a chiding tone that spoke volumes.  <br>
<br>
Leafblade sighed within his helm for a moment, then stabbed the bottom end of his dragon-weapon into the ground where it stood on its own.  Reaching up with his free hand, he pulled away his bright, silver helm and clutched it in the curl of his arm.  The dark hair and blue eyes were the most striking features of the visage that stared at him now.  The slender nature of his form revealed him to be a half-elven person, the type his parents often jeered at in the streets of Qeynos.  This one had saved his life, though.  Now he bowed his revealed head forward in a sign of respect and then looked him in the eye.  His tone was even and polite.  &quot;The Champions of the Silver Hawks wish you well in your return home.&quot;  The other knight followed the same show of etiquette before returning his helm to his head, obviously human this time.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know that I was here for gnoll teeth for Captain Tillin?&quot; the youth asked Leafblade.<br>
<br>
The half elven knight before him chuckled knowingly, and perhaps a bit arrogantly, as he raised his helm above his head to don it once more.  &quot;Because, my young friend,-<br>
<br>
Sir Leafblade was cut off from the rest of his statement by the voice of Sir Kirahann who spoke out loud even as he was walking away to re-enter Blackburrow: &quot;Because once upon a time the magnificent Leafblade rushed out here with a rusty sword and starry eyes in search of the very same teeth for the very same Captain.  Isn't that right, SIR Leafblade?&quot;  A metallic chuckle rang feintly from within Kirahann's helm as he walked into the gaping stone maw of the giant gnoll head and into Blackburrow.<br>
<br>
The youth's eyes turned from Kirahann to Leafblade who stood quite still before him, helm still raised just above his head.  The half-elven features seemed to be growing a slight shade of crimson before he slapped his hand on top of the helm, pushing it down over his face.  He gripped the shaft of his dragon-weapon and yanked it from the earth before turning away without another word.  <br>
<br>
The knight moved toward Blackburrow purposefully in pursuit of his knightly companion, disappearing between the gnoll fangs and into the gloomy beyond.  A voice echoed out from the stone hallway a moment later, but the youth could not clearly make out what was said.  He was pretty sure it was Sir Leafblade, and the words sounded something like, &quot;Very funny, Sir Laughalot.  Why did you have to go and say that?&quot;  He thought he heard the clank of metal, like a hand or fist hitting armor.  The deep echoing laughter of Sir Kirahann was umistakable.<br>
