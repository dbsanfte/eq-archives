WHen looking at Greenmist as a quest, it is not just one quest but several quests in succession for evolving a blade into the powerful greenmist, and usulayy done only by Iksar.  As any Iksar knows, who has done their armor or monk quests for Iksar, this is very involved and very consuming.  And now imagine how it is for a non-iksar who had to work on getting faction with Cabilis as well as doing a quest to be handed a kukhri to even start the quest, all told I have spent 4 days getting faction with all factions in cabilis, have done 6 quests and have 2 of the Kukhri quests to go before I can start the true grenmist quest.  I have tried to do many of them before asking the guild for help.  THose who have helped are Arti, Tygerkat, Dene, Vap/Zidane, Gehric, Troth, and Baliff.<br>
<br>
Here is what remains and what my strategy is.....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hero's Khukri</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It starts by asking Lord Qyzar about either the Visceral Dagger, or about the two crusaders who were sent after the dagger, Golin and Fodcod. <br>
<br>
Quest:<br>
<br>
The quest asks you to find the pieces of the Visceral Dagger, put it back together, and then return it to Lord Qyzar with your Crusaders Khukri, with the result being exp, faction and the very nice Hero's Khukri. To perform this task, you must head to Dalnir, and camp 4 different rooms for the 4 pieces necessary for the dagger. The exact places and mobs for the pieces of the dagger are listed below. The Hilt looks like a long metal tube/pipe. The Forge Hammer of Dalnir looks like a normal war hammer or Forging Hammer, the Jagged Metal Shard and Sharp Metal Shard look like a Canine tooth. Once you have acquired these pieces, you must combined them all (3 pieces of dagger and hammer) in the &quot;Always Works Forge&quot; also located in Dalnir. Once combined, you will have the Visceral Dagger, and then, as stated above, you turn in the Visceral Dagger and your Crusader's Krukri into Lord Qyzar, who is up in the Shadow Knight's Guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I have the hilt from a previous attempt and I can do this solo at 52, when I get there.  problem with Dalnir is there are tons of casters and they kick the crap out of me.  I may be able to do this with a healer, and most likely and more preferably, a druid since they heal, evac, and damage shield which helps more than a cleric.  Shaman would be my second choice.<br>
<br>
In this I basically need just the hammer, and the two blade pieces, all of which are on the third floor.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Update:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  I got the jagged metal shard thanks to Dene, and now I need to camp the other Kly Imprecator in the Church to get the other piece.  WHen I have them all, i will camp the Blacksmith in the statue room and combine them all in the forge and call this puppy done.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Lord of Pain's Khukri</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This quest follows the Hero's Krukri Quest. It starts by talking to Arch Duke Xog and ask him about the &quot;Lost Scrolls of Vok Na Zov.&quot; Once you mention this to him, the Arch Duke will then tell you about Argent and the lost scrolls, saying that no one can understand them. He will then commission you to retrieve an understandable copy of the scrolls.<br>
<br>
Quest:<br>
This quest has basically been divided into two parts. The first one sends you around the world in search of Illegible Scrolls and the second part sends you into the Temple of Droga to decipher the Scrolls, and even meeting the lost crusader Argent. There are 6 illegible scrolls throughout the world. The first one is found on the Failed Crypt Raider who is located in the Library of Kaesora. The next 3 scrolls are found on the Spectral Courier in the stables of City of Mist. The final 2 scrolls are found in Castle Mistmoore, on the continent of Faydwer. The fifth one is on the Dark Librarian in the Library, and the sixth one is on the Dark Librarian Assistant who is in a side room near the Throne Room in Mistmoore After retrieving all 6 scrolls, the next step is to head to Temple of Droga. In the Jail section, there will be a Goblin Penkeeper and a Goblin Penmaster. You must kill these MOB's and their placeholders until you obtain the Bone Key (Penmaster), Bone Necklace Key (Penmaster), and Stone Key (Penkeeper). Once you have all 3 keys, you must wait for an &quot;enslaved iksar prisoner&quot; to spawn, this is Argent. If you hail him he will say nothing, but if you mention Greenmist he will tell you it is a foolish quest and to leave it alone. Give him the 3 keys, and he will return to you &quot;a course iron needle,&quot; the part needed to make the &quot;Always Works&quot; machine to work. Now with the 6 Illegible Scrolls and &quot;a course iron needle&quot; go directly across from where the prisoners are kept, to another jail cell where the &quot;Always Works&quot; machine is kept. This machine will look Pottery Wheel and you will need to place the scrolls and needle in it, hitting the combined button, in order to make the &quot;Stupendous Tome.&quot; Take the Tome and your Hero's Khukri and return them to the Arch Duke to receive some experience, faction, and the Lord of Pain's Khukri. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Okay I have done more on this one than I did on Dalnir.  This one is a pain because the library, as I have found out, is a long camp because the crypt raider is a rare spawn and the PH respawns every ten minutes.  I have been there twice already, once with Gehric, Dene, Zidanne, and Troth; and once with Arti, Aktara, and Troth, and neither time did it spawn after several hours of camping.  Again I may be able to camp this solo, but I need both IVU and Invis, and have found out I can not take on more than two of the greens without having a big worry.  A back-up druid or SHammy can help even the odds.  Due to the nature of the Library and its spawn I have tried not to drag too many people into this long and mindless camp.<br>
<br>
The remaining scrolls I have collected thanks to Nynne and Troth.<br>
<br>
The part of the quest dealing with Droga I may need some help on.  I have no idea what Droga looks like, and have never been there.  I don;t even know the rarity of the spawn.  I look to the only person I know knows about Droga, and that is Elbryann, who I was told led a few raids there.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
&quot;I can see you have alot of devotion to your cause...Krikk, was it? I did too, but that was before the Crusaders were what they are now.&quot; <br>
<br>
This voice spoke to me as a friend, and I was almost familiar with it, however had never met the speaker. An Iksar stood before me, his body naked other than the Robes that covered his ghostly translusent body. But I could tell he needed no clothes. The only weapon he needed was his distinguished honor. And his armor, strength and inteligence matched by gods. I stayed silent. <br>
<br>
&quot;When I was younger, in the days before our Lord's blessing, there was a race of Snake-People who had enslaved our kind. How we resented them, and how relieved we were at their extinction.&quot; <br>
<br>
I knew who he was, and I remembered the text documenting these events. This must have been but a dream. <br>
<br>
&quot;But something eluded us, Krikk. Look upon the moon. It glows so bright, we thought with a moon so beautiful, nothing so horrible could happen. But that very moon houses those we thought gone. Search the land, young knight, and find my lost strength. Once you're armed with that strength, the path to our final revenge will be open.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rile had spoken, and then I was awaking. <br>
<br>
Librarian Zimor had recently begun work in the Crusader's guildhall, but had an extensive ammount of knowledge on our past. I told him about my dream, and asked about Greenmist. He told me he hadn't much idea of what the moon-portion of my dream had meant, but said I should join the crusade on Chardok to recover lost books. <br>
<br>
It was the moment I had been waiting for. The legions of Crusaders, Troopers, Mystics, Swiftails, and Warloks were departing for the Burning Woods to retake our library from the Sarnak swarms, and their crumbling lair, Chardok. We left later that day. <br>
<br>
In Chardok, the Lair of the Higher Sarnaks, built into a large mountain, we fought with every breath we had. In the library, Loremaster Piza'Tak Grand LoreMaster Di`Korr hid from our attack. I guess they knew why we were there. I pryed the History of Greenmist from the Loremaster's body, and after our raid on the Sarnak Stench-hole, returned to Cabilis. <br>
<br>
Librarian Zimor, &quot;Thank you for returning this tome, Krikk. It was scribed before my existance. &quot; <br>
<br>
he held the book briefly, and looked lost in it's pages. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here, Knight, take this to Prime Heirophant Qxyn downstairs. we've been waiting for the Shaman's visions to materalize.&quot; <br>
<br>
I took the note to Oxyn, downstairs. The tribe of Mystics began to howl, and in a fury of excitment, Oxyn handed me a Vile of liquid. I asked what was inside the bottle, and he refered me to Alchemist Granika, who was near the recently over-taken Overthere Outpost. I traveled through Warslisk woods to The Overthere, and sure enough, waiting near the east wall of our old Outpost was Alchemist Granika. I introduced myself, and gave him the liquid. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, what's this, Krikk? A Bottle of Liquid Deklium...amazing. I hope you're prepaired to fight. I've noticed that the wretched Tier' Dal within our old Overthere Stronghold are planning the release of something unearthly. With this, I can see which of their Gollem's have within them that which you are looking for.&quot; <br>
<br>
After some time, a group of undead Troopers made their way into the open from within the Fort, surrounding a Cliff Gollem. After he was alone, we swarmed around the living earth, and with his death, found the shard of metal that the Alchemist spoke of, the Chunk of Tynnonium. Upon my return to Cabilis, I let Oxyn examine it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot; He raised the Chunk of Tynnonium above his head, and again went into a Trance. Shortly after, he brushed it off, stood in silence for a moment, and then quickly scribed a note for the Librarian. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm glad you've returned. This Tome has been most informative, and seemingly, the Sarnak Collective has been studying the Greenmist. However, it's not for them. Rile meant for us to wield it. For you to. Here are some notes I've written for the creation of Greenmist.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Notes from the Greenmist Tome read as follows: <br>
<br>
I made these notes from my interpretation of the Sarnak tome. Read them carefully. The weaponsmith who created the Greenmist still exists in some form. He has been tormented for a very long time and may not remember his art. If this is the case, there may still be some chance of recovering the design of the sacred blade. The key lies with the Lich-King's beloved. It is rumored the lich had a mirror created that allows his beloved Drusella to see her former self in its reflection. Perhaps this artifact can offer you some assistance in this quest. Several items will be needed to recreate the Greenmist Khukri. A special hammer was specifically created to fold and sculpt the weapon's blade. Both the Greenmist and this hammer were created on the same day. Only the year is know. The year was 1406. The tome mentions that the Sarnak were actively seeking the tool. The formula that will be needed to melt the Tynnonium is written in the back of this book. Use this book when you find the forge needed to create the Khukri. You will need a design pattern, the block of Tynnonium, the hammer, and this tome to create the Greenmist blade. To finish the weapon, you will need the Lord of Pain's Khukri, this tome, the hammer, the Greenmist blade, and a Greenmist shard or fragment. We have not found any Greenmist fragments. All items must be forged in the hottest of all forges, the Forge of Dalnir. May the will of Cazic -Thule guide you. <br>
<br>
After some rest, Tsaer, my shaman friend, and I ventured to the Sarnak's other outpost near the Lake of Ill Omen. After some journey, we had fought our way into the fort. The small reinforcment of Sarnaks were weak at best, and with the death of one, Tsaer took an Iksar Skull from the lifeless Sarnak. At the far end of the Fort, there's a room with elite sarnak guards stationed there. We had guessed they were guarding someone or something important. After dispatching them individually, we found the hammer of 1406 on Weaponsmith Ko'zirr's carcass, which means the Sarnak were one step closer to achieving Greenmist's reconstruction than we were. <br>
<br>
Next, Tsaer, myself, and a small force of Iksar troopers made our way to Howling Stones, to find the lost love of Venril Sathir. After we brought her second death, one lucky trooper found a necklace that supposibly granted a physical supperiority to it's wearer. Some speculated it's authenticity. However, lying in her decrepit remains was also a Mirror. I brought this with me. <br>
<br>
The Sarnak inhabitants of Chardok were reportably bent on re-pilfering our recovered tome, Arch Duke Xog ordered a battalion of Cabilis's Knights to put an end to their attempts once and for all by striking their Highest Ranking members inside Chardok itself. Many Sarnak were slaughtered, including the Apprentice Herbalist. A pouch of trinkets was recovered by a lucky shadow knight who was on the raiding team, and he thought I'd be able to make use of the Greenish Metal Shard within. I thanked him. <br>
<br>
Next, I traveled to Karnor's Castle, the home of Venril's Spirit, and the minions he has control over. The kingdom was in the middle of the Dreadlands, a wasteland that lived up to it's title. Many fighters were already there warding off the beasts inside. I made my way to the Drovlog Captain's chambers, and suddenly felt a piercing instinct from deep inside. I looked into the adjacent room, and almost as easily as breathing, uncovered some filfth to find a broken sword. I felt the same feeling as I did in my dream. <br>
<br>
Deep inside Dalnir, where I forged the Dagger earlier, existed a wandering spirit, that of Dalnir himself. Remembering the greenmist notes, I showed him the Mirror of Self Loathing from Drusila, and he gazed into it. With a brief pause, muscle, bone, and scale materalized once again over his spirit. <br>
<br>
He let lose an unearthly scream at his rebirth, and breathed hard. When he was able, he spoke to me, &quot;I've seen Rile, heard his urgent cries in my nightmares. How I wish to be in the land of the dead, to see him and our kind once again. Why have you brought me back, young knight?&quot; <br>
<br>
I explained my task, and the mirror droped. I quickly retrieved it off the ground. <br>
<br>
&quot;I see...return to me with a quill and partchment, Rile's old Blade, and that very mirror. I'll write you plans to fully restore the blade I once had a part in making.&quot; <br>
<br>
Reluctantly, I traveled back home, ripped off some parchment and grabbed a quill-pen, and returned with Rile's Broken Blade. I gave all four items, including the mirror, to the appiration of Dalnir. As soon as me remateralized, he began to scribe without a word. After, he silently handed me the notes he had made, smiled, and then dissapeared. I hope s in a place of peace. <br>
<br>
The notes instructed me to put the Greenmist Design Pattern, Tynnonium , the hammer of 1406, and Notes from Greenmist Tome into the creation of the blade. I did so, in the hottest forge. As in the design, the blade was realitivly basic looking, but resembled nothing I had ever seen in the Grand Iksar Arsenol. Rile must have been very proud of his impliments of destruction. <br>
<br>
Next, I gathered together the newly crafted Greenmist Khukri Blade , the Greenish Metal shard, Notes from Greenmist Tome, into the forge along with my Lord of Pain's Khukri, and forged them together with the Hammer of 1406. After the metal cooled, and the smoked disipated, I held in my hand something more beautiful than anything I had ever seen. The Unholy Khukri of Rile. Greenmist. The bane of the Shissar. Rile's wishes would not go unanswered. However, I was too tired to continue, and I fell into a deep sleep near the forge. When I awoke, a number of Kly Sarnaks had surrounded me. (I really need to sleep more at night) I glanced at my newfound weapon, and realizing it's strength, I smiled at my enemy. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Okay, I can not even start this until I have completed the other two khukri quests first, but I have collected most of the materials, save the mirror from Drusella, and the Greenish Metal SHard, both of which would require a raid force to go in.  I never asked morph or anyone what our chances were in taking out Drusella, perhaps Vinas would know that better.  In the mean time I have collected what I could with the hammer and shattered blade as quick stealth attempts and the purchase of the History for a rather large sum of plat.  The OT golem attack is impossible til I give Oxyn the book, and only when I complete the 2 other khukri quests.<br>
<br>
No hard camps here, no waiting 4 hours for spawns everything is cut and dry and self explanitory.  Just need the man power to help me get the last two drops, and then help killing the golem in OT.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
