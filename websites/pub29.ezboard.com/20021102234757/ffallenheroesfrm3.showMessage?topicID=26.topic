I’ll do it in chapters so I can continue at will. I hope you enjoy it. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
I bring you to Kelethin, the grand city of the wood elf people and the home of a certain elf you all know. Here will I share with you the tale of her life and its joys as well as it’s woe’s. Many people have entered her life and many have left it as well. Many an adventure has she been on and as she sits in her fathers tree cottage she ponders her life and decides that she will put it to paper for future generations so that they may gather what knowledge they will from what is written within. Know you this first; among the elves all are family. What references she makes to brothers or sisters are in this regard as she was an only child to her parents.<br>
            Imagine if you will a small cottage sitting high in a tall tree lush with leaves. Imagine on the platform in front of the cottage an old worn chair and leaning against the wall next to the door an old axe that is rusty with age but bears the signs of battle long ago past. Imagine that hanging from the door is an elven dreamcatcher to bring good luck to those within and imagine if you will that within this cottage there once was a family, a mother and father and a small girl child who was doted on by her parents. Here is where we will begin our tale…..a tale of an elf and her adventures both good and bad.<br>
             She was a small child when born. Her mother was a druid and her father a warrior. They named her Keyra and loved her as any parent would love their child and her home was one filled with love and affection. As she grew her mother taught her the ways of the druids. She taught her daughter how to call to the animals and to respect the wildness of Mother Tunare for she was the Mother of all and deserved that respect. She taught her how to forage for food and how to use fire and ice to defend herself.  Her father, being a warrior in his heart always, taught her the ways of the sword and the shield. He taught her how to hide and blend into the woods, how to hunt, and how to stalk. He wanted his only child to know how to protect herself because he knew she had her mothers nature and would not stay close to home once she felt the call of the world outside their home.<br>
            Keyra spent many years at home learning from her parents. She proved to be her mother’s daughter and the ways of the druid came naturally for her. Often you could find her at the top of any of the tallest tree’s staring out at the world and wondering what was out there for her to find. But just as often you would find her engaged in some mischief somewhere with others and she occasionally got herself into trouble but all it took was a smile and a hug and her father would forgive her for whatever she had done. She practiced the arts her mother taught her and she learned spells and chants for both battle and for travel.<br>
            One night as she came home she found her father sitting at the table with a bottle of strong elven wine in front of him mostly gone and she was sure she could see the tracks of recent tears on his cheeks. She wasn’t sure how to approach her father because she had never seen him cry. It just wasn’t something warriors did and she had grown to accept this as fact.<br>
            She walked up to him and placed her hand on his shoulder, he was trembling and this worried her further. “What’s wrong papa? Why are you upset? Have I done something?” She couldn’t think of anything she had done that would have upset him even though there were a few tricks she’d played on a couple of bullies he didn’t know about but she felt sure if he had found out about it he would have only laughed at her and told her to stop picking on the boys.<br>
             Her father looked up at her and smiled. She could tell it was semi forced but said nothing. “Keyra, sit down, we must talk.” She did as he asked and began to notice that her mother was not home. Dread started to fill her as her mind started to file over the possibilities but avoiding the worst of all. He then told her that her mother was ill, that she was with the elder’s and that they were trying everything they could to find out what was wrong and cure her. She sat in disbelief as he told her how he had come home from hunting to find her unconscious and feverish. He had taken her directly to the elder’s and begged them to cure his wife. “Is she still with them?”, she asked. Her father looked at her and spoke so softly that she had to lean forward to hear him, “Aye, they say that it doesn’t look good and they are unsure she will survive the night.” Without saying a word she left the cottage and raced to Felwithe. She knew that this was where her father would have taken her mother. The high elves were reknown for their healing abilities and were said to even be able to bring back the dead if you brought he or she to them quickly enough. She raced with everything she had hoping to be able to get there in time and hoping that the clerics there would allow her to see her mother. They were set in their ways and it wasn’t often they allowed a stranger to witness their workings.<br>
             She reached Felwithe’s gates and raced within heedless of the guards and those who passed in and out of the city. When she reached the cleric’s hall she banged on the door and begged the man who answered the door to let her in. After explaining who she was and why she was at their door he let her enter and asked her to follow him. She did as he asked and followed him through halls that were brightly lit and the very walls seemed to speak out in welcome to her. Awe filled her as she looked at the engravings on the walls as she followed the cleric in front of her. He came to a stop in front of a large wooden door and she could hear low chanting coming from behind it. He warned her that anything she saw here must be kept secret and to make sure that she adhered to any rules they gave her inside. She nodded her understanding and followed him inside when he opened the door and beckoned her to follow him.<br>
               Inside she saw a gathering of robed clerics standing in what looked to be a circle. As she slowly walked up closer she saw that they were surrounding what looked to be a bed. The cleric she had followed here walked up to the oldest and whispered something in his ear glancing at her as he did. The elder turned slowly and acknowledged her with a smile. “Enter child, you are welcome here. I only wish that the tidings which bring you here were of a happier occasion.” He beckoned her forward and as she walked towards him she realized it was her mother they surrounded. She was lying on the bed and was tossing her head back and forth her face covered in sweat. Tears began to flow from her eyes as she sat next to her mother and took her hand in her own. She gasped at the heat coming from her mothers hand and she felt her forehead and groaned aloud when she felt how hot her mothers fever truly was. Keyra leaned down next to her and whispered in her ear, “Mama.. i’m here, everything’s going to be ok. Mama, can you hear me? Mama..?” T’was here that the elder touched her shoulder and spoke softly.” Your mother is very ill child. She passes in and out of consciousness but she spoke of something I would talk with you about. Please.. come with me so we can speak.”<br>
            Keyra blinked back her tears and humbly followed the elder cleric stealing glances back at her mother while she followed him into a side room. The clerics had resumed their chanting and surrounded her again. She said several silent prayers to Tunare begging Her to heal her mother of whatever made her so ill. The elder shut the door when she entered behind him and motioned to an empty chair at a table. She sat and he sat across from her after he fetched a bottle of wine and two goblets. He filled both goblets and handed one to her. She took it and drank it quickly seeking to numb herself. After drinking a second to steel her nerves she looked at the cleric. “What is wrong with her? Why is she so ill? Every day I see my mother and she has not been sick, I don’t understand!”<br>
           “Your mother spoke to me before the fever got worse.”, He told her. “She spoke of a quest she had been on and that only your father had known of it. She said that she was supposed to best a great evil that had been sinking into the land and that she had met this foe and lost. She fears for her soul and wishes you to continue your druidly studies so that you may face this foe yourself one day and hopefully be better learned and emerge victorious.” His face suddenly looked so old to her and she wondered how many years he had spent here healing the ill and the dying. “What am I supposed to do? Who will teach me if my mother doesn’t recover?” No one but her mother had ever taught her anything of the druids and she felt she would be lost without her to show her all the things she didn’t know.<br>
           He got up then and walked to a large cabinet. He opened it and from it he withdrew a scimitar. Handing it to her he spoke, “Take this ..” he told her. “ You must go out into the world. There is nothing more for you to learn from books and scrolls. Now you must learn from experience. It’s time for you to find your own now. You are welcome to remain here with your mother until she has passed.”<br>
           She spent the next month with her mother bathing her and caring for her as she died slowly. Whatever it was that was taking her did it slowly. It was as if her mother had been poisoned and was being eaten slowly from within. On the last day her mother was alive she held her until she died and then taking the scimitar the old cleric had given her she returned home. She told her father everything that had happened and asked him to make sure that her mother had a druid funeral. Then she kissed her father on his head and wished him well promising to return soon. She just couldn’t stay in Kelethin with all the memories she had. It was time for her to leave the tree city and go see the world. Inside her heart she promised her mother that she would find the person who had caused her death and make sure that they met one just as painful.<br>

The sun was shining down on Keyra as she sat on the deck of the boat and watched the water silently thinking to herself. After she left Kelethin she had gone back to Felwithe and spoken with the Elder again. He had told her to begin her quest in Freeport across the sea in Antonica. She replayed their conversation in her mind and thought about the things he had said to her.<br>
<br>
“Where do I begin Elder? I don’t know who or what I’m looking for and I have little faith that I will be able to accomplish this task you put before me.” She had sat in a chair staring into a cup of elven wine and the sense of hopelessness was obvious on her face.<br>
<br>
“Go to Freeport child. Seek out the rogues and the shadow knights. They know of this evil and not all of them side with it. There you will be able to find someone to aid you in your quest.” He had the younger priests help her fill her packs with provisions and sent her on her way with as much wisdom as he could. “Be careful and be smart. Trust no one until they’ve proven otherwise. Should anyone who follows this evil find out what you’re about they WILL attempt to stop you. You may face much danger child but if you hold true and doubt yourself not you will succeed and avenge your mother well!”<br>
<br>
Sipping on one of the flasks of water the priests had provided her she sat and wondered what this “friend” would look like. Would they be trustworthy? Would she be able to tell them everything and have them follow her? She decided she would follow the Elder’s advice and keep the important information to herself until she knew for sure if this person could be trusted. “Hell first I have to find them….” She thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Some time later the boat docked in Freeport and as she walked off the boat ramp she looked about her and marveled at the size of the town. “How am I supposed to find anything or anyone here? I’ll be searching until I’m old and grey and sipping on berry juice.” Sighing she heaved her pack onto her shoulder and walked into town. The noises were almost too much for her ears. Everywhere she walked there were merchants yelling out to passersby to come and look at their wares. She passed an inn where a tall burly man tossed a drunk out into the street barely missing her as she dodged the drunkard. On one side she passed a smithy working in front of his shop as he banged away at metal with his hammer and on her other side she passed what looked to be a leather shop where a woman was hanging what looked to be a fresh animal pelt on the outside wall of her shop, stretching it to dry in the sun. An old man stopped her and shoving jewelry in her face told her how his baubles were the cheapest in town and the best of quality. Shoving him aside she moved on.A small child ran up to her and stopped her.. “Please miss, buy one of my cinnamon sticks? Only 5 copper!” Smiling at the boy child she handed him several gold coins after she noticed his dirty face and torn clothes. “Thank ye miss!” he cried as he ran off with the coins she’d given him and she nibbled on the cinnamon sticks she had bought from him. “Not as good as grandmothers but not entirely bad… ” she thought to herself. Smiling she began to enjoy her surroundings a little and walked on down the street taking everything in, nibbling as she went.<br>
<br>
Keyra was indeed impressed with the large city but it still wasn’t anywhere near as grand to her as Kelethin. Walking on she eventually noticed some alleyways off to her left and remembering what the Elder had told her she decided to venture forth and have a look around. Stopping to pull the hood of her cloak over her head she wandered down what looked to be the busiest alleyway keeping her head down a bit so as not to attract attention and she pulled her cloak about her. At the end of the alley there was a sort of courtyard where she spotted an Inn and several shops. Wandering about were drunkards and what she could only assume were what her father had always called “wenches”, women clothed in low cut dresses and fluffed up hair and she watched as they spoke to men as they wandered by them offering the men their “attentions” in exchange for coin. “I can see why the Elder told me to be careful…. a person could lose their purse here quickly if they weren’t careful…” she thought to herself. Pulling her hood down a little lower she walked towards the Inn and after taking a moment to gather her courage she walked in and immediately noticed the smell of old ale and sweat that seemed to have permeated every inch of the place. “Disgusting!” she mumbled. Walking to a table that sat in the corner of the main room away from the rest she sat down and waited for a barmaid to come and see what she wanted.<br>
<br>
“Wine please. And some bread and cheese.” Tossing a few gold coins onto the table she sat back as the barmaid hurriedly picked up the coins and rushed off to get her the food and wine. Looking around she noticed that she wasn’t the only one in the Inn trying to look invisible. Several tables had people sitting at them with lowered hoods and shadowed faces. “Mother Tunare what have I gotten myself into?” she wondered. “How am I supposed to find anyone trustworthy in this mess of thieves and cut-throats?” <br>
<br>
When the barmaid returned with her wine and food she stopped her for a minute. “Pardon me but where would I go if I were looking to find or hire someone to help me with a quest? Someone who would earn their coin and not slit my throat for it?” <br>
<br>
“Ah well .. ” the barmaid said. “You’ll not find a lot of honest folk in this part of the town miss but over in the other corner there is a young woman who wandered into town a few days ago and said she was looking for work. I’m judging by her sword and armor underneath her cloak that she ain’t lookin’ to wash dishes if you gather my meanin’. Looks like she could hold her own against any of the filth that comes around ‘ere.”<br>
<br>
Thanking her Keyra slipped the barmaid a few more gold coins for the information and then began to watch the woman she had pointed out while sipping her wine and snacking on the cheese and stale bread.” How to approach her?” she wondered. Even a barmaid could mistake someone for being honest when they may very well be the wickedest. Keyra had no desire to get her throat slit or her purse or belongings stolen when she’d only been in town but a day. Watching the cloaked woman she observed her manners and clothing. She wore a very dark cloak with a large hood that covered her face except for her nose and below. When she turned her cloak fluttered enough to reveal what looked to Keyra to be some kind of plate armor beneath and she disserned that the pointed bulge at the back of her cloak must have been her weapon, a sword no doubt. She had seen warrior women in Kelethin, this wasn’t a surprise to her. In fact some of the best warriors she had known growing up were female. The woman carried herself with a grace that belied her for a Lady and Keyra decided that she must be from noble birth and that whatever her tale was it would undoubtedly be interesting. Picking up the tray of food and her bottle of wine she walked over to the table where this woman sat and setting them down spoke to the cloaked figure. “Hail m’lady..may I sit with you?”<br>
<br>
“If that’s your wish, it’s no business of mine unless you want to share that wine you have there and I wouldn’t be remiss of some of your cheese as well.” Smiling Keyra sat down next to her and sliding her hood back abit introduced herself. “I am Keyra Krystalin of Kelethin, tree city of the wood elves. Who would you be if I may ask?” <br>
<br>
“Not that it’s any of your business but my name is Aoladari Raveynfyre and I am a shadow knight and from where is none of your concern.” The woman glanced up at Keyra with hard eyes and for a moment Keyra was positive she had made a very large mistake in coming over here. “I am told your sword is for hire. I may have a quest for you that would not only fill your purse but you would be looked apon by many with reverence as well as respect.” <br>
<br>
“What care I for respect? What does any shadow knight care about the whimsical rantings of any elf? Everyone knows your kind are partial to fantasy and fairy tales.” Sitting back Aoladari moved one side of her cloak back to reveal her sword and Keyra saw that it was a fine weapon indeed, decorated with small jewels and engraved apon the blade in what looked to be some form of elvish though she felt certain it was probably of the dark elves since she couldn’t read the writing at all. “I am a druid “ she told her “and I am on a quest that requires a sword to help me on the way and a brain behind that sword capable of intelligent thought and I wouldn’t mind someone with manners either!” Sitting back Keyra sipped from the bottle of wine and hoped like hell that her idea worked instead of getting her killed and got the shadow knights attention.<br>
<br>
Glancing at Keyra and sizing her up Aoladari slowly began to smirk. “Well I see you have a tongue to rival perhaps even mine. Allright then,I have a room upstairs. Bring your wine with you and we’ll go discuss just what your quest is and what it would require of me before I tell you what it’ll cost you and that’s if I even agree to help you in the first place mind you..” Getting up Aoladari walked towards a flight of stairs and Keyra followed her saying many silent prayers to Tunare that she wasn’t about to enter a trap.<br>
<br>
“Mother Tunare please help me, I hope this woman’s as trustworthy as I need her to be…” And with that she walked into Aoladari’s room behind her and sat down in a chair. “first let me tell you a tale of how I can to be so far from home…” And with that leaving out some parts she told Aoladari how she came to be in Freeport.<br>

<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Aoladari didn't know what to think of this druid who had approached her. All she knew is that this woman must be despirate to be asking strangers in an inn for help with her task.<br>

Once the druid named Keyra had told her story, Aoladari sat back and thought about the issue at hand. Money had not been fourthcoming in recent times. Aoladari had given up fighting for her food, so to speak. She had just become sick of it all and was honestly copperless after this evening's dinner. Aoladari had no tradeskills with which she could make more money, and this seemed to her like a way out of her growing debt.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will accept your offer, with a few conditions,&quot; Aoladari said. &quot;My room and board must be taken care of on top of the sum you have offered me, starting tonight. Also.. when I tell you not to ask about something that will be the end of it. There will be no questions about my actions in front of others. If you wish to question me in private, you may, but I will not promise an answer.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Druidess thought about this for a moment, and then agreed to the bargan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where do we start then? Have you heard of what I speak of?&quot; Keyra asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard mumblings in the tunnels of Freeport, but most know that I am not a true Shadowknight. I offered my services to many in the past whom my Guildleaders are not appreciative of. Helping you in this way is certainly an example of that! A true Shadowknight might have beheaded you downstairs and then robbed you of your belongings, fair lady, you need to be more careful.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly you have helped those people for a good reason then. I see something in you that most humans do not carry these days,&quot; Keyra said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed. Many a year ago, probably before your parents were even an itch in their daddy's leggings, my ancestry was &quot;blessed&quot;, as some have said, with the Lucan line. Sir Lucan's grandfather had an escapade with my barwench of a grandmother, and he as we all know is part of the leadership of Freeport. Since  I was a part of this kindred I felt a leaning towards knighthood, but alas, they would have none of me.. and evil was all who would accept me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Keyra started to see why she had seen potential in this girl, and felt sorry for her in the same way she felt sorry for the small boy in the marketplace.<br>
<br>
&quot;But, back to your issue. The evil you speak of was cast many a moon ago by the necromancers of Erudin. They have a mastery over evil like none other, and there would be our best place to start.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have a room for the night Aola? May I call you Aola?&quot; Keyra asked.<br>
<br>
Aoladari grinned at the use of her nickname, &quot;I do, though I had been planning a visit to an old friend, and possibly finding some work there, but since it was unannounced I can hold that off for later. And yes, you may call me Aola.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then I will go downstairs and make sure they understand that my payment will be for us both. Do you mind sharing this room?&quot; Keyra asked, looking at the second bed with all of the scrolls and backpacks on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, but let me warn you, fair druid, should you try anything I do know how to use this-&quot; Aoladari pointed to her sword. &quot;I may not be the best in the land, but there are few who can deny my prowess.&quot; Aoladari had made her point it seemed, since Keyra was turning a sickly shade of yellow and had obviously gulped at the thought of betrayal, on either side.<br>
<br>
&quot;I u-u-understand your feelings.&quot; Keyra said as she slipped out of the room.<br>
<br>
Aoladari had wanted no more than something this.... opportune to fall in her lap. She was however suspicious that the dealings ahead were not going to be easy, nothing like collecting orc scalps as she had done in her younger years. she pondered how to go about asking Marl Kastane about the evil she had only heard rumblings of in the tunnels.<br>
<br>
*Why did everyone have to stop talking about this right after she entered the tunnels?? Damnit this could be so much easier if only--- No I will not think of that, the past is the past,* Aoladari thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Keyra closed the door to the room, leaned on it heavily, and breathed a sigh of relief. She had certainly understood Aoladari's &quot;point&quot; when she said those last words.<br>

This was a girl with secrets that ran very deep, she could tell. There was something in Aola’s eyes that spoke of hardships and of loss. But Keyra also saw a gleam in Aola’s eyes as well. “This is someone I could learn from I think…” she pondered.<br>
<br>
After paying the Innkeeper for their room she went back up and entering the room saw Aola sitting on her bed sharpening her sword. Putting her pack on her bed she unbuckled her scimitar and set it with her pack. “I need to go out for some air Aola. I will be back before dawn and then we can decide where we will begin our search.” Tossing Aola a small bag of coins she smiled at her. “This is yours, with luck when we have reached the end of our quest there will be more for you as I’m sure you’ll earn it and then some before we’re done.” Aola opened the small pouch and looking at the coins within smiled, at least she wouldn’t be hungry for a while. She watched as Keyra left the room with nothing but her cloak and to what would have been Keyra’s surprise thought the same things of her that she had pondered about Aola not long ago in the hallway.<br>
<br>
As she stepped outside and began to head to the towns gates Keyra heard music and singing coming from a large clearing. There was a large crowd gathered around what looked like a stage and she ventured closer to get a peek. There was a woman on the stage and her voice sounded like an angel’s to Keyra’s ears. She was a half elf Keyra thought and she had an ominous beauty to her. As she watched her sing Keyra noticed a man to the side of the stage. In his cloak he was almost invisible, yes Keyra wouldn’t have even noticed him she thought if she hadn’t glanced in that direction. She turned her attention back to the bard on the stage and couldn’t help tapping her feet a bit to the lively tune the bard was belting out. Then she felt a prickling on the back of her neck and she would have sworn she felt as though someone were staring at her. Pulling the hood of her cloak up more to cover her face she glanced around to try and see who it was or if her mind was just playing tricks on her. As she glanced around she noticed that the cloaked man next to the stage was the one staring at her and she shuddered. “Who is he and why is he staring at me?” As she started to turn to walk away she was certain she saw the bard glance at her and wink. <br>
<br>
Feeling like a toy in a child’s nursery she walked away quickly and headed for the town gates. As she left the town she hid her cloak in the trunk of a tall tree and after thanking it for guarding her cloak she then began to run. As she ran she chanted the words her mother had taught her and a soft glow encompassed her as her formed changed and what was an elf running in the night became a dark wolf. She howled as she ran reveling in the feeling of the night wind in her fur and the smells of the night air. This was one of the talents her mother had taught her that she loved the most. Running through the tree’s she howled again and smiled inside as she heard the wolves answer her with their howls. Then she heard a howl that stood out from the rest. Heading towards it she howled again and when she heard the answer she knew who it was. God but she hadn’t seen her in so long! Running with everything she had she came to the crest of a hill and sitting there was a wolf with fur dark like her own and she moved forward to nuzzle the other wolf before taking her own form again and smiling at it. The wolf seemed to smile as it stood up and after nuzzling Keyra’s hand took its true form and a human stood before Keyra. She smiled and greeted her. “Sorchae! Sister mine! It’s been a long time and it’s very good to see you again!” Stepping forward she hugged Sorchae tightly. It had been a long time, since they were children. Sorchae had spent some time in Kelethin learning the skills of druids for a time when she was young and she and Keyra had formed a quick and strong friendship. Much of Keyra’s mischief had been while she was with Sorchae for they both had a wild streak in them that was only matched by the others. “What are you doing out here?”<br>
<br>
“I could ask you the same thing, this is a long way from Kelethin!” Sorchae smiled at Keyra and returned the hug. “My lust for travel hasn’t dwindled any and I love being out here in the woods where I can relax. Towns are too noisy and cluttered for me. I would rather be out here.” They walked together talking for a while and caught up on old times and Keyra told Sorchae all about her mother and what had happened to bring her here. “Sis I am sorry, I will keep my ears open and listen for anything that might be of help to you.”  Keyra hugged her tightly before saying her goodbyes and explaining that she had to return and she told Sorchae about Aola and their bargain. ”Be careful Keyra, she is still a shadow knight no matter what you may or may not perceive about her.” Smiling and hugging once more Keyra took her wolf form again and ran back towards Freeport stopping at the tree where she had hidden her cloak. After putting it on she slipped back into the town and headed for the Inn never noticing the eyes that had watched her from underneath a tall tree and that had seen her leave earlier and now watched her re-enter the town. <br>
