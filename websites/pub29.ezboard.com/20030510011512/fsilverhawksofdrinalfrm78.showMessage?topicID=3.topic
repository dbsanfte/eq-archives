<br>
Looting has been a difficult topic for me, ever since I first witnessed the PGT drop in High Pass. Who gets the loot?<br>
<br>
Twenty or more people are usually required to obtain some of the best items. Most of them are worth more then 10k pp. Hmm. 20 people, 1 item worth 10k. See what I mean? There is bound to be some hard feelings. Ever had a really nice item for your class drop and another class in the group wins the lotto, even though the item would improve your stats? Who hasn't? Examples abound. Ever had someone win the lotto only to give the item to one of his or her friends? Someone not at the raid? I can only speak for myself here, but I say that is just wrong.<br>
<br>
Recently, I have had the distinct pleasure of going on numerous raids with The Kindred, TK. These raids consisted of 20-40 people in the 50-60 level range. Needless to say, items that usually drop in these raids are generally above average, and to be honest, many of them are spectacular. They are the sorts of items you have always dreamed of getting.<br>
<br>
The coolest thing about my times with TK is my observation of their very unique view of loot, and their spirit of good will. I believe the high level of teamwork and family that TK demonstrates can be directly attributed to their views on loot and the guidelines they employ. I give them special thanks for allowing me to take part in some of their adventures, allowing me to learn a great deal in the process.<br>
<br>
Compiling my experiences throughout Norath, from other guilds, and pickup groups in most known dungeons, I wish to present our new looting guidelines here. Many many thanks go to Darkarr/Tinsley and Aguita for their brainstorming efforts and to all hawks that succumbed to our "live" testing we conducted down in CC.<br>
<br>
<bold>The Guidelines</bold><br>
<br>
1) MOST IMPORTANT - This is the only rule, and it <bold>ALWAYS</bold> applies. <bold>Inform everyone involved of the loot rules BEFORE the hunt/raid begins.</bold><br>
<br>
2) Gems and Jewelry -  These go to the cleric(s) for their symbols. Exception to this is rare gems (jacinth, black sapphire, diamonds etc. Because of this, I notice that clerics tend to be a little more willing to give those casters those extra couple hundred HP's.<br>
<br>
3) The Class Lotto -  Drops first get lottoed to people that will USE it on their current toon. This should be an upgrade for them, and <bold>NOT</bold> to sell.<br>
<br>
4) The Open Lotto - If no one qualifies for #3 above, everyone can participate in lotto. What they do with the item is up to them (twink, sell, give away, hang on wall, burn etc. etc.).<br>
<br>
<bold>NOTE: NEED BEFORE GREED APPLIES.</bold> Be considerate of people who might need to make some plat to upgrade their equipment on their main characters.<br>
<br>
5) The Everyone Lotto - In the case when no one wants an item, (yes, I've seen it happen; NEED BEFORE GREED at it's finest). It's important that <bold>EVERYONE</bold> participate in the lotto and graciously accept it if you win. A great thing for the person that wins is to hand the item over to the guild treasury, so that another guild member may make good use of it.<br>
<br>
6) Item Distribution - Unless you're an only class/race, people get items in turns. This does not supercede Class Lottos. Items are lottoed off to people who have not gotten something. Class items are excempt, and it is possible for a rogue to come out of a raid with 2 items and everyone else nothing. The idea is for everyone to get something, but people that don't need things should really consider passing on the lotto's. Remember, need and want are two different things.<br>
<br>
7) When to lotto -On normal pickup group hunts, or single party raids, it is acceptable to lotto items as they drop. This is always accomplished on downtime between fighting.<br>
<br>
On tense single party raids (mini raids), or full raids, all items are generally held until after the mission. A great time to distribute the loot is at the evac point, afterwards, the exception would be something that would default to someone (rogue only item and only one rogue), or is "no-drop". If someone has to log early, the party must agree to end the session and distribute the loot, otherwise they are out of consideration. This is a necessary step, and teamwork is the main thing here. If everyone works together, this shouldn't be a problem.<br>
<br>
8)  Rolling - As everyone knows, there are two general ways of conducting a lotto. Alpha and ranged (roll your own).<br>
<br>
Most times, ranged rolls (1-100, 200-300, etc.) work the best. Good thing about this is anyone that wants in on an item rolls, and those that do not, don't. This is a great time and hassle saver, and keeps everyone focused on the task at hand (staying alive etc.).<br>
<br>
On raids where more then one group is present, the best way I have seen is the alpha. This works great for after an event as well. One person (raid leader or ML) calls for /tells from any qualified person that wishes to be considered in the lotto. He/she then calls out an alpha listing of who is in. A 1-x lotto is then rolled. Congratulations ensue.<br>
<br>
Whichever lotto system works best, the most important thing is that everyone is made aware of what's going on before an item drops (before the start of a raid).<br>
<br>
9) Link Death (LD) - If an item drops while someone is LD, they are to be considered "there" for all practical purposes (the LD is out of someone's control). This holds true if they are able to make it back within a *reasonable amount of time and rejoin the hunt, thus participating in the Lotto.<br>
<br>
*What is reasonable depends on the situation, but every effort should be made to "wait" for the person to return, and it should be assumed that they are having computer problems and will be back at any time.<br>
<br>
If an extended amount of time transpires, and the party must split, then the LD person is barred from any consideration. <br>
<br>
Once a lotto has been won, it is considered final.<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
Final Thoughts<br>
<br>
In the way TK has expressed their teamwork, I have been privileged with winning some very nice items. On one raid with TK, we went to the top of CoM and killed the boss. A very nice caster only shield dropped. Myself and another wizard claimed our spots in the Class Lotto. When I won, I couldn't believe that I ended up getting the best item of the raid! I was a guest!! Afterwards, I offered to "give" this to the other wizard. I did this because I realized something. if I had not of been a guest on their raid, he would have won this item. He graciously declined.<br>
<br>
The whole guild was happy that I got something so cool. That's right. They were so encouraging. The thing with TK raids - I was so happy when someone got a sweet item. When a warrior got an uber-armor piece, I knew that warrior would use that armor to protect my butt some day. It's all about teamwork.<br>
<br>
Another thing I've witnessed in other guild raids is the passing up of loot the player didn't need. This game is not about getting the richest the fastest. If you like to play that way, then I'm afraid I will have a very hard time calling you a brother or sister. Or even a Silver Hawk. When I'm with 5 other people, all level 54+ down in Old Sebalis, and caster robes drop that are worth 10k+pp, you think anyone rolls on it but the enchanter and myself?<br>
<br>
NO!! That is how it is done at higher levels, and for good reason.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, the more friends I have that get good gear that can be put to good use, the easier time I will have when it's my turn to attempt that dangerous quest. What you put out there will come back to you some day.<br>
<br>
Remember something please. greed before need will only make us weaker. The item you share with someone that can truly put it to good use may some day make the difference in a battle, and save your life. I believe we will all become richer together.<br>
