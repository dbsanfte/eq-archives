<br>
So you want to take down Vox?  You do know that she is to Lord Nagafen what Terrorantula is to a Wooly Spiderling?  You do?  Ahh ok then.  Better give you a few tips.<br>
<br>
Lady Vox is an unforgiving mob.  If you are not totally prepared and organised she WILL kill you.  Nine times out of ten a failed Vox raid is a sign of either weak leadership or a failure by people on the raid to follow instructions, usually the former.  If you intend to take down Vox you must be prepared to take full control over the situation and focus all your attention on the matter in hand.  If you are not prepared to do this you may as well save everyone else the trouble of a lengthy corpse run and go solo her instead.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, you require a strong team of people to do the job.  By strong I mean a complete raid party with all the required classes represented in suitable numbers.  I'll talk about what is required in a moment after a little theory.<br>
<br>
Vox is a Cleric.  The bane and undoing of many a raid is when she decides to prove herself such and lets loose one of her 10khp &quot;Complete Heals&quot;.  In addition, because she is a cleric she can and will buff herself.  As you stand preparing your raid in Permafrost you may well hear her casting spells.  These buffs add to her AC and HP by a considerable amount.  So disenchant her buffs and you do a whole lot of damage before she even gets started.  In addition she can also be slowed, reducing the horrendous amount of melee damage she can dish out.  All of this screams one thing; Enchanters!  And indeed, enchanters are the lifeblood of a Vox raid.  If you do not have a minimum of three high level enchanters you may as well pack up and go home.<br>
<br>
You also want to make sure your resists are high enough to withstand her 500 point AE Ice Dragon Breaths.  This requires one level 52 druid with the dropped spell Circle of Summer.  A shaman is necessary to Talisman of Altuna people to increase HP, clerics to keep people alive, wizards and/or magicians to nuke her silly and tanks to lay into her the old fashioned way.  Add in necros to feed the casters, monks and rogues to add some REAL damage, bards to do unfeasible things to people's resists and you have just about every class on Norrath on the raid.<br>
<br>
So what is the process for taking her down?  The best method I have heard of, and one which I employ, is a three wave approach.  Put the tanks in the first wave, the high damage melee and enchanters in the second and the nukers in the third.  Why?  We'll talk about that in a moment.<br>
<br>
This gives you an idea as to how your raid should be structured.  Try setting up groups as follows.<br>
<br>
Group 1<br>
 Tank<br>
 Tank<br>
 Tank<br>
 Tank<br>
 Bard<br>
 Cleric<br>
 <br>
Group 2<br>

<br>
Group 5<br>

<br>
Group 6<br>
 Enchanter<br>

 Bard<br>
<br>
Group 7<br>
 Nuker<br>
 Nuker<br>
 Nuker<br>
 Nuker<br>
 Druid<br>
 Shaman<br>
<br>
Tanks = WAR, SK, PAL, RNG<br>
Damage = MNK, ROG<br>
Nuker = WIZ, MAG<br>
<br>
This is an ideal and would probably be massive overkill.  If you cannot kill Vox with the above you shouldn't even be playing the game.  In reality you will probably never be able to muster the above forces and so you will have to think on your feet and do some creative group management.  In fact, it should be entirely possible to take Vox down with only groups 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 and so, if you have to make compromises, you should aim to keep these five groups as close to the above as possible and skimp on the structure of groups 3 and 5 if necessary.<br>
<br>
Put your highest level tanks in group one and add the highest level bard and cleric to protect them.  Then put your highest level monks and rogues into group 4 and put your next or equal highest bard and cleric in to protect them.  These two groups are the cornerstone of your offensive.  You want to keep them alive as long as possible to do the dirties.<br>
<br>
You may well find yourself lacking clerics but with more clerics and shaman than you had anticipated.  Feel free to substitute these extras into groups where you do not have enough clerics.  Also, bards are hard to come by so compromises will have to be made.  I recommend a minimum of three bards, one for each of groups 1, 4 and 6, again to keep them alive as long as possible.  People in the other groups most likely WILL complain if they do not get a cleric or a bard.  Well, you have to be ruthless because if you hold up the raid until you have an optimum selection of people you may well be waiting for hours and, contrary to popular opinion, a large proportion of EQ players do have lives they would prefer to be living.<br>
<br>
One important thing to note is that you should endeavor to have people you trust to to lead the groups.  Have strong leaders in the groups and the giant clearing and buffing process will be a whole lot less likely to have any major problems.<br>
<br>
So you've got your people in Permafrost.  What now?  First get them all to the King room and have them wait there.  You now need to organise groups quickly and effectively.  Have everyone take off roleplay and anonymous and put on LFG.  You can now use the command &quot;/who LFG &lt;class&gt;&quot; to ascertain who you have available to fill each of the slots in your raid.  It's best to write this down so you know who is where.  I use printouts of a little spreadsheet I made in Excel in order to record everyone's name, group, class and lvl (available here  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.sff.net/people/fox/EQ/raid%20sheet.xls">www.sff.net/people/fox/EQ...0sheet.xls</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ).  When you're inviting people to your raid don't forget you can use &quot;/who all &lt;class&gt; &lt;lvl&gt;&quot; or &quot;/who all &lt;class&gt; &lt;Lower lvl&gt; &lt;Upper lvl&quot; to locate and invite the people you need for your raid.<br>
<br>
In addition, the last thing you want to do is to be typing huge amounts of text to remind people what groups they are in.  Instead, type the groups as shouts in social buttons, one group per button.  If anyone goes LD or they need a reminder you can just click a button instead of scrabbling around with your notes and fumbling with your keyboard.<br>
<br>
It's also helpful to have a helper, someone who can shout out instructions to the raiders while you are forming up groups.  People will get fidgety while they are waiting, it's only natural.  They've come to slay a dragon and they want to do the business NOW NOW NOW.  You need to keep them under control.  Have your helper shout out the following instructions at suitable intervals (every five mins or so) :-<br>
<br>
        Take off anon and roleplay<br>
        Do not pass the flag (Keeps people together and away from the giants)<br>
        Stay off the ledge with the torch/firepot<br>
<br>
This last one is very important.  There is a passage from Vox's lair which leads out to this ledge.  (In fact, stand in the middle of the king room and click next to the firepot you will find you can actually target Vox).  If a raider decides to show off his Uber Levitating Skills (*yawn*)and sits on it they WILL agro the giants in the lair which, in turn, will agro Vox.  The giants will probably come storming out mob-handed and start beating up on your raid unanounced.  Meanwhile, Vox will also be agroed and will start pacing around her lair leading to all sorts of problems.  If this happens the best thing you can do is have everyone relog to clear the agro.  Then locate the person who caused the agro and boot them from your raid for not listening to instructions before they get anyone (else) killed.<br>
<br>
You are now ready.  Before you start pulling the giants you need to do three things.  First, and most important, announce ALL your loot rules.  There's nothing which can spoil a good raid than a bickering rabble when loot is being distributed because you did not make it clear which classes would be eligible for loot.  Now is also the time to announce if someone has requested that they wish to roll as a different type of character if you have a special need for the one they have brought along (e.g. you are very low on enchanters but a high lvl bard needs a scale and has a lvl 52 enchanter they can add to your raid) or whatever.  In short, make sure there are no surprises for the raiders and you will hopefully get none back.<br>
<br>
After you have done this, you need to decide who is main assist and secondary assist.  I recommend you take your two toughest tanks - preferably warriors - and use them.  They have the best chance of survival against the Ice Giants.<br>
<br>
Finally, announce your pullers.  These should be two monks, preferably with some form of experience of pulling the ice giants.  Do NOT use first time raiders as monk pullers.  They will probably fall into one of the pits when they get lost in the Ice Giant tunnels.<br>
<br>
Have your pullers bring the giants, preferably one or two at a time although you can probably handle a mob if necessary.  All the time, make sure that your raiders stay behind the flag and that they allow the giants to be brought to them.  This serves two functions.  It allows the monks a greater chance to split mobs and it has a psychological effect of notifying your raiders that YOU are in charge which will hopefully stop people from doing anything foolish.<br>
<br>
Once the giants are clear to the buff rock head over there with your raid.  Make sure that people know that they are not to start buffing yet because you still have some giants to pull.  Once people are assembled, send in the monks and pull down the giants from the lair.  If you manage this step you're half way there.  <br>
<br>
Now it's the buffing stage.  This is a highly time critical step.  You MUST make sure that everyone understands exactly what they are to do and that people ONLY buff when they are told to and that they only buff what you say they should buff.  Total control of your raiders is essential.<br>
<br>
There is one added complication to buffing for a Vox raid which you will not encounter on a Nagafen raid.  Some of the giants in the tunnels are on fast respawn timers.  While you are buffing you will almost certainly find one or two giants spawn on you and agro on your raid.  Make sure that people understand this and are prepared.<br>
<br>
First thing you should do is get all the casters to bind here.  If they die these casters should memorise a single spell and run back into the fray.<br>
<br>
Next, have everyone debuff themselves.  Groups with bards should have them use their debuff songs to wipe out all effects.  <br>
<br>
Finally, shout that you need your group leaders to identify within their groups who will be dropping out for group buffs.  Do this now so that the turnaround process is fast.<br>
<br>
You are now ready for the buffing proper.  This should go in the following order and be completed as quickly as possible :-<br>
<br>
   Four dummy buffs.  Vox will disenchant to remove buffs so the first few buffs should be sacrificial.  Use Poison, Disease and Fire Resist (NOT endure, but resist for the extra sticking time) and one other buff of your choosing.  I recommend a long lasting buff like Dead Man Floating or maybe Call of Stone.<br>
<br>
   Clerics add HP and AC buffs.  If you have a high enough cleric on the raid have them join the different groups to do Group Heroic Bond for speed and to save mana.  Distribute some of those peridots you brought along (you did remember to bring a couple of stacks with you?) if your clerics do not have enough.<br>
<br>
   Shaman add Talisman of Altuna for more HP<br>
<br>
   Enchanters add Rune V or IV to tanks etc for more HP/damage shield.  Again, use those peridots you brought as the enchanters were probably not expecting to have to buff a whole raid of people.<br>
<br>
   Enchanters then cast haste/clarity on tanks/casters<br>
   <br>
   High level enchanters and druids then join each group to do Group Resist Magic and Circle of Summer for more MR and CR.<br>
   <br>
   Finally, have your groups redo their dummy buffs.  By now they are probably just about ready to expire so rebuffing is required.<br>
   <br>
If they have a bard in their group people should make sure that they have at least two buff slots free for Guardian and Elemental rhythms.  Even a lvl 45 bard will be able to add 80 MR and 60 CR to a group using these songs in a twist.  If a melee group does not have a bard they can grab some STR or AGI buffs from shaman/druids if time allows.<br>
<br>
Additionally, have any magicians in the raid make Mod Rods and drop them on the floor for use by the casters before buffing begins.  Buffing is a mana intensive job.<br>
<br>
While this buffing is taking place you should be busy making sure peopel know exactly what will happen and what is expected of them.  Announce the following at the very least.<br>
<br>
   Make sure each group knows which wave they are in.  You don't want the wizards storming in during wave one and being blown to smithereens.<br>
   <br>
   When the first wave enters the lair they must engage Vox and take her to the middle of the room.  Keep her away from the walls or she will be unhittable.<br>
   <br>
   Casters MUST be within melee distance for their spells to hit.  This effectively means they must stand under her belly to get spells to land.<br>
   <br>
   Use none-cold based spells.  Vox has a very high CR.<br>
   <br>
   Enchanters should cast the following spells in order as soon as they engage Vox.  Disenchant (to remove the aforementioned cleric buffs), Tash, Slow and then chain cast sieve to deplete her mana.  Remove her mana and she cannot heal.  Makes sense to me.<br>
   <br>
   If a caster dies they should memorise a single spell quickly and run back into the room to re-engage Vox.  It's a bit suicidal for the casters but it will make a difference.  They should not mind as they are here to grab one of the best INT/WIS masks in the game.<br>
   <br>
   This next one is ridiculously important.  If someone is feared and/or falls in a pit they MUST stay there and either Feign Death or die.  If they try to get out of the pits they will drag along all the bears and terrors with them, will train the rest of the raid and will cause a total disaster.  It's unfortunate but it does happen.<br>
   <br>
   In fact, that last one was so important shout it out again.<br>
   <br>
   Bards must play Guardian and Elemental Rhythms only with their percussion instruments and NOT attempt to fight Vox.  Remind bards to re-equip their drums.  Some of them may forget after having to use their lutes to disenchant their groups.  Some bards like to try to use the Desperate Dirge if they see Vox start to cast a spell.  From my own experience I would say this has a less than twenty percent chance of landing.  However, it does have the potential to interrupt her CH.  If the bards absolutely must twist three songs they should use the mana drain song as their third.<br>
   <br>
   Remind your high lvl raiders to use their resistance disciplines.<br>
   <br>
   Raiders must NOT use pets.  Pets are low level so more susceptible to dragon fear.  This means they will almost definitely run at the first sign of trouble, may well end up in the pits and will agro the bears.  See above. <br>
<br>
   It's also advisable to announce dire repercussions if anyone attempts to loot Vox before you get to her.  Dragons are just as susceptible to ninja looting as any other mob.  If you are a rogue, bard, monk or cleric you may be able to reduce this risk by putting yourself in group 4, the most likely group to gain experience from killing Vox.<br>
   <br>
Once buffing is complete announce a five minute power med break.  Nobody is to cast anything else.  Instead, take a timed five minutes to have the casters regenerate their mana.<br>
<br>
That done, have everyone stand and follow a designated person (usually the main assist) to the top of the second ramp and wait for you to give the order for the attack.<br>
<br>
Remember I said that I favor the wave approach.  Well now is the time to explain why.  Wave one is the tanks.  These guys will storm in and hit Vox around a bit, taking her by surprise and making her just a teensy bit tetchy.  In other words, they will hopefully gain agro and keep it on themselves.  They are the ones most able to take the hits and you want these meat shields soaking up the damage while your main firepower sneaks in unnoticed.<br>
<br>
Wave two are your major damage melee and your enchanters.  With wave one soaking up the agro wave, two can jump in and start hitting Vox around for silly amounts of HP loss.  Meanwhile, your enchanters will begin the process of debuffing Vox, slowing her and draining her of mana.<br>
<br>
Wave three is your ultra-damage group.  Send in the nukers and blast, blast, blast.  Her hit points should fall faster than an Internet Startup's stock price thus allowing your melee to finish her off easily.  She may get off one a CH if you are really unlucky but you should still be able to kill her with a bit of luck.<br>
<br>
Now, you cannot rely upon Vox's hit point chart to decide when to call in your groups.  The delay in the HP bar update is such that what you see may well be a good thirty percent different from what she has.  The best thing to do in this situation is to time your assault instead, calling in the waves at pre-determined times.  I have found the most effective intervals to be Wave one, wait five seconds, Wave two, wait twenty five seconds, Wave three.  But how do you achieve this?  After all, you don't want to be looking at your watch if you are in wave one or two.<br>
<br>
The answer is use a single social button to do the work for you.  Set up a social with five lines as follows.<br>
<br>
        /shout Wave One GO<br>
        /pause 50<br>
        /shout Wave Two GO<br>
        /pause 250<br>
        /shout Wave Three GO<br>
        <br>
The pause command waits an equivalent number of tenths of a second before executing the next line in the social.  Using this you can accurately time your assault waves without even trying.<br>
<br>
Hit the button, CHARGE!<br>
<br>
Hopefully, after this all you will need to worry about is divvying up the loot and basking in the glory of being a certified Dragon Killer.  Congratulations.  Collect your certificate as you leave permafrost.<br>
<br>
I've left a couple of obvious things out here which you should already know, anyway, if you are planning on a dragon raid.  Use high level characters if possible as higher levels resist fear and the DD more (average raid level should be a minimum of 50 if possible).  People higher than lvl 53 cannot engage Vox as they will be teleported out of Permafrost as soon as they get agro.  Etc etc.  It's the obvious things, as I said.  <br>
<br>
One thing of note though.  some people believe that it is possible to interrupt Lady Vox's CH by repeatedly bash her with shields.  This is a complete myth as was demonstrated when I attempted to send in fifteen paladins against her all with shields.  Net result :- Vox CHed four times and ate the lot of us.  Just have your tanks use their biggest, meanest selection of weapons and lay into her.<br>
<br>
That's about it.  All that remains is for you to get in there and take her down.  Go get her, tiger!  And good luck from me.<br>
