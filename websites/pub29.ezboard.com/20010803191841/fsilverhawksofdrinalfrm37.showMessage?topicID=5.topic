<br>
I was patted on the head, asked to calm down, and instructed simply to ask for help from fellow silver hawks who would surely help me should the need ever arise for a short term loan.  I was highly encouraged to DROP the subject as it would cause upheaval and dissention.<br>
<br>
A few nights ago, I sold an 18k BP for a friend who was going to share some of the profits with me.  The buyer had some REALLY nice items &amp; was selling them in Freeport at the time to raise the money.  Another friend of mine agreed to sell me an FBSS for 8k.  I needed a quick loan of about 6500 for a few hours.<br>
<br>
Remembering the advice to ask for help from fellow hawks, I posted a request in guild chat.<br>
<br>
I was shocked.  Probably the most upset I had been since joining the Hawks. I was SUMMARILY hushed by NUMEROUS requests that I NOT ask for money / loans in guildchat.  Mind you, I had fully explained the terms of my request for assistance - we are talkin a mere matter of hours - one day at the MOST before the amount would be repaid.<br>
<br>
So, you understand I hope, that I was livid from the frustration of being told / asked NOT to discuss the prospect of forming an active treasury and NOW asked / told &quot;drop it!&quot; when asking for help from fellow hawks - which is what I was ORIGINALLY advised to do. <br>
<br>
THIS is the EXACT Reason I proposed a bank in the FIRST place. To AVOID the level of .. rage having been advised two separate courses of action.  As it turned out, no Hawks were willing or perhaps able to help and all assistance came from people outside the guild. How very sad.  I would like to restate, we are not talking about a handout, I had sold an item worth well in excess of the 8k I needed - but needed the 6500 up front for a short while to take advantage of a 2k discount.<br>
<br>
SO - I would like add that my proposal for a community fund DID meet with some enthusiasm and I was asked to post my idea here.<br>
<br>
Here are the general guidelines I propose in CONCEPT:<br>
<br>
A Guild Fund / Bank / Treasury    ( call it what you like )<br>
<br>
Only members that wish to participate / donate can withdraw.  If  you don't like the idea - don't donate. This prevents 15 people from depositing and 2 from withdrawing all funds or vice versa.<br>
<br>
A 5 to 1 borrowing ratio.  You deposit 1k - you are qualified to withdraw 5k for a SHORT term.<br>
<br>
Length: Loans lasting less than a (week?) incur no interest.<br>
        Loans lasting 1-4 weeks incur simple 10% interest.<br>
        Weekly payments would be highly encouraged.<br>
        Payments / Withdrawals would be made generally during an established &quot;window&quot; of time.  <br>
        Special requests outside the normal 'window' of time would be at fund administrators' discretion.<br>
<br>
<br>
The person borrowing posts the amount and all subsequent related transactions on this webpage under the Guild Treasury heading which is ALREADY established !! <br>
<br>
Five officers (volunteers) who are on often and highly accessible would have access to a communal account which is PURCHASED for the express and sole purpose of running the account from Freeport.<br>
<br>
Items may be donated to the treasury by members who wish to participate.  They would be donated at 50% value (credit)and sold to guild members ONLY .....at a reduced market value.<br>
<br>
Any other ideas?<br>
<br>

First of all, who would fork out the $10 per month for an additional account?<br>
<br>
Who's going to keep track of all of this?  I would not wish *anything* like this for ANYONE... EQ takes up way too much time as it is.<br>
<br>
Also, I firmly believe, if you don't have the cash to buy it... then don't buy it.  Period.  <br>
<br>
What you're talking about is going to take away a LOT of time from people to keep track of this.. and the 5 officers like you'd say would have to log off... get on as the person... hand out the money.. make a note of this... or, get on, receive money..  No, we want to be in there helping the guild in other ways... Organizing Raids, helping on CRs, dealing with issues, helping with questions regarding guild with prospective members.  This takes a HUGE amount of time away from my hunting...  <br>
<br>
I am firmly against this idea... If you don't have the money, then don't buy it.. This isn't a democracy, it's an authoritian government with Darkarr as the leader.<br>
<br>
Although people are trustworthy in the Hawks, who's to say they will pay it back?  How would you enforce such a thing? interest? sorry, but I don't think that's a very good way.<br>
<br>
Also, who is to say who gets what money?  How do you determine one person's need over another?  If two people both need 5k and there is only 5k in the bank, do you loan to both? just one? Too easy for someone to get their feelings hurt.<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, we are NOT a guild about loot or money.  If you want that, goto another guild.  We are about helping each other and standing up for what is right and true.  I firmly believe if you allow this to enter the guild, it will be a bad thing.  I firmly oppose this.   <p><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular color=#191970 size=2>

<br>
When it comes to big money items like that, you just can't expect to get a &quot;loan&quot; that easy.<br>
<br>
I bet that only 1 or 2 hawks that were online at the time (IF any) had the kind of money to laon you.  What do you think those hawks where doing?   Probably busy in Velious or some such.<br>
<br>
If you make a deal that is worth that much with someone, and both agree... there should be NO problem with doing the transaction in a few hours.  If it's a must have for them, then you can be certain you can get that deal somewhere else.  Otherwise, they should be happy to work with you.<br>
<br>
I'm not for a bank as we have enough trouble organizing raids!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I like your spunk and enthusiasm though!  Keep the ideas coming my friend.<br>

Bascially you get a spell you don't need, u donante it, you get a Gem you don't need- you donate it.  When you need a spell or a Gem that makes a set of 3 you post a quick request and then you get ur gem/spell.  Someone makes a mule and we fill the bank account and inventory with 10 slot backpacks and then maybe get a guildmagic thing going with all of our spells and gems.  Just rambling off a few ideas here.  I really don't like the idea of cash.  There is always money to be made if you take the time to make it.

Well, they're SOL until at least part of the balance is repaid. I've loaned people sizable chunks of my income (have a friend I gave 1300 pp to so they could find a fang for EBW, which has not been paid back yet, another one borrowed about 2k for a few items, as well as a few sub-1k loans that I don't even recall), I don't like harassing people for money owed.<br>
As for the item, you can find FBSS' for sale at around 8.5 if you hunt around, they're almost common if you hit drinal's ezboard (well, ok, so not quite...) looking for a seller. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uanayazen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnayaZen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(4/4/01 10:56:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maybe we should suggest ....</span><hr size=1> I guess my feeling is that if you need to borrow that much money to get an item , the item is out of your reach.  I dont mind people asking to borrow a bit of money here and there... but 6.5K is a lot to ask. But I would much rather be asked in a private tell for a loan than asking in guild chat. <br>
<br>
I think the guild treasury section of the web was intended as a place for people to post any things that they have extra of ... using that for things like extra spells and gems is a great idea.  Using it for a &quot;bank&quot; would just be a pain for all involved.<br>

Nope.  If you had no immediate means of repaying the money, I'd say it was not your time.  As you were simply a transaction or two from it, you had reason to ask and assure others you were worth it, just not liquid enough at the time.<br>
<br>
I think many were probably shocked at your asking because most just simply do not have that much money.  We may have had one or perhaps two people with that much cash.  We may have had a half dozen on at the time with 1k or more. I hope you'll take the reaction you got for what it was, which in my opinion was this: Most here want to help, and most here will lend a bit of money if they can, but many are not comfortable doing ANY lending and some not if it is THAT much.  Too many horror stories of people not getting paid back or getting scammed (and I don't believe anybody thinks you are capable of those).  Some folks worked very hard to get what they have and to loan it all away would be a tough thing.  Konjur, I'm sure you would loan that money to me if you had it and I asked and showed you how I knew I would have it back in a few hours.  I would have done the same for you.  Some will not lend that much money and while it may be frustrating, there is nothing wrong with them for being conservative.  It's understandable.<br>
 <br>
Do I think a guild bank is doable?  I'm sorry.  No, I do not.  It's not open 24 hours a day, as it would need to be to be fair to all.  It would be a burden to most anyone to need to sign that person on to give out money.  I see it only as a source of trouble.  Money is for items which can be gotten with the help of the guild. That is why we have the task force and why we help each other.  <br>
<br>
I'm all for a listing on the boards of items people can pass along or sell real cheap.  I'm not for any amount of coin being put in reserve.  <br>
