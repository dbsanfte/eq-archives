<br>
Kallel fought with a berserkers fury with his new group in the courtyard in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. In the weeks following the rogue tournement Kallels' demeanor had changed drastically. Kallel had not slept in days and had ate little and only lived on the massive amounts of alcohol needed to dull his nightmares. Inside, the rogue was nothing, his eyes were dark and empty, much like his soul. No more was he the party barb, he was little more than a machine now, like one of the master tinker Xitrs' toys. The tournement had changed everything for him. He had lost control, and in a bloody frenzy had dropped all of his close friends, family and even two of his clansmen. His last recolection of the tournement was of Kuurus placing his hand on Kallels should proclaiming him the victor of two brackets and telling him to &quot;hit the showers.&quot; It took what little control he had left to avoid swinging on his most revered comrade and brother. The rogue left quickly after that, dissappearing into the shadows not to be seen for weeks, until now.<br>
<br>
His new group was doing well, days had passed with little excitement, just the merciless slaying of hordes of the lizards who dwell within the temple. The prickling of the hairs on the back of his neck warned him of the danger seconds before it passed. He turned in time to see the door to the throne room flung open and a group of rogues fleeing without abandon into the courtyard. Seconds later lizards and apes flowed through the doorway like a massive tidal wave ripping into his group now standing in awe in the cortyard. With a yell he urged his groupmates to the exits and with a low pitched feral growl, threw himself at the onrushing flow of lizards in an attempt to slow them and give his fellows time to escape. When the last of his party was through the door he turned and sprinted after them. He was stunned more times than he could remember, and the blades and clubs of the lizards flayed all of the skin from his back. Driven only by a stubborness to die and the momentum of his full sprint and the rush behind him, Kallel flung himself at the exit to the temple.<br>
<br>
Dropping to a knee, within inches of his life Kallel appeared in the doorway outside of CT to see a full crowd resting and recovering all around him. For a breif second their eyes met, the cold empty eyes of the barbarian rogue and the soft, beautiful eyes of the bard Robyn. Then her beautiful hymn of healing hit him and her voice was like a hundred singing angels. In that second, a spark was rekindled in the barbarians heart, a heaviness was lifted from his soul. With a smile of understanding the bard nodded, and the rogue met that smile, then dissappeared again into the shadows.<br>
<br>
Later, Kallel strode with purpose back home to Highhold pass. A party was calling to him, and a feast would be welcome after his latest journey. The Bard had given him back something he needed badly, his humanity. He knew little of the bard Robyn, only that she was being chased by his nemisis the whily elf Grendl. Well, seems like the elf is due some more competition.  <br>
