<br>
Unless they contradict the principles of his government or religion, a paladin may choose to follow edicts from his culture. Cultural edicts arise from the long-standing traditions of a particular tribe, region, or race, and as such, they rarely change. Examples include:<br>
<br>
Marry by a certain age.<br>
Always bow from the waist or curtsy to strangers and elders.<br>
Hold the lives of animals to be equal to those of men. A paladin following this edict never eats meat, never hunts for sport or food, and only kills an animal to protect himself or those he's sworn to defend.<br>
<br>
Family<br>
Family edicts derive from tradition, obligations to relatives, and the wishes of particular family members. Edicts may be issued by the paladin's parents or grandparents, or by a consensus of all living family members.<br>
<br>
Won't all paladins automatically choose to follow the edicts of their families? Not necessarily. A paladin's family may not be of good alignment. The paladin may be an orphan and have no knowledge of his family. Sympathetic families may not wish to burden the paladin with their problems. If a paladin has not vowed to follow the edicts of his family, his obligations to them are no different from his obligations to anyone else. Typical family edicts include:<br>
Visit the family burial ground once per year on a designated day.<br>
<br>
Uphold a tradition never to harm a particular animal. (For example, if a bear sacrificed itself to save the paladin's infant sister from a dragon, the paladin may vow never to harm bears.)<br>
Donate a fixed percentage of all income to the family.<br>
<br>
Virtues<br>
<br>
Virtues are traits exemplifying the highest standards of morality, decency, and duty. They comprise the paladin's personal code. A paladin's virtues are implied by his strictures as well as his outlook, role, and personality. Just as a paladin must obey his strictures, he must also remain true to his virtues.<br>
<br>
Though most paladins adhere to all of the virtues described below, exceptions are possible. For instance, a paladin from a primitive society may be so unfamiliar with civilized etiquette that including courtesy as part of his ethos would be unreasonable. All adjustments must be cleared by the DM at the outset of a paladin's career.<br>
<br>
There are no rules for adjudicating virtue violations. The DM is advised to err in favor of the paladin when the player makes honest mistakes. Conversely, the player should graciously accept the DM's rulings and, in the spirit of the paladin, avoid looking for loopholes to take advantage of the DM's good will. The entries below include examples of how virtues might influence the paladin's behavior in the context of a game.<br>
<br>
Fealty<br>
<br>
In feudal times, fealty referred to the relationship between a warrior and his lord. A warrior swore allegiance to a lord in exchange for protection, support, and property. The lord, in turn, could count on the warrior for military duty and other services. Both the lord and the warrior scrupulously honored this agreement. Perfidy, the breaking of the promise by either party, was considered a treacherous breach of faith.<br>
<br>
This takes a broader view of fealty, defining it as loyalty not only to a lord but to any lawful good government, religion, or philosophy. For convenience, we refer to the recipient of a paladin's loyalty as the patron.<br>
<br>
Regardless of who-or what-functions as the patron, fealty gives the paladin a sense of belonging to something greater than himself. Fealty also sets the criteria for a paladin's moral code; in essence, the patron establishes the difference between right and wrong, good and evil. However, although the patron provides the basic moral code, it is ultimately the paladin who is responsible for and bears the consequences of his actions.<br>
<br>
About the Categories<br>
<br>
Let's take a closer look at the three categories of fealty patrons:<br>
<br>
Religion. A religion is a set of beliefs centering on one or more omnipotent deities with supernatural powers. The patron is usually a church representing an established religion, but can be a deity.<br>
<br>
Government. This can be any individual or governing body with the absolute power to make laws and declare war. In most campaigns, the patron is usually a monarch.<br>
<br>
Philosophy. A philosophy is a system of ideas that explains the nature of the universe, exclusive of supernatural beings. The patron may be an established philosophy developed by scholars, or a unique philosophy developed by the paladin himself. (Chapter 8 discusses the definition of a philosophy in more detail, including the differences between philosophies and religions.) For the purposes of fealty, religion and philosophy are mutually exclusive; a paladin can't pledge fealty to both.<br>
<br>
Choices of Patrons<br>
Every paladin must pledge fealty to something. As a minimum, he must pledge fealty to either a religion or philosophy; this faith is what grants him the special powers. Beyond this requirement, patrons should derive logically from the paladin's background and outlook. In most campaigns, the proper patrons will be self-evident. For instance:<br>
<br>
If a paladin follows the tenets of a lawful good religion and serves in the military of a lawful good ruler, he probably swears fealty to both his church and government.<br>
<br>
If a paladin comes from a rigid theocratic culture (a society ruled exclusively by priests) or serves no feudal lord, he <br>
probably pledges fealty to the church alone.<br>
<br>
If a lawful good monarchy has no formal relationship with an established religion, the paladin might pledge fealty to a ruler and a philosophy, and not to a church.<br>
<br>
If a paladin operates independently and has no ties to a government or church, he'll probably pledge fealty to a philosophy.<br>
<br>
For the purposes of fealty, religion and philosophy are mutually exclusive.<br>
<br>
Every paladin must pledge fealty to either a religion or philosophy, which serves as the source of his special powers.<br>
<br>
Obligations of Fealty<br>
<br>
Once a paladin pledges fealty to a particular patron, he's bound to that patron indefinitely. Should his king engage in evil activities, or his church become corrupt, the paladin may be forced to pledge fealty to another patron. Normally, however, a paladin's patrons never change.<br>
<br>
The responsibilities associated with fealty vary with the patron. Monarchs, for instance, may require their paladins perform military service. Churches may expect their paladins to follow rigid rules of behavior. The &quot;Edicts'' section elsewhere in this chapter discuses such requirements in detail. In general, however, fealty requires the paladin to:<br>
Faithfully serve the patron regardless of personal adversity.<br>
<br>
Promote the principles and ideals of the patron.<br>
<br>
Honor and respect the representatives and symbols of the patron.<br>
<br>
Sacrifice his life for the patron if necessary.<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Sir Geffen, who has declared fealty to his king, learns that his homeland has declared war against Dryston, a neighboring state. Geffen is distressed by the news. Many of his schoolmates now live in Dryston, and so does his brother-in-law. Nevertheless, Geffen vows to engage all soldiers of Dryston as enemies, regardless of who they might be.<br>
<br>
In a distant village, Sir Geffen hovers on the edge of death, struggling to recover from serious wounds inflicted by a red dragon. A compassionate farmer offers to take Geffen to a medical specialist. Geffen accepts, and the farmer loads him in his wagon. An hour into their journey, the wagon passes a herald carrying the banner of Geffen's homeland. Geffen demands that the cart stop, then insists that the driver lift him to his feet. Reluctantly, the driver does as he's told. With his last ounce of strength, Geffen raises his hand to salute the flag.<br>
<br>
Courtesy<br>
<br>
To a paladin, courtesy involves more than merely following rules of etiquette. It's also an attitude, a way of presenting himself to the world. A paladin carries himself proudly, maintains self-control, and accepts ill-mannered behavior with grace. He follows social customs to the best of his ability. He is polite and deferential to friends and strangers alike.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the paladin must:<br>
<br>
Consider the feelings of others and take care not to offend them. A paladin always demonstrates proper manners (shaking hands with friends, expressing gratitude for favors). He also keeps himself immaculately groomed (bathing regularly, wearing clean clothes).<br>
<br>
Speak tactfully and kindly. A paladin never knowingly insults or slanders another person, even his greatest enemy. If others engage in insults or slander, the paladin walks away.<br>
<br>
Behave with dignity. A paladin refrains from emotional outbursts, excessive eating and drinking, foul language, and other boorish acts.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Sir Geffen asks a grizzled innkeeper for directions. &quot;My information ain't free,'' snarls the innkeeper. <br>
<br>
&quot;Especially for the likes of you.'' The innkeeper spits in Sir Geffen's face, then glares at him daring him to respond. Sir Geffen politely thanks the innkeeper for his time, discreetly wiping the spittle from his cheek as he turns to leave.<br>
<br>
After a long day spent slogging through a muddy swamp, Sir Geffen's companions can't wait to make camp and <br>
get to bed. Sir Geffen, however, stays up for hours, combing dried mud from his hair and cleaning the grime from his armor.<br>
<br>
Honesty<br>
<br>
A paladin always tells the truth as he knows it. He may decline to speak or choose to withhold information, but he will never intentionally mislead anyone, even his enemies. He may ask permission not to answer a direct question, but if pressed, he'll tell the truth (however, he may frame his answers in such a way as to withhold vital information). Though a paladin doesn't make promises lightly, once he gives his word, he always keeps it. <br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Sir Geffen has been captured by an evil army. The commander demands to know the whereabouts of the paladin's companions. Sir Geffen says nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;My spies inform me that your colleagues plan to arrive at King Relhane's castle by dawn tomorrow,'' says the commander. &quot;Is this true?''<br>
<br>
The commander's information is accurate, but Geffen remains silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you say nothing, I will conclude that I'm correct.''<br>
<br>
&quot;You may conclude whatever you wish,'' says Geffen.<br>
<br>
Prevost, a young companion of Sir Geffen, asks about his performance on the battlefield yesterday. Sir Geffen believes that Prevost fought ineptly. &quot;With your permission,'' says Geffen, &quot;I prefer not to answer.''<br>
<br>
&quot;Please,'' insists Prevost. &quot;I want to know.''<br>
<br>
Geffen looks him in the eyes. &quot;Very well. You allowed an opponent to escape. You dropped your sword at a crucial moment. Your performance was poor.''<br>
<br>
Prevost glowers at Geffen, then angrily stomps away.<br>
<br>
Valor<br>
<br>
A paladin demonstrates unyielding courage in the face of adversity. No danger is too great to prevent him from fulfilling a promise or completing a mission. His commitment is stronger than his fear of pain, hardship, or even death.<br>
<br>
A paladin's valor is particularly evident on the battlefield. He regards war as a noble enterprise, and combat as an opportunity to glorify the institution he represents. A paladin attacks an enemy without hesitation, continuing to fight until the enemy withdraws or is defeated. Whenever possible, a paladin chooses the most formidable enemy-a powerful monster, a giant, a dragon, or the leader of an army-as his primary opponent. In general, a paladin prefers melee to missile combat, so he can engage his opponent face to face.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
A moment ago, Sir Geffen and his companions were riding peacefully through a shaded valley when they were ambushed by a brutish hill giant. The giant snatched young Fredrin from his horse and is now waving him in the air like a trophy.<br>
&quot;I claim this youth as my slave!'' thunders the giant. &quot;If you want him back, send your best man to fight!''<br>
Without hesitation, Sir Geffen rides forward.<br>
<br>
Locked in battle with an army of ogres, Sir Geffen's party is suffering mounting casualties. &quot;Withdraw!'' shouts Bordu, a friend of Geffen. &quot;We will regroup and fight another day!''<br>
<br>
Sir Geffen's companions scramble from the battlefield, but Geffen lingers behind. &quot;Come with us!'' cries Bordu. &quot;You can't win!''<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps not,'' says Geffen, steeling himself for a phalanx of charging ogres. &quot;But I shall cover your withdrawal as long as I can.''<br>
<br>
A paladin can withdraw with honor if outnumbered by more than 3:1.<br>
<br>
Honor<br>
<br>
An honorable paladin conducts himself with integrity regardless of circumstance. He behaves in a morally sound manner even when he's by himself or when no one else will know of his actions. It's an admirable act to comfort a dying friend, but an act of honor to comfort a dying enemy.<br>
<br>
Honor also involves respect, not just for the paladin's peers and superiors, but for anyone sharing the paladin's commitment to goodness and justice. The paladin shows mercy to the repentant, and refuses to inflict undue suffering even on the vilest evildoer.<br>
<br>
Additionally, an honorable paladin:<br>
<br>
Defers to the judgment of all lawful good characters of superior social class, rank, and level.<br>
<br>
Acknowledges the dignity of all lawful good people, regardless of their race, class, or economic status, by treating them <br>
with courtesy and respect.<br>
<br>
Accepts all challenges to duel or fight given by those of comparable status and power. (A challenge from an arrogant youngster or a drunken warrior may go unheeded).<br>
<br>
Dies before compromising his principles, betraying his liege or faith, or abandoning a protected charge.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
After a lengthy battle, the king of the lizard men lies bleeding at Sir Geffen's feet. &quot;I beg you,'' gasps the lizard king, &quot;Let me live.'' Sir Geffen reflects. The lizard king is old and broken. He can no longer be considered a threat. And he has fought honorably.<br>
<br>
Sir Geffen sheathes his sword. He motions for his aides to haul the lizard king away. The king will spend his remaining years in prison.<br>
<br>
Sir Geffen has been captured by a cult of evil clerics. Bound with chains, Sir Geffen stares into the eyes of a cleric who holds a blade to his throat. &quot;Renounce your blasphemous faith,'' hisses the cleric, &quot;and I will spare your life.''<br>
<br>
&quot;Renounce yours, and I will spare you!'' says Sir Geffen.<br>
<br>
Other Virtues<br>
<br>
Fealty, courtesy, honesty, valor, and honor will likely be a part of every paladin's ethos. Other virtues may also be added, some possibilities:<br>
<br>
Humility. The paladin remains humble in spirit and action. He rejects adulation and declines awards. Tributes embarrass him; the knowledge of a job well done suffices as thanks. He speaks modestly of his deeds, if at all, grateful for the opportunity to fulfill his moral obligations.<br>
<br>
Generosity. The paladin gladly shares his meager funds and possessions with anyone in need. If he owns two swords and a elderly hunter has none, the paladin offers one as a gift. He will give his last crust of bread to a hungry child, even if he must go without food for the rest of the day. He is also generous of spirit, always willing to lend an ear to a troubled companion or acknowledge a friend's accomplishments with lavish praise.<br>
Chastity. The paladin avoids even the appearance of impropriety, remaining pure in word, deed, and thought.<br>
<br>
Celibacy. In addition to remaining chaste, the paladin vows never to marry.<br>
<br>
Industry. The paladin engages in productive activity at all times. He works diligently and hard until he completes the job at hand. When not working, he studies, exercises, or practices his combat skills. He considers leisure activities, small talk, and vacations to be time-wasting folly.<br>
<br>
Ceremony of Disgrace<br>
<br>
A paladin guilty of an ethos violation may have to submit to a Ceremony of Disgrace in addition to a penalty. Usually, Ceremonies of Disgrace accompany punishments for heinous crimes involving government or church officials, but they may be used for lesser violations as well.<br>
<br>
A typical Ceremony of Disgrace requires the guilty paladin to appear before one or more representatives of his government or church. The more serious the crime, the higher the station of the presiding official; a low-level bureaucrat may suffice for a Category 2 violation, but the king himself may choose to oversee the ceremony for a Category 4 violation. To compound the paladin's shame, a Ceremony of Disgrace is often held before an audience in the town square or other public forum with the accused paladin standing on a raised platform for all to see.<br>
<br>
The ceremony begins with the presiding official declaring the paladin's crime. The official chastises the paladin for betraying his Code of Ennoblement, then announces the penalty. For a minor violation, the paladin may ask for one of the paladin's non-magical weapons. The official destroys the weapon by throwing it into a fire or snapping off the blade.<br>
<br>
For a heinous violation, more elaborate humiliations may be involved. In addition to destroying one of the paladin's weapons, the official may demand that the paladin hand over each piece of his armor. The official flings each piece into a fire or has an aide pound the pieces with a mallet, rendering them useless. The official may then slap the paladin's face, douse him with a bucket of offal, or roughly shear the hair from his head until only a stubble remains. Finally, the official strips the paladin of his name; the paladin must call himself by a new name from that point on.<br>
<br>
Throughout the ceremony, the paladin must remain silent. Speaking during a Ceremony of Disgrace may be considered an ethos violation in itself, requiring an additional penalty.<br>
<br>
Apologies to the affected parties, with assurances the offensive act will never be committed again.<br>
<br>
A vow of silence for the next 1-2 days.<br>
<br>
A special tithing, donation, or service for which the paladin accepts no return.<br>
<br>
Enforce Laws<br>
<br>
Obliged to eliminate evil, a paladin is always on the lookout for lawbreakers, intervening whenever he sees a crime in progress. Overtly evil acts often meet with swift retribution; the paladin simply slays the culprit outright. In societies where even the vilest crimes must be tried in a court of law, paladins refrain from taking justice into their own hands, instead turning the suspect over to the proper authorities for prosecution.<br>
<br>
Law enforcement involves more than thwarting criminals. A paladin breaks up rowdy crowds before riots ensue and escorts drunks to their homes. She disposes of illegal weapons and other contraband. She intercepts spooked horses, treats accident victims, and reunites lost children with their parents. She may even clean up illegally dumped trash.<br>
<br>
While most paladins enforce the law as a matter of principle, some are formally deputized by their lieges to serve as local police. Deputized paladins are assigned regular patrol hours, usually after dark when most crimes occur. The paladins patrol designated areas on foot or horseback, monitoring strangers, questioning suspicious characters, and keeping an eye out for trouble. They may be authorized to make arrests, levy fines, or even perform on-the-spot executions. Deputized paladins usually have jurisdiction only within the borders of their community or kingdom, though they may demand extradition of wanted criminals who have sought refuge in other lands.<br>
<br>
Encourage Morality<br>
<br>
A paladin takes advantage of every opportunity to encourage and promote ethical behavior. He reinforces lawful good behavior by acknowledging the good deeds of ordinary citizens, expressing his appreciation in private meetings or public ceremonies. He gives lectures, participates in debates, and organizes discussion groups, all meant to persuade others of the benefits of a moral life. He presents himself as a role model to youngsters, dazzling them with stories of his exploits and expounding on the glories of a career spent in service to the government or church. A paladin also makes himself available for counseling, offering advice to the troubled and guidance to the confused.<br>
<br>
Training<br>
<br>
A paladin continuously trains his mind and body, focusing on military skills. He jousts against stuffed dummies using a technique called quintain. He duels against multiple opponents with swords wrapped in cloth. He familiarizes himself with all types of weapons, including those improvised from rocks, branches, and other natural items; with practice, a paladin can construct a usable sling from a length of cloth and a leather strip in a matter of minutes.<br>
<br>
Most paladins undergo a daily routine of physical exercise. Wearing full armor, a paladin may hike up a mountainside while carrying a sheep or calf. With a weight secured to his back, he may attempt to swim the length of a lake. He scales walls, climbs ropes, wrestles other warriors, and stages cross-country races.<br>
<br>
His regimen also includes mental exercise. He may memorize lengthy passages from sacred scriptures or translate poetry into different languages. He may dissect animal cadavers to study anatomy or raise a garden to learn botany. A friendly ranger may teach him how to track animal; an experienced seaman may teach him how to navigate a ship.<br>
<br>
Maintenance <br>
<br>
A paladin maintains her equipment in first-class condition. She keeps her shield and armor polished and free of corrosion. Dents are tapped out, scratches are buffed clean, tarnishes are refinished. Blades are straightened, hardened by fire, then resharpened on grindstones. Clothing, too, receives meticulous attention. A paladin usually hand-washes her garments in cold water, squeezing (rather than wringing) them out before hanging them in the sun to dry. She soaks her undergarments and shirts in a barrel filled with soda and wood ash, then pounds them on a rock. Coats and capes may be freshened with steam by placing them in an enclosed room containing a pot of boiling water. Saddles, boots, belts, and other leather items must be oiled and polished.<br>
<br>
Courtly Duties<br>
<br>
A paladin's impeccable manners, striking appearance, and sterling reputation makes him a highly desirable guest for banquets, receptions, and other formal functions. Some accept as many invitations as their schedules allow, particularly those from colleagues and dignitaries. Refusal might be interpreted as an insult.<br>
<br>
Often, his attendance amounts to little more than window dressing, his superiors taking advantage of the occasion to display him like a trophy. A paladin endures these events with grace, retelling his war stories to pampered lords and ladies while listening to their dreary comments.<br>
<br>
A paladin often represents his superiors at functions in other lands. He gives eulogies at funerals and witnesses christenings. He attends the weddings, birthday parties, and confirmation ceremonies of foreign aristocrats. He may also deliver documents and messages that are too important to trust to heralds.<br>
<br>
Military Duties<br>
<br>
Even when not at war, a paladin with military responsibilities has a lot to do. If occupying a stronghold, he must prepare for enemy attacks by fortifying the walls with metal braces, widening moats, and digging trenches. Ample supplies of food, water, ammunition, and medicine must be secured. He may conduct drills to ensure that his troops respond swiftly and in a coordinated fashion to surprise assaults. He consults with engineers and tacticians to determine which sides of the stronghold are most vulnerable. He rehearses bowmen to fire arrows blindly, in case of an attack made under cover of fog or during a moonless night.<br>
<br>
In the field, the paladin conducts reconnaissance patrols into enemy territory to gather information. He leads his troops on practice exercises to get them used to moving through swamps, deserts, and other hostile terrain. He may also conduct military experiments with animals, using cooperative elephants as pack animals, trained banderlogs as infantrymen, and charmed bulettes as assault weapons.<br>
<br>
Tournaments<br>
<br>
tournament a series of formal games that gives paladins and other warriors the chance to practice their combat skills, impress the citizenry (thereby boosting their reputation), and perhaps even earn a little money. Though designed as entertainment, tournaments are not without risk. A bad performance may cost the paladin her honor. A disastrous performance may cost her life.<br>
<br>
Rulers and affluent landowners sponsor tournaments to amuse their colleagues and raise community morale. Tournaments also give them the chance to flaunt their wealth in a socially acceptable manner. Messengers and heralds are hired to spread the word about upcoming tournaments, which often attract participants from hundreds of miles away.<br>
<br>
A carnival-like atmosphere prevails on the day of a tournament. Colorful banners flutter over sprawling bleachers packed with spectators. Soldiers stroll the grounds in gleaming armor. The aroma of roast pork and steaming vegetables wafts through the air. Merchants peddle paladin dolls and other gaudy mementos. Grandmothers gossip, children frolic, and gamblers place discrete wagers.<br>
<br>
Tournament events include sword duels, archery contests, and-always of primary interest-jousting matches. In a typical joust, two paladins mount their horses on opposite ends of an open field, then raise their shields and lances. On a trumpet blast from the referee, they charge. Each attempts to dislodge the other from his horse. If neither succeeds, they return to their starting positions and try again. The winner faces another opponent in the next round. Whoever fells the most opponents during the day wins the contest.<br>
<br>
Victory brings honor to both the paladin and the liege he represents. The paladin may also win a modest prize. Defeat, however, means disgrace, and a deliberately poor performance is considered an ethos violation. If the paladin has chosen a lady or other person to champion, victory ensures a favorable impression (modify the reaction roll by at least +1). Defeat brings humiliation, and the championed person may shun the paladin forever after (modify the reaction roll by at least -1; in any case, the reaction won't be better than Indifferent). If a poor performance insults the championed person, this might be considered an ethos violation.<br>
<br>
Though contestants use blunted lances and are advised to behave like gentlemen, jousts often result in serious and sometimes fatal damage. Even a blunted lance can strike a deadly blow, particularly when delivered by a paladin on a war horse charging at top speed. Occasionally, a paladin knocked from his mount will catch his spur in a stirrup; the confused mount may drag the hapless paladin to his death. A losing contestant may not take defeat gracefully, attacking the winner with a sword or club. Such attacks have been known to trigger full-scale riots, resulting in dozens of casualties before soldiers manage to disperse the crowd.<br>

The Paladin's Personality<br>
<br>
The defining characteristic, a single word that summarizes a character's personality, describes the essential nature of the character and how he comes across to others. A character's personality comprises many elements, but the defining characteristic is the dominant trait from which all other personality components arise. A defining characteristic can be chosen for paladins (or any other character, for that matter). Several possibilities listed below should get you started.<br>
<br>
How to choose a defining characteristic? There's no best way, but you'll know you're on the right track if a particular characteristic fits your conception of the character. For instance, if you picture your paladin charging boldly into battle, slaughtering his enemies without remorse, his defining characteristic could be Vengeful. If you see him as withdrawn and brooding, he might be Tormented. The descriptions below are intentionally vague to encourage personal interpretation.<br>
<br>
You may also select secondary traits to compliment the defining characteristic. Each entry below lists a number of options. Choose one or two that appeal to you, or make up your own. Any secondary traits are fine, so long as they don't contradict the defining characteristic; a Vengeful paladin might be Brutal but he's unlikely to be Shy.<br>
<br>
Defining Characteristics<br>
<br>
Aggressive<br>
<br>
The aggressive paladin speaks with his sword. Uneasy in social situations and impatient with negotiation, he is most comfortable on the battlefield. He relishes combat, particularly hand-to-hand encounters with enemies formidable enough to put up a good fight. A forceful personality who often wears his emotions on his sleeve, he makes a spirited companion and a dangerous opponent.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Heroic, impulsive, haughty, wise-cracking, abrasive, inspiring.<br>
<br>
Cynical<br>
<br>
While as devoted to her ethos as any other paladin, the cynical paladin sees the pursuit of justice as admirable but ultimately futile. Greed, selfishness, and hatred seem to predominate in the world. Compassion and selflessness are hard to find. Advocates of good are hopelessly outnumbered. The cynical paladin fights tirelessly for her principles, but can't shake the feeling that her work may be in vain. To her, optimism is touching but naive, despondency a perfectly understandable reaction to a callous world.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Angry, quick-witted, reflective, soft-hearted, brooding, helpful.<br>
