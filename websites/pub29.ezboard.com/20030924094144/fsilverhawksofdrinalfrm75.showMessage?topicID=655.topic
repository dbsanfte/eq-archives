<br>
The lands of Norrath are still expanding. Faithful followers of Sony Online Entertainment's incredibly popular MMORPG -- EverQuest -- are about to get the chance to open another expansion pack for their beloved game. Lost Dungeons of Norrath is different, however, than the previous four expansions. Focusing firmly on single group dungeon crawls, LDoN brings some cool new technologies to the table. GameSpy recently got to speak with Lead Designer, Shawn Lord, about LDoN. Read on to get the exclusive scoop on what you and your EQ-happy friends can expect to find to later this fall. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: What's the idea behind LDoN? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: The Lost Dungeons of Norrath is designed to bring back the thrill of the dungeon crawl. There's a certain sense of danger that comes along with being a small group of heroes traveling into the depths of a dark cavern seeking adventure. LDoN is built for single groups of characters that want to push their way through a dungeon from beginning to end. There won't be any &quot;camping&quot; of spawns. To further your adventure you'll have to forge ahead and see what lies in wait for you in the gloom around the next bend. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Please explain how the new &quot;Dynamic Dungeon System&quot; technology works. <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Your group can approach certain NPCs who will ask them to perform a task or explore a location. If the party leader accepts the adventure, the party will be given what is, essentially, a key to the dungeon. All members of the group will be able to enter that dungeon to face the dangers there, but other player characters will not. These dungeons will be created on the server specifically for their use, and will only exist as long as the characters are having their adventure. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Will the dungeons feature randomly generated elements? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Random would not be the proper word to describe it. No content is completely random; we prefer to make certain that all the content is hand-crafted. These dungeons will not be randomly generated from parts, but factors such as the level of the party and the type of adventure that they want to undertake will determine what sort of encounters they have. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: What are the party size constraints of entering a dynamic dungeon? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Parties of five or six characters will be able to travel the Lost Dungeons. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Why did you decide to go down this path with the new expansion? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Many players, when looking back at their most exciting gameplay in EverQuest, will remember the time that they spent pushing themselves and their friends to work together and do something that was challenging. We're the same way. Our personal play experience has taught us that some of the most exciting encounters in EverQuest occur when a small group of friends fight their way to the boss of a dungeon and defeat him. After producing an expansion that had a lot of content for guilds to enjoy, it just seemed like the right time to go back to the basic single-party adventure. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: How many new locations, creatures, quests, and monsters will LDoN bring to the table? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: More than 40 adventure zones, dozens of new NPCs and, well, the whole thing is about quests that take you into these new zones with a goal to accomplish. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Can you tell us exactly what the &quot;Adventure Rewards&quot; technology will do? How does it work? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: You will be able to earn status with the characters that act as the major focus of this storyline. You'll develop an interesting relationship with them over time. As you prove yourself to them, they'll allow you to pick from a large variety of rewards. <br>
<br>
We wanted to make sure that everyone felt they were getting a little something from each play session. In Lost Dungeons, every member of the group will be rewarded for their participation in a number of ways. Each time you work through an adventure, you'll get experience, find coin and rare items, and earn a little credit towards a bigger reward. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Will there be unique items and spells that can only be found in these new dungeons? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Certainly. Each dungeon will contain opportunities for players to discover rare monsters and even special new containers that yield their own surprises. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Do players have an equal chance of getting cool new stuff? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Everyone that buys the expansion will have access to the dungeons and will be able to get new items. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Does LDoN add anything to the &quot;Level Cap&quot; system of EverQuest? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: We are not adding any new levels, classes, or races with this expansion. Our focus is on the new technology and all the new adventures that we'll be providing. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: How are you addressing camping and power-leveling in the new expansion? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: Only members of your group can access a specific dungeon, and the challenge level of those dungeons is based on the composition of your party. In those dungeons NPCs will not be respawning, once they are killed they stay dead, so camping isn't an option. If you want a new fight, you have to move deeper into the dungeon. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Tell us about the new in-game interface that tracks players' progression through the dungeons? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: It's really too early to discuss this. We will be working more in the future to track players' accomplishments, but what this will mean to them is still a bit of a secret. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: How do players physically jump into the new locations? Do they need special items to gain access? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: The NPC that gives you the adventure will also give you an idea about where that adventure will be located. Getting there is up to you. In fact, some of the challenge to a given adventure may be getting to it. Once your group arrives at the proper location, you will find an entrance. No special items are needed; you just need to have been sent on their adventure by the proper NPC. <br>
GameSpy: What changes/additions to trade skills will LDoN offer? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: There will be new trade skill items that can be found in the Lost Dungeons. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Are you looking at optimizing the graphics engine to make it more friendly to lower-powered PCs? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: EverQuest currently supports a wider range of PCs, especially on the lower end, than many other MMORPGs on the market. We've put a lot of effort into supporting those customers with machines that are near, and even below, the minimum specifications for the game. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Each dungeon is said to take around 45-90 minutes to walk through. Why not make them longer? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: We are aiming at an experience that any player can participate in. Some folks are limited on the time that they can play, and these dungeons will allow them to log in and play for a while, complete an adventure, and log out. Those that want to play longer can talk to the NPCs and try another adventure. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Is the overall aim of LDoN to provide simple hack-your-way-to-the-end mini-dungeons? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: We are certainly going to provide the opportunity for folks to get involved in the fabled dungeon crawl. We are also introducing some new environmental elements: objects that break, or need special skills to open, etc. As with everything we've done over the years, every new system we introduce will eventually turn into something bigger and better. This expansion is no exception. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Will there be new quests tied into the existing EverQuest game? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: If you mean will there be extensions or continuations of existing quests that lead into the LDoN dungeons, then the answer is no. We can't count on purchasers of this expansion owning anything other than the basic game, so the LDoN experience will be tied in with the old world. If you're wondering how these adventures tie into the overall story of Norrath, see the answer below. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: What advantages does LDoN offer to the players? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: You can explore five new dynamic environments as they lead you through over 40 diverse dungeons. There's new technology that emphasizes personalized group encounters without interruption from other players. Players will be able to experience the excitement of the &quot;dungeon crawl,&quot; by vanquishing foes, rescuing victims, and recovering lost items using an all-new adventure system. There are also unique adventures that offer different challenges, enemies, and treasure in the underworld. We have a quicker adventure rewards system and the ability to track your progress in the dungeons via a new in-game interface. We've [also] added dozens of new NPCs and more powerful new spells, trade skills, weapons, and other worthy items. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: How does LDoN fit into the EverQuest storyline? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: I don't want to spoil too much, but we are very focused on showing everyone how Planes of Power, the Legacy of Ykesha, and the Lost Dungeons of Norrath all tie in together. This story has been brewing for sometime and we're just getting started. The last couple of years are just the foundation for the story to come. There's plenty of adventure ahead. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Will this be the last expansion we'll see for EverQuest? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: No. In fact, we already have plans for another expansion, though the details on that one aren't ready for release yet. The story of Lost Dungeons will be one chapter in many still to come. <br>
<br>
GameSpy: Is this dynamic approach something we're likely to see pop up in EverQuest II? <br>
<br>
Shawn Lord: You'll have to ask EQII! <br>
<br>
 <br>
Also from rumor control, the next expansion will have the 70th level for Players, mind you this is only a rumor.<br>
