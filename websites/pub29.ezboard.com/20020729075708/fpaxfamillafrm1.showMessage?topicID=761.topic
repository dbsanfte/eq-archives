We had about 15 members online during prime time, and about 3 to 5 members online overnight at most times. Then, without anyone expressing any dissatisfaction, we dropped to around 6 members online during prime time and sometimes none on overnight. I couldn't explain it, and thought it was only a temporary thing. I thought maybe people had other things that were occupying their time or whatnot and things would return to the new normal soon enough. Then.... for some reason, another drop. Last few days I have logged on only to find 3 or 4 people online during prime time. Thats when I kind of panicked. Realized something more was up than what I thought originally. Tonight, what came as a total shock was to find that Thorkin (who I had actually considered giving guild leadership to at one point) and Emberglow, the two people who had been in Pax just as long as I had, and two officers  at that, had quit.<br>
<br>
To me, that kind of sounded the death knell of Pax Familla. Well, even though this is only a video game, I almost cried over that. I mean, I was almost totally blown away. Pax groups were forming alot and having fun together. I hadn't heard any recent comments in weeks but about how good Pax was doing and how people enjoyed being in it. And then people just stopped logging on, people stopped chatting despite my efforts to keep them talking and being friends with each other.<br>
<br>
Well, per the suggestion of a few remaining members, I have posted this poll for you. A majority of complaints that everyone heard before, and what is the complaint of what someone told me tonight, is that Pax cannot help them achieve high end goals of the game. Therefore, it was suggested to change the guild to a 46th+ minimum requirement and attempt to be a high end guild so we can attract high end members and keep existing high end members. Current Paxers would be grandfathered in of course, and I would make attempts to keep the rule of allowing your twinks in, no matter what level. Doing this would probably mean that we would have more raids on dungeons, and of course, planes.<br>
<br>
The other option, that has been offered to me before, and might still be in effect, is to merge with Swords of Sacrifice. Before we did the merger with Sons of Tao, this option was set before me by Sleepingbear, the leader of Swords of Sacrifice. Wanting to keep the Pax identity, I turned him down, but formed an alliance with them so we could go on their raids and hopefully keep members through the prospect of raids. Well needless to say, I found out that not many Paxers took advantage of the raids offered by Swords of Sacrifice. Go figure. I have asked one of his officers, a personal friend of mine, to see if that offer is still open. For the sake of time, I have posted that option here anyway as I'm pretty sure it is.<br>
<br>
Myself, I cannot decide what I would want to do. So, until I give this further personal thought, I will not vote.<br>
<br>
Yours, humbly, Suntoucher. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/utimont2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Timont2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#000099>(3/7/02 12:24:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=761.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Future of Pax Familla</span><hr size=1> I have some knowledge of Guild mergers from watching friends play EQ long before I started playing.  For example one guild merged with Institute.  The guild that merged lost the guild name and tag.  Institute was more of a high level guild at the time before Kunark.  As EQ grew and so did other characters levels Institute was still a high level guild but had lost people that headed to level 60.  Institute relized what they wanted to acheive as far as leveling and getting equipment.  However they did not want to lose the guild tag.  Institute merged with Crimson Eternity but left all twinks in Institute.  Institute still lives and has some higher level characters in as of date.<br>
<br>
A guild can merge and still live on.<br>

I kind of panicked when I shouldn't have. We don't have to merge with anyone. And I would like to see Pax Familla continue. But, I guess as other guilds have also found out, we need a goal of some kind. Something to work towards.<br>
<br>
Yes, I would like to see Pax raiding planes one day again. Yes, I would like to see several members with their epics. But, I don't want to lose that sense of family that has been pretty much essential since Pax's inception.<br>
<br>
Any ideals anyone? I do think we need to get more high end people though. That way we can start to do high end things again.<br>

<br>
Dont hate mah.....please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have been toying with the idea of quiting PAX for awhile now, just been keeping it quiet.  If you want my reasons, it has nothing to do with the Guild.....I loved being a member/officer of PAX, its just time for me to move on, thats all. I've been with PAX since lev 32 or so, stayed through the high lev abandonment, the times when we had only 8 mems or so, and even when everyone said PAX was dead......<br>
<br>
The main reason for me leaving PAX is the fact that yes, I need more high lev support, and I have long wanted to be in the same Guild as my good RL friend MERKIN (a former PAXer) I had long conversations with Ember before he quit, and we were both thinking the same things in regards to leaving PAX.  I didnt know that he had quit on the same evening as I did though....it must have come as a huge blow to Sun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also, I was getting tired of Leading Every raid/event we have had in the last 3 months, and just wanted to lev up and work on my epic and such.....I have joined &quot;Norrath's Domination&quot; a 50+ guild, and am liking it so far <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I cherished my long stay in PAX, and am here for you guys if you need me for raid support, Epics, or whatever, (like trying to get MollyBells Alt out of the new 55+ CT zone this evening) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anyways guys and gals, dont hate Ember or I for leaving.......it was just time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I have had my share of ups and downs, both with Sons of Tao, and now with Pax.  One thing I have seen entirely too many times since starting this game, is people leaving perfectly good guilds for the sake of further personal development.  I COMPLETELY understand the reasoning of those who leave for this reason, if they are among the few who have actively participated and sacrificed their goals for the sake of the guild, as I know Thork and Ember have.  They only want to be able to pursue things they have put off to help the guild.  Although I don't agree that leaving is the solution, I completely understand and respect their decision.<br>
<br>
For those who choose to leave ONLY because they aren't getting what they want, or because they want more but don't want to help the guild in the process....I say they never should have joined a guild in the first place (that's not directed at anyone that left, just my personal feelings on those kinds of people).<br>
<br>
So....now that there are no leaves left on the bush from my beating around it, :O here is the solution I propose:<br>
<br>
All guilds should recognize and welcome the needs of all level groups.  Every guild should have an officer, or small group of officers, responsible for recruiting/helping/leveling/raiding with members of all level groups.  That would help the guild cater to the high end game, and give the lower level characters something to look forward to.  Very often, we focus so much on guild's &quot;average level&quot; group that we turn off those on either side of that average....if that makes sense.<br>
<br>
My proposition to secure the future of Pax, then, is this:  Give each officer a level group that he/she is responsible for.  Make sure that officer is willing to recruit, counsel, plan and attend raids with, etc. his/her assigned level group.  Yes, it will mean taking time away from your personal pursuits, but if you are an officer in a guild, that should have been an understood requirement from the beginning.<br>
<br>
AND....if you get tired of doing the job, or need some time off to pursue your own interests...DON'T LEAVE!!!  Talk to the guild leader and other officers.  Tell them you need a break, and get someone else to cover for you, so you don't abandon those who look to you for support and guidance.<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm off my soapbox now.  I'm all for having a high end raiding guild, but let's not forget where we all started, and those times in our early adulthood that we really had to struggle to find a pickup group, becasue no one in the guild was available to help.  Just a thought.  What do you guys think?<br>
<br>
*NOTE - The preceding comments are not directed at anyone who left recently, as there are no high end characters to help with the things they are pursuing.  These comments are mine, and mine alone, and do not reflect the feelings of the Pax Familla guild.  If you are offended by anything I said, then it must apply to you and.....it hurts, don't it?<br>
<br>
All Hail Pax Familla<br>

I know I have already started recruiting in the zones I've been in. Recently I picked up Stanman (52 Pally), and Rasvith (54th Cleric) for us.<br>
<br>
Its my goal that 1 month from now, to be able to field at least 2  50th+ level groups.<br>
<br>
But, I love your ideal too Maz. Having a officer assigned a specific level that s/he is to recruit for, and plan events for.<br>
<br>
Any other comments on that? I think we should do that.<br>

Not saying that anyone would, but it would be easy for that to happen.  I believe one person being accountable for the operations of his/her specific level group would keep bickering down about who was supposed to do what, etc.  If anyone wants to volunteer to help, that would be encouraged and appreciated, but the officer would still be ultimately responsible for seeing that everything is done that needs to be done.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to say that anyone would take advantage of anyone else in this guild, or anything of that nature.  However, I have gone through this before, and even when you have ONE person responsible for a certian operation, it is still sometimes difficult to keep running smoothly.  Just my 2cp, but I think from my past experience and seeing other guilds suffer the same fate, it would be great to have several &quot;mini-guilds&quot; within the guild, broken up by level groups and managed by a trusted, self-initiated senior officer.  That would cater to the interests and needs of all level groups, and can help keep someone in the guild from the time they join until they are an uber-twinked 60th level Baron von I've-gotten-my-epic-and-done-all-I-can-do-and-then-some.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?  Am I on the right track or way off base?  It WILL take some work and some persistence from the upper management at first...but once everyone knows their part and does what they are supposed to do, it should run like a well-oiled-machine.  Again, just my humble 2cp for your consideration.<br>
<br>
All Hail Pax Familla !!!<br>

Renion, I don't know where he is at; haven't seen him in over a month. Haschel is busy with RL (darn that RL stuff!), so that leaves me, you and Molly. How would you propose to split it up?<br>
<br>
45th ~ 60th?<br>
30th ~ 45th?<br>
10th ~ 30th?<br>
<br>
I think those are about the levels that can group and raid together. Also, the assistants, I would want to volunteer, not just be assigned (of course). Also, with 3 active officers, the way the guild is starting to expand again, I think we need 2 more active ones. What do you think? And who would you recommend?<br>

Of course, you'll want the officer for that group to be the highest possible level for that group, or higher (did that make sense?).  I think we should call a meeting of the members who want to remain and help Pax grow, and see what they think...and go from there.  I would also suggest opening the floor for nominations (both here and with a /guildmotd) for two more officers.  Once they are elected, you can assign groups based on the officers' availability and how often they are online, knowledge of the game, raiding experience, etc.  You (or we, at your discretion) can develop an operational plan that is general enough to apply to all groups, and specific enough to cover the needs of each group individually.  Then the recruiting process begins, the officer meets with those in his/her level group, raids and quests are planned, and everyone has a great time.<br>
<br>
Also, each officer should keep a written log of each person they recruit for their level group.  We may even want to stipulate that those who wish to join can only be invited by the guild leader or the officer for his/her level group ONLY.  This will help avoid confusion, and make absolutely sure that everyone who joins gets to meet his/her group officer.  Again, this is only my humble 2cp, submitted for your perusal and consideration.<br>

<br>
I have some raid leading exp, since I was also a higher lvl character in my last guild.  And, I've been to hate, fear and the dragons entirely too many times.  Once in fear is too much.)  I will say this though, we're a bit short on people to be leading really good raids.  Right now we don't have enough people to do raids where everyone gets exp and stuff.  That's not the main reason to raid, however you ought to know that going in.  I do recommend you use the officers that are in charge of every level to organize level specific raids.  It's good for the whole guild to raid from time to time.  However, the people that are the same level will group together, and know each other better, and thus form a better raid party.  You need the potential to get better items, exp, and get to know the rest of the guild to have a really good raid that everyone enjoys.  Any raid that includes the entire guild will be the high lvls leading the lower lvls around, getting all the exp, and the lower lvls getting all the items.  That get's old.  Either you're low lvl and feel like you're just along for the ride, or you're high lvl, and you feel like you're just pharming stuff for the lower lvls.  However, if someone does need something pharmed, for a quest or such, I'm usually free.<br>
<br>
I think maz is right about not joining a guild because of what they can do for your epics or raids, however it does get old.  It's more than that too.  It's no fun being a guild where you don't have many people to group with.  I've been playing for almost 3 years now, and honestly I'm tired of always being LFG, or missing out on the higher lvl raids.  I really do hope that Pax can make a turn for the better and start becoming an upper lvl guild.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uleomarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leomarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 334<br> <font color=#000099>(3/13/02 9:35:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=761.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sounds like a plan...</span><hr size=1> Well stan, at my last count (and of course, I am subject to error), we have 10 50th+ peeps in the guild.<br>
<br>
Risvith, 54 Cleric<br>
Caddy, 50 Druid<br>
Tkela, 50 Necro<br>
Shihalude, 52 Shadow Knight<br>
Timont, 51 Bard<br>
Haschel, 52 Monk<br>
Stanman, 52 Paladin<br>
Nektos, 50 Warrior<br>
Abbrah, 50 Wizard<br>
<br>
Haschel doesn't really have time for EQ right now, Nektos..... I have not seen him in about 2 weeks, and Timont will not be able to play EQ for about 6 months due to his job starting at the end of this week, or so. We also have 2 46th level clerics in the guild, Suntoucher and Mistt, and were on almost every day.<br>
<br>
Sounds like we could put together at least 1 high end group to raid something. But, I know that I just made 46th a few days ago, and have zero experience on the high end of the game.<br>
<br>
Any ideals?<br>
