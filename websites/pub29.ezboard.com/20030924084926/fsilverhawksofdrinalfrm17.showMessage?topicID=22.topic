 She is not sure why she cannot join them until she is summoned for they are among her dearest friends, but she keeps apart, hoping nobody falls this day.             <br>
 They have summoned her it is time to sing. <br>
They race across the lands running on the wind as they pass the busy dock in the Oasis, seeing the giants roam the land that once had struck fear in their hearts are now only are a minor annoyance. <br>
  Running through the dismal swamp that one among them calls home.  (Shiver) How she dislikes this place.<br>
They travel through the winding tunnels where the inbreeding of the frog people have made this place evil, the froglocks that live there up top shrink away from the travelers for they know they can not stand against them and survive it.<br>
  They travel to the bottom where they stop to make sure all is ready and together.  The hallway explodes with color as the pretty cleric in gold shields them all from undead eyes.  They are ready now and travel slowly to the bowels of that horrid place hoping that the magic that hides them will not fail until they are in place and ready.<br>
  They make it, others are there awaiting them, the sound of metal against metal as warriors greet one another and hails to old and new friends alike fill the  cavern, they care not if the vile creatures now hear or not, let them come and they shall die swiftly<br>
  The warrior stands ready with armor gleaming and weapons at the ready, the rogue slips into the shadows while the enchanter in blue gives power to others so they may pull on magic quicker then normal, the happy troll gives all strength and the uncanny ability of their bodies to heal faster then normal. She sings loudly so all her friends may receive the ability to fulfill their power reserves so they may wield the magic that is granted them. <br>
 The rogue yells out in his deep voice “To Arms my Friends” he has found a creature that has come to challenge them.  The cavern become ablaze with fire, lightning and the colors of binding, swords are heard whistling through the air as they race to slash the enemy, sounds of maces and staves crushing bone.<br>
 She sings for her friends to make them faster and to shield them, to slow and bind their enemy so he may die faster.<br>
  Where there was one there is now five.  The heroes fight on as one by one the creatures fall.<br>
She tries not to confuse her songs as she hears the lady in gold chanting as the warrior is engulfed in soft blue flames noticing he is not as pale and they battle on. <br>
 One has slipped beyond the battle to attack the lady in gold for it knows her power and will alone keeps them alive.  The troll they all call friend shouts a chant loudly and the horrid frog creature is wrapped in flame as it drops dead.  Their cleric is safe so they battle on. Her voice grows horse but she shall not fail her friends for they will never fail her.      <br>
  Two now only stand as she moves in with her mace and sword as she sings stronger knowing they will win the day.  One now left, the warrior steps in front of her as he swings his sword down with one last mighty stroke to rid the world of the last abomination that stood before them. <br>
 Some of the warriors yell out in victory for they have succeeded this day.  She lowers her voice as wipes the blood from her weapons and puts them away so she may pull forth her lute so she may sing and play.<br>
  Her friends are surrounded in a blue glow that carries the magic of healing and energy fulfillment.  They talk and laugh lightly as their wounds and spirits are mended.  They all are well and she is happy to be among friends.  They wait for more to come that think they can take the heroes.  What fools they shall prove themselves this day….<br>
