Take a look at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com">www.graffe.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> message boards if you want to see an upset buch of casters. I only managed to get a little taste of ae in Fungus Grove but BOY was it nice for a change to even be a member of a class that can be so very useful to an EXPERIENCE GROUP! The Grey was even better I think. On the developer's forum, the ae groups are the reason given for the nerf. Lots of classes must be angry at the all the Wizards/Mages/Enchanters responsible but quite honestly they went WAY too far if they were only concerned about people killing 40 mobs per pull. OK at a certain point I can understand that stuff being too powerful but they give us these spells that sit in our books forever unmemorized and when we finally start to USE them, they give us a zone where casters are just about useless. <br>

It was so much fun to be useful to a group once again, and use spells that I would normally only bring out to clean out green trash.

<br>
Simile: This change is like shutting down a dam because the cities beyond it are getting flooded.  Shutting down the dam also causes those cities to be without water, but at least they aren't completely destroyed.  After this quick fix, the dam controllers go to the drawing board and come up with a permanent fix that will allow the cities to get water without flooding them.<br>
<br>
The Grey will be changed again.  It had to be stopped for now due to people killing 40 mobs at once with AoE spells.  The developers are now finding a way to make the mobs in The Grey act the way they want, without providing a AoE slaughter fest that trivializes advancement.<br>
<br>
While I think Verant should NEVER EVER EVER allow Abashi to speak for them EVER again, the following response from EQLive, while doing a poor job, clears it up, sort of:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000427.html">boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000427.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It had to be addressed first to ensure the integrity and longevity of the game. Sure, after that we can sit down and determine what the best way would be. You might want to see what changes go in (some tonight) before making final judgements.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
This is why Gordon should be banned from any PR work.  He tries to explain away sensitive situations with riddles.  He's done it for years.  Moron.<br>
<br>
What he means to say, is Verant made a quick change before the AoE slaughters in The Grey created a huge influx of level 60, full AA AoE casters.  This change will be changed once the developers can formulate a true change that people will like that won't undermine character advancement.  These changes are being worked on and will go in when they're finished.  Verant apologizes for their poor testing, but its inevitable that stuff like this slips by when you rush software.<br>
<br>
That's my take on the situation.  Relax.  Have fun.  Don't assume Verant is out to get you.  They are bad a PR, but you are still playing, so the game must be fairly good.<br>

They will bring the zone back, hopefully they will see that the easy fix is to disable AoE damage spells in the zone and all will be cool. I did not get a chance to go to the Grey, but I was in Fungus Grove and observed a group using this technique. I 100 percent AGREE with what Verant did, and if you want to blame someone for you not being able to cast in the Grey, blame the individuals who were EXPLOITING the zone and killing 40-60 mobs at a pop. Everything wrong in this game does not always fall on Verant's shoulders, many many times it's the peeps who find a &quot;flaw&quot; in the game and use it to their extreme advantage. I bet the experience in those groups was unbelievable when they dropped 40 blue mobs at a swat.<br>

<br>
Disable aoe damage spells? What exactly do you mean by that? Limit the number damaged? Make them uncastable? Highly resisted? What? <br>
<br>
What about disabling aoe stun? Just as important to these groups. <br>

Please don't be so melodramatic Wolfran. No one here has said they were &quot;out to get me.&quot;<br>
<br>
EDIT<br>
<br>
You know to a certain extent, VI had to expect that some experience encounters would become &quot;trivial&quot; with Luclin. There are people who have not bothered to get experience in ages who are now trying to get it as fast as they can. After farming ToV and Sleeper's for whatever ungodly stuff drops there, and possessing the strongest spells in the game, they will make a LOT of otherwise perfectly legitimate and reasonably risky tactics seem overpowering. A level 60 Warrior told me that he was getting slightly better experience in the long run soloing in Fungus Grove than he had been when in an ae group there. Wonder if we'll see any changes to stop that? I'm not holding my breath.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/umithrull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithrull</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/efitch70/usflag.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/14/01 10:38:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/ueqwolfran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWolfran</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>White Wind Officer</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#000000>(12/14/01 1:32:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1214.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok Not Happy At aLL</span><hr size=1> &quot;Please don't be so melodramatic Wolfran.

<br>
But being melodramatic is more fun.  I guess I could delete that sentence, but if you go to the message boards that are whining about this, 50% of the whiners are assuming that Verant hates them.<br>
<br>
Anyway...I saw logs posted about some of the battles, and saying that people were killing 40 exp giving mobs at a time wasn't an exaggeration.  The current zone is a quick fix to stop people from abusing a poorly tested zone...the true fix will come when its finished.  That's all I really meant to say. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One of the two needs to be disabled in order to end the above mentioned tactic. I think the removal of the AoE damage spell makes more sense, as it allows chanters and clerics who possess AoE stuns to still be able to control a situation gone bad. The solution is SO simple, guess Verant won't use it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
