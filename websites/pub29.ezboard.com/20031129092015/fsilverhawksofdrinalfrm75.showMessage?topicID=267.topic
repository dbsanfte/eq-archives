Ok i can answer this better now. <br>
<br>
1.Nobility-Elbryann/Mithrull always knows the right thing to do and has a top notch Moral's<br>
<br>
<br>
2.Honor- Grotar seems to always Hold all High Regard<br>
<br>
3.Respect- Nynne/Gossimer, Even will Disagreeing with Nynne about un game related stuff he always displays a high Degree of respect for his peers and their opinions.<br>
<br>
4.Loyalty-Zygard even when he was not a Hawk and Just grouping with some of us he  would go out of his way to be there for us and will stick out the fight as long as we need a top notch Chanter.<br>
<br>
5.Valor- While no longer with us I feel Baliff was one of the Bravest I have grouped with. He was always willing to Die for the rest of the Hawks so we could get away. Never Have i seen him tuck tail and run when we needed him to hang in melee for an extra sec so the rest could escape.<br>
<br>
6.Genorosity - Glade/Vaporasio has always been one of the most unselfish Folks in all of Norrath. It's not so much what he gives Material wise but what he gives you in time, heart, pateince, and education of Norrath that helps the most. Always he is there to Help Hawks do remarkable things they couldn't have done without him. He invited me into Hawks and Hasn't stoped giving yet.<br>
<br>
7.Compassion- Xoel is  the true embodiment of compassion in Norrath. A good trait for a Cleric to have. Xoel on many occasions has dropped whatever she is doing to rezz someone in guild or not to help them because I truly believe she hates for someone to have the trouble that a death can bring.<br>
<br>
I have seen all Hawks Do these things but these are the folks that stand out the most and who I have seen display these things most often. I have prolly been grouped with them more than others too and have learned how to be a Hawk through Them.<br>
<br>
If i had to say one person who Does all these things the Best it would Have to Be Glade/Vaporasio. Jilcey you have alwyays been a true embodiment to of these attributes but i excluded you since you are our Leader. (We know u got the right stuff) <p><HTML><BODY>

<br>
I too have not been in to long so I will comment on what I have seen....<br>
<br>
1. Nobility - Having or showing qualities of high moral character.<br>
Narcotical/Iandias - I have Rithe telling me of very many times in his ranger carrier how she saved his bacon and was a good friend when he needed it.  She also gave me a noct blade when I needed an upgrade from a MOSS for 2k of which I could owe her later.  I have had the money for a month now and she hasn't asked for it, just to keep it for her, which is in Forcy's possession right now, since she lives up there.  I have heard of many times that Iandias has saved several people with her knowledge of Velks either being there, or as of yesterday, from a distance to Toorch.<br>
<br>
2. Honor - Principled uprightness of character<br>
<br>
I would have to say all of the hawks embody this.  I mean this in the most broadest of examples.  I see each of us holding the guild as a whole to be defined by their actions and therefore I have never seen a Silverhawk act inappropriately. <br>
<br>
3. Respect - To feel or show deferential regard for<br>
<br>
Again each Hawk respects each other and others not of our guild.  I can't pinpoint one in particular.<br>
<br>
4. Loyalty - A feeling or attitude of devoted attachment<br>
I'm giving this to Unianu, and seconded by Tygerkat.  The MM raid I put on yesterday, while a tought day, looked bleak as just Unianu and I were sitting there alone with only Asmius trying to get there at 1pm Eastern.  Unianu stuck with me until 5:30 eastern and also ran with me as I tested zone defenses and pathing.  Much like TYgerkat I made her my friend forever that day, and if there is anything she even remotely needs, or needs me to use my body to defend her, I will at anytime (As long as she can pick me up).<br>
<br>
Then Later, my helper on the raid, Tygerkat, on a friends computer, gives me a tell and explains to me why she can not show up.  Her power is out at her house and she is desperately trying to get it fixed.  However in and among the RL crisis, which I totally could understand she could not join us, she sends me tells she cannot show up and apologizes.  I thought that was the most incredible show of loyalty I have ever seen, and she will always be my teddymistress.<br>
<br>
5. Valor - Courage and boldness, as in battle; bravery<br>
A tough one here but I would say HP, I have heard tales and have seen once where he stayed behind to get ripped apart to let the group evac.  <br>
<br>
6. Generosity - Liberality in giving or willingness to give<br>
Vaparaiso - <br>
This is a story related to me by Rithe Silverwind, Forcy's in game brother and my RL best friend:<br>
Apparently the other night, (friday) I believe right before the womens auction, Vap was in DL waiting for  a Karnor's group to take out VS.  This other Druid, and I forget her name was taking an awful long time getting a group together, so Rithe took the friends and guildmembers he had and Vap down into Karnors and they took out VS (quite easily he told me).  Anyhow Rithe looted his stone and told Vap to quickly loot the other one and instead, Vap allowed the druid who was trying to form the group that they killed VS on loot it.  Rithe's group was within its rights to loot since they had a ready force to go and she was not comitting to raiding VS right away, but Vap showed generosity in allowing her to loot a much needed item that he desperately needed.  In my mind there is no higher form of generosity.  Several other things come to mind like honor as well.<br>
<br>
7. Compassion<br>
<br>
Forcythia/Xoel/Tygerkat:<br>
These three represent the compassionate three in my opinion.  I have seen Xoel drop whatever she is doing and go to the aid of a fallen companion.  Or Forcythia sit in FP and give her coin and help to newbie bards instead of leveling.  In fact FOrcy never levels she spends too much time helping everyone...when she doesn;t work in RL.  She grabbed Xoel and sprinted at top speed to Everfrost to rescue RIthe and Trothbashand then back.  She will run all over the place to help....<br>
<br>
Tygerkat, she's my friend and I love her dearly.  She helped make me laugh when I died a lot one day, and in just 15 minutes I was really content.  She will heal and tl anyone who asks and she will always try to be in game and tell someone why she can;t show up.  She makes the most upset person happy with her charm and wit.<br>
<br>
Well that's all I gotta say.  i hope more people reply here its a really good post.<br>

i think about the faces and character of different people i have known in my long human life on Norrath, <br>
<br>
1)Nobility: Toorch, one of the finest warriors ever to grace the plains.<br>
<br>
2)Honor :Orson Fahn , strong and rough but always true.<br>
<br>
3)Respect: Gehric, i have truly grown to respect him not only as a player, but a friend. <br>
<br>
4)loyalty: tygerkat, always a loyal friend and hawk. <br>
<br>
5) Valor:Ralas, ive never seen a lizard so ready to go himself for his friends and guildmates... and frankly, its a little scary.=)<br>
<br>
6)generosity) conannan. i dont know a more generous guildmate than him.<br>
<br>
7)compassion: thats a tie, between zamori and xoel, zamori was there for me through some difficult times, and xoel believed in me when no one else could<br>
<br>
there have been so many hawks who have helped me be the player that i am today. from darkarr to grotar, thats the funny thing about playin everquest and being a silverhawk. its not what you take with you when go, but what you leave behind. may mercy make us friends<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :boba --><img src=http://www.silver-hawks.org/images/fett.gif ALT=":boba"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>
