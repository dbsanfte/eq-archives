<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The moon was nearing its apogee in the night sky over the quiet lands of Antonica when I returned from some personal business in my home city of Freeport.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Having just attained the 15th circle of prayer while combating the undead menace of the western Commonlands, I had spent the entire past day in silent communion with the Lightbringer, Mithaniel Marr. In my solitary prayer room, I met with my God as the first pink rays of dawn caressed the horizons. All while the sun made its eternal circle across the sky, the Lightbringer nestled me close to his bosom, whispering ways that I might further His cause in Freeport, and in all the surrounding world. As a reward for my vigilance and faith, the Marr twin blessed me deeper understanding of how to channel my faith into pure holy power, for the healing of the just, and the undoing of the wicked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As dusk began to fall across the land, I began my final prayers of thanks to the God who had blessed me with so much. I quickly changed from my white clerical robes back into my battle-scarred armor, making mental checks that every piece was in full working order before leaving the safe haven of North Freeport, the stronghold of the Knights of Truth. With a farewell to my fellow Paladins of the Hall, I headed into Southern Freeport...the fallen city.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the best of times, I receive nothing more than a frosty glare or menacing scowl from the Freeport Militia guards. However, as I do much in protecting the townspeople from roaming monsters, there currently rests no price on my head. As I make my cautious way to the city gate, I am appalled by the stench, by the sheer numbers of vagrants and beggars who now haunt the once-proud city's streets. Noticing the standard emblazoned on my shield, two &quot;ladies of the evening&quot;, as they are known, call out mockingly to me, tempting me with their words, their lewd promises of what might be had for a few gold.<br>
<br>
             I pay no heed to them, of course, and it strikes me how much the people are a mirror of the city. While the city claims to be founded under goodly law, it is stagnant and corrupt. These whores are much the same, the evening light hiding the flaws and scars on their bodies, and too much cheap perfume attempts to mask the overwhelming smell of their unwashed bodies and malnutrition.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I remember my earliest days, when I was barely old enough to walk, when the forces of Order ruled Freeport...before Sir Lucan. Once among the most-trusted lieutenants of the Hall of Truth, Lucan served the Lightbringer with all his heart, and was a revered and respected Paladin of great power. When the Paladins of the Hall set out on their great crusade, Lucan was left in charge of the city. Because of the absence of his fellows, he raised his own army from a grassroots group of mercenaries. Perhaps blinded by their own faith, his brother paladins did not see the warning signs in Lucan. Destroyed by his blind quest for power, Sir Lucan Dlere was stripped of all his Marr-given powers, and now rules East and West Freeport with an unrelenting iron grip, where he now oppresses the very people he was once sworn to protect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A commotion at the gate proper shakes me from my daydream. A scouting party of orcs has, in typical orcish fashion, decided to do a bit more than just &quot;scout&quot;. Screaming cries to Rallos Zek, the bloodthirsty and impartial Warlord, the orcs came on in a wave. A cry went up from the Militia sentries, drawing forth the reserve guard from the Miltiahouse, and the battle was joined in full.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lucan's mercenaries tore into the orc raiders with the fury of a contained thunderstorm. It was blatantly obvious from their savagery that they were hired and paid only for their fighting prowess, leaving honor an unnecessary formality. Most of the guards fought with swords, but a few used spears and poleaxes, and one wielded twin daggers, slicing the orcs in a berserker fury.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Surprisingly, the orcs fell back into the open section of desert leading to the Commonlands. As the orcs broke rank and fled, the bloodthirsty town guards gave pursuit, unwilling to let their beaten foes escape.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had climbed to the ramparts of the gate for a better view of the battle, deciding to stay and protect the merchants and townsfolk, should any raiders slip through into the city. From my high vantage point, I watched as the fleeing orcs slowed their pace, and began to head for cover under a rocky outcropping. Behind that defensible position, I caught a glimpse of many more humanoid forms. I tried to yell a warning to those in pursuit, to stop their headlong charge into an obvious ambush.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For the first time since initially viewing the orcs, I saw that the entire group was comprised of lithe pawns and fleet-footed scouts, not the heavily-armed warriors usually sent on such missions. Blinded by their arrogance and battle-rage, the Militia bore down like a charging mammoth on the orcs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Their bloodlust was to be their downfall. On both sides of the outcropping, huge orcs sprung up from shallow holes they had prepared. Massive centurions and legionnaires, armed to the teeth, tore into the Freeport guards. Because they had been in such reckless pursuit and the surprise was complete, the men began to panic, and were summarily cut down by the orcish horde.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some of the older guards had served in formal military service, and that proved to be their salvation. Forming a tightly knit circle, they were able to repel their immediate attackers, and had some hope of holding out until a controlled retreat could be attempted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The crafty orcs had wisely pulled their pursuers far out into the plains, beyond the range of any archer or crossbowman. Groups of guards were now forming up to aid their compatriots. Most of the town was now aware of the assault, and commoners had clogged the ramparts to see the raging battle. A band of paladins rode up dressed in their field plate and riding fully barded warhorses. At their front was Merko Quetalis, a lieutenant of the Knights of Truth, and also their current weaponmaster.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I ran to join my brothers, I heard the solemn words of the field commander, his jaw set grimly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Defend the city! Do not let the gates fall...but you are all sworn to refrain from intervening on behalf of the Freeport Militia. We fight only if we must, and then only to protect the innocent.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I linked with my brothers as we formed a human shield across the gate. We watched, from afar, as a third group entered the battle. A band of orcs dressed in rags and strange, arcane talismans had entered formed up safely behind the warriors, and began chanting a common refrain. My surprise was complete when I began to recognize the chant to be a variation on a spell I had studied in my earliest days of prayer. I often used this spell to harness a portion of Mithaniel's pure holy light, to flash the souls of the wicked and force them to examine themselves in that blinding aura. These orcish spellcasters, however, had twisted some of the words to have a darker meaning. The shamans were jeering and calling out to their dark gods, that they might blind the guards of Freeport, and then cut them down.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ordinarily, this spell results in a small pocket of intensely bright light, enough to momentarily disorient and blind a foe. However, with the sheer number of shamans simultaneously casting, the effect was nothing short of breathtaking. An audible cry of pain went up from the Militia, as they tried to shield their eyes from the burning light.<br>
Out of place in this flamboyant display, a huge shadow loomed over the warring groups.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A boulder, fully the size of my shield, screamed into the fray, where the spell had been centered. It struck a militiaman a glancing blow on the shoulder, spinning him completely around before dropping him, twisted and broken, into the mud and gore. The glancing blow had not slowed the missile's flight at all, and it now thundered directly into the chest of a veteran soldier. We grimaced in disgust at the sound of the huge projectile grating against the forged steel of the man's breastplate, at the creak of the armor giving, the disgusting crackle of the warrior's ribcage shattering, and the sudden hiss, as the air was blasted from the cavity that used to house the man's fragile lungs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A howl went up, echoing loudly off of the city's stone walls:<br>
           &quot;For the glory of Zek!! Smash and kill!&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the dazzling light subsided, two immense figures jostled each other, one apparently congratulating the other for his accuracy:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;One rock, two smash!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The horrid laughter of the behemoths reverberated heavily throughout the valley, and we felt the trembling of the bass tones through our steel-plated boots. One massive figure picked up another boulder, which seemed in his hands to be a pebble, and hurled it with all his might directly towards us. The townspeople screamed and dove for cover, and we steeled ourselves to dodge certain death, for we had seen of what use a steel breastplate was against such attacks. Luckily, the rock fell short of the gates by several measures, and we were haunted by the visions of what damage the next throw might cause. We did not have long to worry, though, for both monstrosities pulled huge mauls from their backs, and hurried into the fray.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hill Giants?!&quot;, I heard my commanders' voice shout, &quot;How could these orcs have found such mighty allies??&quot; And then, to us, &quot;Knights, our hand has been forced. The depleted Militia stands no chance against this pair of giants. If we do not act, innocent blood will stain this city's streets this night. Forward, Knights of Truth! Show this city the might of the Just, of the Lightbringer!&quot; With his final words, Merko drew forth a shining sword and held it aloft. &quot;Come with me now, brothers! Forward, into the Light!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Into the Light!!&quot; I heard a thunderous echo, then realized that my voice was among them, and that I had drawn my sword and was charging towards the battle, part of the phalanx that was the assembled Knights of Truth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our charging company closed the distance to the battle in a very short time, our charge led fearlessly by our field commander Merko. We heard a fanfare of trumpets from the gates, and all momentarily paused to consider the source. As the gates swung open, a cheer went up from the masses of commoners on the battlements. Sir Lucan Dlere, mounted on a nightblack charger and flanked by 15 of his elite guard took the field of battle, leading in another group of Militia footsoldiers. Our core group, twenty paladins strong, had felled one giant after using our goodly magic to hold him in place, and was now focusing on the spellcasters, as the Militia struggled with the second giant. As I locked swords with a massive orc legionnaire, I heard a nearby knight, Sir Fredrick by name, remark:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah! I see the noble Sir Lucan has deigned to join us after all. How strange that a man possessed of such heralded courage and valour should only appear now, when the giant has fallen!&quot; Sir Fredrick's wry chuckle drew angry glares from Lucan's troops, but he shrugged off their venomous stares and turned towards his next foe.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I squared off against my opponent, the brutish legionnaire, my initial attack having only grazed his arm. As he raised his crude and jagged blade, I could smell the filth of his unwashed body, his foul sweat from the exertion of the battle thus far, and ever so slightly, the scent of his dark blood in the air, from where my blade has sliced his arm.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I found that I liked this smell, the smell of battle. And soon, I smiled grimly, the scent of justice done. I measured this much larger and stronger opponent with a series of carefully weighted strikes and feints. Truly, this would not be a great spectacle of swordplay, I realized as my opponent threw himself at me with a revoltingly uncomplicated attack pattern. His favored method of attacked appeared to be a wild swing for my head, accompanied by a primal scream, leaving himself open to all sorts of counterstrikes, and apparently unconcerned for his own safety.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Either that, or he was unconvinced that a slender half-elf could put enough force into his blows to stop the charge of such a larger and obviously stronger enemy. I smiled then at my heritage, at the memory of my mother, a wood elf of unending beauty and grace, who had followed the tenets of the Rainkeeper Karana with all her heart and soul before a raiding party of goblins burned the village where she lived to the ground. My memory shifted to that of my father, the noble and proud Knight of Truth, who had spent many late nights with me, teaching me the ways of the Lightbringer. He had died in the great crusade, leaving me an orphan among the Paladins of the Hall of Truth. The kindly Valeron Dushire had taken me under his wing, raised me as his own, and brought me up to become a full-fledged Paladin of Mithaniel, as my father before me had been. I smiled serenely at the memories of my parents, pleasant and comforting ones, and of the honor I might bring to them on the field of battle this day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Although bearing a crudely crafted sword and possessing slightly above animal intelligence, this orc was no stranger to combat, I could tell by his overlapping scars and leathery skin. Although this creature had probably been fighting its entire wretched life, I took solace in the fact that I had been trained by the likes of Merko and of Valeron Dushire, a level of training no orc could hope to have.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My delusions were shattered almost instantly, as a double swing by the orc's wicked blade nearly took off my arm. From what seemed to be a simple thrust, he had angled the blade down, and ripped it back across the underside of my bicep. My shock was complete, and I expected to see my lifeblood spilling down my side. Instead, the blade skipped off the fine plate vambraces I was wearing, a gift from my trusted friend Reddbear. I recalled the linked armbands I used to wear, and shuddered at the damage that swipe could have caused me had I still been wearing my old armor. I saw then the truth of my adversary. While he was not intelligent, he HAD indeed been fighting his entire life. Judging by his size alone, this orc had been alive a long time, which was a testament to his fighting prowess. In addition to his immense size and strength, the orc's attacks were borne of a berserk rage I could not comprehend, allowing him to strike impossibly hard.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Seemingly overmatched, I thought back to a trick I had once been shown by a warrior during a sparring match in the arena. With a Z-shaped maneuver, the blade of your sword flashes before the enemy twice, then comes up to catch his sword under the tang guard. I executed this move now, and my blade bit lightly into the hand of the orc warrior as his blade flew from his hand. I angled for a strike to his neck and completed the move, feeling the blade sink into the orc's deeply muscled neck. With a graceful twist, I was clear of my defeated foe and ready for the next.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly, a heavy blow landed on my back, knocking me to the ground and blasting the air from my lungs. I rolled to the side and came up with my sword ready, to see the same orc I had just dispatched, bleeding profusely from a gaping wound in his neck, had apparently clubbed my with his heavy forearm, and was preparing to do so again. I watched in amazement as he came on, his rage so great that his body had not yet realized how serious, indeed lethal, his wounds were. The orc came in clumsily, but as he swung his fist again, he drove his solid forehead directly into my helm, the reverberations driving me to my knees as I raised my sword. The orc drove himself right on top of me, thrashing wildly. He suddenly jerked and stopped moving, and it was then that I realized my blade had completely impaled the warrior as he bore down on me. Standing and wrenching the blade from the orc, I turned to consider the scene of battle around me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The tide of battle had surely turned from the orcs, as the rout was nearing completion. The second giant still stood, however, and he fought with all the savagery of his ancestors. The paladins had immobilized the giant, and been able to heal each other, by use of their clerical magic. However, the Militiamen were possessed of no such abilities, and their losses were beginning to add up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I saw one such city guard in a fearful predicament, with an orc warrior on both sides of him. They were exited and agitated with their seeming victory over him, and they pressed in at impossible angles for him to parry both at a time. With a cry to Mithaniel, I came in hard at the pair, and between the guard and myself, we quickly were able to finish them off. I nodded my support to the warrior, and turned away to fight. No sooner had I turned than a blow landed across my ribs; a heavy shot that knocked me prone. I saw another of the Militia guards out of the corner of my eye as he attended to his wounded companion, the companion I had just saved. This newcoming guard looked down at me and grinned, brandishing his heavy warhammer. I struggled to my feet and went to join up with the rest of my company, to avoid any further such attacks. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sir Lucan had now engaged the second giant himself, having dismounted from his warhorse. The giant swung down his heavy maul, aiming for Lucan's head. Surprisingly, he made no move to block, he simply reached out with a bare hand for the giant's leg. I thought it extremely odd that a seasoned warrior such as Lucan would enter combat with only one of his gauntlets on, but shrugged that off in many possible explanations. Perhaps he was in a rush to enter combat; perhaps it had been damaged or lost in the field. All my questions returned tenfold, though, when Lucan Dlere's touch seemed to jolt the giant like a lightning bolt. The heavy club that had been coming down to squash the Captain of the Militia stopped its downward path, and the giant jerked and kicked spasmodically, writhing in apparent agony from Lucan's grip. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ever so quickly, Lucan shifted his sword up into the now-falling giant, driving it directly through the behemoth as he toppled like one of  Karana's sacred oaks. To most watching the scene, it appeared that Lucan had dealt the creature a mortal blow with his sword alone, and I appeared to be one of the only ones perceptive enough to notice the deception.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the sight of their sole remaining champion topple, the orcs gave full retreat, charging off into the safety of their lairs in the wilderness. Another cheer went up from the townspeople, at the victory of the forces of Freeport. As the field of battle calmed, both factions of Freeport's defense began the solemn duty of caring for their wounded and collecting their fallen. The casualties were high indeed for the Militia, as they had been involved the longest, and spent most of the beginning of the attack panic-stricken and confused from the ambush. The Knights of Truth had managed to escape with only a few seriously wounded, and only one dead. As we uncovered our sole fallen knight, a gasp escaped by lips as I recognized him to be Sir Fredrick. As his body was lifted, his mortal wounds were inspected. Only two wounds were on this brave champion of justice, a slender slash across his back and a single perfect line across his throat. There were no cuts of bruises upon his arms of hands, to show that he might have tried to fend off his attacker. Someone of great skill, wielding two blades simultaneously, had caught this man off-guard. As I surveyed the field of battle, only three men were holding two weapons. Merko Quetalis, who was hardly a suspect, the guard wielding two daggers, who had been one of the first victims of the giant, and Sir Lucan Dlere. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I remembered how Fredrick had mocked Lucan before, and thought how the tyrant would never have allowed such an insult to go unpunished. As he sheathed now his two finely crafted longswords and went about the business of returning to the fanfare and cheers of the crowd, I glared after him, and made a silent vow that some day, somehow, I would gain revenge for my fallen companion, the latest in a long line of Lucan's innocent victims.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When all was said and done that night, the taverns were overflowing with drunken guards, all celebrating their victory amidst the adoring townspeople. The Knights of the Hall, however, refrained from that sort of entertainment, and still had to face the townspeople who still despised them, and the rule of the Tyrant Lucan who still held power.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I chuckled slightly, having cleaned up and rested over the night, when I returned along the same road I had tried to set off upon a day ago, for there was to be a gathering of my guild this evening. In the far off lands around the port city of Qeynos, a tribe of Gnolls had been operating, preying off of passing merchants and adventurers. The Silver Hawks were to assemble and aid the forces of good who would eradicate the gnolls the next day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the sun had been up for several hours, I was set for a hard day of traveling across the continent of Antonica, to meet with my guild this evening. I had hoped to move at a leisurely pace the day before, but now there was no time to waste, as I could not miss this important gathering of the Hawks. Funny how things always seemed to stack up like this, I thought. I had secured a horse from the stable of the Knights of Truth, and purchased provisions for my saddlebags for the day's ride into Qeynos.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was hardly surprised when a welcome voice sounded in my head:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello, my brother. Are you ready to begin your journey to join the Hawks?&quot; This familiar voice, that of the leader of the Silver Hawks, and one of my most trusted friends, the honorable Tinsley Blues, who had contacted me via his extraordinary mental prowess over a great distance. I smiled at his contact, and replied:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, Sir. I am ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
