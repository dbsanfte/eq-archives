I agree with most of what the author had to say about pulling, and am posting it here for your comments. This idividual wrote the post in response to comments made by his group while pulling in LGuk for the first time. Here it is:<br>
<br>
**********************************************************<br>
<br>
To the members that were with me during that adventure in Lower Guk last night, I feel I owe you an explanation for my actions last night. <br>
<br>
I hope my performance was satisfactory, but I realize there were a few issues that could have been improved on. So, I shall put down a few things that concerned me, so others whom I may group with in the future shall know what to expect. The following is how I play, my thoughts on what my role in a group is and so forth. I welcome any discussion, comments or criticism of my performance either last night or at any time in the past. I realize I have not grouped with a lot of you, and different groups require different strategies and results. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, so feel free to point out anything you feel I need to work on. <br>
<br>
First, I can be a tank, but it is not how I see myself. I am more of a utility type, in that I have many things I can do in a group. I see my main purpose as a body guard for the casters, and to deal out damage. Other folks are meat shields, and should (in my view) be the main target for the monsters attention while I rip a new backside in the monster. I can tank, and will if the main is getting chewed up to give them a chance for a heal to land, but as soon as they are back to 60 percent or better, I am going to back out and get the monsters attention back to them. Then I will go back to applying the damage when I can. <br>
<br>
Second, I will do what ever I can to stop a runner. My usual method is snare, usually cast toward the end of the battle. You do not root to control a runner, ever. Root is way too unpredictable in its duration, and can be broken by a nuke from a caster. My current snare lasts 2 minutes and is only broken by dispel I believe. <br>
<br>
Third: Caster protection is my main goal, I will do anything I can to protect the casters be they nukers or healers, to the exclusion of all else. I will put my ability to get a mob off a caster up against anyone else’s, with my selection of spells and taunts, there are very few mobs I can not get back on me if I want them. <br>
<br>
Fourth: Crowd control, I am a not a big fan of pulling multiples and then just whacking on them in a massive pile in the center of the group. This makes it hard for others to target the mobs, and for the chanters to do their crowd control they do so well. Typically if I know I am going to pull a multi, I will either snare one if I can, and bring in the others, the slow one will come along, and can be easier to target for the mezz. If we have a pile, I will peel one of them out while the rest of the group all target the same. I will then pull it to the side and root it there, hopefully at a distance where it will not be able to attack the rest of the group when I leave it there to assist on the one they should have nearly finished. I figure why should we get beat on by 2 monsters when we don’t have too. <br>
<br>
Spell casting: Well this was commented on last night by a few folks, that the melee types should not be casting, but concentrate on hitting the mob. Hmm. This is a sticky situation, since I can increase my damage out put with a timely spell over using strict melee. Plus, if I am getting whacked hard, I need to get the monster off me as quickly as possible. The best way for a ranger to do so is to root the mob, and then back out. This is called the Poor Man’s Jolt. Once I root it, the monster will then attack the nearest person, which will not be me, and hopefully a tank, like it should be anyway. If another member of the party is getting severely beat down, I will cast snare, flame lick and taunt, and that will focus the attention to me, giving the other person time to back out for a heal if needed. Stuns were criticized last night as well, but I figure if the monster is not attacking us for a set period of time every few seconds, well that is just less healing that is needed, or a monster that is dead that much sooner. <br>
<br>
Pulling: Well I was pulling in an area last night that I have never been in before, ever. Was my first trip to Lower Guk, and I was a bit tentative in my pulling at the first for a few reasons. <br>
<br>
1. whenever I pull in a new area, I like to find out where all the spawns are, how many are in each spot, and the best paths back to the group. The area I was in last night had 2 distinct areas, an upper and a lower. The lower area had a few fake walls, that shielded the spawns, so that as soon as you passed through, you had the monster in your lap. There were also a couple of areas that had multiples and at that time I had not devised a way to pull singles, given time I am sure I can. <br>
<br>
2. I will not rush blindly into an unknown area just to pull more monsters, this is foolish in my opinion. I like to pull what I want, when I want, have some sense of control of the situation. <br>
<br>
3. I will not risk the group unnecessarily for faster pulls, last night for example I wanted to see how many we could handle before I could push the group limitations. No sense in bringing 4 monsters if taking them down requires us to spend too much downtime afterwards recovering manna and such. <br>
<br>
4. In the past, when I go out to pull, I like to let the rest of the group know I am doing so. I have always used a simple little message to state this “WW”. Granted I could have a hot key saying pulling or some such, but I got stuck with this a long time back and there you have it. I think I was in Wolf form, and when ever I would go out to Fetch a mob, would say “Woof Woof”, which was later shortened to WW. The group I was with knew what I was doing, and if they had any manna issues or buffing concerns, they would let me know and I would hold off on the pull. I try to be very aware of the buffs and manna situation, nothing worse than pulling and getting it back to the group with all the casters oom and the tank’s buffs fading. Not good, been there done that, have the scars. I base my pulling method usually on either the big nukers or the main healers manna supply. They are the ones in my opinion that should dictate the rate of pulling. Perhaps it is time for me to change my procedure on my pulling message, since it seemed to irritate a few last night, and for that you have my apologies. <br>
<br>
5. I seldom talk while pulling, usually I only use hot keys or quick words, usually misspelled. This is due to the fact I am concentrating on the job at hand and so forth. I take the responsibility of pulling for any group I am in very seriously, since a bad pull can ruin the night for a lot of folks. <br>
<br>
I think, could be wrong here, that once I figured out where the monsters were, and the number of them, I was able to increase the speed of pulling a bit. Also with the way the area was laid out, I was cleaning out the areas, then moving to newer locations for prey, but they were farther and farther away. Pulling from farther away is not a bad thing, but if you mess up on your timing, well you could be bringing back something and hit an area that just popped and this can really throw a clod in the churn. <br>
<br>
I hope that explains how I look at the pulling job and my role as a ranger. First and foremost I focus on group safety and survivability. Granted my pulling method may not be as exciting as some, but I have found few places I can not pull once I have practiced a bit. For myself, I would rather have a constant flow of mobs, vs. a trickle then a rush, then a trickle again. Those have a way of catching up to you eventually I have found. Must be getting old.<br>

I wanted to say that I completely agree with this guy.  All of his comments made sense to me.  Far too many people don't understand how a well organized group, paying attention to everyone else, can run like a well-oiled machine, and when someone doesn't play their part, it fouls everything up!  I have been in far too many groups where the tanks get bored, and wander off, doing a poor job of pulling, and bringing back large crowds of mobs that the casters, who are all oom, can't control.  Or where the puller doesn't pay attention, and just goes out and pulls to his hearts content, bringing back mobs when everyone is low on health AND mana.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough ranting.  I think everyone should read this post and understand the puller's point of view.  It would help groups immensely! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would like to add one thing, though... if a ranger or pally or some other non-pure caster class is using spells, and not going oom constantly so they can't do their main job, leave them be with their casting.  Unless of course they are interfering with things.  When I played a ranger at one point, occasionally casting was the butter on my bread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It broke up the monotony of tanking, for me.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents worth, here.<br>

He knows how to play. Everyone has a job to do in a group. When one fails in their assignment, the entire group will more than likely die.<br>
<br>
When I play Goss, I never try to use any spells during battle. I am a backup healer and prebattler buffer. I try to save  my mana for those times. I will repeatly stun a target if I am fighting a spell caster. This I believe in the long run saves down time by stopping incoming damage before it happens. Also, I will at times cast root to stop multi mops when snare is not available.<br>
<br>
Everyone has a job and should know how to do it. The Hawks, I beleive, are some of the best players around, and as of to day I have never had a problem with any of you. (I would say you're all professionals, but who gets paid for playing EQ?)<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>
