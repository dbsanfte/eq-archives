<br>
And so the chase began. Sweet love notes arrvied at incredible moments, finding her in the most unusual locations. Robyn could not help but give in to this new game and began to reciprocate the flirtation. She found out where Grendl would be and would send secret messengers to him to deliver disgustingly sappy messages to her ardent admirer. Innuendos flew between the two would-be lovers. <br>
<br>
On one starry evening, when the two were resting after an adventure, Robyn jokingly whispered to Grendl, &quot;Ya know, Master Grendl, I just might marry you for MistMoore drums!&quot; . Grendl replied, &quot;If that is what it takes, you will be mine Robyn Sheyoshke!&quot;<br>
<br>
Robyn never took Grendl's devout admirations to heart because she knew the ways of thieves. They will steal your heart, and then when they catch you, the desire for the next acquisition takes hold, leaving your emotions crumbling to dust. Robyn knew this. She should. She is descended from a long line of thieves.....<br>
<br>
Robyn's mother was a Lady in Waiting to the Queen of Feltwith when she met Robyn's father; or rather she fell on him. He was &quot;removing&quot; excess jewery he felt the queen did not need. Robyn's mother was returning to her magesty's chambers when she tripped and stumbled onto the gorgeous rogue who was opening the Queen's secret vault in the floor.<br>
<br>
It was lust at first sight.<br>
<br>
He chased her for weeks until one morning, the Queen's lady gave into tempation and succumbed to the wily lover's way. The torrid love affair lasted for months. She found out he and his family were founding members of &quot;The Hand&quot; . The thought of being with such a dangerous man made the relationship even more exciting and passionate. Then one day, she began to feel ill and discovered she was with child. She approached her paramour and told him of her condition, expecting an honorable proposal (after all, he professd his love to her countless times.) The thief gave her a brilliant smile and said he would most certainly take care of her. Kissing her passionately, he left - and was never seen again. In disgrace, Robyn's mother was banished from Felwith, penniless and pregnant.<br>
<br>
Robyn's mother had no other place to go then to her sister's home in Kelethin. Her sister was a bard and immediately took Robyn's mother in with no questions. She cried her eyes out for days until the first gift came not 3 days later. A lovely gem encrusted goblet that was worth a small fortune. Robyn's mother knew that this was how her lover planned &quot;to take care of her&quot;. She put a grim smile on and went about preparing for the birth of her child....<br>
<br>
Thieves cannot be trusted - not with your heart. Robyn never forgot this rule. Not even with the stunningly handsome Grendl. Not even when he proposed... <br>
