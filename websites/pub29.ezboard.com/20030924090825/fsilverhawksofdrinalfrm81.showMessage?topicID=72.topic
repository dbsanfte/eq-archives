I can remember the very first time I saw screenshots of Corellia. Golden beaches, exotic plant life, and skies that contained a harmonious mixture of purples, blues, and pinks. I knew at that very moment that Corellia would be my homeworld, the planet that would nurture my mining and droid engineering business. I had high hopes for Corellia, and after visiting Coronet and the surrouding areas for the first time today, all my expectations have been exceded far beyond my wildest dreams.<br>
<br>
Upon entering Coronet, I was greeted by a group of tremendous skyscapers. If you get one impression of Corellia that you won't get on any other planet, it's that the cities are enormous. Extending as far as the eye can see, Coronet appears to be a mecca for both the aspiring business man and the lonesome traveler out for a days stroll on the absolutely magnificent terrain. I still can't believe how beautiful the planet is. The planets and moons above are awe inspiring to witness above the swaying wheat fields and the curvacious trees.<br>
<br>
Well done devs, well done.<br>

I visited Corellia, more exactly Coronet and I make a point of telling you that the city look like the one I had in my imagination. Holo, please don't play with my brain without my authorisation.<br>
Coronet is beautiful, large and in the white and bluish colours . Moreover I've only found some arts bugs but nothing really disturbing.<br>
I am not yet completely familiar with his organization, but it quickly will become one of my favorite cities as well as Bestine.<br>
Only small reproach, I would like that the cantinas are different from one planet to another. Just like a Pub, does not look like a coffee or a bar.<br>
I go back there and thank you for your excellent job, guys.<br>

Unreal.... just unreal...<br>
I'm crossing Corellia in the early morning... The sun just barely starts to peak above the horizon as I trek across a plateau. <br>
<br>
Suddenly I hear the sound of distant thunder... It rolls closer until it starts to rain. For a while it was only a drizzle, but it rapidly became a downpoor (eww... stinky wet Wookiee). The thunder boomed around me as the rain literally was so bad I could hardly see... Eventually the clouds parted and with the early morning sun, the hills glowed a redish orange color as the thunder could be heard rolling in the distance.<br>
<br>
Almost brought a tear to my eye... Absolutely amazing... Devs... I'm truly amazed and in awe.<br>

Thought id just repost my first steps onto Corellia that i wrote in the focus thread. I needed to represent my positive reaction to Corellia, since my first focus thread post was skewed somewhat negatively.<br>
Ive been complaining about the state of the skies for awhile now. Corellia gives me new hope.<br>
I finally saw a beautiful sky on corellia that was more whitish  / yellowish in tone with wispy clouds! A great change from the standard blue / pink ive been seeing.<br>
<br>
The city of Coronet is awe-inspiring. I got of the shuttle transport fresh from Mos Entha. I even had to change my shoes because they were so dusty and full of sand. Actually, i changed them because my reptile skin boots seemd to fit my new environment better than the open-toed sandals i was sporting in the desert.<br>
Running through the Starport halls i could hear the bustling mumur of the metropolis that is Coronet! It felt alive. My first shock was rounding the corner near the travel terminals to see new sentient creatures that i have never seen or heard of. I saw this bipedal bear like creature having a full on conversation with this horse/jackal standing on hooven feet like Pan. Later, someone far more versed in Corellia lore informed me these were Dralls and Selonians.<br>
<br>
As i rushed out of the cramped starport into daylight...Coronet hit me like a ton of bricks, literally. The construction of this city is amazing. I spun around and had to crane my head farther, and farther back just to take in the skyscrapers. Thats right, skyscrapers. Beautiful, glimmering skyscrapers reflecting the setting sun. Public parks littered the streets...huge fountains and statues filled the square...i was shaken by the roar of a huge bonfire only to discover it came from two huge vats of blazing, firey splendor. These were some form of noble, yet aggressive monuments to the city.<br>
<br>
Just outside the walls of this great city, i noticed the cloud darkening, the sky turned dark and gray, and i heard thunder roll. That made me smile. When the first drops of rain fell, and then turned into a downpour with increasing peals of thunder, my smile grew.<br>
<br>
Im very wary at this point because all the wildlife is completely foreign to me..completely new. I have no idea what is dangerous or not. Unlike Tatooine where i know to stay away from a Dewback when im by myself. I had heard stories of killer bunnies, so i was cautious. I then spotted a Gurrcat. I walked very slowly towards it to get a better look. I was fascinated by the way it would stretch its back and clean itself, like a real cat. The animation was perfect. Then i heard this blood curdling roar from this beast that knocked me back in my chair! My nerves were already jittery from the everpresent thunder and the eerie tone of the rain....so i ran. I ran so far away.<br>
<br>
Im headed to the snowcapped mountains to the West. Im dying to see some form of snow.<br>
<br>
Corellia, my home planet, i love you.<br>

I think this is the best &quot;unveiling&quot; of a planet so far...Corellia looks great.<br>
<br>
The terrain is incredibly diverse. I traveled through golden wheat fields, a forested river valley, a ravine broken desert, and scrub covered hills. Coming up a hill out of the river valley and looking down on the steel skyscapers of Corenet was magnificent.<br>
The Flora is also something to behold. The color is perfect and the swaying of branches and tall grasses just makes it all so real. The flowers were amazing and I saw at least 3 different kinds of trees.<br>
<br>
Corenet really feels like a metropolis. Even with its size its pretty easy to navigate although like any other big city its easy to get lost in when your first starting out. Overall Corenets layout is good and makes sense. I would like to see a couple xtra mission terminals added however.<br>
<br>
I played long enough to witness several cycles of the night and day system and it looked very good. The first thing you'll notice is how beautiful and incredible the sun is, it takes your breath away. The planet/moon in the night sky looks like it has great potential, other than that there is nothing else very noticable about the night sky. The day sky looks pretty good, and I did love the downpur that I did witness.<br>
<br>
The creatures looked great. Missions were not performing properly as they would disappear and give you a failed mission notice as you came near the mission waypoint.<br>
<br>
I was also impressed at how stable the server was and how the framerates were very good in Corenet. All in all, a very good first day, Corellia looks spendid.<br>
