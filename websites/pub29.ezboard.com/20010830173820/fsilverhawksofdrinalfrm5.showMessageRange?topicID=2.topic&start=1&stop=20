So you are interested in becoming a Silver Hawk? There are a few things you should know. <br>
<br>
The Silver Hawks take life in Norrath very seriously. We respect the rules Verant has set forth and we respect the other inhabitants of Norrath. We believe in brotherhood first and foremost. The Silver Hawks are our family and we look after each other. It is the trust we have in each other and the honor that we show our brothers and sisters that make us a very close knit guild. <br>
<br>
Recently we went through a period of &quot;cleansing&quot; where we stopped all recruiting and removed some members. This was a very difficult time but it has made the Silver Hawks a much stronger guild with tighter bonds. We have learned from what happened to the guild in the past and do not wish to repeat it so we have come up with some guidelines to recruiting new members. <br>
<br>
First, you must have a member of the Silver Hawks sponsor you. If you haven't been referred to this site by a member already, you will need to find a Hawk who will spend some time with you and become your sponsor (see step 5). <br>
<br>
Steps necessary to gain membership:<br>
<br>
1.  Be at least level 15.  You may also have as many alternates invited into the guild but they must be at least lvl 10.<br>
<br>
2.  Visit the website and read about the &quot;Zero Tolerance Policy&quot; [a.k.a. &quot;ZTP&quot;] ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://silverhawks.freeservers.com/zerotolerance.htm">silverhawks.freeservers.c...erance.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> )and &quot;Guild looting guidelines&quot; <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.intad.com/looting/">www.intad.com/looting/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
3.  Make your acknowledgement on the messageboard on the thread &quot;Guild Policy Acknowledgment&quot; <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm4">pub29.ezboard.com/fsilver...drinalfrm4</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  Please leave your member name and email address there.<br>
<br>
4.  Make a post introducing yourself to the guild, (an example can be found at the bottom of this message).  This should include what you would expect from the guild and what you can contribute to our family.  Post this on the messageboard on the thread &quot;Prospective Members&quot; <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm5">pub29.ezboard.com/fsilver...drinalfrm5</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
You would want to do this not by chosing 'reply' but by choosng 'new topic' above.<br>
<br>
5.  Impress yourself upon a well established member of the Hawks and gain a sponsor.  They must then post pledging their sponshorship of you as a reply to your introduction on the messageboard on the thread &quot;Prospective Members&quot; <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm5">pub29.ezboard.com/fsilver...drinalfrm5</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  If you do not have a sponsor, you can search Hawks online by typing: /w all Silver Hawks.<br>
<br>
You would want to do this not by chosing 'reply' but by choosng 'new topic'.<br>
<br>
6.  Email Lady Adiile (swell@lvcm.com) with your information and desire to become a member<br>
<br>
7.  Lastly, create an account and sign-up for the guild Roster at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com">www.guildmagic.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  Once you have signed up, then you will be added to our roster as a Recruit.  Once you have been accepted into the guild, you may then be moved to our Members section.<br>
<br>
Once these steps are complete, an officer can verify that you are indeed qualified to join the Silver Hawks.  They will then let you know by email or in game.  You will then be invited to the guild.<br>
<br>
Please be patient. The officers can get very busy at times.  If for some reason you don’t receive a response within 3 days, please feel free to post again or seek out an officer in game.  <br>
<br>
Adiile and Bevan and  are recruiting officers and can answer any questions you have.  If you can’t find them ask any officer (see the officers listed on the home page). <br>
<br>
Please take some time to check out the website, especially the &quot;Calendar of Events/Raids&quot;, and &quot;Message Board&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Silver Hawks are here to make life in Norrath more enjoyable and we look forward to having new members.<br>
<br>
Good day to you friend,<br>

Hail all and well met!<br>

Loyalty to the guild and its members is first and foremost!  Silver Hawks must all work together toward the common good of us all.

Welcome to our web page and hopefully, welcome to the Silver Hawks!  Email me with any problems/concerns at sirrengate@hotmail.com.  <br>

Fare thee well!<br>

**** EXAMPLE MEMBERSHIP LETTER ****<br>
<br>
Greetings Silver Hawks!!<br>
<br>
I wish to introduce myself as a prospective member to your esteemed guild. <br>
<br>
My name is Ryelle d'Ain Ohtara, a human Paladin female of the 25th Circle, Servant &amp; Follower of Mithaniel Marr and the Light.<br>
<br>
I have been monitoring your website and message boards since before the Yuletide season after being invited to do so by your guild leader, Darkarr. I had met &amp; fought together with Darkarr in Highkeep. Being a good and true Paladin &amp; servant of the Light, however, I was leary of invitations made by Shadowknights. *GRIN* So, even tho I had been very impressed with his fighting prowess, his attitude, comraderie, generosity, and overall &quot;good&quot; &amp; decent behavior (and yes, I admit, he is not hard on the eyes either *chuckle*) <br>
I was cautious...I waited, I watched. <br>
<br>
And in these past months of observation and consideration, I have seen only further proof of what I originally surmised of his character and of your guild as a whole. That is, a guild where goals of fair play, helping others, &amp; respecting codes of ethics &amp; language- all work towards increasing our enjoyment here and protecting Norrath, a realm we have all come to know and love. *warm smile*<br>
<br>
I have read the recent posts that have explained unfortunate losses to your membership as well. One of the main and recurring issues seems to deal with taking advantage of higher levels for services &amp; support. I swear to you now, that I will never impose my wants or needs on any of your high level members. I am a primary character, and not twinked. I have fought for, worked for or bought every item I own. (which, sadly is not very much...LOL) I have never belonged to a guild yet, although I have received numerous invites and am currently fielding 5 offers of membership. But, have delayed as I have wanted to be able to offer something worthy to a guild I joined.<br>
<br>
I am a Master Blacksmith with a skill of 135 and can make banded armor. I have tried to see as many new areas of this fair land so I could chart maps and research quest information that might be of help to others. However, my smithing has left me very poor, &amp; the more I learn...I realize the less I know....so I doubt I will ever be truly &quot;worthy&quot; of guild membership, at least not in my own eyes. <br>
<br>
Then I read Darkarr's heartfelt message concerning the Silver Hawks and the mission of your guild and I could relate to all he spoke of. I too had come to Norrath seeking to level, accumulate goods and &quot;finish the game&quot; as fast as I competively could- as was the goal in all other RPG's I was used to. However, EQ is my first online RPG I have played. All of a sudden, there were real people behind the characters, and original goals all changed. <br>
<br>
I think I chose my Paladin as a reflection of the type of person I try to be in RL. I have now found rewards within Norrath that surpass my plat and armor needs. I find now that when running through a zone, I search for &quot;newbies in need&quot;...like those running from wisps with non-magical weapons where my Lay of Hands has saved them from running back from another continent because they forgot to bind themselves in their eagerness to KILL!! LOL Or being able to use my maps and charts to aid anothers travels or help retrieve their corpse. I even hoard low level items to pass on to others (that don't beg for help) as I remember how much such kindnesses, even that leather skullcap at level 6 (hehe) meant to me. <br>
<br>
Instead of a game, Norrath has become just a different part of my life where the same values of friendship, goals, work, and &quot;the golden rule&quot; apply. I wish to find such a group of like-minded friends, and I believe I have done that with the Silver Hawks. I have currently only met 2 members of your guild thus far (including Darkarr), but am using the /who all Silver Hawks command now anytime I log on to see if any guild members are near so I can meet them. Haven't been successful yet, and now that I am currently in Tox Forrest I doubt I will meet more of you til I sail back to Antonica.<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to meeting all of you and being able to group and fight with similar levels. I would be very happy to assist with any blacksmithing needs, information, etc. that I could provide. Please feel free to send me a tell anytime.<br>

I am a monk of the Iksar race but I shun away from the evilness that is the mainstay of my sisters and brothers.  I am looking to help cure the world of Norrath of the evil that has taken hold by helping those in need at the risk of my own life.  I am being sponsered by Oliff McCleod who has been like a brother to me.  I already hold dear those tenants set forth by Silver Hawk guild and hereby obligate myself to the utmost to keep them.<br>

I have watched him grow thru the hard life in Norath.  I feel he would be a contributing member of the MIGHTY HAWKS and stand Firm in our beliefs.<br>

Since I have known this young monk, he has had service before self in mind and It is for this reason that I, Oliff McLeod (shammy of the 22nd winter) am proud to sponsor him as a HAWK.<br>
