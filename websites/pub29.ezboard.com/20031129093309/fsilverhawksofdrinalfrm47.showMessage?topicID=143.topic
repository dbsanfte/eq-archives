<br>
The hole is a very good xp dungeon- provided that you know what you're doing. Before I can start this, you need to know how to get into the hole.<br>
<br>
Before you know that- a good corpse recovery mule is a rogue under brell, who will be aggrod by 1) cazic factols in the tower 2) ratmen.<br>
<br>
Entering<br>
There are four ways to get into the hole. The first one is a key for 120pp, or have a rogue lpick the door. There is also clipping, one point is in the middle of the door, facing it you will see a rock slanted to resemble a /, . Swim to where the comma is and clip into the rock by crouching. The second is a rock on top shaped like a bent finger. Crouch under and clip through it and drop down over into the water and swim through.<br>
<br>
*Advanced entering for raids*<br>
There is a way to circumvent that 10k fall. It's rather difficult, however. First you must insert a corpse recovery mule via docks(later) to the hole bottom. He must then wait there for mobs to clear by and then say to the raid 'clear'. Then there is the way to change the 10k fall down to 800 normally. Simply jump before you fall into the hole and you will fall for 600-900 points of damage. In order to do this, rune enchanters for drop in and cast celestial heals before people jump. They will all land in the same spot, which has a wanderer crossing by(I believe when yael is down, and Nortlav the Scalekeeper is up). Cels will give them a bit of hp after they land and EVERYONE must swim into the water pool until everyone has inserted.<br>
<br>
Areas<br>
There are a few safe areas in the hole, they are such:<br>
Entryway- the worst xp spot in the zone is the foyer. There is a safe spot where you jump up onto the ledge all the way forward and can stand there. You can bind on the broken, and slippery pillar safely.<br>
<br>
Halfpipe- To reach the halfpipe simply proceed forward from the entryway and hug the left wall until you drop into a U shaped pit that has a ramp leading off of it. That is the safe point, anywhere else in the castle/halfpipe yard will aggro and often wipe out groups.<br>
<br>
Jail- From halfpipe, hug the left wall and pass through into the castle. Keep hugging the left wall until you pass through the second opening into a hallway that is a T intersection. Take a right, and walk down into the stairs area. The landing etc is clear of patrolling mobs.<br>
<br>
City- This area is reached by taking a left instead. It's a city, and as such is very big and confusing to pull through. I do not know of the safe point within the city, but I am sure that one exists.<br>
<br>
Docks- Proceed through the nightmare that is navigating the city area and you will come to the docks. This is the second insert point for the bottom of the hole. To go down, walk straight out from the falls and into the water. If you want to pull to here, there is a V shaped area of land and a rock golem patrols that and the docks. You can pull into the water from here, but this is not as good as the jail hall for pulls, nor nearly as easy to reach.<br>
<br>
Tower- The tower has cazic-thule diety guards surrounding it. Commander Yarik is here, and the cast here is mainly 49 to 54. To reach it you can use the docks-drop method and hug the left wall, or you can try to find the ramp down in the city. This is a difficult and dangerous spot: the wanderers are highly resistant to mezz, and some can only be mezzed with Glamour of Kintaz.<br>
<br>
Yael / Scale Keeper<br>
He's up right in front of the door that resembles the mouth of something's head. The door is locked. I am not sure if yael will aggro during drop down method if you don't invis to lower aggro radius, so it's wise to keep it up.<br>
<br>
Loot<br>
The hole is especially good for the loot. All of the elementals have a chance to randomly drop loam encrusted armor pieces. They vary; some are excellent for enchanters only and others good for all casters. The boots for instance are 8cha 8agi 8dex ac4. Imbued Granite Spaulders are good for any tank, despite the huge weight- they come from rock golems and ratmen... Smoldering Brands drop off the caster elementals/ratmen, and mudman enforcers come from the rock golems.<br>
<br>
The best place to fight is the jail hall, followed by the halfpipe pit. You can also do the tower, however, that is often a pain to reach and hard on the chanter.<br>

<br>
Exp hunting:  Some people have had success soloing here at the zone. I think the trick would be being able to handle more than one at a time since they're pretty close together. I've never tried it, but there is a VERY substantial exp bonus in here, so even a single group hanging out at the zone will get fantastic exp and a chance at some nice items. All in relative safety since the zone is very close to the first mobs.<br>
<br>
Epic Drops: A hint for those in guilds that need a lot of epic drops. My alliance got four Kirns (for shamans), six Kindles (for chanters), one Keeper (for pallies) and three Jaeils (for rangers) in four days of raids. We did this by making one big raid that took us all the way in on the first day. Then, we had a mage with CoH and a druid bind and camp at the safe spot to the right of Kirn's tower (as you face it) that overlooks the waterfall. Everyone else gated or ported out. The next evening everyone regathered and the druid grouped with the mage and ported out and grouped people to be CoHed in. We managed to fit about 30 people on the safe ledge without agroing anything, plenty for a successful raid here. This way you can get as many epic fights as you need without having to go through the long fight to this point more than once.<br>
<br>
Kirn's Tower: The tower where Kirn and Kindle are found has only a very few mobs that aren't ghosts, and those few are quest mobs that are non-kos. We used invis to undead self and group spells and potions to get the entire raid up to Kindle's room without fighting a single ghost. Then because two in that room are quest mobs, only one other agroed when invis to undead dropped.<br>
<br>
Maps: There are *fantastic* maps available at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~berjd/hole/">www.bol.ucla.edu/~berjd/hole/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> which have all of the mobs and their paths indicated, as well as what type they are. I (a shaman) guided a ranger/sk pulling team who had never seen the zone before on what to pull to get us all the way through the zone, based entirely on exploring the zone myself and using the maps during the fight. These maps are amazing! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.showPrevMessage?topicID=143.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.showNextMessage?topicID=143.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.emailToFriend?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.threadControl?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=143.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub29.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm78">EQ Welcome Center<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm75">General Discussion<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm5">Advancement<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm68">Comings and Goings<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm17">CO Stories of the Silver Hawks<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm45">Historic Topics<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm69">Other Worlds<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm40">EQ Guild Members Forum<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm83">Help Wanted<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm47">EQ Resources, Strategies & Trades<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm34">EQ Raids, Events, and LFG<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm50">EQ Allied Adventures<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm81">SWG General Discussion<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm51">DAoC Archives<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm27">EQ Archives<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm79">Test<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm84">Hawk Raiders</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A0B0E0>- </font><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/bsilverhawksofdrinal>Silver Hawks</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm47>EQ Resources, Strategies & Trades</a> <font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href="http://www.silver-hawks.org">Silver Hawks</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
