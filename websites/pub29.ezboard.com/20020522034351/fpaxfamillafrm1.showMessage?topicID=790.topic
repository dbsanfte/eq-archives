In both of the raids, the low end group has died, and relied on the high end group to come rescue them. So, I went to work last night brainstorming, and I think I came up with an answer.<br><br>If you can shoot big holes through this, please do. If you can't, then I think I'm going to make a test run of this sometime soon. Here is how I propose a raid of this type should be run....<br><br>1) Set a maximum number of people per level range for the raid. For instance, for Dalnir's Crypt, only allow 18 peeps from the 25 to 35 range. That would allow for 3 full groups in that range; sufficient, I think, to hold down the first level of the dungeon. Then only allow 12 to 18 peeps from the 35 to say... 42 range. Allow these peeps to hold down the 2nd floor. And then of course 6 to 12 high end peeps to hold down the 3rd floor. Of course, these numbers will vary from raid to raid and with the amount of enthusiasm shown for the raid. The point of this is to keep full groups that will be able to support each other. In this manner, you don't over camp a floor (and thus force peeps to want to go to areas that they can't handle) and you don't leave it undercamped either (thus allowing for them to be overwhelmed). When the raid starts, the group leaders should pick their own team, one team at a time, with preference to those who want to work together and levels. Once groups are formed, then assign an area (whether it be 1 room, or a section) of the dungeon for that group to contain. <br><br>2) Each group leader will designate someone in their group to be the 'looter'. This person should be someone who has alot of strength, or does not actively fight. They will collect all the loot, with autosplit off, for the group. After the raid, they will hand over all loot to the raid leader for division.<br><br>3) Have a 'Roving' group - one that understands they probably won't get any xp on the raid. Their job will be to support groups in a tight spot. They should have at least 1 rezzer, 2 tanks and 1 evac'er. They will go from camp to camp lending assistance where needed and rezzing.<br><br>4) Before the raid even starts, we should have at least 3 to 4 volunteers for group leader. These people should cover the whole spectrum of raid levels and they will be partially responsible for ensuring the raid goes smoothly. Before the raid, they should print out maps of their area of the dungeon, get details on their area as to level of mobs and drops, etc... It will definantly be their job to contain their group in a certain area.<br><br>5) When the raid is first started, the support group will go in with the first level group and clear the level with them. Once their area is clear, they should be strong enough to hold it. Then the support group will go back to the beginning and help the next group in until the first level is situated. Once the whole first level is secure, then the next floors groups will go in, as a whole into the next level. Then the process should be repeated.<br><br>6) A raid length needs to be established also. Too many times, otherwise ok, groups have been severly handicapped by one or two members leaving. If members are told in advance the raid length, and they still attend, they should be able to stay the full raid time. If they have to leave earlier, the raid leader should try to fill in the gaps with other broken groups or late comers. I believe ideal raid length should be 3 to 4 hours for now.<br><br>------------<br><br>Well, there it is. Thats what I came up with at work. If you can shoot big holes through it, go ahead and have at it. Show me what needs to be improved. I'm not necessarily concerned with how &quot;normal&quot; raids go, I want to know what you think of this method.<br><br>If all goes well, I would like to try this method on Befallen. I know its a newbie dungeon, but it will give me a safer chance to try this method out. Anyone who goes on that raid must understand that its for a test, and you probably won't get any xp, or good loot from it. It will be strictly for fun and learning.<br><br>Your comments are welcome.<br><br>Yours, Suntoucher. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#66CCFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/bpaxfamilla.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=haschel>Haschel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#000099>(3/30/02 12:04:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=790.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Raiding Redemption....</span><hr size=1> Just one comment, my suggestion for the roving group:<br><br>1: Cleric - Kinda obvious, you need a rezzer in this group.<br>2: Warrior - Someone big to take damage or offtank<br>3: Warrior/Shadowknight - A good taunter<br>4: Monk/Rogue - Corpse dragger<br>5: Wizard/Mage - Someone to quickly finish off enraged/weakened mobs<br>6: Shaman - Buffer and auxiliary healer<br><br>Of course, you can substitute a bard/chanter in there for crowd control. <p><center><img src=http://members.aol.com/lord1sephiroth/EverQuest/Galford width=260 height=140 alt="Galford 0wnz j00"><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49980>Haschel Spinningfists</a><BR>52 <b>Disciple</b> (+1 AA)<BR>Former Officer of the Sons of Tao<BR>Officer of Pax Familla<BR>"1337 speaking, trash talking, random babbling Jerichoholic hentai for the new millenium..."<BR>"I will stain my hands with your blood!" - Geese Howard<BR>"Now is the time to choose!

Do we have that many people in pax for that many groups?<br><br>second.  the raid lengths, by the time we have the area's clear from the support groups for groups to proceed to their area's, the raid length might be 3/4's way over.<br><br>that is all IMO though.<br><br>i would like to propose another way...<br><br>I recomend that we get a list of *ALL* members of Pax.  The list is sent to *ALL* Pax members willing to give E-mail adresses.  This will allow people to look over the list, see who they like and how they think the person had preformed in their opinion, and then the person can be recomended to a certain area of the raid.(ie, the first floor, the BR, ect.)<br>this will help as in the situation that their will be a sufficent amount of level range in one group, and also that there will be a nice time happening rather than slapping the groups together with someone they have never met and might not even like after a few group kills.  this probably wouldnt happen anyway, seeing as we are all one big happy FAMILLA, hehe.<br><br>just a suggestion, from the wise Dumby......er wait....ahhh, forget about it..<br><br>Dumby Dimminglight<br>32nd monk of Pax Familla <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#66CCFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uleomarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leomarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 360<br> <font color=#000099>(3/30/02 4:39:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=790.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Raiding Redemption....</span><hr size=1> Ok, first off I would like to say thanks for the comments.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Haschel: Good idea. I was just comming up with the minimum membership in that group though.<br><br>Dumby: Its not just pax, its pax and swords, and I think we almost have that many people in pax, if we could get the majority of them online at one time. On our ToFS raid, we almost had 40 people show up between the two guilds. I had thought about your 2nd point, and then thought about to the past raids I've been on. On the ones I've seen, its only taken like one hour to gather and form up groups and then start moving in. That would still leave 2 to 3 hours left for the actual raid proper. Of course, one way to shorten the startup time is to form groups ahead of time and/or to have all groups move in at once, and just drop the groups off as they reach their area. Its hard to coordinate forming groups before the raid though as many people have a hard time confirming if they are going to be there or not until sometimes the last moment. And then we have a 2nd guild, which we don't have that great communication with, to coordinate with also. But, thats why I suggested getting group leaders to confirm before hand, and then have them get a good ideal as to who they want in their group, with preference given to those who like to work with each other (aka: people that like each other and can work with each other), and also classes and levels.<br><br>And as to the members list, I have tried to keep a accurate members list thrice. The first time was when I first joined the guild and we had a fairly steady membership. I even tried to take it easy on myself and instead of putting their actual level in there, I put their level range (aka: 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc...) so I wouldn't have to update it as often. I couldn't keep up with it. The 2nd go around, I put up kind of a public database where people could add, change and delete their own characters from it. That didn't work either. People stopped updating their own characters, and when they left the guild, people didn't have the consideration to remove their characters from the database. It quickly got out of date with in a few weeks. This third time is the most successful, but its still only marginal, that I have done. And I'm doing it in a combination of having the people email me and adding people from memory. And for people that I have not seen in awhile, or that I know have left, I delete them. I do the same with levels. I update from memory. Thats why I always check when I get online and congrats people on their new levels. So, what I'm long windedly trying to say, is that its damn near impossible to keep a up to date, accurate roster of the guild. Not unless you dedicated almost full time to it.<br><br>As to the 2nd half of that, are you talking about issuing the roster to the group leaders of the raid, or to everyone and just let everyone assign themselves to groups?<br><br>Yours, Suntoucher. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uglotonfrostreaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gloton Frostreaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#000099>(3/30/02 9:40:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=790.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Raiding Redemption....</span><hr size=1> I too have a few suggestions...one to be more precise.

As everyone knows RL sometimes interferes with planned play time. If we are to raid dungeons I don't think the brunt of the work should be put on the person setting up the raid. We announce the intended raid and peeps interested put together there own group of 6 and submit that group with leader and members names and levels to the raid leader at least the day before or a few hours before the event. That way the raid leader can deal with groups and not individuals. If someone in a set group has to go early for what ever RL reason then the raid leader can insert a late comer to their group. If your group is about to loose 2 or more peeps during the raid then is should be up to the group leader to ask for assistance in removing their group to the zone and reorganizing there with perhaps another group in the same quandary. Sunny's idea of a wandering high level group would be perfect for just such a chore. It seems that way the reduced group would not get over whelmed by mobs. If as an individual you know that you will have to leave in 30 minutes or so it will be your responsibility to inform your group leader in order for the group as a whole to get to safety before you camp. I believe this will help with less death due to attrition in single groups. Most who want to continue fighting after one or two peeps leave their group are the ones we have to rez.  So lets play smart and communicate with our groups in this manner.<br><br>Another dungeon that has not been mentioned for raiding is Castle Mistmoore, good drops and for groups 35ish and up. If we have 30's that want to go we can incorporate them with higher groups in singles (one level 30 to 35 in each group) that way they will also be able to go on the raid and will have the benefit of higher levels to keep them safe and show them the ropes so to speak. This raiding level was something we were talking about in guild chat yesterday. The minimum level for a peep to join our guild that is. It is why I personally think that 30 should be the minimum requirement. I know that if I joined a guild at 25 and I couldn't go on any raids because of my level I would feel left out and unhappy. Just my two coppers worth.<br><br>Also someone was talking about starting a higher end guild from 46 and up and it being our senior guild. Not sure how that would help everyone, wouldn't it be separate guild chat and what not? How would that help keep the family atmosphere I have grown to love about this guild?<br><br>Errianna Windfury <br><br>May Tunare embrace our hearts as we have embraced    each others as a family. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uleomarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leomarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 366<br> <font color=#000099>(4/1/02 7:12:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=790.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Raids</span><hr size=1> Well, the higher level guild was misunderstood.
