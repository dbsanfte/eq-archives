Subject: The Class of 2003<br>
<br>
The people who are starting college this fall across the nation were born in 1983. They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan Era and probably did not know he had ever been shot. They were prepubescent when the Persian Gulf War was waged. There has been only one Pope in their lifetime. They were 10 when the Soviet Union broke apart and do not remember the Cold War. They are too young to remember the space shuttle blowing up. Tianamen Square means nothing to them. Bottle caps have always been screw off and plastic. Atari predates them, as do vinyl albums. The statement &quot;You sound like a broken record&quot; means nothing to them. They have never owned a record player. They have likely never played Pac Man and have never heard of Pong. They may have never heard of an 8 track. The Compact Disc was introduced when they were 1 year old. They have always had an answering machine. Most have never seen a TV set with only 13 channels, nor have they seen a black and white TV. They have always had cable. There have always been VCRs, but they have no idea what BETA was. They cannot fathom not having a remote control. They don't know what a cloth baby diaper is, or know about the &quot;Help me, I've fallen and I can't get up&quot; commercial.<br>
<br>
Feeling old Yet? There's more:<br>
<br>
They were born the year that Walkmen were introduced by Sony. Roller skating has always meant inline for them. Jay Leno has always been on the Tonight Show. They have no idea when or why Jordache jeans were cool. Popcorn has always been cooked in the microwave. They have never seen Larry Bird play. They never took a swim and thought about Jaws. The Vietnam War is as ancient history to them as WWI, WWII and the Civil War. They have no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran. They can't imagine what hard contact lenses are. They don't know who Mork was or where he was from. (The correct answer, by the way, is Ork) They never heard: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;, &quot;I'd walk a mile for a Camel,&quot; or &quot;De plane, de plane!&quot; They do not care who shot J.R. and have no idea who J.R. was. Michael Jackson has always been white. Kansas, Chicago, Boston, America, and Alabama are places, not bands... There has always been MTV. They don't have a clue how to use a typewriter.<br>
<br>
Do you feel old yet?<br>
<br>
If you do, then pass this on to some other old fogies... but don't send it back to me, I feel old enough!<br>
<br>
Where's my teeth? Anyboby got some warm milk and Grammy Crackers. I am gonna' take a nap now.<br>

I am still using a 9 channel TY with HUGE tin foil wrapped bunny ears and no cable. Larry Bird was my favorite Player and I acctually had the pleasure of meeting him in mt hometown one afternoon. I used to jam to a vinyl record of Micheal Jacksons BAD album intil early in the morning. We also didnt have a microwave until we moved from our appartments. Atari was the sheezy, and you forgot about Frogger with PONG and PAC MAN.....they were all quality games that i played on my first computer that had the old and truly FLOPPY disk and yes they really were FLOPPY......hehehe....well it brought back some old memories for me as well and i was born in 83 so you shouldnt feal all that old. I hope this helped in some way because even though it seems like a while ago they were truly fun times.<br>
<br>
Iam part of all that i have met...<br>

P.S. The help ive fallen and i cant get up was absolutly hilarious.. i couldnt get enough of it<br>

<b>I Am A:</b> True Neutral Human Thief
<br><br><b>True Neutral</b> characters are very rare. They believe that balance is the most important thing, and will not side with any other force. They will do whatever is necessary to preserve that balance, even if it means switching allegiances suddenly.
<br><br><b>Humans</b> are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.
<br><br><b>Thieves</b> are the most roguish of the classes. They are sneaky and nimble-fingered, and have skills with traps and locks. While not all use these skills for burglary, that is a common occupation of this class.

Larry Bird had to be the biggest thorn in the Los Angeles Lakers side. One of the all time great 3 point shooters! <br>
