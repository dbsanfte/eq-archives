<br>
If there is NOT a set guild policy on GGing members, I would like to create a discussion forum for that issue here and now and then submit our consensus for approval by the guild officers.<br>
<br>
Case in point:<br>
<br>
Having joined early Friday, I announced to the guild Friday evening while in North Freeport that I would like the guild members to know that I am available for GGs and wish to help those in need if I am not in a group hunting.  If the need is dire and the group can survive with out me for a little while, I can bind myself to the hunting site and gate out to aid a brother or sister S.H.  <br>
<br>
My offer of aid was immediately taken up and I was asked if I was terribly busy.  I was selling / buying in NFP - so, no I was not.<br>
<br>
Little did I know that I would be GGing and escorting a guild member for an hour or more to five locations for 10pp.  :-)  I was new and was thinking &quot;Hey, maybe this is normal guild policy - I just didn't know.&quot;  I soon discovered that my Brother SH was also new and did not know what the guild policy was.  There were and are no hard feelings here because we openly discussed the matter and agreed that neither of us knew what was the accepted 'norm'.<br>
<br>
I spoke with a guild officer to ask if this was normal and expected of the druids in the guild and he assured me it was not.  <br>
<br>
The reason I believe we S.H. Druids should draft a policy that is fair to all - is to avoid future misunderstandings like this one.  Just as there is a loot policy that is intended to promote harmony and good will among members - so should there be a policy for GGing - A general guideline.  As providers of this service, we Druids of The Silver Hawks should have some input into any prospective policy.<br>
<br>
What are your thoughts and opinions of what our GG Policy should be and first - do you believe we need guidelines for GGing as we do for Loot?<br>
<br>
If we do have a policy it should provide answers to questions such as:<br>
<br>
How can we Druids signal that we are &quot;open&quot; for assistance? (and yet avoid being barraged)<br>
<br>
How can we spread the task of aiding our brothers and sisters amongst us so that it is not a burdened few who do most of the GGing?<br>
<br>
Should there be compensation and if so, what should that compensation be?<br>
<br>
Should that amount vary with the level of the person requesting and for GG to zones such as DL and IC?<br>
<br>
What is appropriate when a druid is hunting in a group and receives a request for normal transport?<br>
<br>
What is appropriate when a druid is hunting in a group and receives a request from a brother or sister in dire need?<br>
<br>
What avenues should the requester exhaust before calling on a guild druid for an dire GG?<br>
<br>
What other questions need to be answered regarding this issue?<br>
<br>
I will post this to the general discussion board as well because I would like those on the receiving end of GGs to have some input.<br>

I know myself I have hit up the guild a ton and probably owe the guild about half a K from all the GGes, hehe.  What I usually do is /ooc for like 10-15 mins then ask /guild if anyone wasn't too terribly insanely bussy to GG me.  Usually someone will offer and to this date nobody has accepted money from me for the GG.  If it is desparate for some reason I do a /who all GUILD and look for a GG possible person who is either LFG or in some area where it looks like they might not be doing much NFP  G-Fay, ie-non XP or duegon places.  If they say no, then it is cool by me, there are just times when they are in the middle of something and I'm ASKING for a GG not demanding it, it is there choice to GG me or not, they are not required to do it.  If i can't get anyone after this point, I start running. <p><img src=http://hopethisstupidpicworks.homestead.com/files/God.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uaguita.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aguita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(2/24/01 9:03:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Policy for GGing?</span><hr size=1> <br>
 My humble two cents..<br>
<br>
<br>
  I don't ask a guild member for a GG unless they said that they would earlier, am running to join a raid, OR I can not find a gg.  But, I will ask only once, and if not... I, Like Sinudorm will hoof it.  LOL.. I tend to forget about gg's .. I usually just ask for a sow.  /shrug.  Hey, I'm a silly mage.  <br>
<br>
 In a dire need... That's a relative term.  Dire for one is trivial for another.  My suggestion is to have guild members do as much as they can on their own... and then if they can not feasibly do it on their own... Then ask guild.  But, please, only ask once.  If you don't get a tell, then assume people are just busy and can not help you at that time.  <br>
<br>
 This also brings up the discussion of guild burden...  We should ask ourselves... Are we a burden to the guild? Yes or no?  That is a tough one to answer... But... you need to ask it.  Are you giving more than you're receiving?  If you are giving more, you're not a burden.  If it's the other way...  Then you should try to remedy that situation.<br>
<br>
 We are a guild of giving people, and we love to help each other out.  But if you take too much, you ruin it for many, many others... Because people start to feel taken advantage of.<br>

It's always going to be a gray area due to their being so many variables: number of GGers on, their location, your circumstances, etc.  It's a tough thing.  We have a lot of druids and wizards who are very dedicated and answer the call a LOT when a guild member needs to travel.  But hey, if they are in Lower Guk or out in a tough zone and playing an important role in their group, it's not fair to expect them to leave.<br>
<br>
Guild GGers have a responsibility to be as helpful as they can for the important task of helping guildfolks travel and do corpse retrieval.<br>
<br>
Guild members have a responsibility to be as independent and unburdensome as they can be in asking for this aid.  Sometimes you will have to take the boat or get that sow and run.  <br>
<br>
Guild members have a responsibility to not get upset when no GG is available.  It does NOT mean that the guild does not care.  It simply means nobody is in a position to help at that time.<br>
<br>
If you are feeling like you have done your best and are in need of help with none forthcoming, speak to an officer.  I take it as a responsibility as an officer to see to the guild's needs.  If someone is in a real bad spot, there is something of an extra expectation on the part of the officers (in my opinion) to arrange help when nothing else can be found.  Sometimes that MAY mean leaving a hunt for a time to get that person some help.  Officers have done this before.  Our lord Darkarr and some of our leading officers have always been great about taking care of the gulid if at all possible in times of trouble.<br>
<br>
It's a fine line we all walk. We want to help but don't want to be burdened. We want GGs, but can't be a burden to the guild.  ALWAYS ask, but prepare yourself to 'hoof it' as Aguita says, if someone is not available.<br>
<br>
As far as a POLICY?  I'm not sure we can make one but I would like to discuss that further.<br>

When someone needs a gate, they ask in guildchat.  If I can do it, I reply.  If not, I don't.  Simple.<br>
<br>
I have dropped things I was doing to help with a GG and other things, and I do not accept payment for this.  I understand that by helping others, at some point, I will get the help I need.<br>
<br>
I think the problem is that GG's think it's their JOB in the guild to give ports.  It isn't a job but a service we have we can offer, like Clerics and the Rez.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, don't leave a group or camp to just give a GG.  Use your best judgement and help when you can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/ucerenityswiftpaws.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cerenity Swiftpaws</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.free-graphics.com/3danimations/computers/2.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(2/27/01 4:13:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> gging</span><hr size=1> I read this when it was first posted and I have been caught in a situation of I need a ride and one turns into 4 not with this guild, but along time ago with my wizard when she was useful to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , I gg the guild a reasonable amount of time but I also will do a /who all the guild I have a hotkey for that. and if I happen to see that lets say a tank was in Rathemtns and all of the sudden they are in Wfp I assume they died and ask them if they need a ride.

I am sorry but she asked me in Nfp the first time, she is a bard with a quickness song in the 3 days she has been asking for a gg she could've taken the boat or ran to where she needed to go. Now I don't like the boat either but it is there for a purpose and I have used it with every single one of my chars, Druids and Wizards aren't born with the gate ability unfortunately <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
