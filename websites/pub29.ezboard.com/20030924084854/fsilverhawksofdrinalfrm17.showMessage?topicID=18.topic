To others he is the vision of honor and fearlessness.  He represents leadership.  His decisions always seem to be right.  <br>
<br>
There she is.  She could look at him a thousand times and never know his feelings for her.  She sees the icy blue eyes and does not see him as anyone other than the warrior.  He merely exists to plunge his sword into the gut of the enemy, our enemy.  It is not to care for the hows and whys but just to do it.  Kill the enemy.  <br>
<br>
She is there to see that he lives.  Only at the vanquished enemy does she smile in delight.  The symbiotic relationship is without less than trust or more than friendship.  She survives as long as he kills.  <br>
<br>
The blood spattered armor, the sweat, the extreme humidity of the dungeon and the disgusting smell from the bowels of the enemy exposed to the atmosphere matter not.  <br>
<br>
From a place far deep inside, his eyes scan her pristine countenance.  Something stirs within.  All this time, they have been together, and now this.  Why would this happen now?   <br>
<br>
His sword sliced into the giant slimy frog creature yet again.  The wizard was there in his purple robes.  Nearby stood the enchanter wearing his green cloak.  Fireballs shot forth from the Wizards' fingertips, bathing the frog in flame and heat, only inches away from this warrior, boiling his sweat into steam.  Other frogs would appear from the darkness, only to stop, mesmerized by the scintillating magic of the enchanter.  <br>
<br>
He could not help but think of her there, behind him, healing him.  Just when he felt like he could not go on, his own blood spilling onto the wet floor, his breath leaving him for the last time, her healing incantations keep him alive past the final moment.  <br>
<br>
What terror has wrought within his heart by horrible visions of death and destruction?<br>
<br>
It seemed to have no end.  He would turn and see her, casting.  Maybe she would look into his eyes.  What would she see?  He may never know.  Are feelings oblivious to her?<br>
<br>
Over and over again, the frogs would come.  Over and over again, they would be cleaved into little more than chunks of meat by the warrior.  Over and over again, they would be charred to a crisp by the wizard.  Coin and magic items were taken from these remains when time allowed.  <br>
<br>
The carnage could never touch her.  He would make it so.<br>
<br>
He never saw it.  He only saw her, in his mind.  <br>
<br>
They would be holding hands on the desert shore.  One long wave after another would gently crawl up the beach, stopping at their feet.  The sunrise would touch the edges of the clouds, turning them bright red against the dark pink sky.  Her silky dress rippled in the wind.  Their eyes meet.  His arms surround her.  Lovingly, they touch.  His soul is healed.  That is where the wounds are.  <br>
<br>
Yet these visions are only within him.  In an instant, the frogs have surrounded them.  The wizard snaps his fingers and in a flash of light we all were safe atop a spire near the desert.  Melancholy grips the warrior's mind.  He may never see her again.  <br>
<br>
The warrior is lost.  The armor he wears is not made of metals, it is pious morality.   Not the slightest utterance can leave his lips.  She will never know because she cannot know, nor can anyone else.    The warrior must endure the pain from within.  It is his lot. <br>
<br>
Good must defeat evil.  The warrior is at war...<br>
<br>
...with himself.<br>

Alone stood the warrior atop the spire. He is covered in dried blood, coated with soot and sweat. The dry heat of the desert offered no relief. Nearby was the shoreline of the oasis, a walk that would take several minutes. He cared little about destroying the undead that roamed about on his path, no longer bothering him as they once had. Many things that once concerned him so, no longer amounted to any consideration whatsoever. He knew what the problem was. It was unavoidable. He was obsessed.     <br>
<br>
How could it be? She could never love him, or anyone for that matter. One could easily see why at first glance. Her inky blue skin, the white hair and the singeing red eyes are a hallmark combination for a dark elf. Dark elves are inherently evil. The warrior was inherently good. Humans like him could travel either path, but the Dark elf was destined to always be evil.     <br>
<br>
He just wanted to run away, away from her, away from his feelings. He ran to the docks north of the oasis. The little raft waited for him there. He sat down on the rickety vessel. The gnomes, trusted to build intricate machines, must have some a secret for making such a frighteningly simple craft so seaworthy. Soon, land was nowhere to be seen. The warrior was alone. The voice of the ocean tickled his ear with sounds of waves softly gliding into each other. Blue skies turned pink. His best efforts to think of something other than her only made him think of her more.     <br>
Good and evil coexist. The evil within him is always suppressed. Is there goodness within her that cannot be seen? Wanting love and wanting to be loved plagued his mind. All of his life, it had been so easy making friends. Making decisions for others was second nature. Helping people is his life's work. Onward he went, neglecting his own feelings.     <br>
<br>
Selfishly, he wants to be loved. Thoughts of love are always in his mind for his friends and family. Maybe he wants to experience what so many others have. Officiating a wedding made him think of it. Strange that he is so attracted to her. Good in love with evil. Does he want to be in love with her or is he in love with the idea of being in love with her? Pain and depression grip him. If only he could bring himself to talk to her. The wall of hatred surrounding her equals his armor of piety. There must be some way to breach this barrier.     <br>
<br>
Almost instantaneously, as it always seems to happen, the pink sky became totally gray. Rain poured onto him. Lighting flashed. Thunder clapped. The water washed away the caked on blood and soot. The warrior removes his helmet. Raindrops mix with teardrops.    <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/udalerengate.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dale Rengate</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/19/01 11:05:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/udalerengate.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dale Rengate</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Hawks Guild Leader </span><br>  Posts: 920<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(11/12/01 1:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/rustycoleman/dale2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Purgatory</span><hr size=1> Alone on the pilotless raft he drifted.  The air became cold.  Rain turned into snowflakes.  The sun had gone down and all was dark.  <br>
<br>
Inside, he felt just as cold and adrift.  For so long he wanted to share his thoughts with another.  Emptiness within brings solitude but no solace.  The thoughts and ideas that he shares with guildmates are from the surface.  All these years of fighting towards a goal that is still so far away.  He just wants someone with which to share his thoughts.     <br>
<br>
With a nudge the raft that always followed the same path had touched land.  Wind blew the snow around him.  The warrior had many magical items covering him from head to foot.  Infravision from a ring let him see in the darkness.  Magical boots allow faster running than usual.  Magic items help him traverse this barren and frozen land.  His proud advance has eroded into a sullen gait.   <br>
<br>
Part of his nature was persistence.  Quitting was not an option, despite how weary he had become.  This was no time to retire.  Difficulties exist to be overcome.  If things were too easy, he would become soft.  Defenses would come down.  Internally, he would wither and expire.  The warrior has resolved that these walls, no matter how high, must come down.  <br>
<br>
What is it that possesses him so about the cleric?  Either he will come to an understanding or become one with her.  Some way must be found.  His desire for her is the one thing that he has lost control over.  If only she knew how he felt.  Would it even matter?  In his mind, the thought of the cleric would not go away so easily.  <br>
<br>
The ice crunched under his footfall as he ran toward the huge bridge.<br>
Guarded by nearsighted giants that never notice him, he stayed at a safe distance while approaching.  The warrior crossed many hills and valleys throughout the long journey to the icy city in the mountain.  Arriving in the frozen city, he found a watering hole at which to sit and consume libations to ease his mind.  <br>
<br>
This was not the escape he desired, but it was one that he could afford.  Casual talk with the dwarves was nonsensical.  Random thoughts were exchanged.  <br>
<br>
The door opened to the tunnel outside and there she stood.  How could she have arrived here so quickly, let alone find him?  Maybe it is a dream?  In his disbelief, she came to sit at the table with the warrior.  <br>

Mother was just one of a dozen women that took care of me.  Father was simply one of the many teachers of our group.  Early on, the importance of serving Innoruk was instilled within us.  All of us grew up knowing that the will of Innoruuk was all that mattered.  Concepts such as friendship and love were completely absent.  My life was spent competing with my brethren for furthering the goals of Innoruuk.  Innoruuk needed a healer, a cleric, and my special ability for that was recognized.  Feelings of hatred for others that had not worked as hard as I to gain favor of Innoruuk raged inside.  On the day that I was summoned and instructed to finally leave Neriak, maybe there was a sense of loss, yet I hated Neriak.  All of the so utterly useless brothers and sisters that will amount to nothing will stay there forever.  <br>
<br>
Traveling across the lands, my abilities grew quickly.  Knowing that I was near, others would press me into service, healing them while they destroyed worthless creatures.  The profit was paltry at first, but soon became my purpose for being, though I was unaware of it.  Whatever I could do to get an item that would increase my abilities, I did.  Cost of relationships meant nothing, for the will of Innoruuk was what drove me, or so I thought.  I was alone, for the want of Lord Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
I was not blind to the sickening ways of the other races that fought along side me.  Cursing the thoughts of love and friendships, what a waste of time it all is.  Can they not see that the only important thing was the will of Innoruuk?  I had respect, if not appreciation for those that did their jobs well.  I knew that there were certain groups that were nothing less than efficient, and that is where I would put myself.  Even I had gone to some social events of the repulsive humans and the disgusting other races of elves to prove to my Lord Innoruk that my resolve was solid.  <br>
<br>
One day, it all changed.  <br>
<br>
I had been in the dungeon of the frogs.  Our group was very efficient this day.  The boring conversation centered around the leader of the group.  For a human, he looked pitiful in his differing colors of armor.  Obviously, colors were unimportant to him.  All the while, praises were spoken of this warrior, for no one questioned his words, though it was not said to his face.  One would have thought that he was Innoruk!  How lost these efficient yet stupid people are.  Then, in the midst of battle, through the steam and smoke, he looked at me.  I laughed because he was such a mess, covered in his own blood and that of the frogs.  There was something in those eyes.  His eyes spoke to me through the small slit in his helm.  It was amazing that he would not stop, even on the very verge of death.  I sensed that he knew that I was waiting for the final moment to heal him, completely.  Seeing him go on and on, gloriously killing frog after frog, made me admire his precision.  Who is this warrior?  <br>
<br>
Something was wrong with me.  A vile human warrior!  My heart soars every time I heal him.  This can not happen to me.  If my brothers and sisters ever did this, they would be locked far into the dungeons of Neriak for retraining.  Training.  I realized that I have been trained to not feel this way.  Nothing in this world has value to me unless it can further the cause of Innoruuk.  He furthers the cause because he is efficient, being grouped with me.  But that is not the only thing about him.  Suddenly my desire is to know everything about this fearless warrior.  He would laugh in my face if we spoke of anything beyond group tactics.  <br>
<br>
He looks at me again, just as we are surrounded by the frogs.  I laugh at the disjointed efforts the frogs make.  The wizard cast his spell of gate.  Even though we live, the wizard must lack intelligence, for we could have stayed and killed every last one of those frogs.  As I seethe at the idiotic decision of the wizard, the warrior has gone.  He cannot run away from me.  <br>

Where is the farthest place from here?” she thought.  At least the incompetent wizard could atone for his mistake by bringing her to the icy north.  There she would go to the frozen city.  If there were a place to get away to, surely that would be it.<br>
<br>
The warrior soothed himself with brew from different lands as he sat near the ancient table.  Peaceful and at ease, he glanced at the door as it opened.  Through the daze of his mind he could see that it was the cleric!  She approached the table. <br>
<br>
It had only been a few hours since they met, but it seemed like forever.  She could see that he had been drowning his sorrowful feelings with alcohol.  He offered her a seat with the wave of his hand, and she sat across from him.<br>
<br>
In the presence of this warrior, she suddenly felt awe.  It was as if he were more than a human, more than a man.  The dark elf cleric and the human warrior locked eyes.  Unspeakable feelings within her began to surface.  For once, the always-vocal cleric was at a loss for words.    <br>
<br>
He did not now what to make of her sudden reappearance into his world.  It was most unexpected, but quite a delight!  He smiled at her.  “Hail milady!  What are you doing here?” <br>
<br>
There they sat across from each other.  She realized that she could not look him in the eye, if she were to continue.  “Why did you look at me so in the dungeon?” turning her head away from him she replied.  <br>
<br>
“You came all this way to ask me that?” he said, while his one good eye scanned her face for answers.  <br>
<br>
Incredulously she replied, “I did not come here to waste my time with you, milord.”  Her gaze trained upon the fire furiously blazing away in the fireplace on the other side of the tavern.  <br>
<br>
The smile dropped from his face.  “I suspect not.  My apologies, it is just that it has been so long since anyone seemed to want to know more about me other than ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’.  For so long my life has been an endless stream of combat, helping others, traveling and looking for places to hone skills of the blade.”  He paused, thinking of what he would say next.  “Looking into your eyes was more than all that.  It was assurance; knowing that in the face of death, you kept me alive.  Because of you, I could go on without fear.”<br>
<br>
“Fear is such a human weakness.”  The cleric stood up.  “It is loathsome.  For you to feel fear...” <br>
<br>
“That’s just it!” He stood up too, using the table to hold himself steady.  “With you there, there was no fear!  I felt… let us say it was a bond that I felt.”  He closed his eye and wondered if he should say what he really experienced.<br>
<br>
“Bonding?  What is this ‘bond’ you speak of?” she said, knowing that she felt it too.  <br>
<br>
“Milady, if I told you, surely it would set me up for a great fall.  Just as you seem to have no time to waste with me, nor do I have time to waste with you on such silly notions; that me and you could ever be more than what we are now.”  He sat back down, taking a long drink of mead with hope that it would douse the passion he felt.  Seeing her so close and talking to him was unreal.  <br>
<br>
She turned toward him, smiling weakly.  “It was funny to see the frogs trying to kill you, letting you almost die, then healing you.  The frogs always seemed so surprised!  Then…” her voice trailed off as she took a deep breath, “you looked at me.  At first, healing you was what we needed so survive, but then it became what…” she could barely speak, “I needed to live.”  <br>
