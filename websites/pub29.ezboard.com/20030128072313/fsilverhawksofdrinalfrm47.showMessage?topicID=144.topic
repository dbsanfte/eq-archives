<br>
Solusek's Eye, from level 18 to 35...(all i did were the goblins, and one night of EXG hunting for a shield for a friend)<br>
<br>
First, get a copy of the map of this dungeon, so you will know where I’m talking about; I’m not going to get bogged down in giving a whole lot of directions...that’s why Allakazam has mapsites <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Second, either have someone who can root, snare, chain, or engulfing darkness...cuz if you don’t you might as well not even come here. This zone can create HUGE trains of angry goblins, all pulled by one runner. The goblin shamans drop SoW on whatever goblins are close by, even through walls, so be sure to slow any NPC immediately. It is also beneficial to have someone who can debuff NPC's, as the wizzies like to flameshield all the gob’s around them. The spawn rate of every goblin (named or otherwise) is 18 minutes from the time they die.<br>
<br>
Levels 18 to 25; Pull to the rug-room, to...get a puller who has become familiar with the spawns you can handle (1 in the window room, 2 on the ledge above the pit, 2 in the foyer room at the beginning of the clockworks, 2 just across the bridge leading towards kobold spawn, 2 in the room directly after the bridge, 2 in the room just before the hallway to the kobold spawn, 1 in the room to the right of this last room before kobold). Mostly young and cinder goblins, with the occasional flame...you'll get some shamans and wizzies...always clear the wizzies first, then the shamans, then the melee gob’s. Once in awhile, Singe will fly across the bridge, so you have a chance at some nice drops. Loot is mostly silver on young gob’s, mostly gold or 1 plat and maybe FS on the cinder's, and up to 2 plat and a FS or gem (or both!) on the flames. Rug room is great because of the proximity to the zone to Sol B...and escape <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kobold Spawn; basically, you can work this in a group of 22 to 28 and be quite safe...its actually one of the safest camps in the whole game (for some tight loot at that level anyway)...you can get the kobold hide boots or the obsidian shard. Once you clean the spawns between the pit and the last room before the hallway, whack either the Kobold or his PH, take a breather on the landing above the 2 gob’s, whack them, and proceed to pull to the landing. You can pull the rooms between the Kobold and the Pit, or you can pull from the foreman room, and beyond. The 2 gob’s near the Kobold are usually flames or cinders, but sometimes a young will pop. Again, shammies and wizzies spawn here, and more frequently than alot of other places. The Kobold is doable by a full group of 25's, easily I would think. I soloed this area from 32 to 34 and made quite the haul, pulling out just under 100 pairs of boots LOL. The young's don’t give XP at 32 to solo, but some of the cinder's still did, and all of the flames did. At 33, no cinder's gave XP, and most of the flames did. At 34, none of them gave XP, so I camped Kobold and Foreman and pulled from past the foreman room to get some fire and inferno goblin action. The closest zone to Kobold is either Rug-room zone to Sol B OR the one mentioned in the next paragraph.<br>
<br>
Foreman: drops the foreman's tunic and the obsidian scimitar. A full group of 25's can hold both the foreman and the Kobold spawns, and do nicely. Mix in a few pulls from past the foreman room (fire goblins, occasional inferno), and you will get nice XP. Close zone spot so you don’t have to run back through the mess near the bridge and the Pit...look for it on the map. Again, the foreman room only spawns young's, cinder's, and flames, but ALOT of wizzies spawn here for some reason. I were doing this dungeon again, in a group, id work both the Foreman and the Kobold, and pull to the landing where the Kobold spawns. However, some good can be said of the pathing problems in the foreman room...once you get the NPC beaten down, they all attempt to escape out of the room through the door, not the secret wall..and then they just meander about in the hallway while you beat them down. The closest escape from the Foreman is a left hand turn past 2 gobs, into Sol B (this is known as Top-of-Window to Sol B campers). Do some exploring invis, with your map. You'll find it<br>
<br>
Past the Foreman, you can go either right or left (through the secret wall first). Both routes can take you to the Inferno Goblin Captain. You will have alot of cleaning to do before you get into this room, and if you are unprepared can even pull the 3 gobs out of the captain room and/or from the two adjoining rooms, for a whopping total of 11 gob’s. There are 2 spawns before the captain room, usually inferno's or fires. Inside the captain room are three spawns, with the Captain or his PH spawning in the middle. The spawns are always fire or infernos, with shammie and/or wizzie about every third spawn. I went there at  34 with a 41 cleric and a 34 SK and we did well, but were eventually chased from the oom when a shammie spawned outside and dropped SoW on a fleeing mob....it pulled 5 or 6 inferno's back onto us and that was the end of that. The captain drops some nice charred stuff, gaunts and boots. Once you have cleaned the Captain room, pull to there. Remember to have your timer set (18 minutes), and don’t let your healers get low on mana before the next repop. It can get ugly fast. The closest escape is run these nasties to the gnomes...LOL...they are KoS to the gnomes, and unless you are too, no sweat<br>
<br>
Bartender Room: drop down in The Pit, head through first and second doors to the first gob, which is usually a young or cinder. Past him are two gobs, always a flame, fire, or inferno. You can either head left (to the Bartender, Drunkard, and High Shaman and a few other named spawns) or right (to the King and Torturer). The foreman room has two adjacent rooms from which to pull, with two additional adjoining rooms off the left hand side (facing the door out). This general area has 9 goblins, with 2 or 3 roamers. All the goblins in this area are flames, fires, or inferno's. A full group of 28's would wreak havoc, and gain quite the XP. I started soloing this area at about 34, starting with the bartender or his PH (those @#%$ inferno wizards don’t have alot of HP but can deal DEADLY damage). The strategy for either soloing or grouping this area is to get behind the bar without being seen (hug the left hand wall as you enter the room and run to the far left corner just behind the bar). Once behind the bar, you clean the Bartender or his PH, then pull the two in front of the bar. Pathing in this room makes it very nice for feign pulling...the gob’s run perpendicular to the bar, then back to the center of the room, and over to the bar entrance. By that time, you can jump the bar (if in trouble) and the gob’s reverse their path...LOL. Talk about exploits. The bar acts as a wall the goblins can neither see through (in non-aggro) nor cast through. The foreman drops nice gear..drake arms and legs. The closest escape is the rug-room zone to Sol B.<br>
<br>
Solusek Goblin King: Take a right at the two goblins just past the drawbridge door. Down the hall, through the first door, and down hall which seems to go left. At this left turn there is a false wall in front of you...this is a good place to pull to when cleaning the king and adjoining rooms. There is one roamer, usually a Solusek gob, so whack him first. Solusek Goblin's, Solusek Champion, Solusek Shaman, Solusek Wizard...all very nasty unless you are in a full group of 30plus, and have at least two healers and two tanks. I went in there the other day to help a level 30 guildmate get a Ring of Goblin Lords (AC4, +3 int and str)...of course with a level 40 SK and level 41 druid (I was 42 at the time). The four of us cleaned the left hand room (two Solusek gobs), rested a sec, cleaned the throne pit (2 sol gobs and an inf gob), and moved into the throne pit. Anyway...the three gobs remaining in the right-hand room of throne pit proved to be quite a challenge...Sol Champion and two Sol wizzies. We did it, but it was quite a battle. One thing...if you pull the right hand room first, more often than not you pull the throne pit and the left hand room, plus any stragglers, due to pathing in this area. I suggest doing it based on 5 minutes per room (if FULL group is below 32 or 33). If you cant clean at this rate, this area is not for you...you will be overwhelmed and most likely die. If in this area you have a puller who wont listen to &quot;oom&quot; requests....politely bail out. Anyway...the King drops the Ring of Goblin Lords and a worthless (nowadays, with the nice Kunark loot) staff or totem. The Ring is sweet for SK's. If you are nicely grouped, you can pull the goblins from near the left-hand room; down the stairs, right turn (2 gobs-usually inf or fire), through that room door (1 gob-usually fire or inf), and down to the end room which spawns 2 or 3 goblins, one of which is sometimes the Torturer (drops a turquoise eye-patch, nice newbie giveaway...and a box which is 4-slot, small items, 100% weight reduc.) The closest escape is the rug-room zone to Sol B.<br>
<br>
I would talk about the gnomes and such (imp, efreeti, etc), but since I rarely hunt in those areas (drop and spawn rates are wayyyyy to slow)...I wont. Also of note, all evil races are KoS to the gnomes, unless you do some major hunting in Sol B (kobolds)...so watch out. There is a goblin you can sell to if you can sneak (he’s near the left-hand room of the Throne Pit), and a gnome located in the castle (Marfen Binkdirple?) you can buy food and also a Tinkered Bag from (8 slot, all sizes, 100% weight reduc....approx 5200pp, bard 43 charisma 127) and sell to.<br>
<br>
All of these observations are based upon MY experiences...bard, now of the 43rd whole note. I love Sol A...I think its one of the best designed (except or the pathing in a few areas), most fun and definitely most profitable zones (for XP AND loot) in the game. Its also highly under-camped, which is great. If you go there early, and run into a wizzie or shaman you or your group cant handle, shout for help and someone who's camping Gabbie will come and help ya...or should at least.<br>
<br>
Don’t get upset if you fall in the lava...it happens to everyone (I have yet to talk to a person who did this dungeon who didn’t fall in at least once)...ask a druid or bad to lev you and run over the spot you fell in clicking corpse...it will pop up out of the lava. Or carry a jade coffin and have a necro fetch you<br>
<br>
Good luck in this most excellent zone<br>
