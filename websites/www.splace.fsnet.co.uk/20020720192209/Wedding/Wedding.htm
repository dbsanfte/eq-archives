    Yinadriel raises her hand in greeting to the assembled crowd and calls for 
    silence.<br>
    Please guests take seat'<br>
    We are here to see a true story ending ... hmmm or better see how it goes on 
    '<br>
    Once upon a time - long before Norrath existed like we know it today' there 
    were two dragons.&nbsp; More mighty and powerful dragons than the ones we 
    know today,' these dragons were so deeply in love with each other, so deep 
    no one today can really imagine.&nbsp; This love gave them the strength and 
    power to overcome all problems and misunderstandings, they never doubted the 
    love of the other . They understood the other without a word,' simply to 
    say: they belonged to each other'&nbsp; These dragons lived happy together 
    and helped all creatures around them without looking for their advantages in 
    doing so.&nbsp; The aura of love covered all around them and it was a 
    wonderful place to live.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">But not all 
    creatures were happy about the wonderful world around the dragons in love,' 
    there was a jealous Balrog, who didn't like the love of he dragons,' in his 
    evil heart he searched for a way to destroy their love'<br>
    Paaw shakes his head at the evil Balrog.<br>
    He tried to kill those two but his magic was much too weak compared to the 
    powerful love of the dragons, that protected them, he realised he would need 
    very powerful magic to kill them so he gathered a horde of mighty evil 
    creatures around him and together they could kill the dragons in a long and 
    epic battle.&nbsp; They killed their bodies but they couldn't kill their 
    souls so fulfilled with such incredible love.&nbsp; So the evil creatures 
    cursed the souls they should never find back to each other, their souls 
    should live in pain and sorrow forever.&nbsp; The souls were reborn a 
    thousand times in several kind of creatures, always searching but not 
    knowing what they search for.&nbsp; It was really an evil curse that kept 
    them longing and searching for aeons.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In our days now 
    the souls were reborn in Talaz and Priwinn.. They have broken the curse, 
    because they found each other. they felt something special as they met for 
    the first time in Greater Faydark a long long long time ago '<br>
    Paaw smiles.<br>
    But it took them about 54 levels to have the courage to believe that they 
    belong together.&nbsp; This incredibly strong love flows between them and 
    surround all who are near them '<br>
    Grabatz hands Paaw a troll hankie.<br>
    They both have the the souls of those two dragons, helping where ever they 
    can without looking for their advantages '<br>
    Yinadriel looks around.<br>
    Paaw sniffles.<br>
    We are assembled here today in this beautiful setting to witness and 
    celebrate one of the most wonderful adventures that any pair among us can 
    enter upon if there be anyone here who knows of any reason that Talaz and 
    Priwinn should not wed... the door is that way'<br>
    Grabatz smiles.<br>
    Yinadriel listens and could hear a pin drop.<br>
    Paaw smiles.<br>
    Selkie chuckles.<br>
    Yinadriel nods with satisfaction and continues.<br>
    To quest alone is noble. to quest with the one you love magnificent'<br>
    Yinadriel looks at Talaz.<br>
    Talaz, do you take Priwinn to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to 
    hold, in full health and in unconsciousness.&nbsp; In times of full buffs, 
    fine gear and many coins, and in times when rabid and poisoned, empty handed 
    and without a copper to both you names for as long ye both shall live and 
    not have reached lvl60 ?'<br>
    Talaz says, 'I do '<br>
    Yinadriel nods solemnly and turns to the bride.<br>
    And Priwinn, do you take Talaz to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have 
    and to hold in quick spawns and slow, in times of full buffs or none, 
    through 10 000 deaths and resurrections for as long as you travel this 
    world? '<br>
    Priwinn says, 'I do<br>
    Yinadriel smiles upon the couple.<br>
    Talaz and Priwinn, have you brought with you the eternal symbols of timeless 
    unity, rings to exchange?'<br>
    Talaz says, 'Yes I have '<br>
    Priwinn says, 'Yes i have<br>
    Paaw quickly slips a ring to his bro.<br>
    Selkie beams a smile at Paaw.<br>
    Grabatz giggles at Paaw.<br>
    Korudan checks his fingers in case Fendel's been near<br>
    Grabatz is sure Fendel has a good selection of rings for . uhm . 
    emergencies.<br>
    Then Priwinn extend your left hand so that your groom may place upon it the 
    token he bears of his love.'<br>
    Priwinn extends her hand to Talaz.<br>
    Talaz repeat after me these solemn words handed down through the ages: </p>
    <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;With this ring, 
    Priwinn, I thee wed&quot; '<br>
    Talaz Places the token of his love to Priwinn on her finger.<br>
    Talaz says, 'With this ring Priwinn I thee wed '<br>
    Talaz, you must now extend the the hand of your own to bear the symbol of 
    emotion your bride does share'<br>
    Talaz extends his hand towards Priwinn <br>
    Priwinn, repeat after me these solemn words handed down through the ages:
    </p>
    <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;With this ring, 
    Talaz, I thee wed&quot;'<br>
    Priwinn places the token of her love to Talaz on his finger.<br>
    Priwinn says, 'With this ring, Talaz, i thee wed'<br>
    Yinadriel smiles and is happy.<br>
    And now by the authority vested in me by our Mother Tunare with the approval 
    of the Gods above us I now pronounce Talaz and Priwinn married.'<br>
    It is too late to back out now , foolish ones!!<br>
    Talaz kiss your bride'<br>
    Taliin cries over Priwinn.<br>
    Zeksie giggles.<br>
    Saira lowers her head and mourns the loss of Talaz.<br>
    Taredor smiles.<br>
    Talaz Kisses Priwinn.<br>
    Taguro says, 'Woot'<br>
    Rikera says out of character, 'Gratz to the both of you'<br>
    Selkie smiles.<br>
    Jennya smiles.<br>
    Kelthan cheers at Talaz.<br>
    Faywik cheers.<br>
    Kelthan cheers at Priwinn.<br>
