<p><b>Tuesday 30th January, 2002 - All gather to take down the Corrupter</b></p>
<p>With a quick word from Priwinn, it wasn't long before Celestial Rising and 
Omerta were gathered in EK ready for the battle to take down the Corrupter.&nbsp; 
As soon as everyone was ready, Priwinn started her hand ins.&nbsp; All didn't 
quite go to plan though as she was chased back to the hill by two reavers.&nbsp; 
A quick rez from Jennya and she was soon back on her feet and looted the corpse 
for the item needed for the next part of her epic.&nbsp; Thanks to Omerta for 
being so prompt and assisting us and ...</p>
<p align="center"><b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> Priwinn on making another step closer 
to your epic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Thursday 24th January, 2002 - Twilight Sea Armour Quests</b></p>
<p>I have added a link to the Navigation Bar called 'Twilight Sea Armour 
Quests'.&nbsp; After laboriously surfing the net for as much information as I 
can find I have collated it all to give you information of what is required for 
each piece of armour and weapons and who it needs to be handed to.&nbsp; In 
addition to this I have detailed all the ITEMS and MARKS that can be found, what 
creature drops them and in what zone.&nbsp; I hope that as a guild we can work 
together on kitting each other out in this armour, and anyone else that wishes 
to join us in the process.&nbsp; I will keep you posted on here of our success.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 19th January, 2002 - 'Reaver Fest'</b></p>
<p>Today we were invited by Omerta to join them on a 'Reaver Fest' in the City 
of Mist.&nbsp; The turnout was fantastic with almost everyone of the right level 
in CR attending.&nbsp; We duly made our way to the back of the city to the 
castle entrance to find Lord Rak'Ashir awaiting us.&nbsp; This was it, the test 
of our ability to work together with Omerta and Lions of the Heart and with some 
quick planning all pets were brought into action.&nbsp; For the first time melee 
classes had to sit back on their heals and watch as pets and casters went to 
work.&nbsp; We sent in the mages fire pet and it was the job of the three 
clerics to chain heal it with the assistance of secondary healers.&nbsp; When 
pets died more were summoned to replace them, and 15 minutes later the Lord was 
dead.&nbsp; It is good to know that when our Shamans are finally ready to 
complete their epic we now have the force to do it.&nbsp; With a quick reform 
and rexxing of the unfortunate we made our way into the castle and placing 
ourselves in the entrance hall continued to take down everything in our sight.&nbsp; 
The day was a success and congratulations go to the following people who won 
their awards :</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">Kandalf - 3 Book drop 
from Lord Ghiosk (epic)</p>

<p>Call to Arms, and that's exactly what we did :0)&nbsp; On wandering through 
Lower Faydark Paaw noticed that the Tainted Brownie was up on track, so a quick 
post to guild chat and 5 of us dropped what we were doing to be at his side.&nbsp; 
Grabatz, Talaz, Zeksie, Jennya and Kandlaf stood at his side as we were all 
turned into wolves and went chasing the Brownie through LFay.&nbsp; Once caught 
it was brought down without too much trouble and immediately spawned the 
Corrupted which again was taken down in the blink of an eye.&nbsp; This brings 
Paaw another kill closer to his epic.</p>

<p><b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> to Talaz and Kulfi today as they both manage another step 
towards their epics.&nbsp; After a long camp in City of Mist for the Human 
Skeleton Talaz finally got the 3rd part of the Concusion spell - Soul of Mardon.&nbsp; 
Being in City of Mist also proved fruitful to Kulfi as she was allowed to loot 
the three books required for her next stage from Lord Ghiosk which 5 members of 
The Well had just taken down.</p>

<p><b>Thursday 10th January, 2002 - Kael Drakkal Raid</b></p>
<p>We were very kindly invited by 'Omerta' to join them on a raid to Kael 
Drakkal.&nbsp; Our target camp was the Arena and without any trouble at all it 
wasn't long before groups were set up and we were safely there.&nbsp; The 
evening was enjoyed by all and we seemed to have the lucky dice as we were 
winning roll after roll.&nbsp; Out of these 3 pieces of quest armour were 
dropped and won as below :</p>

<p><b>Wednesday 9th January, 2002 - New boots and a key</b></p>
<p>Well after almost 20 hours Jennya and Zeksie were finally in possession of 
'Ring of the Ancients'.&nbsp; A quick trip to West Commanlands to take down some 
Shadow Men for the Shadowed Rapier, pick up 3250 gp at the bank, then off to 
Rathe Mountains with Grabatz and Yinadriel in tow.&nbsp; We weren't the only 
ones after Hasten, Bennyboy a monk from Blood Cult needed to kill him for his 
epic so after bringing him over to us to trade in the bits for our boots we 
assisted him in doing this.&nbsp; Jennya and Zeksie are now the proud owners of 
a pair of Journeyman Boots.</p>
<p>It was quickly discovered that our new warrior Badiek was not in possession 
of the Sebilis key, so a group set out to get this rectified.&nbsp; On reaching 
Trakanon's Teeth we found that a Doom Skeleton was blocking up the spawn table 
so re-enforcements were called for.&nbsp; With the help of Oana the Blood Cult 
warrior we took him down without too much trouble and after recovering Paaw's 
corpse a couple of times from the depths of Trakanon the medallions were soon in 
Badiek's possession.</p>

    What was becoming a long boring Ancient Cyclops camp in Ocean of Tears 
    turned out to be quite eventful.&nbsp; Sitting and watching the time slip by 
    as Jennya, Zeksie and Paaw killed Aqua Goblins, Ogres and Cyclops in the 
    vain hope that the Ancient would spawn, Paaw announced that the Tainted 
    Cyclops was on track so off we went.&nbsp; We managed to knock down the 
    Tainted without too much trouble, but then the Corrupted spawned immediately 
    from it's corpse and this proved a little more difficult.&nbsp; It was down 
    to almost one bubble of health when Jennya ran out of mana, Paaw was having 
    problems casting and soon he and Zeksie had become corpses.&nbsp; In a rush 
    of panic at losing the AC camp we hurried our way back to the island rezzing 
    the fallen and resumed camp once more.&nbsp; The Corrupted headed back over 
    to the island and this time we were more successful in bringing him down and 
    Paaw is now one step closer to his epic.</p>
<p>Fendel and Trepidation were invited to join Blood Cult on a raid to the City 
of Mist and within no time at all Lord Ghiosk had been brought down and the 
three books are now in Trepidation's possession giving us another guild member 
one step closer to his epic.</p>

<p><b>Sunday 6th January, 2002 - Celestial Rising is born</b></p>
<p>Well it is done, at approximately 10pm GMT on the XEV server, Celestial 
Rising was born.&nbsp; After sitting waiting for almost 2 hours for a GM to 
respond to our petition amidst the duelling that was taking place through 
boredom a response finally came.&nbsp; We had a turnout of 15 people which was a 
wonderful start and I would just like to say thank you to everyone involved in 
the whole thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sunday 6th January, 2002 - Guild Approval</b></p>
<p>Well it's 03:00 on the morning of 6th of January and I have just checked my 
email and we have guild approval ... WOOT !!!!&nbsp; Our guild has been approved 
as Celestial Rising, now all we have to do is gather a minimum of 10 people 
together when a GM is online so that the guild can be born.&nbsp; I am 
desperately hoping that later on as we prepare to wipe out Chardok that a GM 
will be about, but i'm not holding out much hope.&nbsp; If not then, then 
tomorrow night for definite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Saturday 5th January, 2002 - Guild Application</b></p>
<p>I jumped on this morning to see if I had any email ... still nothing, so I 
went to check the guild status.&nbsp; It was sitting there showing 'Need 
Reviewing', on going into it the msg said guild name duplicated.&nbsp; I jumped 
online to find no one there, so racked my brains on the suggestions thrown at me 
last night.&nbsp; I have edited it to now read 'Celestial Rising' ... keep your 
fingers crossed and let's see what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Friday 4th January, 2002</b></p>
<p>Well at 8:00pm GMT we all moved ourselves over to a chatroom and a request to 
create the new guild was put through after some initial name problems.&nbsp; I 
later spoke to a GM in game and was told that I need to wait for email 
confirmation although the new guild is showing in the list as 'Initial 
Approval'.&nbsp; Once I have received the email (and was told by another GM that 
it took 3 days for him :0( ) then we need to gather a minimum of 10 people in 
one place for the guild name to be given.</p>
