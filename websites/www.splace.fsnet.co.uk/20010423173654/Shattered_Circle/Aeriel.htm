<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Aeriel is a slight girl, typical of her race,
with long white hair to the middle of her back, braided, and very large blue
eyes.&nbsp; She has beautiful white wings and a delicate figure, being
small-breasted and lithe.&nbsp; She prefers a light blue toga and high-laced
sandals.&nbsp; She wears one of her own feathers on a chain about her neck, the
holy symbol of Aerdrie Faenya.</font><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Aeriel was a gentle girl, in
love with the winds of her birth, given to her Goddess and blessed with magic.&nbsp;
She loves to sing and loves more to soar on the high breezes and drafts of her
home in far away High Aerie.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Her life dramatically changed
one night.&nbsp; While flying alone, she felt a sharp pain in her right wing.&nbsp;
Falling to the ground, she was struck hard upon the head.&nbsp; For many days
and nights she drifted in and out of consciousness, feeling herself on a boat,
then on land, sick and drugged.&nbsp; She felt the darkness of a close space,
some panic, but was never awake enough to know what was happening- only knowing
enough to be afraid.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; She awoke in a small cage, her
wing splinted, her muscles and head aching.&nbsp; It was a mage that had
captured her, an evil man with dark hair and a small black moustache, calling
himself Ronarre.&nbsp; He laughed, saying he had both feathers and blood for
spells and experiments.&nbsp; The young Avariel felt only terror.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; She spent the night in shaking
horror, both from her fear and from the claustrophobia of her prison.&nbsp; A
young servant came to feed her and in desperation she charmed him, the only
spell left in her.&nbsp; He let her out in response to her pleadings and she ran
as fast as she could, her wings unable to lift her, carrying her few possession
with her and leaving a confused young man behind her.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; At daybreak, a wandering monk
found her, bleeding and crying along a road.&nbsp; Will the dark-haired mage
find her?&nbsp; Will she ever find her way home?&nbsp; She does not know…</font><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
