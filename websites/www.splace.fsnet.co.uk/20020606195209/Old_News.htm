    Well what a story this turned out to be.&nbsp; After the misfortune of 
    having the trigger killed on us last time we decided once more to head back 
    to Timorous Deep for Priwinn.</p>
    <p>A fantastic turn out from the guild and a handful of friends from Dreams 
    of Darkness saw us stay as far away from the trigger as possible and get 
    buffed up before going in for the kill.&nbsp; It was a smooth fight and 
    although clerics were OOM at the end and a handful of corpses Faydedar was 
    lying in the sand.&nbsp; The picture on the left was taken at this point and 
    then Priwinn looted up, but then it all went horribly wrong .... the zone 
    popped and we were all thrown out of the game only to come back and find 
    that Priwinn no longer had the water in her possession, but that the trigger 
    was up again.</p>
    <p>A petition was sent in immediately and after much 'bitching' we decided 
    to make the most of the trigger being up again as Tendarya is also at this 
    point in her epic.&nbsp; Still no word from a GM we started the buffing 
    cycle again, almost finished the Lead GM turned up.&nbsp; Although we had 
    numerous log files, it was shouted 'in zone' and various screenshots this 
    wasn't enough for her to award Priwinn with the missing bit of her epic.&nbsp; 
    We had to take the dragon down again.</p>
    <p><i><b>NB:&nbsp; For all our friends that read the website we learnt a 
    valuable lesson here.&nbsp; /report anything of importance like an epic kill 
    immediately after it happens.&nbsp; We will not be making this mistake again 
    and most of us now have /report hotkeyed</b></i></p>
    <p>So we finished the rest of the buffing and once more triggered the 
    beastly fish.&nbsp; This round went even smoother than last with only one 
    death (sorry Fanko) before Priwinn was once again in possession of the water 
    and /report had been spammed by the 20+ people in attendance.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <p align="left">Most people that know me know I love this zone at the best 
    of times, but today was fantastic.&nbsp; With two groups we headed over to 
    the reaver building at the back of the zone and pulled reaver after reaver 
    until the building was clear.&nbsp; It was the last reaver down here that 
    saw Rint awarded his Jade Reaver and the first epic piece of the day.&nbsp; 
    We had a couple more join us at this point before heading up to the sky 
    platform for a meeting with Neh'Ashiir.&nbsp; We settled ourselves in the 
    larger room up top as there is a bit more room in there and Zeksie pulled 
    the last reaver for us.&nbsp; About 3 Black Reavers spawned one after the 
    other before Neh'Ashiir decided to show himself.&nbsp; Kandalf handed in the 
    ring and it wasn't long before Neh himself was eating dust off the floor 
    awarding Kandalf Neh'Ashiir's Diary and as a bonus Fanko got his Torch of 
    the Elements.&nbsp; After losing a few people to RL we stayed in this room 
    and continued pulling the mobs from the surrounding area and outside 
    Neh'Ahiir's room in a desperate effort to get the Wraith of Jaxion to spawn 
    for Kwanii, but to no avail.&nbsp; On our final clear up before we decided 
    to leave, Neh'Ashiir's Black Reaver had spawned again, so making this the 
    final pull we were rewarded with yet another Jade Reaver for Kalnaery and 
    taking Neh'Ashiir down again Talaz was rewarded with an Ornate Rune Shield.&nbsp; 
    All in all a very good trip and fun was had by all who attended</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">I have added a link to the Navigation Bar called 'Twilight Sea Armour 
Quests'.&nbsp; After laboriously surfing the net for as much information as I 
can find I have collated it all to give you information of what is required for 
each piece of armour and weapons and who it needs to be handed to.&nbsp; In 
addition to this I have detailed all the ITEMS and MARKS that can be found, what 
creature drops them and in what zone.&nbsp; I hope that as a guild we can work 
together on kitting each other out in this armour, and anyone else that wishes 
to join us in the process.&nbsp; I will keep you posted on here of our success.</p>

<p><b>Saturday 19th January, 2002 - 'Reaver Fest'</b></p>
<p>Today we were invited by Omerta to join them on a 'Reaver Fest' in the City 
of Mist.&nbsp; The turnout was fantastic with almost everyone of the right level 
in CR attending.&nbsp; We duly made our way to the back of the city to the 
castle entrance to find Lord Rak'Ashir awaiting us.&nbsp; This was it, the test 
of our ability to work together with Omerta and Lions of the Heart and with some 
quick planning all pets were brought into action.&nbsp; For the first time melee 
classes had to sit back on their heals and watch as pets and casters went to 
work.&nbsp; We sent in the mages fire pet and it was the job of the three 
clerics to chain heal it with the assistance of secondary healers.&nbsp; When 
pets died more were summoned to replace them, and 15 minutes later the Lord was 
dead.&nbsp; It is good to know that when our Shamans are finally ready to 
complete their epic we now have the force to do it.&nbsp; With a quick reform 
and rexxing of the unfortunate we made our way into the castle and placing 
ourselves in the entrance hall continued to take down everything in our sight.&nbsp; 
The day was a success and congratulations go to the following people who won 
their awards :</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">Kandalf - 3 Book drop 
from Lord Ghiosk (epic)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">Mystyfy - Jade Reaver 
(epic)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">Jennya - Spell: 
Upheaval</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">Kwanii - MoSS</p>
<p align="center">Thank you Omerta for inviting us much fun was had by all who 
attended</p>

Lower Faydark Paaw noticed that the Tainted Brownie was up on track, so a quick 
post to guild chat and 5 of us dropped what we were doing to be at his side.&nbsp; 
Grabatz, Talaz, Zeksie, Jennya and Kandlaf stood at his side as we were all 
turned into wolves and went chasing the Brownie through LFay.&nbsp; Once caught 
it was brought down without too much trouble and immediately spawned the 
Corrupted which again was taken down in the blink of an eye.&nbsp; This brings 
Paaw another kill closer to his epic.</p>

Being in City of Mist also proved fruitful to Kulfi as she was allowed to loot 
the three books required for her next stage from Lord Ghiosk which 5 members of 
The Well had just taken down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Well after almost 20 hours Jennya and Zeksie were finally in possession of 
'Ring of the Ancients'.&nbsp; A quick trip to West Commanlands to take down some 
Shadow Men for the Shadowed Rapier, pick up 3250 gp at the bank, then off to 
Rathe Mountains with Grabatz and Yinadriel in tow.&nbsp; We weren't the only 
ones after Hasten, Bennyboy a monk from Blood Cult needed to kill him for his 
epic so after bringing him over to us to trade in the bits for our boots we 
assisted him in doing this.&nbsp; Jennya and Zeksie are now the proud owners of 
a pair of Journeyman Boots.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It was quickly discovered that our new warrior Badiek was not in possession 
of the Sebilis key, so a group set out to get this rectified.&nbsp; On reaching 
Trakanon's Teeth we found that a Doom Skeleton was blocking up the spawn table 
so re-enforcements were called for.&nbsp; With the help of Oana the Blood Cult 
warrior we took him down without too much trouble and after recovering Paaw's 
corpse a couple of times from the depths of Trakanon the medallions were soon in 
Badiek's possession.</p>

    What was becoming a long boring Ancient Cyclops camp in Ocean of Tears 
    turned out to be quite eventful.&nbsp; Sitting and watching the time slip by 
    as Jennya, Zeksie and Paaw killed Aqua Goblins, Ogres and Cyclops in the 
    vain hope that the Ancient would spawn, Paaw announced that the Tainted 
    Cyclops was on track so off we went.&nbsp; We managed to knock down the 
    Tainted without too much trouble, but then the Corrupted spawned immediately 
    from it's corpse and this proved a little more difficult.&nbsp; It was down 
    to almost one bubble of health when Jennya ran out of mana, Paaw was having 
    problems casting and soon he and Zeksie had become corpses.&nbsp; In a rush 
    of panic at losing the AC camp we hurried our way back to the island rezzing 
    the fallen and resumed camp once more.&nbsp; The Corrupted headed back over 
    to the island and this time we were more successful in bringing him down and 
    Paaw is now one step closer to his epic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fendel and Trepidation were invited to join Blood Cult on a raid to the City 
of Mist and within no time at all Lord Ghiosk had been brought down and the 
three books are now in Trepidation's possession giving us another guild member 
one step closer to his epic.</p>
