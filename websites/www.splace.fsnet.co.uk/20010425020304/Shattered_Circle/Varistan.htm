<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varistan's elven heritage is apparent to those observant
enough to note his graceful movements, his scarred but fine features, and his
bright lime-green eyes.&nbsp; Those less observant might mistake him for a
full-blooded human due to his lack of pointed ears.&nbsp; The left side of his
face is a mask of burn scars, his ear almost completely gone and his lip curled
into a permanent snarl.&nbsp; The right carries a livid scar running
horizontally across his cheek and across the side of his head, corresponding
exactly with the missing top half of his right ear.&nbsp; His clothing is old
and worn, from his scuffed and dirty leather armor to his stained boots.&nbsp;
Over it all he wears a black, hooded cloak, though the hood is rarely pulled
over his head, displaying a wild growth of short, ragged, jet black hair.</font><br>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varistan was born in unfortunate circumstances to a human wife
of a bigoted and jealous husband.&nbsp; He never knew who his real father was.&nbsp;
His human father was cruel and vindictive, though life was bearable when his
mother was still alive and able to offer some form of protection to the young
half-elf.&nbsp; He loved his mother and his siblings very much, and to help
support his poor family he took it upon himself to engage in petty pick pocketing
and theft, learning at a very early age to be quick and resourceful.&nbsp; But
when his mother died when he was only eight years old, life took a turn for the
worst, culminating in a horrifying night when his father beat him near to death
and held his face into the burning hearth.&nbsp; Varistan would have died that
night if not for his siblings, whose pleas finally got through to their father.&nbsp;
But still desperate to be rid of the child he despised so much, he sold Varistan
for a few silver to the first group of traveling merchants who would take him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traveling for two years through cities he'd never even heard of, he eventually
escaped from the merchants who thought of him as nothing more than property and
took once again to thieving in order to survive.&nbsp; For the next six years he engaged in various pursuits, ranging from a lowly pickpocket to a burglar, to
a hired sword, learning the ways of the streets and combat, honing his physical
abilities on the rooftops and in the alleys of the cities, eventually working
his way back to his home, hoping to reunite with his siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was
sixteen years old when he returned home, only to find his family gone, no sign
of where they had left to.&nbsp; For two years he worked the streets of his home
city, hoping to find a sign of his lost brothers and sisters, until the day he
was forced to flee.&nbsp; He had always been exceedingly careful in his less
than savory proclivities, only stealing from those who he thought could afford
it, or those who he thought deserved it.&nbsp; He had never been caught, though
there had been close calls.&nbsp; The severing of his right ear was testament to
that.&nbsp; But perhaps setting his sights too high, he decided to make his next
target the home of a powerful merchant lord, and within the walls of the home
witnessed the merchant's abusive nature as he struck a young woman, perhaps his
daughter, perhaps his wife, with closed fist.&nbsp; Varistan had never killed
before.&nbsp; Now he was wanted for murder.&nbsp; At the age of eighteen,
Varistan is on the road, his future uncertain.</font></p>
