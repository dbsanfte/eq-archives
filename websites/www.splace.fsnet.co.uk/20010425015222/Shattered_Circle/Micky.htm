only 5'4&quot; and weighing a light 130 lbs., Micky dresses as a professional,
always clean, always in tailored clothing. He prefers the light blues and whites
of his Mothers heritage, rather than the dark clothes normally associated with
his profession.</font><br>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some months into training, he
realized the true nature and profession of his teachers’, they were the same
men who had stolen from his family only months before. Enraged, Micky quit the
'school' and went home... Later that same night, his parents were both killed in
