    badly, the first 2 groups with the only 2 clerics on the raid got up and to 
    safe spot without a problem, unfortunately the third and fourth group 
    weren't quite as successful, but before long corpses were dragged, people 
    rezzed and we were back on our feet again.&nbsp; Most of the first floor had 
    been cleared, but started popping about an hour after we got up there which

    travel up to Plane of Hate.&nbsp; Grabatz came on line to tell us that his 
    epic mob 'Kurron Ni' was up in The Overthere, and as I was running over to 
    Freeport to pick some peridots up for the raid, Cazel was harrassing n00bies 
    in the Oasis of Marr.&nbsp; As we had a couple of groups in South Ro already 
    we headed over to the Oasis, and it wasn't long before Cazel found himself 
    face down in the sand.&nbsp; We then jetted over to The Overthere for our

    much trouble.&nbsp; So all that is left for me to say is ...</p>

    lying face down on the floor and we waited for the 'nothing on corpse' call 
    that we were so used to .... but no ... not this time ... our first black 
    reaver produced our first Jade Reaver of the night.&nbsp; Yes, you heard me

    camp and proceeded to lay into it, but then it got away.&nbsp; The next 
    thing we knew we were bashing the Maestro himself and it wasn't long before 
    his crumpled body was at our feet.&nbsp; Shortly after the hand returned, 
    this time we didn't let it get away and soon we were fighting a giant hand, 
    it took a few deaths, but we succeeded in bringing it down.&nbsp; The raid 
    once again was very successful, and great fun was had by all who attended 
    and many people went away happy with new pieces of armour, weapons or epic

<p><b>Saturday 19th January, 2002 - 'Reaver Fest'</b></p>
<p>Today we were invited by Omerta to join them on a 'Reaver Fest' in the City 
of Mist.&nbsp; The turnout was fantastic with almost everyone of the right level 
in CR attending.&nbsp; We duly made our way to the back of the city to the 
castle entrance to find Lord Rak'Ashir awaiting us.&nbsp; This was it, the test 
of our ability to work together with Omerta and Lions of the Heart and with some 
quick planning all pets were brought into action.&nbsp; For the first time melee 
classes had to sit back on their heals and watch as pets and casters went to 
work.&nbsp; We sent in the mages fire pet and it was the job of the three 
clerics to chain heal it with the assistance of secondary healers.&nbsp; When 
pets died more were summoned to replace them, and 15 minutes later the Lord was 
dead.&nbsp; It is good to know that when our Shamans are finally ready to 
complete their epic we now have the force to do it.&nbsp; With a quick reform 
and rexxing of the unfortunate we made our way into the castle and placing 
ourselves in the entrance hall continued to take down everything in our sight.&nbsp; 
The day was a success and congratulations go to the following people who won 
their awards :</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">Kandalf - 3 Book drop

    Cyclops was on track so off we went.&nbsp; We managed to knock down the 
    Tainted without too much trouble, but then the Corrupted spawned immediately 
    from it's corpse and this proved a little more difficult.&nbsp; It was down 
    to almost one bubble of health when Jennya ran out of mana, Paaw was having 
    problems casting and soon he and Zeksie had become corpses.&nbsp; In a rush 
    of panic at losing the AC camp we hurried our way back to the island rezzing

together when a GM is online so that the guild can be born.&nbsp; I am 
desperately hoping that later on as we prepare to wipe out Chardok that a GM 
will be about, but i'm not holding out much hope.&nbsp; If not then, then 
tomorrow night for definite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">I jumped on this morning to see if I had any email ... still nothing, so I 
went to check the guild status.&nbsp; It was sitting there showing 'Need 
Reviewing', on going into it the msg said guild name duplicated.&nbsp; I jumped 
online to find no one there, so racked my brains on the suggestions thrown at me 
last night.&nbsp; I have edited it to now read 'Celestial Rising' ... keep your 
fingers crossed and let's see what happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Well at 8:00pm GMT we all moved ourselves over to a chatroom and a request to 
create the new guild was put through after some initial name problems.&nbsp; I 
later spoke to a GM in game and was told that I need to wait for email 
confirmation although the new guild is showing in the list as 'Initial 
Approval'.&nbsp; Once I have received the email (and was told by another GM that 
it took 3 days for him :0( ) then we need to gather a minimum of 10 people in 
one place for the guild name to be given.</p>
