Karg is a tall man who keeps much of the look of his barbarian past.&nbsp; His
people were the Gralk tribe of the bear clan.&nbsp; His hide armor is of bear
skin, a dark brown.&nbsp; Underneath, he gives some sign of a more civilized
society in that his plain trousers and tunic are of brown wool instead of hides.&nbsp;
His boots are furred and tied in place with leather straps.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever present at hand is a massive club (two handed) and
slung over one shoulder is a sling with five javelins in it.&nbsp; His long hair
is brown and is tied back into a pony tail.&nbsp; His eyes are so dark a brown
that they appear nearly black.&nbsp; His deeply tanned arms show many scars from
his youth.</font>

Born to the Gralk tribes, Karg was raised to be a warrior of the clan.&nbsp; He
was taught to stalk the great bear for his own armor, the use of the small
spears (javelins) in use by his people, and the war club.&nbsp; He proved a hale
lad and provided well for his people.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Karg grew tired of the relentless warring of his
people and decided to travel abroad.&nbsp; He was jumped by a small band from
the clan of the elk and while he fought them off, he was wounded grievously.&nbsp;
Making his way further, he came across a small wooden keep in the wilderness,
the monastery of the Kephian order.&nbsp; While his body mended, he became aware
of Shyeth and felt an instant kindred with the fabled Kephan, being a stranger
among his own.&nbsp; And so he decided to remain, to repay the kindness of the monastery
with his talents and to repay Shyeth with his service.</font></p>
