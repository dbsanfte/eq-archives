<p>WARNING DO NOT perform any of the quest turn-ins while using Form of the 
Great Bear. This quest will only trigger with proper TRUE SPIRIT FACTION is 
detected by the quest NPCs. Reports have been received that being in Bear Form 
during epic-item turn-ins may BUG the quest NPCs to misread your True Spirit 
faction and cause the quest trigger to FAIL! <br>
<br>
There are several methods for beginning the quest, among which have been 
reported are: Ocean of Tears, loc +800, -5400, Capt Surestout Rathe Mountains, 
(on cyclops hill), Blinde the Cutpurse; Butcherblock Mountains, +260, +1650, Peg 
Leg; Field of Bones, (marauder cave), Iksar Outcast/Manslayer<br>
<br>
While the information here is gleened from conversations with Capt. Surestout, 
it is reported that any of the above will yield the same information and &quot;tiny 
gem&quot;. <br>
<br>
Here is the Surestout method of beginning the quest: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><a name="Step One:  Beginning the Quest">Step One:&nbsp; 
Beginning the Quest</a></b></p>
<p>Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout 
(green con at level 54, one ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where 
he's killed, hail the spirit. <br>
<br>
Capt Surestout died. </p>
<p>Your faction standing with PiratesOfGunthak got worse <br>
Your faction standing with FirionaVie got better </p>
<p>Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the Pirates of Gunthak.. 
They will avenge me.. Unngh!! <br>
a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell. a lesser spirit's body pulses with 
energy. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail a lesser spirit' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman? a lesser spirit 
regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Yes' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life? Did he threaten 
your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way?
<br>
<br>
You say, 'He threatened my life' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his 
heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now. 
Thank you for what you have done, shaman. You say, 'Who are you?' a lesser 
spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do 
you wish to know more, shaman? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to know more' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the 
clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to 
where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There 
you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he 
will tell you more of the spirits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Drunken Shaman</p>
<p>Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers in the north western part of town, a 
little ways in on the inside of a collapsed wall is Bondl Felligan. Give the gem 
to him.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan'<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You 
have nothin' I want and I certainly have nothin' you want.'</p>
<p>Give Bondl the &quot;tiny gem&quot;.</p>
<p>Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink 
for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see 
how much I can get for it right now! </p>
<p>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
You gain party experience!!</p>
<p>Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the sewers onto the land 
outside, there he will stop and speak to you.</p>
<p>Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with 
this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with 
it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some 
booze with this or not?<br>
<br>
You say, 'You can buy booze.'<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman, 
please come with me.'</p>
<p>After this you can follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den or just go there 
yourself. Head up to the third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll 
find a greater spirit waiting.</p>
<p><i>NOTE: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to him and saying 
&quot;You can buy booze&quot; at anytime will cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No 
need to travel back to Ocean of Tears, Field of Bones, Rathe Mountains or 
Butcherblock Mountains to initiate the quest again.</i></p>
<p>Once you arrive at the Jade Tiger's Den . . .</p>
<p>You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], 
[War], [Fear], or [Hate]?<br>
Answer appropriately depending upon whether you are:<br>
Barbarian [Justice],<br>
Ogre [War],<br>
Vah Shir [Justice],<br>
Iksar [Fear], or<br>
Troll [Hate].</p>
<p>What follows is the Barbarian response . . .</p>
<p>You say, 'I follow justice'<br>
a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you are, 
then. You would be best served by speaking to my brother in the next room. 
Farewell .<br>
Go to the other room as instructed by a greater spirit.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you. We're glad you trusted in our 
brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us 
with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways most people would not understand 
and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah].</p>
<p>You say, 'What true spirits?'</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if 
you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend to 
your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe and 
we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this 
form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in an expanse of<br>
emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost.</p>
<p>You say, 'What trust do you speak of?'</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts 
others to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do 
themselves. The trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do 
our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied 
with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed 
destroys the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the 
grass.</p>
<p>You say, 'What very few?'</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged 
worthy to be friends and, reluctantly, masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. 
Bondl is one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able to 
grasp our existence. There are many troubles that threaten us and our home. We 
seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health of 
the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important to 
you.</p>
<p>You say, 'What wisps of consciousness?'</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for 
we are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives 
beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When you ask for 
his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the 
personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an 
ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of understanding.</p>
<p>You say, 'What heyokah?'</p>
<p>The greater spirit should give you the gem after you say the above line.</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our 
friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek 
nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept this 
and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish 
what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We 
ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the 
Heyokah].</p>
<p>We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be rewarded for 
your efforts, albeit grudgingly.</p>
<p><i>CAUTION: DO NOT say the following line until you receive the gem by saying 
the above line. The next line will cause him to immediately despawn but will 
start the next quest for you.</i></p>
<p>You say, 'I will walk the path of the Heyokah'</p>
<p>a greater spirit says 'That is good. You will need to walk three paths before 
you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. 
First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an 
island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there 
are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem 
and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about 
trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><a name="Step Two:  Test of Patience">Step Two:&nbsp; Test 
of Patience</a></b></p>
<p>Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the 
island.Approx. loc -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 
hours.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Ooglyn'<br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say 
you comin an need da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? 
Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put test. Keep 
your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, shaman, they gib you 
gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh.<br>
<br>
Give her the gem.<br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you 
missed it. The sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you 
so I take you there. We goin for a swim, shaman!<br>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn feels much faster.<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn is surrounded by a brief lupine aura.<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn's body pulses with energy.<br>
<br>
After Ooglyn finishes casting spells, she starts to run away. Follow her until 
she disappears into the water. Then run out over the water (make sure you have 
levitation and some sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600, 
+4200.&nbsp; Dive down about 10 feet into the water and cast your pet spells. 
Then proceed to the bottom of the ocean and wait patiently as this test 
suggests.<br>
Ooglyn may be waiting there for you there or she may not. If she's not there, no 
worries. It won't effect the quest.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Patiently wait at that location. Five different spirits or Heyokah will 
eventually spawn. Be patient. Your goal is to receive &quot;a broken arrow&quot; from Abe, 
and a &quot;gem&quot; from the Greater Spirit. As such, only the conversations with Abe 
and the Greater Spirit are presented here. Conversations with the others is 
merely &quot;fluff&quot;.<br>
Did I mention patience?<br>
Invisibility to Animals: Several have reported that using Invisibility to 
Animals while waiting will keep the sharks from attacking you.<br>
<br>
<i>NOTE: You will also have to fend off the regular Sharks and the much tougher 
Killer Sharks that roam the area while you wait UNLESS you keep Invisibility to 
Animals up constantly.</i><br>
<br>
TIP: Despite what ANY of the spirits or Ooglyn say to you, DO NOT leave this 
location. They are only trying to trick you. Remember, this is about Patience. 
Now then, once you are at the bottom of the ocean at neg 1600 pos 4200 . . .<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Abe the Abandoned'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into 
focus. You can't tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in front of 
his own face. Then ,suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! 
I AM [ABE]!'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Who are you abe?'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know 
where to look and you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if you can't 
get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend you mine but I 
don't wear the same size.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What eyes?'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although 
it doesn't seem to make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods 
approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it was naught but a 
dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine] 
fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And 
now<br>
we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What is the combine?'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd 
think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not'<br>
After a few minutes, Abe will speak again. Be patient! :)<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will 
never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. 
Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know 
who to give it to when it is time.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Yes i will give them the arrow'<br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly hands 
it to you without a word.<br>
A few minutes later . . .<br>
Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer! 
Come with me and I will tell you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledeg is not 
for everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me 
Shaman!<br>
<br>
Stay glued to that spot. DO NOT follow him<br>
<br>
After or before Abe spawns, a greater spirit also spawns . . .<br>
a greater spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
a greater spirit's body pulses with energy.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know 
what to expect. We are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient 
and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and 
wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all 
the energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without<br>
patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here 
and we believe you are ready to walk the [next path].<br>
<br>
You say, 'What is the next path?'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you 
to act in our name, we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make 
the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of wisdom. You must 
walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is 
his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure 
understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy 
to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here to 
succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his 
instructions.<br>
<br>
You will receive a &quot;small gem&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><a name="Step Three:  Test of Wisdom">Step Three:&nbsp; 
Test of Wisdom</a></b></p>
<p>Head to West Karana. Look for a wandering spirit (looks exactly like a wisp).
</p>
<p><i>TIP: You can stand at neg 500 neg 5300 in West Karana and he will path by 
you. I've now done this twice and never waited more than 20 - 30 min tops. He 
will also path by Tower 2, actually colliding with it on his journey. Just keep 
looking around so he doesn't slip by you.<br>
</i><br>
Once spotted, run up to him and Hail him repeatedly at close range to get him to 
stop moving.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail a wandering spirit'<br>
<br>
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be 
regarding you with interest.<br>
<br>
Give the &quot;small gem&quot; to the wandering spirit. <br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's 
too late. Go now to the Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your 
help quickly! They will know you when they see you and instruct you on how you 
can help, but you must hurry! Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better
</p>
<p>Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the Goodly (approx level 32) at 
loc pos 6300, pos 1550. If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Tabien the Goodly'<br>
<br>
Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here, Waring . I was beginning to 
think I would be abandoned in my time of need. I have a [task] for you to 
complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What task?'<br>
<br>
Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal 
but is now scoured in cuts, dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is 
known as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was actually used by one of 
Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is 
immeasurable and I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a 
patriarch of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be 
stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me proof of his death.<br>
<br>
The other one is Glaron the Wicked (approx level 32), his loc is pos 2900, neg 
1900.<br>
If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Glaron the Wicked'<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should 
have known they would send a green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and 
myself. Very well, you will have to suffice. I have a [task] you must fulfill if 
you wish to know the blessing of my god and impress your masters.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What task?'<br>
<br>
Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a 
horrid, diseased stench as soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, 
shorter and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a larger than normal 
hilt, obviously for defense. He says, 'This festering blade is called Woe, and 
this scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by<br>
Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection of such holy 
relics. However, there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy these 
relics. End this idiot follower of Marr's life and bring me proof.'<br>
<br>
Now both these guys are fools, what do we do with fools? We kill them. Take 
their items (Envy, Woe and Marr's Promise) back to West Karana and give all 
three to the wandering spirit at the same time.</p>
<p><i>NOTE: Marr's Promise will not fit into any bag, except either a Tinker's 
Bag or a Large Sewing Kit, for it's huge size.<br>
NOTE: Conversation with Glaron and Tabien is not required to finish the quest. 
You may, if you wish, simply kill them outright.</i><br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good 
work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good 
work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing 
else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect 
the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was 
not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with 
righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted<br>
accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one 
to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. You have 
walked the path and now, as your final test, we must set you along one [last 
path].<br>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
You say, 'What shield of falsehood?'<br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and 
Envy and fashioned them together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this 
in defense of possession and the weakness that comes with hoarding treasure 
instead of using it to accomplish your goals. May it serve you well, Barbarian.<br>

<br>
You say, 'What last path?'<br>
<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You have trusted us along the paths we have set before 
you. You have been known to be patient and await the right moment. And now, you 
have learned the wisdom to act in our best interest. However, one last path 
awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done. There 
are many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is more serious 
than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find 
one of our spirits. Show them the gem you have been given and follow the path 
they set you on.</p>

<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahh, you live, shaman! I am glad the beasts of this jungle 
haven't torn your body asunder. Tell me, do you still walk the path? Are you 
willing to [continue what you have started]?<br>

<br>
You say, 'I will continue what i have started'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'This brings happiness to our hearts and we are grateful. 
However, we must ask you to walk one more path before you can become a true 
Heyokah. With trust, one can focus on what is important. With patience, one can 
perceive what is harmful. With wisdom, one can know what must be done. These, 
you have learned, yet without the might to carry out what must be done, all is 
for naught. Are you [prepared to walk the path of might]?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am prepared to walk the path of might'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this place, Waring , this forest? 
The wasichu call it the Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the terrible 
place. Where there is no spirituality, we are weak. The lost city in the middle 
of this jungle is a great void of belief not only absent of spirituality, but 
actually draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that void. The void 
is like the sky, and nothing escapes its gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us 
away and sometimes it turns our minds, making us [like the wasichu], crazy for 
things with no meaning.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What like the wasichu?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who have turned their backs on 
our world and struggle for possesions and power over others. These lost ones are 
our brothers and we cry for them. Our hearts are in pain like bleeding wounds 
when we think of them. The path of might will lead you to one of our lost 
brothers. We are afraid there is nothing we can do for him now, so you must<br>
eliminate him when you [find him].<br>
<br>
You say, 'How do i find him?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and walked the land for ages. He soon 
met a man, one of the pointy-ears that live underground. This man was like a 
void just liike the one over that terrible place now. Our Brother-Friend was 
attracted to this man's desire and ambition. He no doubt thought that he could 
get what he wanted in service of this [dark point ear] who denied his own 
creator.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What dark point ear?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began traveling with this point-ear, 
they became shrouded in a darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was 
a powerful being and we soon lost their trail.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
We have no idea where he could be now. Although, after all these centuries, he 
has no doubt been gathering and cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an 
incredibly influential being at this point. Find this point-ear and draw our 
brother out, then destroy him and bring us proof. We await your return in somber 
mourning.<br>
<br>
Head to Mistmoore. Find the wolf spirit, Black Dire. He is STRONG and he has 4 
slighty weaker wolves as his four guardians. Black Dire hits hard and fast for 
up to 200 HP per swipe, so use extreme caution.<br>
Black Dire is not a timed spawn, but you can kill the Advisor in the general 
vicinity of the Library (location 19 on EQAtlas map) and Black Dire will repop 
each time you do so.<br>
Black Dire is by the ramp leading up to the castle but you don't go up ramp. 
Instead, head all the way up the canyon that passes under the bridge. At base of 
cliff you will see 4 wolfs and Black Dire in the middle. In order to get a 
response from the wolf you have to con Warmly. He is truespirit faction. When 
you walk up to him and hail him this is what he says:<br>
<br>
Black Dire says 'So, you've come. I suppose my brothers have sent you to lead me 
back to their flock. Those fools are so blinded by their devotion they know 
nothing of life. If they only knew the power I've become, the luxuries I've 
amassed, the pleasures I've known, they too would leave that sour and 
unrewarding existence in seconds. You know, you could come to know what I have, 
shaman. You found me, which speaks of your intelligence; we could use you. What 
do you say, Waring ? [Will you join] my master Mayong Mistmoore?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I will NOT join you'<br>
<br>
Black Dire says 'Good shaman, now bare your neck that I may show our master your 
devotion in death. The more blood you spill upon the grass, the more impressed 
our Lord Mistmoore will be. Then maybe, just maybe, you will be allowed to scour 
our kitchen floors in the eternity of unlife.<br>
TEAR him to pieces, my wolves!<br>
Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire bashes YOU for 60 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<br>
Black Dire begins to cast a spell.<br>
YOU writhe in the grip of agony.<br>
Ah well, no easy task killing Black Dire and his friends. It has also been 
reported that conversation with Black Dire is not necessary. Killing him 
outright will work just as well. Also, if the accompanying wolf guardians are 
green to all in the party, it is reported that Black Dire can be pulled without 
agroing his guardians.<br>
<br>
Once you kill Black Dire, loot his pelt.<br>
Return to the Sentinel Spirit in Emerald Jungle, loc +1250, +300.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Spirit Sentinel'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the pelt, battered and bloody. 
After a few moments, he says, 'We can only hope his passing was quick and 
painless. The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always remember that 
when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being 
that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him 
and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt 
into a pair of boots and give them to you.<br>
With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain 
forever.'<br>

You say, 'What is heyokah?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, you have walked the Path of the Heyokah to its end. 
You have become what few have and we will now call to you as Heyokah Duhara . 
From now on, you are a direct link between the spirits and man. Whether your 
goals are to help us or master us, you are welcomed. Though there is little time 
for celebration. Do you feel the darkness of this place, the forest? To eyes<br>
not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any other forest. 
But you know, as do we, of the mantle over the city threatening all of us. We 
must [rub it out].<br>
<br>
You say, 'How can we rub it out?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles scarring the universe and each 
is very different from the last. Removing them requires that we learn how they 
were created and go about reversing the damage done. We cannot enter under the 
mantle for long which is why we search out Heyokah such as yourself. We need you 
to enter the city and find out what you can about the [city's demise]. We hope 
you will do this for the cause of balance but if you desire none but your own 
power, we<br>
shall grant that as well<br>
<br>
You say, 'What about the city's demise?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed 
great wealth and power yet it eventually crumbled. No one understands what 
happened. The men of the world ask themselves how a nation as successful as 
Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague, internal unrest, the constant 
encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of monsters but we alone know 
what happened. Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their spiritual paths, so 
did Torsis. Without the awe and inspiration of that which was greater than 
themselves, they eventually withered away. The mantle was born long before the 
last days, though, and what we need to learn is [how it all began].<br>
<br>
You say, 'Tell me how it all began'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you 
can. The ghosts who still walk the streets may hoard precious memories that will 
aid us. Take this booklet and combine what you find in it. Then bring me the 
completed report. From there, we will know where to look next. </p>

reads: </p>
<p>I heard last night that there was some kind of commontion at the castle. 
Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some 
say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the 
command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine intervention. I have no 
idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. He is a paragon fro the 
cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and 
not my shop though.<br>

Crier's Scroll, identifies as &quot;Report Information 2 of 6&quot; in lizardman. It 
reads:</p>
<p>Hear of all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another 
High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held in 
honor of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests 
of skill in arms. Booths will<br>
be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all.<br>
<br>
Merchant's Letter, identifies as &quot;Report Information 3 of 6&quot; in lizardman. It 
reads:</p>
<p>The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need 
such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that 
they would not need as many new robes this coming season as &quot;none were quite 
ready to don them.&quot; My<br>
colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less 
these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. 
However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to 
normal shortly.<br>
<br>
Written Annoucement, identifies as &quot;Report Information 4 of 6&quot;. It reads:</p>
<p>Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen 
Neh`Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding 
countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of 
mercenaries to venture into the<br>
Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties 
should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen 
will be found. Wisdom guide us.<br>

Priest's Diary Page, identifies as &quot;Report Information 5 of 6&quot; in lizardman. It 
reads:</p>
<p>Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his &quot;wisdom&quot; has cut our church's 
donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many 
were wipe out during the Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more 
soldiers everyday, more that I<br>
ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can 
craft. This along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that 
coin grubber Biliaz leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but 
destroying our church entirely. I<br>
don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad.<br>

<p>Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy 
sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange 
class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be 
able to attend regulary.<br>
Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be 
discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as 
well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think 
I'll have to miss<br>
tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members 
again.<br>

thecombined Booklet to the Sentinel Spirit at loc +1250, +300 in Emerald Jungle.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Spirit Sentinel'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us 
in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance 
of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, 
the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We 
need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to<br>
the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last 
lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can 
learn about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here In the jungle 
beneath the murky waters of a pond. Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got 
better</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must kill Lord Ghiosk in the City of Mist and bring the three books drops 
to a Spirit at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle. Reports indicate he's no 
slouch, so bring 3 full groups of your uber friends (level 55 +) to the party.<br>
<br>
The Three Books Lord Ghiosk drops (accurate Iksar translation):<br>
<br>
Book 1<br>
Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have 
a saying that goes &quot;Neh's chances&quot;. We all know this is used to define an 
innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the early 
years of our fair city. For as many people as there were in Torsis there were 
that many theories regarding Neh Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were 
political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much so that she had to 
leave to escape death. And for good measure a few<br>
pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One 
thing all agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal couple 
was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two 
that implied a separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even 
tie the highly publicized Crusade of Kirn into the disappearance of Neh as Kirn 
left the city only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the 
visage of Rak' Ashiir reflected his despair over his wife's vanishing although 
it is a well known fact that it was mostly an act played by the King to keep up 
his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this 
point it would mean little to the public.<br>
<br>
Book 2 - Keeper of the House's Log<br>
1. New wash basins must be acquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster 
and place the order tomorrow.<br>
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally repaired tonight. Payment must be 
sent to the contract holder tomorrow.<br>
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 dozen finely made 
vials. What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this 
as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumours abound 
of the Advisor's mastery of the arcane.<br>
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the 
shortage of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a 
Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the 
intelligence to figure the<br>
symbolism.<br>
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as 
discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and 
discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot 
decide whether to place it ourselves<br>
with the help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the 
church. The less people that know of this the better. It might be prudent to 
..remove.. the servant who found it within the sheets.<br>
<br>
Book 3<br>
Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to 
practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kirn was given the 
hallowed title that contact between the sexes became tolerated. While Kirn 
wasn't the mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve many great 
victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle known as the 
Bone Rending when Kirn lost his fabled whip, Thriaxis' Tail, as was still able 
to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only.<br>
Before this battle many believed Kirn could not fulfil his duties as a leader 
and patriot for the people.<br>
However Kirn's might and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade 
and duty convinced the public that celibacy had its place in divinity but 
non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church. A shrine depicting 
Kirn among many women was constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign 
although his corpse was never brought back for burial as it was lost far across 
the ocean among distant brothers on faith.<br>
<br>
Bring the three books Lord Ghiosk drops to a Spirit at loc: +3685, -640 in 
Emerald Jungle.<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as 
random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort 
of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it 
known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the 
High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon<br>
mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the 
icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards.

In the last room you will find a temple with a waterfall running down its side. 
Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull skeletons, etc., from the first door 
you see at the base of the temple.<br>
<br>
Open the door. Inside is another door directly in front of you, do not open this 
door, it leads to top of temple. Look instead to the right, where three 
skeletons spawn. Pull these skeletons to courtyard and kill them.<br>
<br>
Go back into door, head right and ye will see a room set below ground level with 
three phantoms in it, standing on a raised dais. Pull and kill these phantoms. 
There are two doors beside the dais, one opening to the left and one opening to 
the right. Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, 
and a small bag on the floor in the left corner. Click on the bag, you now have 
the High Scale Icon. Gate out.<br>
<br>
Using Invisibility to Undead potion (Unlife Awareness) will get you past the 
last three skeletons and phantoms. They will still scowl at you, ready to 
attack, but it is a bluff. They will NOT be able to see you.<br>
<br>
Be warned, however, as the golems of the area can see through Invisibility to 
Undead, and you may run across a couple on the way to the temple area. There 
were no rogue-locked doors between the zone and the High Scale icon.</p>

child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and 
the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect 
of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If 
we put the child to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may 
be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take

. . . . Lord Rak' Ashiir is initially non-agro to all, but if you have 
sufficient True Spirit faction he will AGRO IMMEDIATELY when you turn in the 
Child's Tear, so be fully prepped and ready to fight!<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT CAUTION: Lord Rak hits with a 2000 hp area affect spell!<br>
Recommended 3 mage fire pets works nicely. Once Rak has spawned from the Reaver:<br>
1) Park the questing shaman and the mage fire pets around Lord Rak<br>
2) Move the rest of the raiding party to the opposite side of the room.<br>
3) Questing shaman hands Lord Rak the Tear. Rak will AGRO<br>
IMMEDIATELY, use his AOE on you (likely killing you), but also agroing the Fire 
Pets on him.<br>
4) Have party stay back and watch the show while healers keep the Fire Pets 
healthy. If other mobs pop, the party can attack them, but be sure you DO NOT 
use AOE on those mob pops to avoid agroing Rak on the party.<br>
5) The quest shaman should not move toward raid party, but rather stand there 
and try to heal yourself. You'll probably die quickly from the AOE. Have a 
cleric resurrect you back as soon as possible, loot the &quot;Iksar Scale&quot; and get 
party out. We fought our way back to zone, but evac works as well of course.</p>

NOTE: The following conversation is not necessary. You may, if you wish, simply 
hand the Iksar Scale to the Spirit Sentinel and receive your Spear of Fate.<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak 
has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has 
repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who 
initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have 
been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but 
that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. 
It was the people who chose to follow.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What is lost?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless 
individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly 
cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, 
indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual 
devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the 
bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured 
the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child 
from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest 
treasure, the [Spear of Fate].<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the 
first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as 
he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. 
Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous 
magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was 
capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of 
negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed 
into existence one of these [black holes].<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of these Black Holes?<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to 
experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately 
for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black 
hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle 
was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within 
its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened 
with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck 
against Miragul's mantle.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What powerful shaman?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the 
timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a 
weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the 
sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a 
young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using 
nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged 
the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. 
Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the cosmos?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought 
into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. 
Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of 
will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough 
anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger 
volunteered<br>
immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In 
one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the 
land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the breach?'<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough 
negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so 
perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and 
nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that 
was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we 
recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When 
you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger 
when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah. Congratulations, Heyokah! 
You have received your Spear of Fate!: </p>
