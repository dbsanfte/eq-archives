<p><font size="4">Rupert is a thin, not altogether unpleasant looking man, with
straight light red hair held in a ponytail, fair skin and slightly pointed ears.&nbsp;
He favors a long coat with many deep pockets that he stores things in and is
forever losing important items.&nbsp; He walks with a staff and has a tendency
to look quite distracted by the slightest thing.</font><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born to his mother Rachel and an
Elven father whose name he still does not know, Half-Elven Rupert DeVere-Brown
has lived a very sheltered life.&nbsp; Whisked away by the machinations of his
unknown father at a young age, he was closeted in a series of very private
tutoring establishments.&nbsp; It was in these that he discovered his innate
abilities as a Transmutor, along with his skills in math, engineering and most
surprisingly, cooking.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While away, he heard of his
mother’s tragic accident and the birth of his half sister Dolores.&nbsp; He
immediately had felt pity for his sister’s heritage and decided he
would have to go home to help her when he was finished with his studies.&nbsp;
In the meantime, he wrote home often, not surprised that he received few letters
in return.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4">Growing into a young man, Rupert
began feeling the urge to wander the world.&nbsp; He returned home to find (to
his horror) that his sister was a backroom drudge.&nbsp; Although she seemed
physically able to take care of herself, her older brother decided then and
there to take her away.&nbsp; Perhaps in travel, he could protect her and
satisfy his curiosity of the world he had seen so little of.</font><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
