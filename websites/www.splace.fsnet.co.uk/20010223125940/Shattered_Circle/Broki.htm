Already he has a long, thick beard of black that seems to begin at the top of his head and run down to below his chest.&nbsp;
He wears both his hair and beard in the traditional war braids of his
ancestors.&nbsp; They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul; his black eyes seem to swallow the light and reflect more than they show.&nbsp;
His skin is darkly tanned from working at the outdoor smithy and the training he’s received.&nbsp;
He also has many small burn scars on his heavily muscled arms from his time at the smithy.</font><br>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born and raised at the foot of the Gray Mountains, Broki was trained to fight the trolls and orcs that inhabit the countryside and caves.&nbsp;
He was apprenticed to the renowned Armorer, Dras Blokhamer, at an early age because of his family’s noble standing.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they are not recognized as nobility now, Broki was continuously told the stories of how his family was once the Clan Thanes under the mountains, hundreds of years ago, until the Dwarves were forced out by the overwhelming numbers of orcs and trolls that migrated out of nowhere.&nbsp;
Outside of the mountain home, his ancestor’s lost their claim to the title of Thane during the Gray Mountain civil wars.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broki is now sworn to restore the former glory of his family and to have him named as the new Clan Thane of the Gray Mountains.&nbsp;
But first, he must gain some experience and funds to take a group into the mountain home and clear out the trolls that now inhabit the ancient homeland.&nbsp;
Then he must win-over the Dwarfs, and convince them to return to the caves and mines.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only 47 years of age, Broki should still be at home, learning his trade, but he has set out to find the glory that he feels is due him as a royal Dwarf.
