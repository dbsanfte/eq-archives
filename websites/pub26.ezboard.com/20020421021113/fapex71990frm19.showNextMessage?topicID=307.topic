This wasn't, truly, my first experience with Neverwinter Nights, as I'd seen a few pseudo-functional tools and builds in the past. However, this was my first run with the game in a playable state. <br><br>The first thing that hit me, as Jay started up the game, was the very elegant menu system that BioWare has created. The various menu systems are overlaid on extremely well drawn scenes from NWN and 3rd Edition. Tooltips and help text make Character Creation, and navigating between games a breeze, even for players new to Dungeons and Dragons, or RPGs in general. Although I can't give any specifics, the selection of skills and feats was fairly impressive, as well as the &quot;Character Packs&quot; that have been made for those without the need to customize their characters. A &quot;Recommended&quot; feature lets the game choose which skills, attributes, feats, or whatever else you might need that are appropriate for your character. You are, of course, free to choose what you want in each case if you don't want to use the 'Character Packs' or the 'Recommended' settings. <br><br>Another aspect of character creation that left me thoroughly impressed was the &quot;customization&quot; screen. Character models are designed for race, but not class, letting players pick the perfect look-heads, skin and hair colours, even tattoos combine extremely well with the variety of &quot;default&quot; outfits that you can have your character don. Instead of the originally proposed RGB wheel, skin and hair colours are picked from a variety of predefined tone. These work very nicely-my prototype character, a Dwarven Monk, had bronze skin and flaming red hair in a Bart Simpson-esque style... The colours I chose automatically added accents to the hair, and wrinkles and blemishes, of the correct hues. The portraits, too, are extremely well done, much higher resolution that the Bhaalspawn series. <br><br>Gameplay itself is somewhat simpler than Baldur's Gate, yet more complex than Diablo. The much-ballyhooed Radial Menu system works well in practice, although it requires some experience with it to become very efficient. Some of the BioWare guys, using the numberpad shortcuts, seemed to positively fly through command giving. There are several camera modes, which seem to facilitate different kinds of play. I favoured a free-ish camera, which gave me a nice view of battles, and let me in on some very nifty John Woo-ish material. A chase cam (following the character around from behind) and a &quot;driver mode&quot; (sacrificing camera control for keyboard character movement) both looked promising as well. <br><br>The particle effects are very, very well done. Torches flicker realistically, adding to the mood created by the shadows. The water, while not cutting edge, still looks fairly nice. The spell effects, however, really blew me away. Certain protective spells involve orbs of runes rotating around the PC, while others have shafts of light arcing around. Many spells have dynamic lighting... A magic missile travelling down a hallway will illuminate with a burst of light (along with the appropriate shadows). <br><br>Combat too, seemed well implemented, though, admittedly, I was somewhat inept at it. As I mentioned above, it's somewhere between Baldur's Gate and Diablo 2. There's only one character to control, so it's a simple &quot;point and click&quot;, as compared to BG's &quot;Select and Attack&quot;. However, there's definitely more depth that some other games... The to-hit and damage rolls appear in a window at the bottom of the screen, revealing the D&amp;D core of the game. Combat feats, &quot;Parry mode&quot;, and certain other commands (which are thoroughly animated, by the way) add extra layers of strategy. <br><br>I think I speak for most of the NWN community when I say that the Toolset is the most eagerly anticipated feature of the game. In this regard, I was tremendously impressed. As has been said in countless interviews, laying down tiles is a breeze. The lack of Z-axis is kind of annoying at first, but most encounters (such as rooftop chases) can easily be emulated with Height Transitions. Another gripe is the deja-vu of repeated tiles... This isn't quite the problem that it might at first appear. For one thing, the vast majority of customization isn't done through tiles... Rather, place-able objects and features can be used in their stead. For instance, using just tiles, a dungeon would be fairly barren. But slap down a couple torture devices, some burning corpses and the odd pile of skulls and it becomes a labyrinth that deserves the fear of adventurers everywhere. Many of these place-able objects are stackable. For instance, a (place-able) wagon can be loaded with corpses (impaled, mangled, zombie, or regular), and then set on fire with flame emitters. <br><br>Fog and ambient lighting, too, can be used to great effect. While the city of Neverwinter itself seems overly clean, drab and greyish, another district (using the same tileset) has a completely different feel, simply by using yellow fog and ambient settings. <br><br>My other large concern, apart from the tiles, was the variety of monsters. In this I was particularly blown away. I expected 20-odd creatures, and a few permutations thereof. Instead, there's a menagerie of what seemed to be dozens and dozens of unique and excellently crafted creatures. From the standard orc or goblin, to golems, demons and wild animals, there is a vast array of monsters to choose from. <br><br>The customizing tools of the editor didn't let me down, either. Levels can be added to a creature, or simply individual abilities, as well as hit-points, ability scores, and many other attributes. The item creation is also very in-depth... There are some wizards for automatically setting up many things (such as dialogue), but I didn't get much of a chance to try them out. <br><br>Unfortunately, I didn't get much time with the DM client. What I did see looked very powerful, and I'm looking forward to see how the finished version works. <br><br>Though I can't give any specifics on the plot, though what I did see looked like it had some excellent hooks for the rest of the game... I didn't get very far through the first chapter, however, as my character was continually killed off by hordes of half-naked escaped prisoners. (That's what you get for running through a prison, smiting people randomly, I suppose). <br><br>On the whole, it was a very interesting experience-some things, like the large variety of monsters, and the combat system, are hard to understand simply from interviews and movies. I'm eagerly looking forward to the release of the full game, in order to try out all the cool stuff that I've been fortunate enough to have a glimpse at. <br> <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>Lead DM - <a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a> <BR>A NWN Persistent Campaign<BR><i>And so it was that the gods gifted upon mortal men the varied treasures and mankind was changed for the better and worse, but forever changed. </i></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=306.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blNextTopic12.gif" border=0> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=306.topic><img src=http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blAddReply12.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.emailToFriend?topicID=306.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.threadControl?topicID=306.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=306.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=306.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub26.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="apex71990frm1">Apex General Chat<option value="apex71990frm3">Apex Members Only<option value="apex71990frm4">Zone Guides, Strategies and Loot Lists<option value="apex71990frm5">Apex Charter and Policies<option value="apex71990frm7">Officers Area<option value="apex71990frm10">NWN - Campaign Rules<option value="apex71990frm11">NWN - Scenerio/Plot Info<option value="apex71990frm12">NWN - GM Chat<option value="apex71990frm13">NWN - Quest Forum<option value="apex71990frm14">NWN - Fantasy Works<option value="apex71990frm15">GM/Volunteers Policies and Procedures<option value="apex71990frm16">NWN Volunteer Forum<option value="apex71990frm18">NWN - Links<option value="apex71990frm19">NWN - General Forum<option value="apex71990frm20">Member's Forum<option value="apex71990frm21">Scripting Library<option value="apex71990frm22">Persistent World DMs Only<option value="apex71990frm23">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/bapex71990>NeverWinter Nights - Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19>NWN - General Forum</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
