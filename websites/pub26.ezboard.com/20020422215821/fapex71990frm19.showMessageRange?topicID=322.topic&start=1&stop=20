We, by no means, wish to be considered insensitive about your concerns and questions. Today, April 4, no less than myself, Trent O. (Producer), Scott G. (Lead Programmer), Mark B. (Lead Researcher), David G. (Designer), and Jay W. (Community Manager) got together to speak about this issue specifically.<br><br>We acknowledge the statement made by Trent in November of 2000 that you can edit your save games was true back then. It has not been true for almost a year now. Why?<br><br>The answer is not an easy one but is discussed below by Scott Greg - Lead Programmer, Derek French - Assistant Producer and Trent Oster - Producer, along with the answer to a number of general questions that have been asked about this issue.<br><br>1. How can I fix bugs in a Module without requiring a player to run back through the entire game?<br><br>Ideally we would like the ability to load a save game into the toolset, make changes, and save it out. Although we have gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that this could be done at some future time, we haven't had the time to do this before the game is released. Depending on the success of the game, we will consider doing this post release. That said, don't despair. For all the major issues that save game editing would address, there are already methods available for performing these tasks. The only extra functionality that save game editing in the toolset would give you is to make this more accessible to general module making community. Until that time I will briefly touch on the methods that are currently available to the more ambitious module maker. Warning: some of these are rather technical and complicated.<br><br>1a. How do I change game variables?<br><br>The DM client already has the ability to get and set an object's variables.<br><br>1b. How do I add new items, creatures, etc?<br><br>You would create this new item in the Toolset, then export it. After exporting this new object (item, scripts, creatures etc.), open the save game in the Hak Pak file editor (provided with the game) and add the new objects. Save the file and run the game. You can now spawn in any of these objects from either a script or from the DM client.<br><br>1c. How do I modify items that are already in the game.<br><br>In the example in 1b, you were creating object blueprints. Every time a game object in the game is spawned in, it is in fact a copy of the blueprint. If you change the object's blueprint, any objects already created from the blueprint are not affected. For example, if you change the blueprint of your house, your house doesn't change unless you rebuild it. So changing the blueprint of an item that is already spawned into the world will be unaffected by the example in 1b. What you can do is write a script that scans through all of the objects in world and looks for the object in question. When you find it, you can destroy the old one, and replace it with a newly spawned instance. If you want to get fancy, you can even copy the game effects and variables to the new object before destroying the old one. This script will be a little tricky to write, but once someone makes it anyone should be able to use it to update spawned objects.<br><br>1d. How do I change conversations or scripting behaviors?<br><br>Same as 1b. Since each time a script is run, it looks at the script blueprint, simply changing the blueprint change the behaviors of objects running that script. The same is also true of conversations. New scripts and conversations can be added as 1b.<br><br>1e. How do I modify or add entire new areas?<br><br>There are couple of ways to doing this depending on how extensive your changes are. If you are modifying creatures, items and other types of objects see above. If you are changing some tile properties (light color, animations etc.) or are modifying the layout of area, you can do the following. Make the changes to the area and then export the area. Add the &quot;areaname.are&quot; file into the save game (just like in 1b). Your area changes will now be in effect when you load the save game. Please note that it is possible that creatures and other objects may be in invalid positions so you will have to deal with that with a clean up script. If you want to completely replace the area, do the same thing but also copy the &quot;areaname.git&quot; and &quot;areaname.gic&quot; files into the save game file. This will destroy everything in the area and replace it with the new stuff. You should not do this if there are player characters in that area.<br><br>2. What happens to a character's state information (spell effects, local variables etc.) when they leave a game and then return (either by logging out or portalling between servers?.<br><br>When a player leaves, its location and game state information are stored in memory in a placeholder object. This object is saved with the save game. If the player rejoins the game, then the player is moved to their last location and all the game state information is restored. If they return through a different portal, all the game state information is restored but they are moved to the new destination of that portal.<br><br>3. How can I transfer information between servers that are connected by portals?<br><br>Currently the best method is to use items. In the future we may add the ability for one server to send a message to another signaling a variable change but this is really scary in terms of bandwidth abuse and security. We also may allow writing and reading variables to a specific shared drive location. We will not be including this with the initial release of the game, but it is definitely a candidate for a post-release addition. In the meantime you can do this. Consider the following example: The module is scripted to keep track of the number of noblemen that a player has killed. Each time a nobleman is killed, that player's noblemankilled variable is incremented. When a player portals to another server, the portaling script can add an stackable item to the player's inventory with the stack count set to the value of noblemankilled. When the player appears on the other server, the OnPlayerEntered script can scan for that item, add the noblemankilled variable and set to the stackcount of the item. It would then destroy the item. The player would be unaware of this occurring.<br><br>4. How can I transfer information between chained modules (the next module is loaded with the LoadModule scripting command)?<br><br>Modules are chained together via the LoadModule script command. When it is executed all the players are moved from the first module to the second. Ideally a version of the script command would be written that accepts a list of variables and transfers them to the new module. This will not be included in the initial release of the game, but it is definitely a candidate for a post-release addition. You can however use the same item trick as in question 3.<br><br>5. How can I transfer information between unchained modules?<br><br>Currently the only way to do this is with token items. Basically set up a series of items that represent various game states. For example if you want the player not to be hated by all Orcs in any of your campaign modules, give them an Orc clan totem and say in the description that that possession of this totem ensures the cooperation of all Orc tribes. If you make the absence of the item to be the &quot;bad&quot; effect, the players will want to hold on to these items. Some creative design should be able to handle most of your needs.<br><br>6. How can we keep save games intact in the Official Campaign after patching?<br><br>Our modules are stored in a format that the game recognizes as read-only. The save game data that it saves is read-write data and is stored separately and the Official Campaign modules which are not resaved with the save game files. If we need to patch some part of the Official Campaign modules, this won't break your save game, since the save game data is stored separately. A patch to one of our modules may not fix an existing issue in your save game because we are not patching or altering your save game data file, just the module file. It will prevent it from happening in any future games in that module.<br><br>The follow-up question is why can't you the fans do this? Well, you kinda, sorta can. It will require some fancy file copying and renaming, but it IS possible, just not easy nor for the faint of heart. Please confine your responses to this thread. Other threads on this issue will be locked and directed here. <br> <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>Lead DM - <a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a> <BR>A NWN Persistent Campaign<BR><i>And so it was that the gods gifted upon mortal men the varied treasures and mankind was changed for the better and worse, but forever changed. </i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 3570<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/5/02 9:25:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lots of Discussion on saving Variables</span><hr size=1> Lots of techie talk on the issue<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.php?topic=22036&forum=7">forums.bioware.com/viewto...36&forum=7</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br> <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>Lead DM - <a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a> <BR>A NWN Persistent Campaign<BR><i>And so it was that the gods gifted upon mortal men the varied treasures and mankind was changed for the better and worse, but forever changed. </i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/uquintrel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quintrel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/images/downloads/icons/symbol.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orcan Draft Dodger</span><br>  Posts: 295<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/6/02 3:20:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://216.40.197.199/webgraphics/clipart/animals/wolves/clipart_animals_wolves_001.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lots of Discussion on saving Variables</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Although we have gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that this could be done at some future time, we haven't had the time to do this before the game is released.

The problem that bit them in the ass is the fact that any class can use almost any skill, under 3E rules.  So, in 2E, you only had to plan on a couple of classes being able to Pick Pockets.  In D&amp;D 3E, you have to plan on ANY class being able to Pick Pockets.  The madness doesn't stop there.  You can assign almost any skill to almost any creature or even assign entire class levels to any creature.<br><br>I watched a video on Gamespot that was taken in April 2001.  The look in TrentO's eyes when he says &quot;We'll be done by the end of this year&quot; was classic.  I have seen that look many times, and as a project manager; I have had that look in my eyes a few times.  It is the look of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I'm so deep underwater that I can't even see daylight&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br><br>In the meantime, Bioware has not done a hell of a lot to earn an income while they tinker around with Neverwinter Nights.  I'm speculating here, but it's an educated guess.  Infogrames has set a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do or die</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> release date for NWN.  Sure, Bioware can tell themselves and us that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;it's ready when it's ready&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> all they want, but I don't believe it for a second.<br><br>This leads to the sequel.  Infogrames is probably going to soak up a lot of the profits from the initial release of Neverwinter Nights.  Bioware is probably going to have to make their share of the money from a few quick expansion releases followed by a Neverwinter Nights II type release.  So, the outlook is good if Neverwinter Nights sells well and does not take too many returns. <p>- gladimir@san.rr.com<BR><a href=http://www.vagabondia.net/>Vagabondia Online - June 2002</a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/uquintrel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quintrel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/images/downloads/icons/symbol.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orcan Latrine Digger</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/6/02 9:35:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://216.40.197.199/webgraphics/clipart/animals/wolves/clipart_animals_wolves_001.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lots of Discussion on saving Variables</span><hr size=1> Hmph... which is probably why we are now hearing changes in NWN features <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that will now be in NWN II</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?<br><br><br>Gotta love it.

Im big on people/organizations keeping their promises, especially companies that take other people's money for a product. =P  <br><br>Im actually just getting tired of all these games getting released half-finished.  Seems like the Computer Gaming world is able to release a product that is incomplete (ie defective), with little or no backlash.  If most of us released something subpar or unfinished, wed lose our jobs (I know I would).   DAoC did this, now NWN is going to be released without a MAJOR component of the game that the fanbase was expecting (and was promised to them), and even DS has to patch already.  And these arent the only games that have done this.<br><br>I was hoping Bioware would be different from the others, that's all, but I guess not. =)  Like I said, not going to stop me from buying the game, but they dont hold the position they once had in my mind.

However, brief writing isnt as simple as you imply either. (at least if you want to do a good job at it)=P  Briefs may not be as long as computer programs, but there is a hell of a lot of research that needs to go into many of them.  It's not like I can just sit down when I write a brief and just start rambling like I tend to do on these boards.  I bet I have had just as many, if not more, late nights researching and drafting briefs as some computer programmers, etc.  drafting their programs.  There is nothing more embarassing than standing in a courtroom for oral argument and a judge asks you, &quot;Well Atty So-and-so, have you read A vs. B?&quot;  and you havent read the case.  I have seen this happen (not to me thank god)--one time, the judge had even wrote the opinion.  So, not only do you need to know the cases in your brief inside and out, you need to know your opponents brief inside and out, not to mention reply briefs, as well as the judge's history, as well as any cases that may apply but you havent used, it goes on and on...<br><br>My point is not that my job is more difficult than a computer programmer's.  In fact, my job right now as a consultation atty is pretty lax and laid back.   <br><br>However, my REAL POINT is simply this:  The length of time it takes someone to do something is NO excuse for substandard and/or incomplete work, be it a brief or a computer game.   My clients expect me to do complete work, and I even have to pay for malpractice insurance in the event that some dodo head decides maybe my work was not so complete.  Using excuses concerning how difficult a job is or how much time it takes to complete it is a very American way of explaining away substandard work and incomplete products, and it is an excuse Im getting tired of hearing. =P<br><br>What avenue do paying customers of a computer game have for incomplete products?  Attorney General's offices that are already overworked and understaffed (and dealing with more important issues than a $45 game) and customer service departments *shudder* who dont do crap.  Sure, you can take the company to small claims, if you want to pay the $80 bucks to bring the action (which is twice as much as the game costs), plus take time off work for the hearing, yadda yadda yadda (and this doesnt include attorneys fees if you want to hire a lawyer).  IE, the only solution is not to buy the product, but in cases of games where you have already misled a fanbase and they have spent 2 years preparing for it...that doesnt seem like much of an option, now does it?<br><br>Your end result...computer stores continue to be flooded with games and other computer products that dont work as they should, as promised, or as intended.  Yet people pay for these products because well, this is the best they can get until something better comes along.  I think this is very sad and a bit disturbing, that is all.  It does not set a good example.<br><br><br><br> <p><b>Amberyll Arydunmorn </b><br><b>SHROUD WORLD</b><br>A NWN Persistent Campaign<br><i>Those who choose to walk in the path of the light shall never fear darkness.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 3587<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/8/02 11:23:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lots of Discussion on saving Variables</span><hr size=1> I disagree. <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>Lead DM - <a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a> <BR>A NWN Persistent Campaign<BR><i>And so it was that the gods gifted upon mortal men the varied treasures and mankind was changed for the better and worse, but forever changed. </i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/uamberyllarydunmorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amberyll Arydunmorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1609<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/8/02 11:26:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lots of Discussion on saving Variables</span><hr size=1> With what part? <p><b>Amberyll Arydunmorn </b><br><b>SHROUD WORLD</b><br>A NWN Persistent Campaign<br><i>Those who choose to walk in the path of the light shall never fear darkness.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 3588<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/8/02 11:27:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lots of Discussion on saving Variables</span><hr size=1> Just figured if I could get another 2000 words out of you if I said that.
