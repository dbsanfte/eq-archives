The Gods now look upon each other to determine what should be done.  Allanbay called forth that Phykrell should be punished for the conflict had caused.  All but HellaCaster and Canter agreed, each with their own reasons, some good and some evil. Phykrell stood tall and grand before his accusers and swore great ill to any that stood in his way. <br>        <br>So it was that punishment was decreed and Phykrell was to be imprisoned for his crimes.  Daeder built a great hall within the mountains called the Crown Spires.   And Broodblame cast great magic upon the door so that none could open it.  And Vidal summoned great undead warriors to protect the prison from intruders and a Dark Angel was set down to lead them.  <br>             <br>While the construction of the prison was underway, Phykrell had plans of his own.  He called upon Delrox his faithful and dreadful servant.  And he gave upon Delrox powers and magic yet unknown to mortals.  He stopped the Heart of Delrox so that he would live forever.  He commanded Delrox to forever toil to free his master, and so it was to be done. <br>             <br>Then, as Daeder had done, Phykrell created children from his own blood.  These children were of red skin and immense power and they were called Red Shroud.  The Shroud were given the task to carry out the plans of Phykrell even though he be imprisoned and to insure that Delrox fulfilled his bargain.  The Shroud was also given the task of gaining great hoards of followers for their master so that he could grow more powerful.  Powerful enough that he could overcome the wards that were to bind him. <br>        <br>When the Prison was complete, the council of Gods summoned forth the resistant Phykrell and sentenced him to his eternal prison.  They drew forth his very soul and bound the dark gods power within a golden key.  The weak and powerless Phykrell was placed within the mountain prison and the mighty gate was shut and locked by the golden key.  The Golden Key was then placed upon a great stone and shattered by Daeder’s hammer.  The seven shards of the keys were given to a mortal Guardian named Morgane to watch over.<br>             <br>Morgane was well aware of his duty to the gods and created a magical tower in which to store the keys.  He created three guardians, redish gold scaled dragons that feared nothing.  For 300 years, the tower stood and the powers of the keys stood safe.  The world soon overcame the scars of the Fate War and men multiplied and learned.  The Shroud constantly worked to increase the followers of the Dark God, by coercion if all else failed.  Delrox tried many spells and enchantments upon the prison of his master, but even Delrox's great power was futile versus the gates of Broodblame. <br>             <br>After the passage of 300 years, the dragons grew weary of their dull watch and asked for relief.  So it was then Morgane allowed them one day each year of freedom while he personally stood guard over the keys.  And time passed, and each year the dragons flew free for one night.   Decade after Decade, Morgane dutifully watched the shards as the Dragons flew.  Slowly, the power and temptation of the keys began to work on Morgane.  More and More he greatly anticipated the dragons flight so that he could caress the keys.  Finally he was overcome with the powers of the keys and he took them for himself to use their powers.  <br><br>Morgane drew out the powers of the keys to make himself an immortal, an all-powerful being.  But the power was beyond his control and a great explosion rocked the tower.  Morgane was reduced to ash by the chaos of the keys. The explosion was so powerful that key shards were scattered across the valley, reeking of dark magic. <br><br>The Red Shroud saw a chance to free their lord and used all their powers and influences to find the shards.  After many decades the evil Shroud had attained four of the precious key shards.  The Three Dragons also searched for that which they were to guard.  Legend says they still roam the land in hunt.  A Priest, who was rumored to have killed one of the Dragons, found one of the Keys.  The Priest, named Sullen, later hid the Key after the Red Shroud destroyed his city and temple.  But it is said that the dragons hunt still, be the dragons dead or alive. <br>        <br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> From “Holy Verses” by an unknown author</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br><br><br>So it was that the Basenbe, son of Allanbay and known as the God of Fate, has a vision of the future.  The vision was one of continued war as jealous and vengeful gods wrecked havoc on the mortal lands.  War, plague, and destruction would grasp the lands so firmly that only creatures of evil would survive the events.  Without hesitation, Basenbe realized that the interaction between mortals and gods must end.  He formed a plan.<br><br>He traveled to the mountain home of Daeder and spoke to him of the future.  Six days, Basenbe recited the visions he had seen and Daeder listened.  After Basenbe finished, Daeder spoke not a word but picked up his hammer and journeyed to the valley of the mortals. <br><br>With special powers given to him by Basenbe and by the magic of his Hammer, Daeder constructed a tower of Salt and Sandstone.  In the tower he placed magic rocks of control, one for each of the gods.  The Tower was bound closed and magically protected with all the powers and enchantments that Daeder could control.  The future of the Gods was forever changed and bound by the tower of Sandstone.  For the magic of the tower prevented transferal of power, no god could come to the mortal world without loss of al his powers nor could a god leave the mortal lands to return to the stairs without loss of all his powers.  A barrier was formed.  So it was the Daeder was bound to the material plane and could not return to his home on the Eighth Stair, which was just fine with him in any case.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Excerpts from Galahoe’s ‘Love of Nature’</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br> <p>Segal</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=7.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blPrevTopic12.gif" border=0></a><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.showNextMessage?topicID=7.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blNextTopic12.gif" border=0> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blAddReply12.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.emailToFriend?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.threadControl?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub26.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="apex71990frm1">Apex General Chat<option value="apex71990frm3">Apex Members Only<option value="apex71990frm4">Zone Guides, Strategies and Loot Lists<option value="apex71990frm5">Apex Charter and Policies<option value="apex71990frm7">Officers Area<option value="apex71990frm10">NWN - Campaign Rules<option value="apex71990frm11">NWN - Scenerio/Plot Info<option value="apex71990frm12">NWN - GM Chat<option value="apex71990frm13">NWN - Quest Forum<option value="apex71990frm14">NWN - Fantasy Works<option value="apex71990frm15">GM/Volunteers Policies and Procedures<option value="apex71990frm16">NWN Volunteer Forum<option value="apex71990frm18">NWN - Links<option value="apex71990frm19">NWN - General Forum<option value="apex71990frm20">Member's Forum<option value="apex71990frm21">Scripting Library<option value="apex71990frm22">Persistent World DMs Only<option value="apex71990frm23">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/bapex71990>NeverWinter Nights - Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23>Archives</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
