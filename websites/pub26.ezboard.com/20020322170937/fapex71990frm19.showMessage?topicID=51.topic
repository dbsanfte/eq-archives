He tends to be a sly, unpredictable fellow, always with an ace up his sleeve.<br>
<br>
He's acts more like a thief than a mage, but likes to save a spell or two escape bad situations.  Indeed, most people assume he is only a thief as he tends to hide his magical skills, especially when in any town or city.<br>
<br>
He enjoys the fact that practically no lock is beyond his skills, even if magically protected.  His skills often get him into trouble, however.<br>
<br>
In Segal's world, he would fit right in. Most likely he'd be a member of the local thieves guild.  In the past, he has disliked overly lawful governments because they interfered with his trade.  Now with the evil government, there's too much competition, so he wouldn't mind balancing things out a bit once again.<br>

Honest facts, I have been GMing RPG games since 1975.  I would imagine that I have spent maybe 20 hours as a player in that whole 25 years excluding tournament play.<br>
<br>
I have played mostly cleric in tournaments, about 30 or so including most of the major ones.  Never been to Gencon but most of the other major ones. <p>Segal

<br>
I played Gnomes, Dwarves, and Halflings. I tended to try to be different. For example I would make halfling warriors even though they weren't suited for it.<br>
<br>
My most memorable character was a gnome illusionist/thief. --- well a note on the illusionist. my DM was not very good with illusions so instead of dealing with it, he basically made it difficult to use them and I rarely employed them. I used more alterations than anything (used heavy amounts of alteration magics)<br>
<br>
Overall though I did play more dwarves than any other race. I absolutely loved the fact that the dwarves could hold their ground and take enormous punishment from their vast number of hit points and bonuses to their saves. <br>
<br>
Smaller races were easier to role play as well since you don't really ever have to be serious. Even dwarves can be deliberatly gruff and stoic.<br>

<br>
As of late, I prefer playing tank types.  I love the idea of a paladin but i dont like having high moral standards.<br>
Thats why in eq the idea of a shadow knight is so cool, but it loses alot because of the lack of roleplay.<br>
<br>
Heather and I are starting in a campaign that has 9 players and 2 DMs which is a huge undertaking but we have some really competent gamers and DMs which will make this alot of fun.<br>
<br>
We are playing in the Forgotten Realms setting and I have made a human fighter named Kaeth.  I plan on multiclassing him with a few cleric levels and hopefully later in life gain a prestige class of Divine Champion (from new forgotten realms source book).  He is Lawful Evil and part of the Zhentarim and wants to become the Chosen one of Bane.  <br>
<br>
Kaeth is a completely honorable person, fully believing that law and order keep people in line.  His word while not given lightly, is of utmost importance to him.  Despite being evil, if he gives his word to honor or protect someone, he will do so unto death.  He will not needlessly hurt others (ie children) unless there is no alternative.  However, when anyone oppposes him, he is not above using any means at his disposal to kill someone.  If challenged to a duel, he will fight within any rules stated.<br>
<br>
While not honor bound to honesty, he prefers to not lie and decieve anyone in his dealings, unless he is specifically on an undercover mission.  He is a charismatic and outgoing and tends to blend in well with a crowd.  Secretly, he desires more power and control over others, though he bides his time until he has more means to gain what he seeks.  When his time comes, he will challenge those who oppose him and not hide in the shadows making shady deals or playing politics to gain favors.<br>
<br>
Preferring to not carry a shield as it implies weakness, Kaeth wields a heavy flail, which requires both hands to use.  In addition he is trained in the used of the heavy flail to disarm opponents.  He wears a standard breastplate and helm, drawing no attention to himself.<br>
<br>
Eventually a few levels of cleric will give him some healing capabilities as well as some undead control, and the use of spells like fear.<br>
<br>
The prestige class i hope to get is basically a paladin package designed for use with any alignment...it gives the ability to lay-on-hands to other who worship the same diety as well as divine saves and the ability to smite any who are not of his diety.<br>
<br>
Currently he is a spy of the Zhentarim, but is a very good party member because he understands that success only come when order is preserved, so he does not dare show his true self. <p><B>Scaab Plaguebourne</B><BR> <B>Iksar Crusader; 56th Rank Revenent of Fear</B> <BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/utarsi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarsi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=104956905&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 429<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/5/01 11:26:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Which AD&amp;D class/race do you like to play?</span><hr size=1> Maob, try webrpg.com<br>

basically they have an applet that creates a tabletop for a group to play D&amp;D on...the DM can create tiles and place monsters on a map.  The PCs can place an icon of themselves on the map as well.  It includes a dice roller and creates folders for a gm to store different parts of the game<br>

I really need to learn the new system, and the best way is by playing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/umaoudeib.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maoudeib</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 879<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/19/01 12:22:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Which AD&amp;D class/race do you like to play?</span><hr size=1> That's exactly what I was thinking Segal.  I figured it was time to refresh my memory of AD&amp;D 3rd edition rules, plus I missed the adventure and surprise those games offer.   Funny how things come full circle.<br>
<br>
One thing I noticed, skills and feats help make all stats play an important role in the game.  In previous editions of D&amp;D, charisma, intelligence and wisdom were pretty much pointless for a fighter.  However, they now play a bigger part.  For example, a fighter's intelligence dictates how many more skills a fighter can learn as he levels. <br>
<br>
Skills and feats may at first appear to be minor details, but I've quickly learned just how vital they can be.  An average character can become an amazing one just by choosing the right skills and feats when he's first created...and as he levels.<br>
<br>
Choosing equipment really helps shape your character as well.  You can't carry or afford everything as you start out.  This is especially true for the lighter armored classes since they need to keep their encumbrance very low to remain at peak combat efficiency.<br>
<br>
So yes, the best way to become an expert in AD&amp;D 3rd Edition rules is to use them in a game.   Reading them is one thing.  Applying them to a game where players frequently do unexpected things is quite another.<br>

EQ opened me up to actually playing a class by choice instead of managing NPCs in a campaign world.  I think I like the cleric class.  Something about divine influence that I find interesting.<br>

Never druids though, i always thought them to be useless treehuggers and laughed at them being a major class when EQ came out (little did i know the power of the farmer...).<br>
<br>
My favorite types of casters were ones that used their talents in not-so-straightforward ways.  I was not one of the good wizards that sat in the back with lightning bolt and fire ball memorized and nuked anything that approched that might be thinking to attack us.  I was also someone who believed magic should NOT be easily mastered, and mistakes should be often occurances in the arts for anyone other than the upmost highest level magic users (clerics were different, their talents came as gifts from their gods).  Because of this, i LOVED the addition of the 'wild mage' speciliazation, in which strange magics would occur when you least expect them.  When unable to play a character like this, i would simply use 'creative magics' in order to try to accomplish tasks as opposed to brute force.  Although illusions were not my speciality, i liked to tinker in other realms.<br>
<br>
Apart from this type of character, my favorite char was a multiclass mage-assassin.  Instead of using my magical talents in order to highlight my theiving abilities, i used my abilities of stealth and hand speed to try to enhance (or rather acquire) new magical components in order to do more precise damage (assassinate) to a victim.  It was sometimes difficult to separate out and explain to the group why id not just randomly steal from passterbyes, being a theif and all, but a guy has to have his morals, even if they are considered a hired killer.<br>
<br>
The third type of char i dabbled in was Psionicists - but they were way too hard for GMs to understand and / or control, especially at lower levels, and therefore were not very viable in normal campaignes.<br>
<br>
I never played tanks, and do not think i will in NWN either.  I just like to have more things to play with than just a few swords and a cool bow =)<br>
