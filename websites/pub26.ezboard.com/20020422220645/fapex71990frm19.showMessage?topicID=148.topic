Some basic rules apply to every online game, across the board, no exceptions.   The players will have erroneously high expectations; will expect extraordinary levels of customer service, will expect largely bug free software to work without fail with their out of date hardware, will expect zero defects, zero design flaws, and almost instantaneous resolution to their individual concerns.   They will expect a game that is challenging yet not too difficult, rewarding yet not focused on materialistic avenues, a game design that is balanced even though they secretly pray for favorable imbalances.<br><br>NWN is going to be something new and fresh for many people, yet I am afraid that quite a few people will be surprised at the product they get.   The game is based on a long standing Pen-and-Paper game called Dungeons and Dragons; yet NWN would hardly be recognizable to your ordinary D&amp;D fan because the mechanics of the game are buried within the mechanisms of the game.   Online gamers will find NWN a totally different venue, no longer will there be some faceless nameless entity in charge of the world, instead it will be some overly enthusiastic (at least at the start) fellow player trying to show case his creativity.<br><br>The final product may disappoint both genres of players, unless they understand up front what they are getting.   The game is produced by one company (Bioware), published by another (yet unknown) based on rules by yet another company (Wizards of the Coast) and brought forward to the players by an individual or a small team of game-loving fanatics.   When you enter the world and your Sneak skill doesn’t work the way you envisioned it, you really have few avenues to travel to complain.  The creator of the world certainly had little to do with it and even less opportunity to change it to fit your needs.  The publisher certainly doesn’t care as you have already bought the product.  The game programmer based the ability on the rules set down by the RPG maker.  And the RPG maker is far more concerned with selling their own products than tweaking their game rules to fit the needs of a Licensee.  <br><br>So why are there so many people looking toward NWN as the ‘Holy Grail’ of computer gaming?  Because it just might be for some of us.   Here is a program that allows someone like myself to create a world that reflects my visions, dreams, and ideals.   Here is a program that allows me to bring this world to life in a manner unlike any other virtual world; no two will be alike.   A world that can be intricately designed to the play style of the player base that can pull together all the good things from all those other games into one cohesive entity solely for the enjoyment of a small group of people.<br><br>The player’s role within the world will be as much the role of a co-creator as that of a simple player.  Players will contribute ideas, interaction, focus, and the events they involve themselves in can and will effect the global environment.  Unlike any other game, they will be a partner and as such have certain responsibilities to themselves, to other players, and to the world in which they play.  Like any community, the people within it will be the determining factor on whether or not the community thrives or dies.   <br><br>I think it is important that I manage expectations at this points as we get ready for the new adventure we call NWN.   I feel safe saying that NWN will not be a massive online game nor will it be a Pen-and-Paper game, nor will it be a CPRG.   The soul of NWN will be a sprinkle of Pen-and-Paper with a touch of massive online game and a dash of CPRG with a whole bunch of Community tossed in and the mixture will be lovingly cared for by a dedicated but very mortal overseer.   This overseer will never be perfect, never have all the answers, and suffer all the vices and failures that go along with being a human being.   But his goal will be divine, to bring a gift of enjoyment to himself and those that take the journey with him.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/1/02 6:42:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 2432<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/13/01 12:27:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A word from our Sponsor...</span><hr size=1> One of my goals is to develop my world in to a 'community of players'. I guess there are alot of ways to go about it, and I hope that the community is involved in developing some of those ideas because I certainly cant do it alone. But I do see some interesting things occuring if NWN offers us the gameplay we all hope.<br><br>First, there will be no spoiler sites so everyone that plays will be part of the vanguard of explorers that are learning about the world. Eventually, I can see one of you taking the time to make some rudimentary maps (or maybe some very excellent ones) for other players. These might not be so important for the outdoor areas since the scale is so much smaller than a MMoRPG but it certainly could be useful for the various dungeons.<br><br>Another aspect of that (you might have noticed this in the 12/12 news update) is there is no such thing as a 'Con' in NWN. So a group of players could meet a monster and have absolutely no idea what there chances are of beating it. To make matters worse for the players, the 3rd edition rules make virutally very monster type scaleable. So you can beat the snot out of those 4 Hp Kobolds, wait till you meet the Kobold Elite Kneebiters with the 6 hit die, 40 hit points, and wearing plate armor. Trail and Error will be the basis for learning, which means alot of deaths early on.<br><br>I suspect eventually people will start comparing notes and not everyone will have to face the same trails. I plan on making it somewhat easier by not having too many misleading monster types; you probably wont see Vorpal Bunnies with 100 hit points and instant-death critical hits. Most likely you will see things like Ogres and realize that that monster is a minimum of 4 Hit Dice and possible more. As MMoRPG players, we are accustom to seeing named monsters and being pretty wary of them, that would probably be good advice in NWN.<br><br>There of course will be some Fed-Ex quests, Bash the Mob quests, and some take the guard his wine quests but I am really hoping to develop many quests that are epic in scale. Not to mean that the reward might be epic, but that the process involved in solving the quest might be epic. Where the whole community could get involved and work on various aspects of the quest to try and bring it to a conclusion. <br><br>The problem with making this difficult quest have a corresponding rich reward is the fact that the quest (once solved) becomes relatively easy while the reward remains rich. I could implement it so that the quest gives a epic level item the first time it is completed and then a lessor item thereafter but this is sort of shortchanging others if the quest was solved based on participation by a large number of players. Hmmm, something for me to think about. <br><br>I think we will have a few players involved in the development of the world with certain restrictions. They of course can't be designing areas and encounters that are specifically tailored to their character nor can they go about providing design level information to the other players. So it will be kind of a balancing act for some of these players to keep their design side knowledge seperate from their player knowledge. Another dilemia that we will have to work out because the eventual success of this project will be dependent upon players being partners. <br><br>I am really looking forward to seeing the player designed areas because I think it will eliminate the chances of the world getting stale which could happen if everything was derived from the creativity of one person. Also, I truthfully plan on spending alot of my time playing the game with the rest of the players, having areas created by other people allows me to experience at least some of the thrill of discovery. Going to be hard enough for me to be a simple henchmen type and walking around with the party knowing what lies behind the next door. I will be screaming, &quot;NO NO NO, dont open that door&quot; with every fiber of my body, but my character will just be loyally following along to his death.<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/1/02 6:44:53 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=148.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blPrevTopic12.gif" border=0></a><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=148.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blNextTopic12.gif" border=0> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blAddReply12.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.emailToFriend?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.threadControl?topicID=148.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=148.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=148.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub26.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="apex71990frm1">Apex General Chat<option value="apex71990frm3">Apex Members Only<option value="apex71990frm4">Zone Guides, Strategies and Loot Lists<option value="apex71990frm5">Apex Charter and Policies<option value="apex71990frm7">Officers Area<option value="apex71990frm10">NWN - Campaign Rules<option value="apex71990frm11">NWN - Scenerio/Plot Info<option value="apex71990frm12">NWN - GM Chat<option value="apex71990frm13">NWN - Quest Forum<option value="apex71990frm14">NWN - Fantasy Works<option value="apex71990frm15">GM/Volunteers Policies and Procedures<option value="apex71990frm16">NWN Volunteer Forum<option value="apex71990frm18">NWN - Links<option value="apex71990frm19">NWN - General Forum<option value="apex71990frm20">Member's Forum<option value="apex71990frm21">Scripting Library<option value="apex71990frm22">Persistent World DMs Only<option value="apex71990frm23">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/bapex71990>NeverWinter Nights - Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19>NWN - General Forum</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
