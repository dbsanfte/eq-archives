Movement Animations <br>
Quote: How is the acceleration towards maximum movement speed implemented ? It would be nice and balancing with a slight delay before you reach maximum speed. It's both realistic and takes away the annoying factor that a melee monster/person with slow running speed never can attack a faster moving archer. It's just a thought and can't be to hard to implement if it's not done already.<br>
<br>
Done. The animation looked crappy without it. When people just popped to running it looked bad, so character now go from stand-&gt;walk-&gt;run and run-&gt;walk-&gt;stand. It looks much better.<br>
<br>
Two Headed Weapns <br>
Yes, we will have a few two headed weapons (Ed. Note: These are weapons where boths sides have weapons on them)<br>

Tilesets <br>
As far as the tilesets go, there's quite a lot that can be done with them. Like was mentioned above, the inherent limitation is that you have only 1 tileset available per map...and which the set is big, there is a finite amount to how much can be included.<br>
<br>
I don't think the final list has been put out there yet...but, regardless, if your expectation is that the initial release is going to have tiles for every single map idea you may have, that expectation's probably not going to be met. The tilesets take a good long time to do, since they must mesh automatically, have logical pathing and so forth...so there's only so many that can be included right off the bat, and our idea is to include as much selection as possible. The hope is, at least for the start, that the initial array of themes is broad enough that 3rd-party modifiers can use these as a good starting point for modification (and, yes, be useable by us for the official campaign).<br>
<br>
Having a game that has all the stuff we want to go into it, is stable &amp; works properly is important, too. <br>
<br>
Really different &amp; unique tilesets may have to come later. But different terrain (such as some of the ones that were mentioned) can be faked or are pretty basic alterations. (And incidentally, I saw the screenshots for the user who's making the arctic-type tileset, myself...if he can implement that in the game like he plans, that'll be pretty sweet.) <br>

Quote: Lochlainn wrote: I know that it's never been BW's position to oppose user-made content (ie hackpacks); is this an indication that BW's stance is now to actively support it with BW resources, rather than it continuing as an unsupported but not unwelcome occurrance?<br>
<br>
We're trying to make it as easy as possible for the users to generate their own content for the game and add it in without needing to be programmers. The existence of an accessible online community that creates modules &amp; content for NWN players is how NWN is going to fluorish. Jay is our Community Manager and could probably explain this in more detail than I.<br>
<br>
Scripting Experience <br>
Incidentally, while I won't address all the points myself, all XP and gold rewards can be scripted to either apply to one person directly or applied to the entire group.<br>
<br>
For instance,<br>
<br>
RewardXP(&quot;KIDNAP_PLOT1&quot;,50,GetPCSpeaker(),FALSE);<br>
<br>
This rewards 50% of the experience listed in the journal for the kidnap plot to the PC speaker only.<br>
<br>
RewardXP(&quot;KIDNAP_PLOT1&quot;,50,GetPCSpeaker());<br>
<br>
This would reward the same amount of experience to each member of the party (you could also put TRUE on the end, but that's the default). You could, conceivably, reward XP via a script in the 'OnUnlock' for lockpicking and such...and give it only to the thief who performs the feat.<br>
<br>
Building Signs <br>
Some of the buildings have signage built into the tileset. There is also a whole swack of placeable objects which cover things like merchant's shingles, store signs, pennants, banners, signposts and such. Most have a variety of symbols on them (like a sword and shield, 'writing' or other designs...that incidentally would be some of the easiest things to go in and modify), but no legible words.<br>
<br>
To read these signs, mostly what I've seen done is that they've had dialogue added to them (yes, you can make dialogue files for placeable objects). The dialogue doesn't have to have any responses or actual dialogue...it can just display what the signage 'says' (like the name of the inn or store).<br>
