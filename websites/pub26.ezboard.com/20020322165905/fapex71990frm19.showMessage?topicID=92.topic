Default appearance Posted by Rob Bartel - BioWare on Feb 28, 190 at 15:53:31:<br>
<br>
We may dictate your default clothing style (what you see when your inventory says you're not wearing anything) or we may give you a choice. If we do give you a choice, it will be clothing only. I think we can all heave a sigh of relief that NWN will not allow for full-plate skivvies. ;oP <br>
There will be a *lot* of variety in weapon icons (we've got a really sweet approach to icons and you folks are going to just love us for it -- but 'tis not my place to let this cat out of its bag, so you didn't hear any of this from me) but we haven't decided how much of that will be filtering down into in-game models. At the very least, each basic class of sword will have its own model. Depending on how things work out, there could be a lot more. <br>
Still a daggers up our sleeves,<br>
<br>
Colours and appearances Posted by Trent - BioWare on Mar 29, 190 at 12:31:25:<br>
<br>
There are six basic colours a character can have: 1) skin tone 2)hair tone 3)primary cloth colour 4) secondary cloth colour 5)primary armour colour 6) Secondary armour colour. <br>
In addition to the colouring system you can choose your sex, race, phenotype and set a theme by the type of armour you purchase. In terms of the character's face, you can select from a variety of facial hair options and other additions. Beyond this you have the character portrait as the ultimate form of individual expression. <br>
P.S. Love those british spellings  <br>
<br>

<br>
We're just starting to get some cloth and leather armors models together and textured now. We had been focusing on the full plate for a little while, just to work out a few issues, but you'll be seeing much more variety in the coming months. And by the way, while these screenshots are from the new engine, new things are being added in every day (the current build puts these latest screenshots to shame, if you can believe it). <br>
<br>
Posted by Trent - BioWare on Apr 06, 190 at 11:07:23:<br>
<br>
With the armour in NWN we are building five variants per armour class. These variants each subscribe to a different &quot;theme&quot;. We have rough names for the themes and they are:<br>
Evil - Dark fantasy look. Think skulls etc..<br>
Fancy - Think elven themed armour<br>
Barbarian - Hides and patchwork plate.<br>
Utilitarian - more realistic medieval period armour<br>
Punk - Extreme looking armour. Think nasty jagged spikey things.<br>
We hope with these themes and the other customizations available that you the player will be able to find a look that fits your style of play. <br>
<br>
Re: Character appearance Posted by Scott - BioWare on Jun 05, 19100 at 09:21:33:<br>
<br>
We are still working out some of the details of what can be customized on the characters. Ask again later. (&quot;hmmm I sound like my magic 8-ball&quot;) <br>
At the very least you will be able to choose a head/hair style, skin color, hair color, body type (normal, fat, skinny, heroic), race and sex. We are still working on the number of armors and clothing types. <br>
<br>

You will be able to change all colors on you character. Skin, hair, two clothing colors and two armor colors.There will be helemets, hats, facial hair, hair styles, jewellery (not a typo that's canadian spelling eh!), and lots of pointy things to run with...<br>

Rob Bartel Female Characters<br>
<br>
Hello Jade, and thanks for your very good comments.<br>
<br>
I totally agree with your position concerning gender image in NWN. I realize now, we made a mistake using <br>
that particular test character for screen shots. That figure is only a 'place holder' and will not be in the game. <br>
We have made a number of changes to how we build the models since we made Dana Warrior Princess.<br>
<br>
I agree that female characters should not be forced to to fit a sterotypeed 'sexy girl' image.<br>
<br>
Role playing is all about designing your own character, and we want to give the players as much choice as <br>
possible. I have been designing a wide variety of clothing and armor styles for both sexes. You will <br>
certainly have the choice to play a scantily clothed maiden if you wish, (may of our players do), but you <br>
may also choose to play a heavily armored female in a very practical set of full plate. <br>
<br>
(The same goes for the males in fact. We have some cute little vest and tights combos for the guys who <br>
want a more festive look).<br>
<br>
We plan to make five 'styles' for each armor class, and 10 for clothing, for each sex. In addition we are <br>
aiming for 200 character protraits to choose from, as well as the ability to load your own portrait art. You <br>
also have a text description to further personalize your character. So there will be a lot of options for role <br>
play.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the opportunity to address this point. Keep on posting those tough questions!!<br>
<br>
Dana Scully, Warrior Princess Posted by Trent - BioWare on Mar 22, 190 at 10:27:17:<br>
<br>
You fellows don't care for our early art prototype heroine? The variety of clothes and armours will provide for many different options on your character's appearance. You will be free to choose what your character looks like and what he/she wears. <br>
<br>
realism...Posted by marc - BioWare on May 31, 19100 at 20:42:35:<br>
<br>
One of the things you have to keep in mind - while realism is great, you are playing a computer game, and we want your character on the screen to be visible on the backgroud, and to be recognizably different from all the other players. I like a little exaggeration, so all the characters don't look alike. But, you are 100% right, this is Dungeons and Dragons, NOT Japanamation, and we wont be going too far in that direction. <br>
<br>

We still have to do a lot of research before we can promise mage robes. We think we might have a solution, but only time will tell. <br>
<br>
Re: Posted by Scott - BioWare on Jun 05, 19100 at 10:52:19:<br>

Right now you can strip you character down to his or her skivvies but that's as far as it goes. I don't know the full details but, if we were to include nudity in Neverwinter, I believe it would mean forgoing our Teen ESRB rating, something we take fairly seriously here at BioWare.<br>

For the record, the Gamma UK article (that's the Knowledge Base...Ed) is out of date. The more flexible armor system outlined in the Neverwinter Nexus interview is what we're now going with. If you want a spikey shin-guard, throw on a spikey shin-guard. If you want some more 'plain-jane' or historical, use that piece instead. Want your wizard to have metal epaulettes on his shoulders, a leather jerkin over his torso, and cloth sleeves and leggings, and chain boots, go ahead. There are plenty of suit-making possibilities within the toolset, and the end result is still treated as per the 3rd Edition rules: a single suit of armor or clothing, with associated AC, Armor Check Penalty, and Arcane Spell Failure values compiled according to its component pieces. <br>

<br>
The variant system is actually allowing the end user to assemble suits of armour in the toolset using component parts. In the game the armour suits are one part, in the toolset a suit is composed of up to 18 different parts. We have a large number of variants of each part, so mixing and matching 18 different parts, from clothing to full plate armour can give you a huge variety. Additionally, armour suits don't have to be symmetrical. If you want one arm of solid plate and the other of cloth, you can make it. The AC of the suit is calculated in the toolset at creation time and applied to the item. If you want a better AC for the item, you can apply a magical effect to increase the protection offered.<br>

Topic: my head is big enough......... From: Rob Bartel Date: Wednesday, November 15, 2000 04:46 PM <br>
<br>
As Blade, uh, sorta mentioned, you'll be able to pick a body type during character creation. Right now, the choices will probably be Average, Muscular, and Fat (we found that Skinny and Average didn't look all that different, given our isometric perspective). As the art content starts coming in for all of the the different gender, race, armor, and body type variations, we may come up with one or two more that are both distinctive and useful.<br>
<br>
25/11/00 Rob Bartel: Co-Lead Designer<br>
<br>
3) The Look of your Character - Here's where the good news starts. There will be literally billions of possible armor and clothing looks in Neverwinter and that's not including the wide range of color variations that will also be available. All of these unique looks will be apparent, both in your inventory and within the actual gameworld. Also, unlike Baldur's Gate, your class no longer determines the look of your character - you do. This allows for a much freer roleplay environment, where you dictate the nature of your character, not us. <br>
<br>
4) Ring Mail Armor - Yup, we've definitely got some. In fact, we've got plenty. The textures the artists are working on look great and the reflective environment mapping is as sweet as ever. We'll be creating plenty of magical versions and you're more than welcome to create a few of your own as well... Elven chain anyone?<br>
<br>
28/11/00 Rob Bartel: Co-Lead Designer -ring mail armor:<br>
<br>
Rolo has it cold. We won't be creating a specific model for ring parts, but we are creating a large number of chain parts, so creating a ring suit could still be possible.<br>
<br>
19/12/00 Trent Oster: Producer cloaks &amp; robes: <br>
<br>
We do not have time in the schedule to create cloaks and robes. I really wish we did, but we don't. The technology isn't terribly difficult, but implementing it, testing it and then creating the new content will take too much time.<br>
<br>
Bits and pieces. From: Rob Bartel Date: Wednesday, November 08, 2000 12:38 PM <br>
<br>
From the player's perspective, armor is single-piece. Not only does this make inventory management much easier, it also maintains the integrity of the D&amp;D Armor Class rules.<br>
<br>
Within the toolset, however, we're allowing you to build individual armor suits in a piece-based fashion. It's a very powerful system and will go a long way towards personalizing the heroes and villains of your modules as well as your own player character, as well. <br>
<br>
3/1/01 Trent Oster: Producer - robes and cloaks:<br>
<br>
We can't support cloaks and robes in NWN in the traditional sense of long, flowing garments. Cloaks and robes in NWN are tighter fitting and shorter as a whole. This is due to the solid part based nature of our characters. We are offering over a million possible combinations of clothing however. Have no fear, your characters will be visually interesting and different from other characters.<br>
<br>
11/1/01 Rob Bartel: Co-Lead Designer - hair: <br>
<br>
We discussed treating separating the head from things like hair, facial hair, hats, etc, but to do so meant having another piece on our character model. Within the engine, the performance cost of additional pieces is small but still significant. This is compounded by the fact that quite a few player models might be onscreen at a time (the NPCs in a busy market square, for instance). For this reason, we felt it was wisest to handle the entire head as a single piece. We may choose to upgrade the system in a future expansion but for now we wanted to play this one safe. <br>
<br>
11/1/01 Rob Bartel: Co-Lead Designer - custom skin/hair colors: <br>
<br>
Decisions on this aren't super firm at this point so a hybrid approach may still be possible. We have considered it and the primary reason not to hybridize the color selection, at least at this point, is that it would require two GUIs instead of just one.<br>
<br>
A secondary reason is that, as with BG, you're not actually selecting an individual color but a color range that typically spreads from light to dark. There are times when the artists pull a few subtle tricks to make thinks look better, though: a thin band of blue in an otherwise gray color range can bring out a more silvery tone, for instance. A bit of brick red can show up as a band of rust running along your blade, etc.<br>
<br>
For now, we'll start with implementing a pre-fab color system because we know it works and we know it will look good. During the testing period, if we find that it doesn't give us enough freedom, we'll look into further solutions at that point. <br>
<br>
Thanks for raising a valid concern<br>

ARE appearences deceiving? (6 of 14),From: Trent Oster Date: Monday, January 08, 2001 02:18 PM <br>
<br>
In NWN you determine the appearance of your character through the equipment you wear and your race,sex and phenotype. If you wish to be a hulking muscular dark skinned mage who wears little clothing you may. If you wish to play an overweight halfling who wears beggars clothes you may. In short, you determine what your character looks like.<br>
<br>
ARE appearences deceiving? From: Rob Bartel Date: Monday, January 08, 2001 04:04 PM <br>
<br>
Right now we're aiming for 3 basic body types: standard, overwieght, and muscular. We used to have skinny but cut it for two reasons: 1) Given our camera angle, it was hard to distinguish between standard and skinny; 2) Skinny armor just plain looks wierd.<br>
<br>
As for number of heads, we have a fair number modeled and a few textured at this point but we're not ready to commit to a specific number. Hats, hairdos, beards, moustaches, etc, are all integrated into the head and won't be swappable.<br>
<br>
We haven't decided on a solid number for skin tones and hair colors yet, either. We had previously wanted RGB scaling but found that no one but the artists knew how to get a decent skin tone out of it. With that in mind, we've opted for a selection of discrete color ranges instead.<br>
<br>
And just to restate what you already know, races will have separate models but classes will not.<br>

Topic: Charaters not what I was expecting From: Marc_taro Date: Monday, January 15, 2001 08:31 AM <br>
<br>
You must have a spy inside our organization! Last I recall we have not shown the full awesome power of our character building system! Guards, find this man and have him executed! <br>
<br>
But seriously, I think you will be pretty happy with what we deliver at the end of the day. Beards and facial features were left out because 3D games lose speed when there are too many separate objects on screen. We MIGHT, (MAYBE) bring them back after other optimizations for speed are done - we shall see what the future brings... But, actually facial features are less important than your clothing/armor, because you don't get that close to the characters. You'll be able to see the final character generation soon, and I think you'll find your number of choices superior to anything else offered in a Dungeons and Dragons RPG...<br>

Topic: Character Sizes, Skills &amp; NPCs, Holy Avenger From: Trent Oster Date: Wednesday, January 17, 2001 08:46 AM <br>
<br>
With character sizes the body types are easier to do, as they don't change the pivot positions in the character skeletons. For each racial variant we have to reworks sections of the animations to compensate for the different proportions and pivot positions. For this reason, we aren't supporting different heights beyond the races.<br>
<br>
Topic: Correctomondo From: Trent Oster Date: Wednesday, January 17, 2001 08:39 AM <br>
<br>
Beards will be included, as will Elves' pointy little ears.<br>
As Cord and Silhan both said, they are hard welded to the head, so you will choose the head you desire, if you want a beard, you can choose from many heads with beards on them.<br>
<br>
Topic: Options on character faces From: Rob Bartel Date: Wednesday, March 14, 2001 01:19 PM <br>
<br>
Richard is correct. You won't have piece-by-piece control over hair, moustaches, hats, beards, etc, because each &quot;piece&quot; we add to the character model costs a little bit more in the engine (slows down performance, etc). Instead, we've gone in and created a bunch of mix-and-match heads on your behalf. As a result, you get a fair amount of variety (including bald dwarves) and we get to keep everything down to just a single piece.<br>
<br>
Topic: Color ? From: Aidan Scanlan aidan@bioware.com Date: Wednesday, March 07, 2001 08:51 AM <br>
<br>
The color selections you will make for your character are:<br>
<br>
Skin<br>
Hair<br>
Cloth x2<br>
Leather x2<br>
Armor x2<br>
<br>
Each of the above categories has a separate selection of 32 colors to choose from. i.e. the selections for skin will be different from the selections for cloth, etc.<br>
<br>
Topic: Cloth animation system From: Rob Bartel Date: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 12:41 PM <br>
<br>
Are you causing trouble again, Cylent? =o)<br>
<br>
Framerate hit might have been one of the factors but there are others, as well. The primary one is that the algorithms we use for the cloth effect don't take collision and sorting into effect. A lock of hair, for instance, might cut through the character's ear in a strong wind. It's not that noticeable on a lock of hair but, if you apply the cloth algorithms to an entire robe, for instance, you'd constantly be seeing your character's knees poking through the fabric as they walk. Also, the movement of the fabric itself would be based on what the pelvis is doing rather than the movement of the legs themselves.<br>
<br>
In short, while our current cloth system looks great and works wonderfully for what we're doing, it's not really a technology that lends itself well to cloaks and robes, etc. When the time comes to tackle those issues, we'll probably take a different technology path (though this one might still be useful for little details like fringes and tassles along the base of a cape, etc).<br>
<br>
Hope that clarifies things,<br>

Armor and clothing in NWN are the same thing. The only difference is how much protection is offered. Clothing/armor is made up of pieces that may cover you from neck to toe. You decide what each body part will be, from naked up to plate mail. You can change neck, chest, belt, pelvis, shoulders, biceps, forearms, hands, thighs, shins and feet. There are six different areas color you can change with 32 colors or environment maps to choose from. The possible number of combinations boggles the mind. Once made (or edited) in the toolset, the clothing is a single item that must be equipped to be worn. Helmets and head covering are not included in clothing/armor and will be a separate equip-able item. So, as a module designer, you have more or less control over the styles of armor and clothing that are available on your server (however players coming from other servers may bring other suits of clothing/armor with them).<br>
