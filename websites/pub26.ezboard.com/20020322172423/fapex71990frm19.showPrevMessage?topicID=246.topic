(PW NWN from here on)<br>
<br>
At first glance it would just seem that the -enormity- of the task.  The patience of your user base would be tried as it takes time not only to flesh out the &quot;base&quot; world but also for there to be changes reflective of the users actions.<br>
<br>
(Static MMORPG Anyone - UO, EQ, etc., etc., ad nauseum)<br>
<br>
That side of it is very easy to see.  But there is another world, a darker nastier world underneath it.  And we must see it to be able to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  PULL THE TRIGGER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  (Sorry different personality took over - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  {Back-Back you Heathens - Begone I say</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The current heirarchy of one section of NWN ecology goes: Tile -&gt; Area -&gt; Module.  Tiles we all understand.  Area I believe is a group of tiles of various sorts that constitute a portion of a server's Module.<br>
<br>
One Area maybe 32x32 (or any such combo) for a large city. While another area may be as large but not for just one thing. A small village that is close to raiders so it there are always some roamin' criter waiting to be whacked or not to be whacked. However that is not my -current- question!!!.<br>
<br>
So Shroud World is going to be a module - A PW NWN Module. The problem with this is flow.  You will see many tiles, you will pass through numerous areas, but you will never truly go through any different Modules.<br>
<br>
A module is the conclusion. i.e. G1 to G2 to G3 (Against the Giants)  You *can't* have that kind of progression in a persistent world. <br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Well, fellow addicts of something not yet tasted, a module while be concluded by someone/some group.  Everyone just no logging on, or getting to 2nd level will have the world end around them (programmatically) to load up the NEXT module.<br>
<br>
It is the transition to something completed (Diablo 2 anyone). in D2 you can have people in the different Acts but the accomplishables don't respawn.  You just progress to the next step up.  You can go back (tich-tich very un-module like behavior. Shame on them) but it will still be cleaned out.<br>
<br>
Now respawning will occur in NWN but where is the since of accomplishment.  Since it is be a persistent world you can't have these types of climaxes.  Change will be, and must be, gradual over time or those of us who don't play daily won't get to enjoy Shroud world fully.<br>
<br>
Heck that limitation may even be monthly.  Think about doing weekly changes - <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Eeeek!.  Even monthly could be a brutal schedule for the Dm as it is not just figuring out WHAT has changed and should be reflected but actually MAKING the changes.<br>
<br>
Daunting task.... Nigh impossible task.  The Dm want's to play sometime and this could quickly become WORK ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I thought there was a 4-letter world filter here!!!!! )<br>
<br>
Even if he has helpers it becomes troublesome...... And trust me Bioware knows this.  Which is why the accept PW NWN but don't really say that it will suceed.<br>
<br>
The answer to that is follow the money........ Cigarette break<br>

<br>
|Deep Breath|<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not talking cash when I said money up there.  I'm talking about reward, karma, the thingey that you wanta.<br>
<br>
And the thingey is adventure.  Accomplishment.  Not just roleplaying - 'cause iff'n that were the case we'd all be on the IRC just a chatting the roleplay and not needing this. (or some lesser solution)<br>
<br>
We want to see our prey.  We want to hunt them.  To stirke them down.  Granted all of us don't want to be doing it OOC, we love the roles.  But if I am playing the role of a knight I wish to persue Knightly endeavors.<br>
<br>
This is where the vault characters and vault playing is going to hammer PW NWN.  I can just connect to any server out there (me 1/2-orcish persona in hand) and go trouncing anywhere I like.  As I like, whenever I like.<br>
<br>
Likely there will always be someplace new as well as some good ol' standbys. (Tribes was that way for me... some servers I could always count on)<br>
<br>
That won't go with Shroud World.  Nada, Nope, Negative Surrah on Vault Characters.  And where would the romps be.  Lord knows CRPGS let us romp.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Portalling</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Must PW NWN are looking at this askance IMHO. But they are looking at it from a competitor perspective. You always have difficulty trusting a competitor... and that is what I've seen written about PW NWN and Portalling.  Trusting the DM who's running the server not to introduce himself as &quot;Hall, Monty Hall. I'd Like a Fellow DM to drink, very shaken, not stirred.&quot;<br>
<br>
But you don't have to portal to a PW NWN.  Just portal to module NWN's.  <br>
<br>
Your PW NWN becomes a hub.  Hubs change slowly. Hubs are thoroughfares, gathering places.  But also with the occasional hiccups.  (Look at most Center Cities)<br>
<br>
A Module NWN could be like neighborhoods.  Sometimes those thingeys change overnight. Same here.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>
<br>
I don't need my PC on weekends. Period.  Goes to waste, dsl too.  Just my life at the moment. Could change, prolly not.<br>
<br>
I could run the certified and apporved Shroud World Module SW23 - &quot;Weekend Warrior Teeth Cutter Dungeon&quot;.  It's up only weekends.  It resets every weekend.  It has several levels or areas.  It accepts ONLY people that PORTAL from Shroud World making it exclusive.  It can be changed regularly without great upheaval.  <br>
<br>
Heck I could even get ticked off with Segal and shut it down. No big loss.  But the gains.... ahh the gains.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at possible answer numero dos &lt;sp?&gt;<br>

Answer 2!!!</span><hr size=1> Another solution is the -mentioned- (by bioware) about the ability to run multiple instances of NWN server.  Same IP different port num.  (Techies will see this gem Eye-mediately)<br>
<br>
Don't know about trusting another's server, leary of portalling. Well, dear friends, just portal to yourself!!!<br>
<br>
With this ability you can have multiple instances running. It can even reduce the number of Areas you need to have for the main hub, as well as creatures and memory hoggin stuff, and shift things over to another instance of NWN.<br>
<br>
Sounds difficult but you can have module dungeons, small ones, in another instance of NWN running simultaneously. Not much in area, not much in creatures.  Relatively small compared to the monstrousities most peeps post about.<br>
<br>
This can also give the leary Master DM (he's the owner not a helper) another NWN to portal to so he can SEE what portalling does.  How to control it and what can't be controlled.<br>
<br>
I like this as well.... That's only becuase I am not a single answer man but a combinator.... or I'm just plain nuts in denial.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Ok.... Let's take my fisrt Portalling Example.  Got dead cpu time, dead dsl time.  Up fer grabs.<br>
<br>
So how do we do this:<br>
<br>
One: Setup so that I only Accept characters From SW HUB<br>
<br>
Two: Each Level of dungeon is a seperate instance of NWN.<br>
<br>
Three: The end of each level leads, portalling, deeper or back to some spot at the SW Hub... Say a wooded glen with a cave, possibly where you entered. (UO dungeons anyone?)<br>
<br>
Four: Limit each level to a certain number of players. i.e. only 8 players simultaneously.  When someone drops or leaves the level another can enter (Realm dungeons anyone?).<br>
<br>
This is just starters - additional thoughts...<br>
<br>
Three Revisited - Each level ends with the culmination of a &quot;boss&quot; creature death. Period.  Module ends - goto auto portal to next server for new module or bounce back to SW hub if module_next is occupied.  <br>
<br>
At the beginning of the next level is only one portal. You might think it leads back to the last level but Noooo it leads back to SW HUB.  Also the loot from the boss might be there waiting for you.<br>
<br>
Hmmm... how to do, how to do.  End level - Boss dies. Dialogue Info for everyone then simulated cutscene which is actually the change over from one server to next.  (Some fading to white or black or whatever)<br>
<br>
Opening scene of next level?  Why you have the dead boss there with a passage or something leading deeper. You now have opportunity to grab quest items or loot as implemented and continue.  Or you can leave.<br>
<br>
No worries about someone just coming along and grabbing quest items becuase Level 2 server only accepts portals from level 1 server, period.  Can't get to level 2 iff'n ya don't level 1.<br>
<br>

<br>
Now ways to play this:<br>
<br>
If you can get some people to host these modules, even if they are hosted only one day per person, you create the virtual NWN version of romper room.<br>
<br>
Also new modules can be implemented with relative ease without having to make major changes to SW HUB.<br>
<br>
Further to break it up even further, that replayability thingey, there can be variations of the level 1's so that one time you go through the traps are here and the critters do this, next time it's a different ball game. This can happen everytime the module is reset(respawned) and peeps moved onward.<br>
<br>
Imagine creating the A1-4 series (Temple of Elemental Evil) but each module has multiple variants that load in sequence or random? (Guess this ain't your Grampa's MMORPG anymore is it?)<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What is the possibility of having the portal scripted to search an array of servers?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If this is possible you can the portal search for the next availble dungeon slot before bouncing the player back to hub due to no room.<br>
<br>
If I am not going to use my cpu Monday I leave NWN server up and running.... And since it is up and running the SW HUB portals them in like sardines even though I normally am not up except weekends.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Multiple Instances of NWN or Multiple Computers, hmmmm?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I saw the thread about getting a dedicated server (nice specs btw) connected up to some ok bandwidth.<br>
<br>
But how about multiple computers on the same b-width pipe? Using a router you can keep a fairly consist IP even with PPOE dynamic ip's (mine hasn't changed in 3 weeks).<br>
<br>
You can also direct your router to specifically direct packets to each machine.  i.e. 193.143.123.109 is your IP.  Peeps connecting to your router with packets for 193.143.123.109:50001 are directed to SW HUB (Machine over on the corner on the hutch by the window) and you may portal them to 193.143.123.109:50020 which the router knows as &quot;Newbie dungeon the purees Newbies&quot; (Machine under the kids bunk beds)<br>
<br>
If you work your areas to portal back and forth you can chunk the cpu and memory needs across two seperate machines as opposed to overburdening one machine.<br>

The key to making some of this work is: You provide the content.... the modules. The direction. But make sure the hook is firmly SW HUB, and firmly scripted.<br>
<br>
Or not.  Just that the portals you use only allow SW HUB.  Which makes you the Portal master and ensures survivability for the PW NWN portion of Shroud World while you work on it.<br>
<br>
And there I think is the money.......<br>

Enjoy this ranting and raving. It doesn't last (might be fibbing) and it's your fault, Segal.  Went to sleep and my last thoughts were about dialogue for Louie.... I dreamt about it and in the ensuing dialogue a module loomed in very near distance. Actually jumped out of bed not knowing what hit me and then ran for the computer before the idea left me. (Age what a wonderful thingey - Anyone want some of my excess?

Actually all this stuff here was tangental to what I was [click - clackety - klacking] into my notepad.  But it'd be a shame to flesh out the module idea more if some of the more salient points of my spiel are not addressed I guess.... and I hate wasting my time.<br>

As for players needing consistant content to keep from getting bored, that is of course a concern and is one of the reasons that Segal has requested of players to help create quests / content in any way they like.  Take even a little of the burdon off of the DM, and you get both more content and his ability to concentrate on other aspects of the server's development.<br>
<br>
Also, just because you are playing on Shroudworld does not preclude a player from also having a vault character.  When there is not alot of quests or adventuring you feel like doing on shroud, players can certainly jump onto the vault servers and check out other situations.  I am sure a few of us plan on trying other servers through the vault in order to see what the game can do, and possibly incorporate it into shroud where it is fitting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/uquintrel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quintrel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kobold Runt</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/25/02 6:46:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://216.40.197.199/webgraphics/clipart/animals/wolves/clipart_animals_wolves_001.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Later we will be.......</span><hr size=1> [qoute]If what you mean by portalling (I got lost reading through some of the last couple rants) is the utilization of multiple servers to have different types of areas, I believe this is being handled.

I figured as much, planned to do the same myself.  Seeing that is.  The only reason I brought it up was that with so much planned content it will be likely... lost my thought... that it will be enticing to play your &quot;vault&quot; character so that you can level up while having the ability to romp anywhere.<br>
<br>
Especially since it is supposed to take a while, vault and SW characters, to actually level up.<br>

My goal is to build a world that is an enjoyable place for my friends to congregate, a world that showcases the creativity of myself and others, and a world which tells a story that people find stimulating.   I know my goal, the process and path to arrive at that goal will very likely be a learning experience but I have established a few basic concepts.<br>
<br>
Expectations vs. Reality – I believe I am being pretty realistic about what I can and cannot do, further, I have made every attempt to educate the player base on the reality of what Shroud will offer.   Shroud does not have a staff of techs, programmers, and customer service people, nor will it ever.  Shroud World is not a commercial enterprise, it is a hobby thus the players should have no expectations of a commercial level product.<br>
<br>
My World vs. Our World – Creating Shroud World has been a dream of mine since high school (and that’s many, many years ago folks).   I have considerable materials already created and a vision of how I want the world to look and feel.  I have built the foundation upon which Shroud World can prosper.   Whether it does or not is 100% dependent upon the players.  The players can build this world into a fantastic adventure or they can sit back and grow bored.    Shroud World will always be ‘Our’ world.    That is why my signature reads ‘Lead GM”, and not something like ‘Creator of Shroud World’.<br>
<br>
Closed World vs. Open World – My definition of a closed world is one that has local characters (characters that you cannot play elsewhere) and is not linked in any manner to the works of a separate entity.   An open world allows players to go out and explore other worlds, but they can do that anyway simply with a different character.   An Open world also allows players to enjoy the works of other world designers, but again they can do that anyway.   What a closed world offers is a constant measuring stick and stable environment so that players can gauge how they have progressed and have pride in their accomplishments.   What a closed world also does is protect the feel of the world and allows you to tell a story (albeit over a long period of time).<br>
<br>
Dynamic vs. Static – I have played in any number of static worlds (AO, EQ, DAOC, and several others) and I enjoyed them all to varying degrees.   A static world can be enjoyable if it is well designed.   A static world also allows you to expand new content quickly because you do not have to worry about the content already created.  A dynamic world allows players to actively effect the outcome and eventually the content of the world.   A dynamic world allows players to be more than human controlled NPCs, the actions of the players can make a difference.   Unfortunately, I do not think a persistent world can ever be fully dynamic without a ratio of content creators that far exceeds those that are consuming the content.   So somewhere in the middle is a common ground that can be strived for.<br>
<br>
Shroud World will be dynamic in a static sort of way (I know, that doesn’t make sense).  The world is being designed so that content will replenish itself (i.e. respawn) and players will be able to extend their playing time by adventuring in areas multiple times.  It will be dynamic in the sense that specific paths taken by the players will cause changes in the world.   This will be visible in many ways; factions will change, NPCs will react differently, and areas will be physically different.   <br>
<br>
Expanding Content vs. Linking to other Worlds – Unlike Baulders Gate or others RPGS, the game is not being built as an adventure, which the characters play through, it is being built as a world that players play in.   So players will have significant new challenges because they can and will wander into places that they are not prepared to deal with.  They will find quests that will be unresolveable with their current resources.   We will continue to expand the world (i.e. add more modules) by adding more hardware.   The current plan is to begin with one server as a ‘Character Lobby’ which will actually be part of the play world but to a smaller extent.   Then we will have 2 servers running modules, initially both servers might be mirroring one module until we have sufficient content to actually need 2 modules.   If we are successful and have a continued need to expand, I expect that eventually some of the player base will be hosting modules as well but I don’t expect us to ever link to any modules that are not Shroud oriented.<br>
<br>
DM created content vs. Player created content – As I alluded to before, Shroud World will be ‘Our World’.   Without active player contributions, it would be impossible for me as the solo content creator to continue to offer a world I would be proud of.   As I stated in another thread (likely in the members section), if every player created just one intricate quest, that would be 60 quests and a significant increase in world content.   The most exciting thing that NWN offers me is the opportunity to watch others be creative.  I have been extremely impressed with the things the player base has created so far, especially those works by Amber.   <br>
<br>
Success vs. Failure – Persistent Worlds will be difficult to accomplish and rewarding to everyone that participates.   The most important aspect of a persistent world will be the dedication placed upon it.   I think most the player base realizes how serious I am about making Shroud World a success and bringing the world alive for them to enjoy.  It will be the dedication of the player base that WILL make us successful.<br>

<br>
How many open worlds do I expect to see for vault characters?   A handful.   There is virtually no benefit to the DM for having an open server when demand will far outweigh supply anyway.   Running a NWN world is so vastly different from running a tribes or half-life server that comparing them is not worthwhile, unfortunately, there is not much similar to NWN with the possible exception of Vampire Masq.  Virtually every world will be closed, server side characters, invitation only.   <br>
<br>
Are there any advantages even to the players?  Some I guess, though my interpetation of enjoyment within a online game centers almost exclusively around the social aspect.  Playing a vault character in an open game will be equal to playing a pick-up game of D&amp;D.  Given a choice between developing a character in a long running campaign or doing nightly pick-up games, I would take the first choice exclusively every time. <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>
