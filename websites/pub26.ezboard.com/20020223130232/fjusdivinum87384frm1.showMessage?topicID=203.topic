If that marks me as a n00b. Fine. What I have done is managed to do is solo my way up to about thwelth before I even considered joining up with a group. As warriors we are generally viewed as tanks for a group, not solo artists. This does not necessarily need to be so. I group with the people I do now because they are more fun than with playing alone. <br>
<br>
First of all, as a new barbarian, you are (Like any character) Going to Die.....A lot. First thing to do. Stay near the Halas Ramp/Newbie Zone. Dont bother wandering too much, exploration comes a little later. Your spawn point becomes the halas ramp naturally. Fetching a corpse thirty In game feet from you is a lot easier than searching around, Finding a SoW for a corpse run running around some more, Doing a few /ooc anybody seen my corpse? Make is easy for yourself. Stay near home.<br>
Secondly, and this is very important also. You don't lose XP for the first four or five levels of your character. So, if this is the case, Why fear death? Lets look at it carefully. Dying makes you loose any stuff you picked up. (Okay, if you followed the first thing, its almost in sight upon spawning) But on a positive note, it gives you five more food and water. Its better to stay in a fight and die. Dont run. No point, Dying is a good thing as long as your corpse isnt too far away. Also, if you are standing still, its easier for someone to come to your assistance (Anyone ever had to chase after three MOBS that were chasing another character that was fleeing? I have. Its a Pain.) Stand and fight. Besides , perhaps your skills will go up some more? Who knows?<br>
    Last thing, Loot everything. Scrounge. Dont leave anything on a corpse, you need every copper you can find to start out with. This includes stackable items like bone chips. Chartacters will pay a couple plat or so per stack of stuff like this. Dont be greedy, Nothing irks other players more than someone demanding 5pp a stack of something. They are paying for the right of not having to gather it themselves. Besides, they are more likely to help out someone who isnt greedy. Also, ruined pelts arent worthless, Do a couple of Shouts for new Tailors. Offer them the pelt if they will make you armor. Some will some won't Dont get discouraged. ( I spent four hours making armor for New characters later after someone did it for me. Got my skill up to 26 and met a lot of cool people)<br>
 QUESTS:<br>
<br>
First, Newbie Quests. Quests are VERY important. (Hint : Ever QUEST. I personally have found the name to be very similar to purgatory, scarey when you think about it. Pass the crack pipe will ya?) Here are a few that every new character should try to accomplish (Worth XP, Money, and Some other reward)<br>
<br>
Cantl<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Located in Mac's kilts) This lady wants White polar bear skins. They are an uncommon drop off the polar bear cubs in the newbie zone) GIVE them to her and she rewards you with xp, a gold, and a piece of tattered armor) Dont knock tattered armor, this stuff will keep you alive longer to kill more stuff to get more xp, get it?<br>
<br>
Female Warrior trainer (In the Pit of Doom Warrior guid): (Dont remember her name offhand) She has a couple three quests. Most give okay xp rewards for new characters, but she is fairly stingy with her item rewards. One is Goblin Ice necklaces(six), Gnoll Fang (three), And Orc Wristbands (Four) You will probably not be able to do any of her quests until level four or higher, but just keep her in mind.<br>
<br>
There are lots more. Best site Ive found is Everlore.com for looking up quests. Check it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, now we get to what to kill,<br>
<br>
1st level - Decaying Sceletons, Gnoll Pups, Goblin Whelps. /con everything (Or right click on it) At first level, all other first level creatures will con white. <br>
<br>
2-3 Everything from First level, plus spiderlings and snow wolves. See if you cant get a better weapon from a skelleton. Even a rusty Longsword is better than that newbie shortsword POS. (I used A rusty longsword until sixth, No twinkage for me. But it worked just fine.)<br>
<br>
4-6 Kill everything in the zone. Polar bear cubs especialy, they give great xp. Collect everything , sell, Do some newbie quests. Get tattered armor. <br>
<br>
Sixth level, Congrats!!!! Time to think about travelling. Blackburrow (South of Everfrost Halas Ramp) Has a pretty good area for gaining xp and some halfway decent loot. gnoll fangs are very cool at your level, You get the xp for the gnoll, plus extra for turning in the fang (What a bargain!) Qeynos Hills just outside is also a good place to hunt. Either of those two places can easily get you to tenth or more if you are careful.  <br>
      If you are going to go far to hunt, get a bind affinity from a caster, as close as you can to where you are hunting. (Remember, Long Runs for Corpses SUCK. Anyone who has done a freeport to Qeynos or Karana's Corpse run w/o SoW will give you a sympathetic look for it. Bind close to wherever you decide to hunt.    <br>
     I wish you the best of luck in your adventures. I had a lot of luck, but there were a lot of friendly people from the Mithaniel Marr Server to help. Find them, befriend them, you wont regret it.<br>

<br>
Level 1-12 Misty thicket right outside of Rivervale...not many there and lost to kill<br>
<br>
Level 12-20 Oasis...Lots of stuff to kill here<br>
<br>
Level 20-30 HHK.....VERY boring but if you are in a good group can pop about a level a day...OR Sol A with a good Puller....<br>
<br>
level 30-40 ToFS with a puller over 51...we were getting 1/4 Blue Bubbles EACH kill here at 25th (Grouped with a level 37 Cleric) and a level 51 necro for protection....there is about 50 spawns here and almost NEVER see more than on group...we were doing about 6 of the spanws and had very little down time..I did nagicam from level 31 to 33 in about 1 day (Rl time about 6 hours)<br>
<br>
Level 40-50 Sol B (Tiger from 40-46 then King from 46-50) BORING as hell (Unless you are pulling) but awesome exp.<br>
<br>
Lots of places by level 50+ to hunt and by this time you are wanting adventure...only so many Frogs one can kill before you lose your mind and do stuff just because... <p>Arch Duke of Jus Divinum <br>

Ya brought a tear to my eye reading this post. My first Warrior was a Barbarian warrior. I recall going through the steps you are currently.<br>
<br>
Here are some of my thoughts to add on here.<br>
<br>
You should not be grouping as a warrior/paladin/ShadowKnight/monk/ranger until level 10 at least. There is no real benefit to doing so when you can and will get better xp and skill increases by doing so.<br>
<br>
Get the names of clerics/shaman/druids onto your friends list! You will need them in the level 10+ game.<br>
<br>
Stats and such, they are a lie. As a shaman and a warrior, they do improve performance but not so drastically that they should be sought after over such things as haste and healing.<br>
<br>
Get yourself into the best armor you can and the best weaponry you can. Armor first, weapons second. At level 15, on our server you should be into a full set of bronze at least. If not, give me a tell in game sometime, I have a full set or two of Black Alloy sitting in my bank.<br>
<br>
Visit warrior specific websites. Sure most of them repeat the same crap over and over. &quot;what race should I be?&quot; and such silly questions.<br>
<br>
here are some such sites.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">eq.castersrealm.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> (see warrior section of this site)<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.steelwarrior.org/">www.steelwarrior.org/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Next, keep ALL your weapon skills maxed out. <br>
<br>
Keep your bandage skill maxed out. After level 24 when your shaman starts doing his Cannibalize Dance for mana, bandage him so he can dance for more mana !<br>
<br>
Killing lots of blues is more efficient xp wise than killing a single even or yellow con mob. At least as a warrior it is.<br>
<br>
Find places where there are TONS of single or double pull mobs and VERY few people to compete with. On this line of thinking, here are my Xp and such for zones (speaking as a barbarian) :<br>
<br>
Level 1-15 Everfrost/BlackBurrow is an awesome area.<br>
6-20 Aviak Guards in Rathe Lake/Beholders Maze<br>
21-30 Runny Eye / Cazic Thule / Solseks Eye<br>
30-45 Nagfen's Lair / Lower Guk (live side)<br>
<br>
And a final note, a quote from a halfling, &quot;Shaman and Clerics are much like underwear. Do not leave home without them.&quot;<br>

I knew there was one more thing I wanted to add regarding xp and leveling.<br>
<br>
The biggest waste of time to me when you are trying to get xp is the corpse run and later on searching for a rez and then waiting for rez effects to fade and for mana to regenerate.<br>
<br>
So, DO NOT DIE.<br>
<br>
Heheh.. sounds easier than it is I know. But that is the key. It is better to zone and come back to try again than to hold and try to squeek that last bit of xp out of that last one you have almost killed. You lose more xp and more time trying to get that last bit of xp thinking 'I almost have it dead, no need to zone.'<br>
<br>
Zone if things look to be going poorly. Mind you I do not mean you should panic, you will get to know the strengths of those you fight with and what you can handle, but always leave yourself a way out. Learn the way to zone from any xp camp you are at so you can get there quickly. Designate a person to call the retreat and go when they call it. No questioning or hesitation, just go. <br>
<br>
Funniest thing I have seen is 3 warriors, a cleric and a shaman all waiting near zone for the others to zone first and they all end up dying as none of them wanted to be the chicken who zoned first.<br>

<br>
Slam is your friend, use it even as a shaman. It will increase as a warrior but even as a shaman you will be able to interupt the spell casting of mobs with this attack.<br>
<br>
Train up your taunt and use it all the time at lower levels to get it up. It will allow you to pull mobs off casters who agro the mobs with a heal or a nuke. It does not work all the time, but it does often enough between your hitting it and the taunt you should be able to keep the caster alive.<br>
<br>
On this thought, keep your casters/healers together. Circle mobs so you can keep an eye on your support classes. If they are getting the beat down, have one of your tanks 'peel off' to get the extra one to hit him/her instead of the caster. <br>
<br>
And yell at your caster if they start doing the silly 'Its on me, get it off' dance. It is IMPOSSIBLE to taunt something off a caster once they start running around in circles to avoid getting hit. This running around only results in a dead caster.<br>
<br>
Hmmm.. think that is it for the moment ::sheepish grin::<br>

There is so much that can be added and all the points you made are extremely valid, Im currently suffering the effects of not maxxing my bind wound skill. I am working on it, I managed to save a little halflings life last night when he started repeatedly falling unconcious due to the poison he couldnt cure ( I think he lost the spell LOL) Anyway, he managed to get back enough mana eventually to heal himself, and he thanked Celtim and Me for saving his life. Made me feel good. Will make me feel better whn I can get the skill from where it is (Like 20 MAYBE) up to where its supposed to be (80-85) Gonna take a while, but needs to be done, because as Is im a mana sponge for healing spells as is, I need to take a little of that burden off the healers. even if it is only a few points of mana here and there.<br>
     As far as equipment goes, Im doing alright. I have some bronze, some banded, and a couple pieces of fine steel. (Breastplate is coming from Illioas/Nagicam) Plus a couple pieces I bought from vendors for cheap (Like less than 50plat a piece, less than what I figured I could buy from a player, so I got the bracers and the visor) <br>
   And now for my only complaint. My blacksmithing skill is what I have been dumping money into recently. My skill is 68 (Lanterns done YEAH!) And Im ready to go on to skewers to become a master, got the backpack full of metal bits, got a backpack full of water, and no molds! I did a little reasearch and the only confirmed place that sells skewer molds is kelethin! I dont mind going there, its a gorgeous place (And Crushbone is a great source of cash to recover from my losses at smithing) but I can only pray that the vendor is OUTSIDE. Barbarians dont fit in any of the buildings. Meaning, this could suck.......A whole lot. Heh. Anybody know where there is another confirmed spot to pick up Skewer molds? One possibly more accessable?<br>

I leave the skill trades for the most part to the dress wearers. Think Molder is getting very good at blacksmithing so you might ask him directly. <p>~I am a little Teapot, Short and Stout.

Iccarus is now a master balcksmith with a skill of 115. Eventually going to start making banded mai, I know of a friend or two that needs an armor upgrade. If anybody needs a set of Banded i will make it for you guys at cost. (Just cost of materials) My time is your time. Just shoot me a tell.<br>
