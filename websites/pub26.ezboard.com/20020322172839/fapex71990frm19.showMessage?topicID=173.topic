Find out how servers can be linked together in NWN, to create a sort of &quot;massively multiplayer RPG&quot;, and if it ever will be possible to get the quests in BG2 which were cut. Click Read More...<br>
 <br>
Question: How exactly will the multi dungeon sharing occur? It would be neat to have maybe a central hub(a city, have you) where pc's can just hang out at taverns, guilds and such... Although I suppose that would make it a massive multiplayer game. Still, t'would be neat. [Submitted by mangafee]<br>
<br>
Dave: Well, let me try to explain some of the basics:<br>
<br>
A ‘module’ in NWN consists of at least one area…it can be as large as numerous city blocks or as small as the interior of a small hut. A module can have numerous areas in it, linked to each other via transitions (the same as BG2, really). So a door to a building could transition to an area which is the interior to that building. Or you could walk down a street at the edge of the map and transition to another city area. Ultimately, there can be as many areas in a single module on a server as that computer can sustain.<br>
<br>
Players log onto a server and enter the module as characters…right now the limit we’re working with is 64 at one time, but that could always change (and regardless will relate to the capability of the server’s computer). That’s a lot of players, surely, but not quite massively-multiplayer. The sharing aspect that you mention comes about through the use of ‘portals’, which are a type of transition that allows a player to move from one module to another…which could be on another independent server entirely.<br>
<br>
So there’s definitely the possibility of setting up some form of multi-server dungeon, and I’ve seen some people in the community planning to take advantage of just that, which is likely what you’ve been hearing about.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: In BG2 you meet your &quot;mother&quot; and Gorion says he could save only 1 child. Then why is Imoen in Candlekeep with you? [Submitted by Shadowstrider]<br>
<br>
Dave: Gorion could save only 1 child when he and his companions attacked the temple of Bhaal where the PC was going to be sacrificed…and this meant he had to choose between saving the infant PC and saving the young Sarevok. Imoen was never at that temple (nor do I think it was even implied that she was)…Gorion finds her years later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: Will there be a ToB Mac version?<br>
[Submitted by Penta Spellstrike]<br>
<br>
Dave: BioWare wasn’t involved in the translation of BG2 to the Macintosh…the publisher, Interplay, has been managing that process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: Any chance of ever getting a file that finishes all the quests you guys cut down on? <br>
[Summary of many people asking...]<br>
<br>
Dave: If only it were that simple. There is no ‘magic’ part of BG2 that contains all the quests that were deleted or shortened which can be regained with a file. We cut all that stuff for good reasons…either it just wasn’t working (too many bugs) or it had to be taken out because we couldn’t add any more. In the middle point of production, we could have kept adding and kept adding story and features until our faces turned blue…at some point we had to say ‘stop!’ simply because the alternative would be to never finish the game. All these cut plots that have been mentioned from time to time sound interesting, I’m sure…but keep in mind that the vast majority of them never made it past the planning stages and the few of them that were actually started very likely only had dialogue written for them and no actual scripting or testing. So the only way the cut quests could ever be restored would be for us to start work again from scratch, using our old design notes…but that would be the same as doing an expansion with no other benefits for using the old material to speak of. Which is fine, I guess, were we thinking of doing an expansion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: Though levitation are abilities that are not going to be hard coded into the game, could they still be implemented to almost their full extent through scripting? For instance, you come to the moat of a castle. You did the quest to get the levitation scroll. The mage in the party uses the scroll to cross the moat (i.e., the scroll disappears and he appears on the other side). He pushes a plank over the moat allowing the rest of the party to cross. They sneak around to where the castle wall is less guarded and less smooth. The thief in the party throws down a rope so the rest of the party can join him. Would that be possible? Could the proper class restrictions for the spell and difficulty for the wall climbing be implemented?<br>
[Submitted by Star Moose]<br>
<br>
Dave: Yes, but it would have to be scripted on a case-by-case basis. Let me point out an example in Throne of Bhaal…we had no ability to climb ladders or such in the game, right? Yet in the graveyard cavern area in Amkethran (where you encounter Vongoethe the Lich), there are a number of platforms which can only be accessed by ‘climbing’ the ladders. We just scripted triggers over those ladders, so when you clicked on them the player would approach…and be ‘jumped’ up to the top of the platform. I believe we even scripted a check based on the character’s Dexterity to determine the success (they were rickety ladders).<br>
<br>
You can do the same thing in NWN…though the scripting would actually be easier than in ToB as the scripting language in NWN supports doing things like skill &amp; attribute checks and is much more flexible. It does have to remain a work-around, however, as the engine wouldn’t do something like that for you without effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: What can you tell me about Baldur’s Gate Deluxe? (EBgames are taking pre-orders) Is it a updated version of BG1 with enhancements like bags, TAB highlight function, 800x600 support, kits, dual wielding?<br>
[Submitted by Markus]<br>
<br>
Dave: As I understand it, it’s a rebundling of BG1 and TotSC called Baldur’s Gate: the Original Saga…and that’s it. There’s no technical enhancements or additional content that I’m aware of.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: Will they have public boards for their new Star Wars game? That is one of the great things about BioWare and Interplay/Black Isle. Are they going to look for fan input for those games? Any news they can share?<br>
[Submitted by Nausher Ali]<br>
<br>
Dave: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic will most likely get its own forum area at the BioWare boards at some point. It would have to be at a stage where we could discuss it at length with you fans, though…or what would be the point of opening up an official forum? All that would do is invite speculation and make all of you annoyed at the lack of official information. Once more announcements have been made regarding the game, that’s probably when you’ll see the official boards.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: I noticed that in BG2 Imoen has a belt that cannot be removed, but is gone when you re-acquire her in the asylum, what was the belt for?<br>
[Submitted by Brian Schaaf]<br>
<br>
Dave: Have you read the description? Beyond that, there is a technical reason. Initially, we didn’t have the ability to add states onto creatures directly as we do now. We had to put items on them that conferred those states as equipped abilities. We originally put an invisible item with no icon on Imoen’s creature file that made sure that she couldn’t be killed while she was in the original Irenicus dungeon…if she got to the point where she would have, she had to run off and be present for the cut-scene with Irenicus once you escaped. Very late into production, however, one of the testers noticed that you could still select ‘something’ in her inventory’s belt slot…and that attempting to drag it anywhere would cause the game to crash. We didn’t want to play around too much with that portion of the game, since it was already supposed to be solid…so instead we made the belt real and gave a vague reason as to why Irenicus might have put it on her. Much of what he did was ultimately unexplained, after all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: After what I have experienced before, mages always seems to be the best fighting characters in books/games, with their devastating magic...but in BG, I don’t know, and I think they should be better. A level 40 mage should beat any other level 40 character I think, because magic is a much more powerful tool than swords and bows. They should rather be harder to advance with, and to get the spells. And when you lvl up in BG shouldn’t the time between spells decrease, so that you could cast spells more rapidly?<br>
[Submitted by Sindre]<br>
<br>
Dave: There are many players out there who would disagree with you, I’m sure. I’ve seen the mage vs. fighter argument on the message boards flare up numerous times. As far as the casting time between spells go…no, according to D&amp;D rules, spells take a set amount of time to cast no matter what level you are. There are a couple of powerful items in the game, however, which do shorten the casting time for a spell (the Robe of Vecna is one, I believe)…but the only thing which allows you to cast spells at a faster rate than one per round is the 9th level spell Improved Alacrity. The amount of power that gives a mage, when used right, is really quite over the top. <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>
