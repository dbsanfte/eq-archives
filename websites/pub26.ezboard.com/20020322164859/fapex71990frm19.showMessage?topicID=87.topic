Scripting and Conversation Editor: Learning how to script will take some time, obviously, but it's not too hard if you don't start off trying to be too ambitious. <br>
<br>
One really cool thing is that the game will come with lots of pre-made scripts that you can drop right in, all with explanations on what they do. (These also work as examples) <br>
<br>
The modules that come with the game will also serve as examples of how to do various things. <br>
<br>
Best of all, the conversation editor is drag-and-drop and has user-friendly pull-down menus for the scripting. Without worrying about translating what you're writing, it can be as long and intricate as you like, too, with conversations across multiple characters and as many player responses as you wish. <br>
<br>
More on Conversation Editor: Well, I don't want to talk too much about it because there are likely going to still be a lot of features in flux, but I really can't get over the conversation editor, myself. <br>
<br>
I spent a couple of years working with the BG dialogue editor and I truly wish that I'd had this one to use. With the BG editor, you entered dialogue by string...you would have a big box up top that had the current string (which was whatever the NPC was saying). <br>
<br>
Below that you could add various PC replies (or nothing if it was linked to another string...'CLICK TO CONTINUE'...or was the end of the dialogue). You could do scripting on the same screen (just type it in), but there were a lot of other frustrations. <br>
<br>
For one, every time you entered a string, it had to be inserted into the database. As time wore on, that could take anywhere from 2-20 seconds per string, depending on how busy the servers were. May not sound like much, but when you type really quickly it can seem like forever waiting to move onto the next sentence. <br>
<br>
For another, when you had really complex dialogues that linked between different characters (like with interjections) or linked a lot back on itself, it could be really hard to keep track of things. A lot of times we would have 'dangling' links that we wouldn't find until QA months later and not remember where it was supposed to go. Bad bad bad. <br>
<br>
Even WORSE, if you had dialogues that had a set of questions (PC responses) that needed to be repeated, you only had two options...one, link back continually to a single string with the same set of responses (even if a question had just been answered) or two, re-type the PC responses in new strings. <br>
<br>
How is the conversation editor better? Well, for starters: <br>
<br>
- You type a string and it is entered instantly. <br>
<br>
- You have a big screen where each string is tracked visually in a fountain-type format. You see what links to what, what the responses are, who's saying what (PC responses and NPC lines are in different colors and not only have names attached but you see the portraits as well)...and if it's taking up a lot of space you can 'minimize' a section (you click on the '-' sign next to it and all the links that followed that string disappear, leaving a '+' sign) or even double-click on a string to get rid of everything else that you're seeing so you can focus only on the links from that string and nothing else. <br>
<br>
- Want to link a string to some other lines that you've already typed? Easy! Click on the string you're linking from, drag to the one you're linking to and voila...it reproduces the linked string below...greyed-out, too, to tell you that the link may go on from that point but it does so elsewhere. <br>
<br>
- Want to link to a PC response over again? No prob. Click-and-drag, like above...the response appears greyed out below your string. You can even mix new responses and linked responses. <br>
<br>
- Want to change the order of the responses? Pull down a menu, change your 'drag' option to 'order' instead of 'link' and click-and-drag the response to wherever you want it. <br>
<br>
- Scripting's easy (as is making new and saveable scripts on the fly), you got options to tie dialogue to animations (want your NPC to laugh while its talking?), etc. etc. <br>
<br>
There's lots of other things I could rave about, but as I said the whole editor's still subject to change. Even if we end up keeping 75% of what I've mentioned, I'll be happy. It is just so easy to use, I can't stress that enough. And that's not just me as a developer talking...that's me as a writer and a gamer. <br>
<br>
OK, enough gushing out of me. It's late and I gotta write on that editor all day tomorrow...if I keep talking about it I'll be dreaming about it, too (and that can't be good...) <br>
<br>
Game Areas Look Empty: Just a comment on something said by an earlier poster, where they said that the 2D art in BG looked a lot busier... <br>
<br>
To a point, this is true. But I will say, from my experience working with the game, that how dense the area is depends on how dense you want to make it. And when we jump into an area at this point, keep in mind that for the most part no other characters or items have been placed there. <br>
<br>
You can make a city or forest area complete with wandering peasants, animals and what-not, up to the point of your computer's capacity (what that ceiling will be, though, I personally don't know yet). Even items can be placed and will show up on-screen. <br>
<br>
So as far as the areas looking relatively empty, this will change as game gets closer to completion and full-blown modules/areas are being crafted (what you can slap together in 5 minutes is fairly cool...what you can put down with some effort is pretty amazing). <br>
<br>
Specs and System Performance: Q. I'll bet, but with my little 750 mhz will I experience slowdown in areas like towns that have a lot of sprites? <br>
<br>
That's something that will have to be answered a lot later in development. The idea is to optimize it as much as possible...especially if we're going to ensure you can have a lot of players on one server, right? But system specs are something that can only be speculated about at this point and I am not the one to do that (when the programmers start talking, my eyes roll up into the back of my head...they find it so annoying...) <br>
<br>
NWN Graphics: Just one quick comment: <br>
While I think the graphics in NWN are great, there is a certain limitation inherent with how NWN is being set up. In a game like Quake 3 or whatever (even the Star Wars RPG we're working on) it's a very different thing to make an area from scratch and to have something that's modular enough so that it can be re-used. <br>
<br>
We can get the artists to sit down and do a level in 3D that they can tweak and add detail to repeatedly...and it would be top of the line...but it would certainly not be useable for anything else. <br>
<br>
But doing a tileset that can be pieced together and look somewhat natural and flow is a little different. <br>
<br>
Points on putting more details and such are certainly valid too, though. Personally, I think the character avatars are looking much better than I would have expected them to...and all the different armor/weapon/item types and visual representations are pretty cool. <br>
<br>
Intelligent Animals: I believe Familiars have been commented on, but I'm not 100% sure I remember what that was, so I won't try to repeat it here. <br>
<br>
I will say, though, that you can apply any kind of scripting and/or dialogue to any animal. If you want to take the animation for a deer, say, and give it stats and abilities and intelligent dialogue then you can do that without any difficulty. <br>
<br>
There's even no reason why you couldn't script an animal henchman, either. <br>

Can you Play Offline?: Yes! There is no need to ever connect to the Internet to play Neverwinter Nights or use the Neverwinter Nights Toolset if you don't want to. <br>

Info on Official Module Storyline: Well, I could tell you that, as an elf of Neverwinter, Lady Aribeth has a special connection to the city's elven founder, Lord Halueth Never. His tomb, long since lost, is said to be guarded by the swords of his 12 sons who have died, one by one, and taken their place beside him. The youngest of these sons, Aertriin Never, still serves as Neverwinter's protector and the Commander of its respected militia. Having to order that same militia upon its own citizenry, driven mad by the Wailing Death or eager to break quarantine and escape its clutches, has not been an easy or an honorable task. But Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher, even Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun himself, have convinced him that the dirty deed is necessary -- and so his militia line the walls of the city that his father once founded, their crossbows trained upon its infested streets. <br>
<br>
Heroes Wanted... <br>
<br>
Building the Storyline: The continuity vs. non-linearity debate comes up with reasonable frequency around the office and it's something we juggle with in NWN. Back in the early days, we had plans for well over 100 hours of gameplay, with 7-8 modules in every chapter. The idea was that the player would not only be able to choose what order to play them in but also choose which ones to play at all. Reality, of course, has since set its cold, damp fingers upon our neck and we've had to scale those over-ambitious plans back -- but don't worry: it's been a good thing, allowing us to pick the cream of the crop and focus our efforts on making them fun. <br>
<br>
The official campaign now requires you to play all of the modules (1 point for continuity) but we're still letting you choose what order to play them in (1 point for non-linearity) as long as you play the individual chapters in order (another point for continuity). Within the individual modules, you will have clear objectives that you will need to meet (continuity) but you will always be presented with various means of meeting them (non-linearity). You get the picture. <br>
<br>
One other point of note, however, is the potential presence of other players and how you choose to interact with them. The official campaign actually plays with that idea a little (one of the perks of playing through the campaign in multiplayer). So, because other players are all unique and will interact with you in unique ways, your interaction with them is inherently non-linear. That said, we attempt to channel that interaction in the official campaign, in the name of continuity. At the same time, we'll be presenting you with a complex range of choices and options in this regard, so we're right back to being non-linear. <br>
<br>
Neverwinter has been an exciting project to work on, so far, because we're charting a lot of new territory in terms of how we think about story. It's a different beast than anything that's come before but I believe it to be a better beast - one that manages to have more story continuity than anything we've done before while, at the same time, providing the player(s) with more options, more meaningful choices, and more non-linearity than anything we've done before. As always, you'll have to give us some feedback on what we did wrong and right in this regard once you've had a chance to play the official campaign. <br>
David Chan (Audio Producer)<br>
Sound: Triggers and Formats: A lot of what you are speaking of can be triggered in script. If you are good with scripting you will be able to make a pretty cool custom audio scape. At this point I think we are going MP3 for music, although Ogg Vorbis is a pretty cool idea. Sound FX will be .wav files most likely. In the ens we need to use formats that are cross platform compatible. <br>
