Have you decided on user-made content yet? How will you encourage people to make there own textures, sounds, models or AI scripts? Are you considering using GMAX? <br><br>[Greg] We have given considerable thought to how players will be able to add new art, sound, and music content to the modules they create. We have a designed a system that we think should make people happy. I'm not going to discuss it though until we've totally nailed it down though. Once we've got it totally figured we'll be sharing it with all of you. <br><br>With regard to tools such as GMAX used to create art - it's something we're certainly open to (and coincidentally we use 3DS MAX for all of our 3D development at BioWare) and we will consider when the time is right. <br><br>People will be able to create their own AI scripts within our toolset - we are shipping a basic text editor and compiler that will make creating scripts fairly easy (it includes descriptions of commonly used functions and similar little features to make script creation more smooth). <br><br>2. More details on Henchmen... Is the limit total, or per each type? Can they level up? What sort of built in features are there to support them (i.e. leave if your reputation with a certain faction drops below a certain level). <br><br>[James] <br>a. You can only have one henchman. You can have a total of five types of companions, but only one of each type. Therefore you could have one henchman, one summoned monster, one animal companion, one familiar and one dominated monster. <br>b. Yes, they can level up, BUT this is a designer scripted function. There is no built in level up system for henchmen (as in BG). What we do is replace the henchmen with a new higher level version of the henchmen when you ask him to level up through dialogue. <br>c. There are no built in features to support henchmen at this time. All of a henchman's actions must be done through scripting and dialogue. We'll probably include a henchman template that mimics the actions of our campaign henchmen. <br><br>3. How many people/monsters/items can be onscreen at once without a performance hit? <br><br>[Trent] This is a very difficult question to answer in an accurate fashion. Right now we are still optimizing the engine on a daily basis so our benchmark changes. The largest issue with creature numbers is the hardware you have running the game. For our extremely low minimum spec system (PII 300mhz, TNT2, 96Mb of Ram) you can turn down the graphical detail to bring up the frames per second the game is rendering. For a higher end system you can turn on every graphical option and witness NWN in full glory. It is possible on a high end system to cover the entire visible area with creatures if you so desire. On a lower end system to keep performance up it is best to limit the number of creatures in one area to a more reasonable level. <br><br>4. Now that you have a publisher and have resolved your legal matters we are still not seeing screen shots, movies etc.- why is that? <br><br>[Ray] We apologize for the relatively quiet period in PR recently - this will change momentarily (in fact, it probably has already by the time you read this!). Out of courtesy to our new publisher, Infogrames, we wanted to ensure we approached future PR for Neverwinter in way that was consistent with both BioWare's and Infogrames' preferences and goals. We've now met several times with Infogrames staff, and the great news is that we are both very excited about the potential of Neverwinter, and we have a plan worked out for the PR on the game - hence, the PR (screen shots, movies, community site, and a few very cool surprises in the next couple of months) will be rolling out soon! We have a lot of great ideas that we're looking forward to providing to our fans. <br><br>5. How does chat work? Whisper? Yell? Shout? OOC chat? How much control do DMs/Module Creators/Server maintainers have over what chat-types are allowed? <br><br>[Trent] For chat you have the basic options such as shout, whisper (which is also tell), a normal chat mode, an OOC(Out Of Character) chat, a party wide chat and a special DM chat. As a user you can toggle which messages appear in your chat display. You also have the option of splitting your chat into two panes and setting different filters per window. You can for instance set it up so all the in-game combat rolls appear in one panel and only party chat appears in the other window. Right now all chat types are enabled and server operators do not have the option of disabling them. This has been a request from our fan base in the past and if we can fit it in before ship we will. <br><br>6. Is there a possibility of NWN coming out for a console system like Xbox? <br><br>[Ray] This is a really interesting idea - one that we have and will certainly talk about with our publisher, Infogrames. In many ways Neverwinter has always been designed with other systems in mind - after all the game is being co-developed for Mac and Linux, for example, and the interface (the radial menu system) is one that would potentially work well with a console controller. We don't have any specific plans at this time for the Xbox but it would be something well worth exploring - the Xbox is a great system and one that BioWare definitely plans to support as a company. <br><br>7. Will you consider raising the minimum specs for a system to run NWN now that you have a new publisher? <br><br>[Greg] Definitely not! We want Neverwinter Nights to be playable by as many people as possible! Just because we support slower systems doesn't mean that the game won't look amazing on higher end systems. Our graphics group is working very hard to make the graphics engine in Neverwinter Nights extremely scalable - the game will look good on a lower end system, but it will look sizzling on a higher end system. <br><br>8. How many CDs will NWN be, or are you using DVDs? <br><br>[Greg] We're still working out how our data will be arranged. We haven't received all of the final voice, music, and sound effects so we aren't able to determine how we're going to structure the data on the final version (this is something we learned from the Baldur's Gate series). Our goal is certainly to use less CDs than the Baldur's Gate games. <br><br>Our publisher, Infogrames, would be responsible for determining if Neverwinter Nights will also be shipping on DVDs. I'm quite certain we're never going to ship on DVD only (CDs are still the essential media for most gamers), but there's also no reason why Neverwinter Nights won't be able to ship on DVD that I'm aware of. I believe it will end up being a Marketing and Sales decision. <br><br>9. Importing of BG and BGII characters? <br><br>[Preston] In NWN we will not be supporting the importing of BG characters. In the past we had expressed a desire to do so, but after recent events we revisited the earlier decision. We now have a slight conflict regarding this feature, as NWN in published through Infogrames and the BG line of games are published by Interplay. We also found this planned feature to be somewhat redundant after we noticed our QA team had already re-created all their favorite character from the past using the toolset. <br><br>10. What are some things that are being considered for any expansion packs that might come out? For example Climbing, Psionics, Prestige Classes and feats from additional official source material like Song and Silence, or Sword and Fist? <br><br>[Trent] I have to be honest. At this time the entire team has a serious case of tunnel vision. Every thought is on how to get NWN finished and polished to a level we are happy with. <br>After NWN releases we will all take a break and then we can start thinking again about the future. <br><br> <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>Lead DM - <a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a> <BR>A NWN Persistent Campaign<BR><i>And so it was that the gods gifted upon mortal men the varied treasures and mankind was changed for the better and worse, but forever changed. </i></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=252.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blPrevTopic12.gif" border=0></a><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=252.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blNextTopic12.gif" border=0> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=252.topic><img src=http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blAddReply12.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.emailToFriend?topicID=252.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.threadControl?topicID=252.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=252.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=252.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub26.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="apex71990frm1">Apex General Chat<option value="apex71990frm3">Apex Members Only<option value="apex71990frm4">Zone Guides, Strategies and Loot Lists<option value="apex71990frm5">Apex Charter and Policies<option value="apex71990frm7">Officers Area<option value="apex71990frm10">NWN - Campaign Rules<option value="apex71990frm11">NWN - Scenerio/Plot Info<option value="apex71990frm12">NWN - GM Chat<option value="apex71990frm13">NWN - Quest Forum<option value="apex71990frm14">NWN - Fantasy Works<option value="apex71990frm15">GM/Volunteers Policies and Procedures<option value="apex71990frm16">NWN Volunteer Forum<option value="apex71990frm18">NWN - Links<option value="apex71990frm19">NWN - General Forum<option value="apex71990frm20">Member's Forum<option value="apex71990frm21">Scripting Library<option value="apex71990frm22">Persistent World DMs Only<option value="apex71990frm23">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/bapex71990>NeverWinter Nights - Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19>NWN - General Forum</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://Shroudworld.com">NeverWinter Nights</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
