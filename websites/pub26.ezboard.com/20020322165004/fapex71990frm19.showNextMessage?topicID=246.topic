&quot;Louie, Louie, Oh Yeah&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hiya, hiya. Whadya need today?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; A short middle-aged gentleman asks as you walk in. He gestures around him, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Is there anything, anything, I can get for you.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
You look, you wander, and you glance around. &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gee my grandpa's attic wasn't this bad!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; As continue turning gathering in the slapdash clutter of the place you wonder how the grapevine could have been so wrong about this being &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the place</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; to find what you are looking for so desperately.<br>
<br>
When you start looking for the exit the shopkeeper blows the dust off of a wardrobe standing to one-side, obviously groping for the handle.  During it's brief opening you see inside a complete set of plate mail that sparkles as if the smith just finished the last touches.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ya know you'll catch flies with that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;, he reaches up, pats the underside of your chin, closing your mouth for you. &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I have the best selection of almost anythin', sometimes everythin', in this here town.  Everyone comes and gives me first offer on loot and treasure and those odd I-don't-know's that they find when on the road, even when under them there roads.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I generally give best price to buy things, I like know'in everyone can come to me, and I give a very minor mark up on things as well.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; His voice takes on an oily manner;   &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> All your needs are my concerns.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Now I see that look in your eye.  No I can't get you everythin' but if I don't have it I might know someone who would.  And if I don't someone who would I can at least tell you where's the best place to ask.  I don't just sell equipment mind you.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Your curiosity peaked you start really looking over all the displayed wares with a critical eye. As you do so you try your hardest to figure out what half of the items could be and what the other half might be.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Now I have to admit that I don't always believe where everyone says they got somethin', sometimes the stories I hear are just a tad bit wild.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; He gives you a curious look, then he gestures over towards a dimmed section of the shop, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Like for instance take a look at this here fine dragonhide belt.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> See now, this here lil guy comes in and says how much for this.  Well I look at it and figure not a whole lot right?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; He pushes his forefinger against the side of his nose while his eyes light up with mischief, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Of course I was a thinkin' to myself he'd be wanting a favor of my not member'in who I got it from, right? And them type of favors cost I'll tell you. Integrity is downright expensive in this here town!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> But then he puts it on and picks up that there wardrobe like it was nutt'in. Well give him my let's get this doggie going look and we starts a haggl'in.  He's acclaiming that he not only had the belt made but killed and skinned the dragon just last week and I know he sold a lil something on the sly three days past.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> So I looks real close and notice just how familiar it was and mentioned it. Well whadya know the price drops right fast at that point.  You might say I got it for a steal.  Heh-heh, steal get it.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ahh, I see that you're a might interested in it. Well how's about 600 crown for it?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
You think about his reputation and seriously debate your next statements. However finding no other choice you relate to him your story minus one or two salient, and possibly embarrassing, details.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ahh, tis a story I have heard all to often in this town. With the look on your face I should have known.  It is nice indeed-y that all them there adventurous types told you where to find me. I think I can help out a decent fellow such as yerself who is trying to do right by a </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;friend&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> .  How about 300 crown?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
He quickly holds up one hand in front you as your shoulders swell from indignation, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> No funny stuff or I'll tell everyone how you gave me trouble and you don't want that do you? No? Good, I'm glad you heard how well loved I am, or at least, how needed I am.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
You grimace as you really have no choice. However your sense of satisfaction is mollified by the grim demeanor that your hard earned money to this leech.<br>
<br>
 As you turn to leave he reaches out and grabs your arm, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Now remember Louie's policies. If anyone asks where you got that, and anything else you might buy, you proudly tell them </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> At Phukivyno's, where everything's gotta go and fast</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Oh and by the way I charged you an extra hundred because you didn't tell me the belt was really yours in the first place. Have a nice day.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>

Description of Site and Proprietor: <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Louie is a fence but he prefers to only work with adventurers. He knows that most of them are usually selling things that are hard to find a fair price for.  And knowing how thorough most adventurers are he can also be sure that the owner isn't coming by later in the day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Louie has sold things, and loose interpretation on things, to many groups of adventurers.  He has actually come to enjoy providing for their needs.  He will not, almost ever, sell to anyone else but an adventuring party or person.  The only exceptions to the rule is a couple of retired adventurers in town and, unfortunately, to the licensed members of any guild in town.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why unfortunately is the case?  Well selling to a mage from the guild is one thing.  Selling to one of the Thieves or Assassin guild members can be quite another. Louie happily pays any &quot;protection&quot; fees associated with doing business in town.  He can usually count on getting a discount from being a retired guild member.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Louie's Shop is actually a marvel in terms of merchant skills and magic.  The house itself will not allow anyone to enter with &quot;ill&quot; thoughts towards Louie or his concerns.  The must stay outside until Louie asks them to enter (like the old vampire legends).  Some of the chests and containers will only open for Louie, or anyone wearing what appears to be his wedding ring (he's happily widowed), and they will actually, while closed, repair items till they look like new.  Note look like new, it will not recharge magic items in any way.  It will however return weapons and armor to like-new condition over time (Depending on GM's taste), and maybe even upgrading to masterwork material as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Louie will always warn adventurer's about anything he sells.  He can't be cured with an item while inside the shop &quot;as I can not always be certain what anything really is...&quot; so &quot;as-is&quot; definitely comes into play in his life.  Louie does however have one chest that 50% of the time will identify an item, 5% of the time determine charges and finally 1% time command words and curses.  Caveat Emptor I believe are two words that Louie can not spell but he knows them very well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Last but not least Louie will always give a fair shake, that is to nice people. Anyone that gives him grief will almost always find just some little thing wrong with their purchase, usually just when they need it.  &quot;Ahh, a band of ogres. Will I'll just point my Staff of the Magi and..... Eeeeek!  That was the only charge!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gamemaster notes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Louie is the place where adventurer's can find that little thing that maybe they are looking for, if you wish to be nice.  Or that little thing they might happen to need, be it an item or information.  I have never really gotten as detailed in the physical aspects of Louie's shop becuase as an NPC &quot;we&quot; have a lot of latitude with him and his wares. In past history I have never had to roll one combat swing for him and wouldn't bother with keeping a complete adherent track of his stats because he is, in reality, just window dressing for the campaign.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Personality note: When I run Louie I think and try (hope I succeed) in portraying a medieval &quot;Leo Gets from Lethal Weapon type of character&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And please, remember, you don't have to say it the way it is normal said but remember, always remember:<br>
