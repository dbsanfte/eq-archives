<br>
So what is the ‘Vision’ and how will it play out in NWN.   Because NWN is a multiplayer online game, many people automatically go into the MMORPG mode.  I really don’t think that style will be appropriate for NWN because the game will be more focused on the story than on the characters.   Sure it will be fun to gain high levels and have a lot of Uber gear, but there aren’t that many people to show it off too and the majority aren’t easily impressed with +5 Pixels of Doom.   The real focus will be on telling a story, offering quests, and allowing the players to become part of the plot.<br>
<br>
Gaining Experience will not be accomplished by sitting in a room and killing respawning monsters over and over.   I’m not saying that camping for experience is not fun, in fact some of my best online experiences have been sitting in the same spot for hours, killing the same mobs, and enjoying time with some great people.   Because NWN has a much smaller scope, we have to approach some things differently.<br>
<br>
I expect groups will gain experience by going to an area in a dungeon that is approximately their level and clearing as much of it as they can.  Since the dungeons will be designed to be progressively harder as you work through them, eventually the group will come to an encounter that will be too difficult for them.   This is the point where the people that play these type games for the tactics of defeating the hard monsters will really find enjoyment.   Hopefully, the motivation will be more focused on ‘Lets go see if we can get deeper into the dungeon than we did last night” instead of ‘Lets do experience.”<br>
<br>
Though players do get more powerful as they gain a level, which does not mean that they will also be more enjoyable.   There are many reasons not to be focused on gaining levels, in the long run, understanding the storyline will be more important.   Dungeons will be level coded, so some dungeons will become inaccessible after a certain level.  Quests will also be level coded, so gaining levels to fast might prevent the player from doing certain quests.  And finally, the content will be created from the bottom up, with low level content being created first.   No use being level 13 when the highest-level dungeon in the game is only level 10.<br>
<br>
When you are not playing your main character, you can always play a secondary character.  Note however, that twinking such characters will be frowned upon and we will be using the ‘Honesty Policy with a big stick’.   Meaning I am simply going to ask you not to twink characters and let you police yourself.   However, if I happen to notice a level 3 Paladin wielding the Flaming Sword of Army Slaying, I will probably open the editor and make a few subtle changes.   This is a really sticky subject and it is very difficult to determine what is actually ‘twinking’ so attempt to use your best judgement.<br>
<br>
Since the world will be online most of the time and we need to maintain a reasonable level of playable content, monsters will respawn and encounters will respawn.   Respawn in NWN and respawn in a MMORPG are two totally different types of animals.   You wont see monsters respawning every 26 minutes on the dot, most likely the majority of the monsters will spawn on a 6 or 12 hours schedule.   This promotes the idea of ‘Doing the Dungeon’ but it makes sure that there is content for other players at a later time.  Some monsters will have a fast respawn, generally roaming monsters, but you will quickly figure out which ones are which because the roamers don’t give experience.<br>
<br>
NWN allows the GM to design custom loot tables.  That means you wont have Mob A drops Loot A, what you will have is monsters that have a random chance of dropping 5 or 6 different items with a very rare chance of dropping the Uber Loot.   Equipment will be fairly rare for several reasons (see below).    In addition, you will have unique loot items that drop off monsters that are one time kills.   It will be very simple for me to design an NPC and give him an item then toss him into a dungeon some place.  I expect to add a few of these every week when I do the module changes.  These unique items won’t be especially powerful as there is an equity issue when creating such items in a multiplayer environment.<br>
<br>
Loot will be fairly rare for several different reasons.   Most of the really good items will come from quests or during the questing process.   Because players only have a limited number of item slots (maybe 10 or 12) compared to like 27 in EQ or about 50 in AO.  Dungeons and Dragons doesn’t have magic legs, vambraces, breast plate, etc..  it is just one set of armor.   I would prefer that there were more item slots, would make it possible for having more item drops but that doesn’t appear to be the case.   Another factor is the way NWN handles magical bonuses, basically its +1, +2, +3, +4, or +5.   Not a lot of variation there (though you can add many special properties) so its pretty much set in stone that +1 will be a level 4 to 8 weapon, +2 will be a level 9 to 12 weapon, +3 will be a level 13 to 16 weapon, +4 will be level 17+ weapons and the +5 weapons will be epic level type stuff.   <br>
<br>
As I said earlier, quests will be the foundation for obtaining most of the major items.   Quests will be long, hard, and vague; solving these quests will be a community effort or the work of a few dedicated questers.  The quests will to a large degree tell the story behind the game and it will be very important that those that solve the quests educate the rest of the server about the story.    <br>
<br>
There you have a basic summary of what the Vision is.<br>

<br>
At the beginning of the game, there maybe 64 players signed on to go exploring their character, the quests, and the encounters (most players like to try out the new games immediately when they can, which might lead to many people on right at the opening whether or not they plan on sticking around for the long run).  With no experience given to some roaming monsters, the slow spawn time of the dungeons, and possibly 60 people looking for something to do...<br>
<br>
Will Shroud have the amount of content to pacify and entertain 60 people at once in the beginning?  Although most playing on the server might know eachother and be friends with eachother, my bet is that (especially early on) people are going to be looking for the thrill of the gaming environment as much as the social aspect of the server.  How will you ensure that the people playing are not going to feel restricted in their options early on? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 2584<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/21/02 2:14:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The 'Vision' (tm)</span><hr size=1> I really dont expect 64 people on at once, even at the beginning, more like 40-45 maximum.   Most of these people are really only going to play during normal hours (i.e. 5-10 on weekdays, longer on weekends).   But since all the content is reuseable, there maybe some overcrowding initially but it will thin out.   Try going to an Everquest server on release day, 300 in Greater Faydark.  If Sony cant do it with multi-million dollar budgets, then I dont expect I can either.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, after the first couple of weeks, I dont think it will be that big of an issue.   Take the campaign module that comes with the game, it has 60 hours of gameplay included.   If you staggered 6 man groups through it in a persistent style world, you could conceivably host an unlimited number of people.   The bigger problem with content is maintaining content on the back end (i.e. making sure you have enough content continueing to enter the game to keep people occupied.)<br>
<br>
But as a more direct answer to your question, I plan on doing the following.<br>
<br>
1) Area Creation - Creating areas is fast and easy (the devil is in the details as they say).  So creating a number of areas with appropriately leveled mobs is pretty easy.  Then, as time allows, come back in and revamp them to be more intricate and challenging.<br>
<br>
2) Quests - Completing quests will be difficult and time consuming.   Players will have to band together to share knowledge to try and solve them.  This will be a major enterprise initially as players explore the areas and find the quests.<br>
<br>
3) Player-created areas - I expect players to add new content, many of our members are very creative and have already expressed interest in trying to develop content.  Further, people cant complain about a particular type of content missing from the game, my answer will be &quot;No Thieves guild in yet, why dont you create one.&quot;<br>
<br>
4) Community Aspects - NWN is designed in a modular style, scripts and such can easily be ported from one module to another.  I expect to borrow quite a few scripts right out of the official module, change a few words and you would never recognize them.  This will be a huge timesaver, once you invent the wheel, no one else has too.<br>
<br>
5) Dedication - It really all comes down to dedication.  Am I willing to work 40-50 hours per week for the first month to make sure that people have a world they can adventure in?  Sure, I have been waiting for this opportunity for nearly 3 years and cant wait to get started.<br>
