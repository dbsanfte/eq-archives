The bleeding continues and he will not last long regardless of his sturdy constitution.&quot; replies Letaya, changing the crimson bandages carefully wrapped around Rockpit's ribs.  &quot;Most of the harm was done internally.&quot;        &quot;Can he be moved?&quot;<br>&quot;It is really not going to matter one way or the other, death will find him regardless but moving him my hasten the process.&quot;<br>&quot;Maybe Helena can assist us.&quot;<br>&quot;We don't know that,&quot; answers Letaya, whipping away of a grim tear that had fallen to rest upon the tip of her nose.<br>&quot;She is our only chance.&quot; <br>Olan lifted the Dwarf in one mammoth hand and caressed him, as a mother would hold a newborn.   With haste born of desperation, the company worked its way up the sloping path, now heavily covered with fresh snow, to the peak that hold the home of Helena.<br>        <br>The natural born cave entrance rose well above their heads, some sixty feet high at it's apex.  A carpet of small colored square tiles had covered the cave floor, though time had taken its toll leaving the tiles dull and dirty.  The entrance gave way to a foyer, dark and silent, whose ceiling rose to an equal height and the rough-hewn walls were covered with a vibrant panorama.  The painted walls depicted a lush forest of strangely shaped trees, standing gaily among the painted branches where laughing fairies and devious nymphs.<br>A thunderous voice echoed from the far end of the hall, the source not visible, directed toward the company.   The tone, feminine, archaic and melodious, dared the company to answer, &quot;Whose so trespasses upon my step?&quot;<br>The company, startled by the voice, stands silently looking at each other and waiting for someone to reply.   Finally, Father Aslow stepped forward, &quot;I am Aslow, priest of Allenbay.  My friends and I have traveled far to pay homage to Helena.&quot;<br>&quot;This is nay shrine upon which ye can lay ye prayers!  Try my patience not and leave my door as ye found it.&quot;<br>&quot;We cannot, I'm afraid, regardless of the consequences.  We believe that our mission here is important, so important that it allow us to accept any sacrifice.   Further we need your help to aid a friend who suffers a mortal wound.&quot;<br>&quot;Bold ye are Priest.   Doth thy reach my door by trickery?&quot;<br>&quot;No trickery nor treachery, it was destiny.&quot;<br>&quot;Nay ye say, then how does thee stand breathing still when my immortal guardian doth protect the way?&quot;<br>&quot;Your guardian, the lord of the peak, has fallen.&quot; <br>&quot;So thee say....nay I know it not so.&quot;<br>&quot;But my lady, it is so.   A mighty heap of ash lay on the path to your doorway.&quot;<br>&quot;Do ye make pun in my very entry hall?&quot;<br>&quot;Not so, the lord was laid down by very blade that made him.&quot;<br>&quot;A blade, Ye carry the blade still?&quot;<br>&quot;Aye, and the stones of ice have been returned to their sockets.&quot;<br>&quot;And thee one who doth carry the blade is a Knight?&quot;<br>&quot;Aye, given the blade by his master who was also a Knight.&quot;<br>&quot;Alas, the pieces fall to proper place,&quot; whispered the voice from the far hall.  &quot;Then let me greet thee, come forward and we shall converse more upon thy destiny.&quot;<br>The foyer, with its delicate paintings, reached two hundred feet deep into the mountain peak.  The footfalls of the company reverberated off the walls of the empty hall as they approached the end where two tall stone doors lie open to reveal another grand chamber.  Reaching the doors, the party stopped in astonishment at the sight before them.<br>The vast chamber was so large that the opposite wall was not visible in the meager light provided by small beacons near the door that glowed with magical illumination.  The floor of the hall was littered with treasures beyond the imagination of any common man.   Coins of all shapes, sizes, and colors covered the floor so deeply that one would have to wade through them waist deep.  Gems, and jewels, and jewelry lay strewn about as if discarded, precious items so valuable that a handful would by a lifetime of luxury.   Mixed into the trove were the bleach white bones of men whose corpses still wore heavy plate armor or light leather vests.<br>&quot;Welcome,&quot; said the musical voice from the darkness.   &quot;There was a time when gold and silver doth mean to me a great deal, that time has long passed.&quot;<br>&quot;Helena?&quot; asked the tentative Father Aslow, peering into the darkness in a vain attempt to see to whom he spoke.<br>&quot;Aye, Helena is the name given to me by my master but over the years I have known a hundred others.&quot;<br>&quot;Why do you hide in the darkness Helena?&quot;<br>&quot;Darkness? Forgive me, I am accustom to the blackness and my eyes can see thee without but thee has not that ability.&quot; says Helena, the shifting sound of shifting coins fills the air.  &quot;Let me present myself properly.&quot;<br>Helena waded through the dunes of coins and treasures into the light and the view of the company.   Of height at the shoulder seven times a man, Helena passed into the light upon her stout muscled legs.   Pearly white scales flowed down her body from tip of the nostriled nose to spiked filled serpentine tail.   Great pink eyes as large as wagon wheels cast their gaze upon the priest and his fellows.  Her head was wide and carried a great many saber like teeth that protruded not gently from the snout.   Great claws mark the way with prints in the precious treasure, dastardly long and keenly sharp.   She raised herself to full height high above the party who scampered back except for the giant with carried the dwarf still.<br>&quot;Fear not, harm will nay be brought upon thee.&quot; speaks Helena, the grand dragon.<br>&quot;Forgive us, we have never seen such a sight,&quot; trembled Aslow, hands across his chest as if to still the too rapid beating of his heart.<br>&quot;I hold thee words as true, there doth exist only three guardians.  Most mortals who have laid eyes upon them have not carried breath much longer.&quot;<br>&quot;Miracles!&quot; cries Letaya.<br>&quot;You speak of the three guardians of the key?&quot; asked Aslow.<br>&quot;Aye, none other, though many lessor dragons roam, only three like I.&quot;<br>&quot;We are in grievous need of your aid for our friend, who was sorely wounded in the exchange with your guard.&quot; pleaded Aslow, casting a long glance upon the limp body of his ally.        &quot;Worry not, bring him to me and I shall cast away his consumption.&quot; said the dragon, pointing one long razor claw at Olan who comes forth without a word.<br>&quot;We thank you, he is good friend and a valuable member of our company.&quot;<br>With delicate care, the great dragon lifts the dwarven body from the arms of the young giant.   Speaking in a tongue that none in the party could decipher, Helena tediously worked her magic upon the bloody Rockpit.   Until finally she laid the dwarf down in a bed of gold coins, &quot;There, the task is complete, though he will sleep more than a few hours.&quot;<br>&quot;But he will be well?&quot; asks Letaya, worrying still about her charge.<br>&quot;Aya, he doth live and will live on.   Now tell me completely of thy quest.&quot;<br>        &quot;We have come here with no knowledge why, only that we must as shown by the visions of Papon,&quot; said Aslow as the awesome realization that he was speaking to one of the three dragon guardians of legend slowly sunk in.<br>        &quot;Ye have done well, though my wait has been long and lonely.&quot; responds the dragon.  &quot;I know well the task ye are to undertake, I have planned for it for more generations than I care to remember.&quot;<br>        &quot;I can only hope that we can do as you ask.&quot;<br>        &quot;Ye have been chosen, thee fate, as well as many others, will rest upon the decisions ye make.   But ye will not quest alone, certain factors will come to thee's aid in time and likely already have.   The path ye walk has been carefully crafted by heavenly powers, thou's life has been a script of which ye were just a player till this point.&quot;<br>        &quot;It is hard for me to believe that my past, and my future are not my own.&quot; states Camron, as he caress his silver blade.<br>        &quot;No, then answer me this.  You carry a blade which is older than the city in which ye were born, that was crafted by smiths that could not foresee the reason for their endeavor, that was given to thee as a gift though ye were hardly the most capable to wield it, and it stands as the only weapon that would allow ye passage to my door.   Do ye think that chance is so great as to dictate all these?&quot;<br>        &quot;I have no good answer to your question, I can only hope that my life is my own.&quot; replies the Knight.<br>        &quot;In truth, it is.  The choices ye make can and will alter the webs of fate, more so now.  Upon the quest that has been set before thee will be many choices of which only one is correct and proper.   Enemy will turn friend, friend will turn enemy, all will seek thy company if but for reasons of their own. Said the great dragon as she dipped her head close to the heavily bandaged body of the dwarven warrior to check his progress.<br>        You are as riddle bound as Aslow, laughed Camron nervously, hoping the Dragon accepted his jest as it was intended.  Helena turned toward him, white puffs of frost billowing from her snout.  Camron took that as a Dragon laugh and allowed himself a nervous chortle.<br><br>        <br>        Forknoll rewrapped his shattered hand carefully with a strip of coarse cloth from his cloak, binding the fingers in place.  He grimaced as the pain hit him in waves, his whole body tense with exertion of keeping his mangled fingers inert.  Finally the pain was too much and he let out a deep moan, tears forming in his eyes.   Quickly, he looked about to make sure he had not drawn attention to himself though he was reasonable sure that his prey did not now turn hunter.  <br>        Slowly, he climbed back in to the saddle of his impatient stead and rode on.  He took the reins in his good hand and carefully rested his heavily bandaged appendage in his lap.  Urging the great mount forward, every step forcing him to draw a breath of anguish.   He followed the path and the set of tracks, which he had found some hours earlier.   Night was overtaking him, yet his wound would not let him sleep even if he felt it safe to stop.<br>        The moon was high in the sky when Forknoll finally spotted the small campfire up ahead.  Galligon, that stupid fool, hes lucky I found him before the Orcs did, he whispered to himself as he brought the horse to a stop.   He dismounted and began walking the horse into the priests camp.  No use scaring the old priest to death, he thought to himself.<br>        Forknolls battle senses warned him of the danger seconds before he realized he was under attack.  Without knowing why, he tossed himself to the ground.   A thin dagger was in his good hand, his eyes darting about and looking for a target.   He saw a flash of light and then a burst of fire erupted around him.  <br>        He ignored the throbbing hand, he paid no mind to his seared flesh, and with dagger held high he rushed forward and lunged into the brush from which the magical bolt had emerged.  The smoke and magical energies of the fire bolt had left him partially blind but his instincts for survival and from years of training were in full alert.   He felt a presence to his right and thrust the dagger toward the danger, again and again till he finally felt the dagger strike home.   With a resounding thud, his unseen target collapsed to the ground.        Out of breathe and fatigued, he crawled forward into the camp and the warmth of the small fire.    <br>        Help me, came a call from the brush, in a weak yet familiar voice.<br>        Galligon is that you? <br>        It is I, help me please, pleaded the priest.<br>        Why in Krells name did you attack me? questioned Forknoll as he pulled the priest loose from the tangle of the brush.<br>        I thought you were, death overtaking the red priest before he could finish those words.<br>        Forknoll rolled over upon his back and stareed blankly at the stars with despair starting to overwhelm him.   Slowly rising, knowing he must keep moving or he would join Galligon in the after life.    He straddled his steed and pointed the horse in the direction of the closest town, Whimlay.    He hoped that he would survive the journey but he calculated the odds as low.  Giving the horse free rein, the combination of pain and fatigue forcing his body and mind to shut down into a deep, nightmare-filled sleep.<br><br>         Ballius placed the bowl of warm soup on the cluttered table in front of Seldan, careful not to spill the murky liquid on the sheaths of parchment.   Seldan did not acknowledge the presence of the slave, he head buried in his hands deep in worry.<br>        Ballius, when is the last time you saw the sun? said Seldan without stirring.<br>        Be a long time since I seen it, master, Ballius answered the unusual question.<br>        I think a few days away from this place would do us both some good, dont you?<br>        I go where ever you go, master.<br>        What am I saying, might as well wish to be a bird. Chuckled the bleary eyed administrator.   Take this soup away, eat it if you want, just dont tell anyone if you do.<br>        As you say, Master.  Be there anything else you need?<br>        Ahaha, yes.  Can you provide me with a Knight in chains, a conclusion to a make believe conspiracy, and a good set of answers for a foul smelling shroud lord that would as soon kill me as speak to me?  Not to mention a insane torturer who wants to test his methods on me and a slow witted church bishop who expects me to solve all his problems. Asked Seldan, rubbing his hand and remembering the cruel device that Lord Hammerly had used as a less than subtle threat.<br>        Sah? replied the slave, feigning confusion.<br>        Never mind, too many things on my mind is seems.<br>        Sleep would help, Master.<br>        Not with those infernal nightmares!<br>        Some warm cider by calming ya nerves, will fetcha some, responded Ballius, for the first time concerned about his master and sympathetic to his plight.   He step out of the room and into the small kitchen, quickly preparing some cider.  When the cider was warm, the sugary smell filling the room, he sprinkled a small dose of herbs and stirred it well.   The medicine was made from a rare herb of which Ballius had but a small supply, but his masters health was of concern.  Important events were transpiring and this would be a poor time for the senior administrator to start losing his grasp on the myriads of matters before him.<br>        Thank you, said Seldan and he sipped the concoction.  Ballius smiled, it had been many years since anyone had shown him appreciation.<br>        All questions have answers, you be finding them me think, suggest the slave, trying to offer some reassurance.<br>        Nay, many questions have no answers at all, some questions are answers in and of themselves.  I am afraid that it will take some miracles well beyond my norm to make these matters end in a fashion suitable to assure I continue breathing.  But it is my issue, none of your concern.<br>        Be my business, Master, for your death would be mine.   Best I be praying for would be losing my tongue should you be arrested said Ballius solemnly.<br>        Hmmm, so you share my burden it seems, says Seldan as he lifts the cup of cider and draining the last of its contents.  Shame that is, I am as much of a slave as you in the eyes of the church.<br>        You be a free man, you could walk away before the troubles find you.<br>        Free man?  Interesting concept but not true I am afraid.  Seldan was starting to feel the warmth of the medicine and cider flow through his mind, causing both relaxation and a greater awareness.  None of my peers have every walked away from the church without repercussions, usually entailing a large axe and an insincere priest.<br>        Let me tell you a story, offered Seldan, beginning to feel lightheaded.  When I was a child, I worked in my fathers shop.  He was a simple cobbler, made shoes and such.  Not a great cobbler, but adequate in skill and very quick with his tools.  Like most peasants, he was a simple minded man and concerned only with putting enough food on the table and keeping the doors of his shop open.<br>        Was about this time that I took to helping him usually with his accounts, for mother was good about educating the brood.   I could both read and write, and of course I was beginning my love affair with numbers.  Seems my father was being cheated and cheated often by suppliers, customers, and whomever else he did business with.   Just part of being a simple man I guess, but the cheating ended quickly when I took to handling the silver in earnest.<br>        Not only did my family begin to see more coin, but it was enough to offer some limited tutoring for both myself and my younger brother.   Those that had been cheating my father, which is to say about everyone, began to grudgingly show me respect and I found my reputation growing within the merchant community.  Within two years, I was doing the accounts for four other merchants and my income exceeding by twice that of my fathers.  I was thirteen at the time.<br>        A few years later, plans to construct this church were put in place.  A complex such as this requires an army of labor to build, mostly slaves but skilled workers as well.  Masons, carpenters, glassblowers, and such; of course every entity has demands for clerks.  To me, this was a great challenge, for I was already getting bored with my accounts and my ambition drove me to join this endeavor.  Not to mention the pay was in gold, and not barter which was what I was accustomed.   Can only have so many chickens and hogs, smiled Seldan.<br>        Began as an apprentice clerk, which was really nothing more than an errand boy.  By the time they finally allowed me to touch quill and parchment, I had learned every nook and cranny of this place though it was quite a bit smaller back then.  But more importantly I knew who was who, and had learned who had the ability to make things happen and who did not.   I used that knowledge to great advantage, allowing me to get things done that even the senior clerks could not produce.<br>        I had been here almost ten year before I realized that the Red Church meant serious business.   To advance within the ranks of administrators, I had to learn and digest the philosophy of the religion.  By the time my common sense overcame my ambition, it was too late, for I was one of the wheels that made this monstrosity work.   So here I sit before you, son of a cobbler, self-appointed fool, and senior administrator to the greatest evil that ever existed.  Sometimes I envy you, at least you were forced in to your labor.<br>        And with that, this old fool will lay down and dream of my dear old mother.  I wonder if she still lives, havent seen the family since I enter this wretched place.  Seldan stood, glassy-eyed, and stumbled to his bedchamber, softly closing the door behind him.<br>        Ballius stood for a moment, not quite sure what had just occurred, but slowly realizing that an opportunity might have come calling.   Taking a parchment from the desk, without even a glance of its content, he hurried out the door.  Parchment in hand, held prominently before him to suggest he carried an important message, he hurried to the underground.<br><br>        Brett sat at the long table, in a deep and sour mood.  His head ached, throbbing behind his ears and both light and sound made it worse.  Thus he had come to haunt the chamber that Nert had made available to him.  It was both quiet and dark; made more so since he had reduced both the oil lamps that routinely burned here to a mere hint of light.<br>        The books before him lay open but unread; he knew them from prologue to climax.  Every word he had read, digested, and ingrained deep within his mind.  It could do him no harm to read them again, magic was such a subtle art and the minute nuances were of grave importance.  But the pains in his head cause his eyes to blur whenever he tried to read.<br>        Damn that infernal Nert, exclaimed Brett.  Nert had said the supply of the elixir had run dry.  The elixir Brett had used for sustenance and to keep himself alert.   He was past the stage of needing it any longer, he was well ahead of his peers in his class and his workload was no longer excessive.   But withdrawals were excruciatingly painful, and he still desired the focus and clarity of purpose the elixir granted him.  He must find another source, he told himself.  <br>        He shouldnt be too hard; he could easily earn some favors from some of the other students.  Several had begun to ask him for tutoring, especially some of the older boys.  Once past the 4th year, you didnt simply pass or fail, you lived or died.   Certainly incentive enough for those on the cusp to beg, steal, or borrow what he needed.   <br>        Though he had received, so far, very little training in Alchemy, Brett had spent considerable time researching the components required to make the Elixir.  Most were fairly common with only one herb not being native to the local region.  That would be the key ingredient that he would look to his fellow students to provide him.<br>        After thought the process through and confident that he could find a new source, he turned his attention to the problem of research materials.  It was evident that Nert would not be able to acquire books that explored the more dangerous aspects of magic, especially the red magic of the shroud.   Such information was well guarded and access was limited to those in the higher classes, and in most cases to the brethren of the shroud itself.   Finding an answer to this problem would require more resources than Brett currently had available.  His task at hand was to determine where these books were stored and how they were protected.   <br>With this in mind, Brett stands and begins to leave the dark chamber to begin his investigation.    Bringing one of the lamps back to full illumination, he realizes for the first time that he is not alone.<br>I felt it best to wait until you were done with your meditation, my friend. Offered the stranger.   He stood leaning comfortably against the far wall, wearing only a light suit of tanned armor and showed no visible weapon.<br>Who are you and what do you want? asked Brett impatiently.<br>Which name would you like?  I have many depending on my mood or situation.  At this time, I do not believe any name would be satisfactory so I will refrain from creating one for you.  I am here as a messenger, that should be a sufficient title.<br>A messenger?  Then lets have it and we both can be on our own path.<br>Nothing in writing I am afraid, too easy for such to be found and the implications are not worth the risk.   I am a courier for your father, who asked me to check upon your welfare.  I see that you are alive and well, if not a bit haggard looking.<br>My father?, asked Brett, sitting back down to ponder the words.  Yes, um, I am fine.  I am progressing well in school.<br>I am sure your father will be proud that you have become a fine example of a Krell Priest, sneered the messenger.<br>Brett glared at the intruder but said nothing.  His mind was racing back to the last moments with his father; neither he nor his family had crossed his mind some time.  <br>I will tell them you are fit and your studies progress well.
