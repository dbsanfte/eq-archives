The PC game, based on the wildly popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons® game published by Wizards of the Coast, is scheduled to be launched worldwide in the Summer of 2002. Infogrames, Inc. (Nasdaq: IFGM) and parent company Infogrames Entertainment SA (Euronext: 5257) will handle U.S. and European publishing, respectively.<br><br>&quot;We are thrilled to add a product like Neverwinter Nights to our global catalog,&quot; said Bruno Bonnell, Chairman and CEO of Infogrames. &quot;The Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise has been a major force in defining the RPG genre and with Neverwinter Nights, BioWare has created a new standard of excellence. Retailers around the world are already eagerly awaiting this game and we are putting our full worldwide distribution network of 50,000 retail outlets behind this title to meet the demand this summer.&quot;<br><br>Neverwinter Nights is the most fully featured RPG ever. The first computer game to completely recreate the classic &quot;pen and paper&quot; role-playing game in stunning 3D, Neverwinter Nights features a dynamic single player storyline, advanced graphics technology, revolutionary online multiplayer capabilities and the extraordinary new &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; feature. <br><br>&quot;Neverwinter Nights will change everything you thought you knew about computer role playing games,&quot; said Jean Philippe Agati, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Infogrames' Los Angeles studio. &quot;Neverwinter Nights' unmatched quality represents everything that Infogrames stands for, from unprecedented 3D graphics technology to genre-defining gameplay to a never-ending, user-created multiplayer component. This game will be equally entertaining for hardcore RPGers and those new to the genre.&quot;<br><br>The 'official campaign,' which can be played in single or multi-player, will thrust gamers into a deep, enriching fantasy world with 60 hours of gameplay across four engrossing chapters. Players will enjoy a fast-paced adventure, revolving around an epic story of faith, war and betrayal. The intuitive user interface was designed to be accessible to new RPG gamers as well as the hardcore fan base. <br><br>In a gaming first, Neverwinter Nights allows gamers to design, build, and share their own role-playing modules using the &quot;BioWare Auroraä Neverwinter Toolset.&quot; Gamers will take the role of online &quot;Dungeon Master,&quot; creating and presenting their challenges to the Internet community with support for up to 64 players simultaneously. Online gamers will be able to enhance their Neverwinter Nights experience with an exclusive community that will foster the development of new adventures and offer resources for Dungeon Masters, module builders and players.<br><br>&quot;This is a game that will live for years and we're excited to be working with a publisher like Infogrames. We're both dedicated to quality and to pushing the limits of existing game genres,&quot; said Ray Muzyka Joint CEO and Co-Executive Producer of BioWare's games. &quot;We're committed to making sure that Neverwinter Nights is the best it can be. It has been a long road, but the game will be worth the wait,&quot; added Greg Zeshchuk, BioWare's other Joint CEO and Co-Executive Producer. <br><br>&quot;Neverwinter Nights gamers will have unprecedented gameplay options,&quot; said Trent Oster, BioWare's Neverwinter Nights producer. &quot;Adventure as a single player through user-created modules or play with a group of friends through the official campaign storyline. Or you can be the Dungeon Master for your friends on an adventure you created using the Toolset. Whatever you choose, Neverwinter Nights will provide limitless adventure.&quot;<br><br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I figured this game would be delayed, my feeling is we will not see it released untill fall or even as late as Christmas.<br><br>COME BACK TO DAOC NOW <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 2911<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/4/02 12:39:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NWN Delayed...</span><hr size=1> The publishers doesnt have much more information on the Release date than the retailers do.

When I hit the back button the text was gone.  So I will rehash some of what I attempted to post a few weeks ago.<br><br>First I believe late summer at the earliest.  I think Fall is the most probable, with Christmas as the latest.  I feel this way for many reasons.<br><br>First of all, NWN is going to be a single player game with over 60 hours of single play fun.  It will be similar to BG series of games in that you will develop your character throughout the chapters and come to a final conclusion.  It will have a main plot and many many sub plots and quests.  With this in mind, please compare this game to other single player games.<br><br>Single player games must basically be released 100% complete with all known bugs gone.  You cannot have the MMORPG mentality of release early and have an initial large patch.  Every single MMORPG game that has been released required a downloaded patch of greater than 4mbs on the very first day of release.  You cannot sell a single player game that is incomplete and expect the customer to visit your site and download the patch because you were not finished with the game before it went gold.<br><br>Along with that thought people do, believe it or not, buy games because of game reviews in magazines, review websites like gamespot, and word of mouth.  Since NWN will be a single player game first, that is the part of the product that will be in the review magazines.   If that part of the product sucks and is full of bugs, NWN is dead (although Bioware is a kick ass company and I am almost positive they will never allow that to happen).  So, Bioware and their new publisher will have to make more than certain that the single player game of over 60 hours of fun is as complete, bug free, and enjoyable as it possibly can or else they will not make the kinds of profit they need.<br><br>On top of all this is something special.  Underneath the single player game is this totally new concept that will allow groups of friends (like us) to build their own world and quests and play together just like they were sitting around their kitchen table on a weekend playing D&amp;D pen and paper games.  It will provide a toolset for developing a world that will be online 24-7 that people can play when they feel like.  All of this needs to be as close to complete and functional as possible because Bioware will not be hosting these worlds so no update client and version control will be readily available for its Persistent world users.<br><br>As we have seen from recent history, MMOGs set a release date and come hell or high water will release the damn game on that date like it or not.  Games like these are highly successful (if you do not look at steaming piles of crap like Anarchy Online or WW2OL).  Single player games that even think of adopting this strategy are doomed to failure.  A mild example of this is Pool of Radiance.  This game released with a large amount of bugs that has ultimately resulted in bad reviews and lower sales (I personally was going to purchase this game until I read the reviews posted on it).  I would also bet that the number of bugs are actually relatively small compared to what you would find in a MMOG, yet it is a crap game not because of game play but because of the release and patch mentality.<br><br>To pass the &quot;Long ass post&quot; and go into the &quot;Amberyllish&quot; post I shall continue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  If as Segal says Bioware has not changed the release date (and it is just the publisher) then they have less than 2 months to finish the game, test all 60 hours of single player action, test the persistent world tools, and send the game to the presses.  My bottom line is this is not even close to going to happen.  Their current testing consists of basically in house closed testers.  If they are to ensure the game is as bug free as possible they will need to have a sizable testing force of possibly 100s of testers.  If that is the case, then we would have heard about the testing by now.  Leaks would have happened, screenshots would make it out, and movies of the game play and effects would be all over the web.  I don't see it, so I don't think they are at this stage of the game.<br><br>Ahh, I feel better now.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 2918<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/4/02 2:57:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NWN Delayed...</span><hr size=1> Of course its possible that NWN could be delayed for yet another year, who knows. <br><br>Couple of points though...<br><br>They have been working on the Official campaign for well over a year.   You never see a Beta for those types of games, they are always tested in house (in fact Bioware may not do a beta at all and if they do it will be of very small scope).  I would expect that the single player game is probably almost ready, that is by far the easiest part of what they are doing.  Just to give you an idea of how fast they can spit those out, they just announced Icewind Dale 2 with a release date of May 23rd.<br><br>Its the toolsets that would require most of the time consuming programming and using them to write the single player campaign is a dang good test.  I am sure 95% of the problems were not bugs with the single player game but bugs with trying to get the toolset to create the single player game.   I would bet a donut that whatever issues might still exist, most of it revolves around the DM interface.<br><br>The DM interface is the tool that allows you to do things while the game is being played.  Dont get it confused with the design toolset which is totally different, you cant add content (with a couple of exceptions) with a DM toolset.   <br><br>I believe they are done to a few issues (some are pretty big).<br><br>1) DM interface<br>2) Balancing (things like resting, etc..)<br>3) fine tuning and polishing <br><br>I would suspect the official game and the toolset are at 98%. <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>Lead DM - <a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a> <BR>A NWN Persistent Campaign<BR><i>And so it was that the gods gifted upon mortal men the varied treasures and mankind was changed for the better and worse, but forever changed. </i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/umaoudeib.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maoudeib</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NWN PlayTester</span><br>  Posts: 913<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/4/02 7:53:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NWN Delayed...</span><hr size=1> I'd agree with Segal.  The toolset is by far the more complicated piece of the puzzle.  But Bioware place much on their plate for NWN.<br><br>1)Make a completely new toolset for creating dungeons that is relatively easy to use for gamers (except for complicated scripting).  If it takes PHD in programming to make a simple script for an npc, the player made content is dead.<br><br>2)Make a new single player type game (relatively easy except they are using the toolset to do it).  Thus they kinda have to finish the toolset before finishing the single player game.<br><br>3)Finally, (this is often overlooked), they have to adapt AD&amp;D 3rd edition rules to a new game.  This is a duanting task since the rules are actually more complex than all the previous versions.  Some rules simplly won't work in an online game.<br><br>4)Also, Mythic has to adapt those complex rules into an easy to use player interface.  If you look at Pool of Radiance, that's an example of what NOT to do in terms of interface.<br><br>5) Finally you have wrap all this with a graphics engine that is competitive in appearance to other games out there, while not excluding too many games in it's computer requirements.<br><br>A huge endevour and much more complex than any other game out in the market to date.  It's like building ROME with new more complex building codes, while using as yet unfinished building instructions that you must create from scratch that are relatively easy to use for the average contractor...whew.<br><br>So I'm not surprised if NWN is further delayed.  Bioware is preparing to released a huge revolution in gaming and seems intent on doing it properly without any artificial deadlines.  With such a huge endeavor, it's impossible to predict when they will be done.  I doubt it will be by the end of March, however.<br><br> <p>Ex EQ enchanter<BR>Current DAOC Dabbler<BR>Future NWN Neophyte<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/udolardarkbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dolar Darkbane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puny Skeleton</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/4/02 8:13:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NWN Delayed...</span><hr size=1> On IWD2 it was just announced but it has been rumored to have been in development for more then 6 months now, they just officially announced it today.

With a new publisher, there is a new plan for marketing, QA, localization and distribution. <br><br>To that end, BioWare and Infogrames now feel that Summer 2002 (which could mean as early as May or June) is a good conservative estimate of the distribution date - guaranteeing a game worthy of the quality inherent under the titles of Dungeons and Dragons, Infogrames and BioWare. We are still aiming for the same development completion targets that we were aiming for in the past, but Infogrames and BioWare both want to provide a safe target window for the game to be ready in terms of the things that are covered by the publisher working in conjunction with the development team - distribution, localization, marketing and testing. <br><br>Thanks - as always as we get more information we'll update you. Our fans are very important to us. <br><br>Ray Muzyka Greg Zeschuk <br>Joint CEO's BioWare Corp. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Thats the scoop from Bioware.<br><br>I certainly hope they dont worry that much about the Character Vault, I can really see much use for it.

After all it is there baby and frankly may be a make or break for them. If it's sales are less then stelar I am sure Infogrames will not think twice about dropping them. I am not worried about a buggy game, I am more worried about the game not offering as much as everyone thinks. It has been hyped for so long, this delay is just gonna make it seem more unatainible. Unless it is perfect and has all the bells and whistles I am afraid some of us(including me) are gonna be let down.<br><br>One other thing I have heard is that, becasue of Infrogrames being based out of Europe(France) they were pushing for a worldwide release. And that is the reason for the pushing back of the release. While that is a good thing for the players in Europe and world wide, it just sypes the game that much more for us in the US.<br><br>Dolar <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead-GM</span><br>  Posts: 2931<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/5/02 8:10:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NWN Delayed...</span><hr size=1> Aside from Blizzard, I think Bioware is the one of the best developers out there but no product is bug-free.
