<br>
Japanese Armor <br>
There are some Japanese weapons but not armor. I, of course, can't be more specific right now. <br>
<br>
World Map <br>
Right now, we are shooting for the map being made up of a group of tiles. If everything goes right, each map should be connected by an area transition. You do not transition to a new screen unless you go from one map to another. As it stands, there is no world map- only local area maps. Mark D., Lead Programmer, and Scott G., Director of Programming, mentioned that the world map idea flipped back and forth between being in and out many times. At last count it was not in.<br>
<br>
As an aside: if I do not answer a question properly it could be because:<br>
<br>
1. I need to scan many posts quickly and do not take the time to read everything as carefully as I should because I feel some sort of answer is much better than no answer. Mistakes that are made are all mine.<br>
<br>
2. In general, I need to rephrase a collection of posts and edit them together before I send it off to a designer or programmer as a list of clear questions and sometimes things get lost in the translation. I want to make sure that things are as easy as possible for them as they have little time to sort through the boards (and occasional liberal use of grammar and spelling)<br>
<br>
3. I generally do not waste my time on 'redirecting questions' as, most often, if I can't answer a question, I do not and leave it at that. There are many things that can't be talked about that I need to side step by either letting the question fall away-which I hate- or pop in, and send a note saying I can't answer the question to at least show you that I saw the question. I hope that I come across as a straight shooter instead of a Spin Doctor. Hopefully that clears things up: if any questions end up being answered incorrectly- that's my fault and you can call me a Monkey-Head.. <br>
<br>
Various questions <br>
<br>
To add some further bits to Urthpaw's stuff...<br>
<br>
Q: 1. Do bipedal monsters have the same emotes as humanoids? Can they sit or lie down?<br>
<br>
A: Actually yes, most humanoid monsters have the same emotes as humans.<br>
<br>
Q: Is the toolset sophisticated enough to allow an action taken inside the building / dungeon to have visible / audible ... consequences outside (e.g. pulling a rope and having the peal of bells heard all over the area)? I'm sure it can easily be done through scripting, but I'd like to have to script as little as necessary.<br>
<br>
A: As far as I know this can only be done through the magic of scripting.<br>
<br>
Q: Can NPC's (both joinable and non-joinable) have followers of their own? Can followers have followers? (e.g. Can I have boy with a pet dog / lizard / rat / tarrasque... following him around? Again, without scripting.) <br>
<br>
A: Good news here: henchman, such as mages, can summon monster who will then follow them around. No Tarrasques however <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Q: I'm sure there are dogs in the game, but are there different dog breeds?<br>
<br>
A: Yes- we have a wolf / coyote type model a mastiff, and a doberman type model expected.<br>
<br>
Q: Are there children models for monster races? Are there models of pregnant women?<br>
<br>
A: Unfortunately, we do not have the art resources to explore the many variations as could be encountered, such as monster children models and pregnant women, as it would add significant development time. For some of the variations that fans desire, we are relying on innovative use of existing models such as the large women model with certain clothing to simulate the pregnant women look. Marc, our art director, is only occasionally allowed to go home as it is, and we feel he may begin to refer to his computer as 'my precious, my preciousss'.<br>
<br>
Q: Can we create a cursed temple surrounded by complete, impenetrable darkness fifty feet around it (without resorting to scripting, placing permanent globe of darkness spells, etc.)?<br>
<br>
Not without scripting I'm afraid, as that is a pretty specific thing to want. As with the preganant women idea there are many clickable controls within the Toolset that can be jury-rigged to simulate a variety of special conditions such as a Fog Setting that was used by Derek French to simulate an underwater look (turn the fog blue etc.). <br>
<br>
Scripting help for novices <br>
Sorry about the wait folks. I went a spoke to Don Moar, our tools programming Overlord, to see what developments have been to help out module creators who have no scripting experience. I then talked to Brad, our Das Uber PR Leader, to make sure I could even reply to this. I can't give specifics at this point-sorry- but I can say that 'things' are being worked on right now to help the novice scripter. Hopefully, I can speak more specially about these things a little later. Don had some great news about what he is working on, but I can't detail it right now. This is a terribly painful reply, but the best I can do right now.<br>

User Created Content <br>

Saying that NWN is somehow so Double Plus Special that us poor clueless buffoons just wouldn't be able to figure it out is insulting and wrong. If a 23 year old computer science major at Bioware can do it, then yes, I can do it as well.<br>
<br>
We have never said that we are going to disallow user made content. All we have said, and we continue to say, is that we are looking into the best way to support user made content. We know there are lots of talented and creative artists and modelers out there. We know that people will make add ins and modifications to the game in one way or another. We just want to support you in a convienient manner.<br>
<br>
If we say, yes, you can create tilesets, but you need 3D Studio version 7 which costs $7000 we have then cut out a great number of creative people that either cannot afford this software or we end up with people making content for our game using warez software. Obviously this is not the best solution.<br>
<br>
Quote: Further, it's not as though Bioware needs to &quot;promise&quot; us that we'll be able to construct decent tiles. All they really need to do is provide the hooks, then let us work out the rest ourselves. If we succeed, then hooray for us. If we fail- well, that's our problem, isn't it?<br>
<br>
For the most part, this quote is right on the money. Except that we do want you to create content for our game. It is something that we want to encourage and we want to support properly.<br>
<br>
Quote: So if Bioware disallows user tiles, it'll be for only one reason- Bioware wants to maintain a deathgrip on every aspect NWN gameplay. (A concept that already seems far too likely, given their apparent &quot;You can't change stats,<br>
<br>
I am not exactly sure what you mean by &quot;stats&quot; here. The DM can control the stats of the players and the DM has full control over the stats of all NPCs in modules that he creates. I am fairly certain that I am not understanding you correctly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quote: you can't make your own races,<br>
<br>
True, while you cannot create a new Player Character race through the Toolset, you can use the SubRace field of your character sheet and create modules that respond to this field. Also, you can adjust your skin color to be more Drow-like. If you are talking NPCs you can create pretty much anything.<br>
<br>
For example, if you wanted to play a Drow (yes, I know, example comes up 10000 times, but hey, at least you know what I am talking about) you would choose Race: Elf, SubRace: Drow and then script in the support for Drow abilities into the module you create. While this SubRace would follow your character wherever you go, the individual modules would have to have the support for your particular SubRace.<br>
<br>
There is so much data dependancy with regards to Race that supporting user created Player Character Races without breaking the game would be very hard to do at this point. This is why we have the SubRace field and scripting.<br>
<br>
Quote: you can't add your own artwork<br>
<br>
Well, this whole post is about this phrase so it has been addressed.<br>
<br>
Quote: and if you don't like it tough&quot; attitude.)<br>
<br>
This is not our attitude at all. We want people to create content for our game. We are not disallowing custom art, in fact there is very little that was are &quot;preventing&quot;.<br>
<br>
Quote: The sad thing about this is that it will inevitably spell the death of NWN. It will be as though every Mud through history FORCED you to use Diku 1.0, with nothing but the five stock zones. I mean, really folks, if we can't add our own art, models, or races, then most of our mods are going to look pretty much the same.<br>
<br>
While I believe the Toolset and the Neverwinter Community will no doubt astound us with what they create, there is a glimmer of truth to your statement of the restriction of custom content. Again, this is why we are not actively preventing you from doing anything. We just want to work out the best way to support the NWN community properly.<br>
<br>
The final word on the topic is that we are still working on the best way to support user created content (especially art) in NWN, but we do not have it finalized yet.<br>
<br>
Server questions <br>
Quote: ladro wrote: One: Authentication. Is the authentication done by the module server, or the vault server? Situation...6-8 clients at home, do the clients or server have to be dialed up to the internet.<br>
<br>
In this situation, only the server would have to be dialed into the internet.<br>
<br>
Quote: Two: Characters in the vault<br>
<br>
To check characters into/out of the vault, between the clients and the server, which needs to be hooked to the internet?<br>
<br>
Quote: Three: passing characters. If the answer to number two is the client, can you pass ownership of characters, one by one, to a single client that is dialed up so everyone can check their characters back in?<br>
<br>
Sorry, can't answer these two at this time.<br>
<br>
Quote: Four: proxies Since three would be complicated: Bioware has stated they will release a list of ports needed and I think support firewalls. Can you also list supported win2k proxies for those of us using 56K modems?<br>
<br>
Proxies = yuck - and are horrible to deal with. No, there will be no proxie support in NWN.<br>
<br>
Single player campaign <br>
Quote: Saddam Hopper wrote:In a single player game, you can't have a DM. So why is there a so called single player game, anyway, when the game is meant just to be a pure-online game?<br>
<br>
Mainly because the game is not a pure-online game. The game can be played by a single player with a non-internet connected computer, or by some friends on a LAN or over the internet with a group of complete strangers.<br>
<br>
Single player and multiplayer <br>
Both are supported. The game (and the Official Campaign that ships with the game) can be played with a single player on a single computer, or with a DM on a server with up to 64 clients connected. Plus users can create their own modules and tailor them to on-line or solo play.<br>
<br>
Global Module rankings <br>
Can't talk about it yet, but just you wait till you see what we have in store for you!<br>
<br>
Any region restrictions <br>
The only requirement between server and client is that you are running the same version number. There are no location based restrictions.<br>
<br>
Downloading the toolset <br>
Well, the game isn't released yet, so there is nothing to purchase at this time.<br>
<br>
Module downloading <br>
Quote: Windwalker wrote: Now only one question remains for me, and forgive me if it's a n00b question. If I host my own server for people to play on, will the client download the module in an editable form, or some kind of byte-code that was compiled in the toolset? Basically I want to know if someone who plays my module can just rip it off by logging on, and then logging off and looking through some directory to find the module and edit it.<br>
<br>
I just have time to answer this one paragraph. The server streams data to the client. It is stored in RAM only, not on your hard drive or in any other accessable or editable format.<br>
<br>
Making money <br>
Quote: Windwalker wrote: And for Bioware it's a win-win situation, just look at Half-Life. Do you think it would enjoy even half of the success it has, if it wasn't for excellent mods such as Counter Strike which was made by other players? When you put THAT much work into a game to get it to do new things that the creators didn't even envision, then you have no less rights to your intellectual property as does Bioware. (Luckily Valve saw this opportunity and worked with the Counter Strike team, and I'm sure both parties managed to make a buck of the deal.)<br>
<br>
OK, so I have time to answer one more. In Half-Life, Valve Software owns all rights to any and all mods, levels, etc. that you make for their game. This includes CS, the moment it started being coded. The programmers of CS had no rights to their code as all of it was created using Valve Software IP. This is covered in the HL SDK EULA (how is that for acronyms?). As per the EULA, they were allowed to distribute their mod but not to sell it. Valve hired on the two CS programmers onto their staff as opposed to &quot;working out a deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bah, forgot to add... Our EULA will explicitly prevent any type of revenue generation using Neverwinter Nights. You will not be able to sell modules, you will not be able to charge for server access, you will not be able to sell scripts.<br>
<br>
Quote: mbyrne wrote: Or, is BioWare just hoping to exact a royalty from anyone who wants to build a campaign worthy of being sold?<br>
<br>
No royalties because there will be no selling of modules.<br>

Stanley Woo - Quality Assurance Ninja -<br>
<br>
Party encounters <br>
As far as I'm aware, scripted encounters in modules take character level or party-average lavel into account, and scales the encounter accordingly... so the same encounter trigger would summon fewer creatures, or the same number of lower-level creatures if the party-average level changes. This would simulate the Challenge Rating guidelines in 3E. Hope that helps. <br>
<br>
Chris Priestly - Quality Assurance -<br>
<br>
Can players run <br>
I don't think Trent or Jay will mind me stepping in here and confirming that running is in the game. So is walking. So you will have a choice as to how fast your character moves towards or away from danger. And remember retreating is just charging in a different direction. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
