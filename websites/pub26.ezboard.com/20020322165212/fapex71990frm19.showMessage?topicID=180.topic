Details of this ground-breaking RPG... <br>
<br>
The tool kit incorporates the ability to script events which affect gameplay, as was demonstrated in the original Infinity engine used in Baldur's Gate and its sequels, but this time you get the option to use the tool kit and it is up to you how the scene is played-out. This feature will allow you to hand craft the personalities of the NPCs, how they will respond in given scenarios ultimately allowing you to weave your own stories and create a more realistic playing environment. For instance, you could use the script to describe the interaction of a dumb Orc guarding a treasure box, allowing the players to trick him into leaving his treasure unguarded or respond violently to the player’s decisions. The script allows you to build in a sense of realism within the events, providing pre-rendered animations allowing you to convey emotion from in game characters such as frustration, which could be portrayed by pacing or fits of anger. Ambitious stuff indeed, and if Bioware can pull it off, surely their place in gaming history will be forever secured.<br>
<br>
You will be able to create environments suited to your own requirements and ideas of what a real adventure should be about. Each server will accommodate up to sixty players, adventuring into your dungeon and abiding by your rules. You can decide what happens to each of them when they die, making them lose experience points, kicking them out of the game or if you want to be really nasty you can ban them from your server upon death. Being the dungeon master doesn’t mean you miss out on the fun, you can join in the action at anytime and possess a creature to interact and deal with any players that you may have taken a disliking to. This means that each adventure will have a different storyline making online gaming that much more playable, no more hacking and slashing your way through the same old creatures and quests. <br>
<br>
Bioware seem to have thought of everything when it comes to online gaming glitches. If you decide to create an adventure that a party of ten would find challenging but more players join the game, ordinarily the party would finish the game with ease. So how could you possibly overcome that type of problem? This is where the clever stuff comes in; instead of placing a few creatures at set points you create an event with encounter points. When the party enters an encounter zone, this triggers a script that calculates the number of people in the party and spawns enough enemies to make the encounter challenging for your party size. But what if your party incorporates adventurers of both high and low levels? Unbelievably the engine compensates for this by spawning a spread of enemies that the higher levels would find challenging, whilst the lower levels would find demanding. Very smart stuff indeed.  <br>
<br>
Bioware have opted for a minimalist approach to the on screen interface, and who can blame them given the luxurious visuals provided by the engine. A simple mouse driven wheel provides access to all of your characters abilities, plus a small status window provides detail on the usual suspects; such as health levels. From the wheel you will be given the option of attacking or interacting with other characters, using character specific abilities and access your inventory and statistics screens. For those preferring the keyboard, shortcuts for the above options will also be catered for. A large bank of common phrases will make chatting within multiplayer games easier than ever before.<br>
<br>
Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons there is a strong social aspect to the game, which means you need to decide on how you look. Choose the colour of your character's hair and skin tone; when fighting and interacting with the game's many individuals you will want to look your best. You also want to make sure that you are aware of who your friends are and their whereabouts. So once joining a group of players their portrait and stats would appear next to yours, and an arrow will point out their direction if you happen to lose them.<br>
<br>
Another inspiring element to this game is the diversity of the classes. In previous games once choosing a 'magic' character you would be stuck with using it's predetermined skills. In Neverwinter Nights you could choose a magical character but train him in the ways of a fighter in order to wear armour, this option sounds like a good idea but would be to the detriment of its potential as a spell caster. Whereas if you were willing to lose the higher armour class you could max-out your spells to cause maximum damage or make them faster to rid you of that ever so annoying casting-time.<br>
<br>
For anybody that has ever played Dungeons and Dragons I am sure there that you will agree that character generation is often as enjoyable as playing the game, so you will be pleased to learn that the diversity of races from which to choose includes Humans, Halflings, Gnomes, Half Orcs, Dwarves, Half Elves and Elves. The character classes: Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard are also all here. Further good news is that each of these characters will be portrayed with a sense of scale, meaning that If you choose to play a Half Orc you will appear much larger on the screen than if you had chosen to be a Halfling. It all sounds simple I know but many developers in the past, having been limited by their game's engine, have often, disappointingly, wound up with a cast of all humans. Drawing from the vast array of equipment existing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world, you will have the ability to equip your character in gleaming armour and swords; with a realistic metallic sheen, easily allowing you to differentiate your online persona from those around you. We are looking at millions of possible combinations, all scaled to fit your chosen race. The customisation goes even further by allowing you to forge your very own weapons and armour of mighty power, selecting bonuses and curses as you feel fit, and even allowing you to adjust their colour and appearance.  <br>
<br>
Think back into the past, the advent of 3D-style graphics really arose from the flight simulator genre. One of the next early adopters of this technology, within games, was role-playing. Think back to the Dungeon Master (now I really am showing my age); first-person perspective before Doom, and a story to boot. During the desolate dry years when role-playing games on computers lost their popularity, developers moved from first-person perspectives, to top-down and finally onto fixed isometrically viewed games. Until recently they have avoided true polygon driven engines preferring beautifully drawn sprites to depict their gaming worlds.<br>
<br>
Neverwinter Nights dives into the 3D arena with a luscious state-of-the-art engine, depicting transitions from night to day, weather patterns, fantastic spell effects, superbly animated combat sequences and realistic character and NPC behaviours. The eye-candy promised from Neverwinter Nights really does look set to ‘raise the bar’ and set a new standard for all RPG games. Enough said. <br>
<br>
And now onto my pet hate. Having played many online role-playing games, in particular Diablo II, the experience is all too often destroyed by hackers and cheaters, or 'scum of the earth', as I like to call them. Let me explain why: having clocked hundreds of hours building up my 90th level sorceress in Diablo II I was challenged by a particularly boisterous 70th level barbarian. Haha! No problem I thought. I danced out of the encampment raining ice and lightning at the poor man expecting certain victory. Try as I might he just would not die, confused and frustrated I attempted to return back to safety, when with one hit he killed me outright. “How can this be?” I screamed with outrage, he simply laughed back; “I am in god mode”. What is the point?<br>
<br>
My biggest concern for this ambitious title is how cheating can be avoided, especially since the developers have allowed the transition from single to multiplayer games. Surely this would leave the system wide open to abuse? In answer to this problem Bioware are incorporating encounter controls, as stated previously within this article, whereby higher-level characters would be faced with harder enemies. My remaining question would be, will this be enough to dissuade hackers from affectively writing their own powerful avatars offline then bringing them online to ruin the experience for the rest of us. Only time will tell.<br>
<br>
As with all too few great development teams Bioware are dedicated to releasing this ambitious game only when it is ready. It has already slipped a pre-Christmas 2001 proposed release date, but nobody ever really thought (given the delights promised) this would happen anyway.<br>
<br>
In closing I would suggest that if Bioware can deliver on even seventy-five percent of their current proposal for this game, then it will be a run-away success. I eagerly look forward to playing the finished product.  <p><b>Segal SoulSaver</b><br>
