Neither Vault characters nor imported characters will be allowed. To play in the campaign, you must generate a new character that will be stored on the game server.   You will not be able to export this character to play in other NWN games and still use the character within Shroud World.   The world will be password protected. This means that getting to play on the server will require you to have a password (and thus my permission the play). This is by no means a method to stop my friends from playing, but rather to keep an effective cap on the number of people playing.  When will start with an effective cap of 64 members with a goal of having 30-40 players online during prime time.   Once we have a better feel of the technical aspects of the game, we may increase the number of members.<br><br>Character Generation – We will be using the default setting for character generation, at this time that would mean a Standard Point Buy System with 25 points as outlined on page 19 of the 3rd Edition Dungeon and Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide.   If Bioware decides to publish the game with a higher or lower point value, we will use that as the default.   I see the lower point values as an opportunity to generate loot tables that offer plentiful stat bonuses and do not expect the character to be undermined.  Though once again, I remind the players that the level of this campaign will be set at ‘challenging’.<br><br>Alignment Restrictions - The basis of the campaign world is that evil forces control most of the territory; few organized forces of good exist (those that do are not highly visible). New characters must be of neutral or better alignment, no evil alignment types are allowed. Since alignment is dynamic in NWN, players whose alignment slips to the dark side may very well find that their character has become an NPC.  If for some reason, I determine that the adjustments to alignment made by the game are unreasonable, I will make the proper adjustments on an individual basis.<br><br>Class Limitations - Paladins have a bounty placed upon their heads, obviously the goals of a paladin would conflict greatly with an evil society. Paladins will find special hardships within the game (as well as special opportunities). I reserve the right to restrict the total number of Paladins that can enter the game.  Players wishing to play the Paladin class must have approval from a GM before creating the character.   I suggest reading the Paladin Guidelines for further information.    <br><br>PVP Restrictions - This campaign is primarily PVE (Player versus environment) and it strives to establish a high level of cooperation between players to achieve the overall goals. The Player versus Player environment will generally be turned off, but I reserve the right to turn it on under special circumstances at my discretion.    In places where PVP is turned on, this is meant to increase the risk to players of unintentionally causing harm to their fellow players.  Using these areas to harass or otherwise reduce the quality of the gaming experience for other players is a bannable offense.  In some rare cases, the storyline will dictate that player’s conflict with other players; only in these cases will PVP be permissible.<br><br>Code of Conduct - This campaign is designed for mature players. Excessive use of obscenities, attempts to disrupt the game play of others, or blatant attempts to harm the campaign world will result in an immediate banning.    Any type of play style that conflicts with the general morale of the community of the players will be frowned upon.   Though the goal is for each player to find an enjoyable experience, I will not sacrifice the enjoyment of the many for the pleasures of the few.   Any type of behavior that is consider discourteous such as derogatory remarks, racial or religious slurs, sexual harassment or any other type of behavior that would not be appropriate in your common ‘workplace’ will result in punishment ranging from a warning to banishment.   I would strongly discourage players for trying to test me on these type issues, as I am dead serious.<br><br>In addition, certain individuals may have GM status or be a volunteer in some other capacity.  These volunteers work to increase the quality of the game world and directly to increase the game enjoyment of the players.   These people are not compensated in any material form, doing their work purely from whatever benefits it alone grants them.   I will expect that they be treated with courtesy at all times, that any rulings or decisions they make are accepted without complaint.   Appeals can be sent to me privately via email and I will attempt to make an impartial judgment in such situation, however, people that are in the position to make such decision are there because I trust their judgment.   Any form of attacks versus these volunteers in-game or via the message board will be looked upon in a very negative light.   Do I expect any of this to occur?  No, but I want the rules straight from the start.<br><br>Player Commitment – Because this is a closed world with a limited membership, each membership slot has a certain value.  I expect players that are no longer going to participate in the game, to let me know so that I can bring in someone off the waiting list.   Players that do not log on in any one 20 day period will have assumed to have abandoned their membership slot and I will replace them.  If for some reason a player is going to be unable to play for an extend period of time, please communicate that information to me so I can hold your spot.   <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>Segal</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usegalsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Segal SoulSaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=112539253&img=5" BORDER=0> at: 1/23/02 7:07:07 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=1.topic"> <img src="http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blPrevTopic12.gif" border=0></a><br><br><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.nutrocker.co.uk/board/blAddReply12.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.emailToFriend?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.threadControl?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub26.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="apex71990frm1">Apex General Chat<option value="apex71990frm3">Apex Members Only<option value="apex71990frm4">Zone Guides, Strategies and Loot Lists<option value="apex71990frm5">Apex Charter and Policies<option value="apex71990frm7">Officers Area<option value="apex71990frm10">NWN - Campaign Rules<option value="apex71990frm11">NWN - Scenerio/Plot Info<option value="apex71990frm12">NWN - GM Chat<option value="apex71990frm13">NWN - Quest Forum<option value="apex71990frm14">NWN - Fantasy Works<option value="apex71990frm15">GM/Volunteers Policies and Procedures<option value="apex71990frm16">NWN Volunteer Forum<option value="apex71990frm18">NWN - Links<option value="apex71990frm19">NWN - General Forum<option value="apex71990frm20">Member's Forum<option value="apex71990frm21">Scripting Library<option value="apex71990frm22">Persistent World DMs Only<option value="apex71990frm23">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/bapex71990>NeverWinter Nights - Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm23>Archives</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://Shroudworld.com">Shroud World</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
