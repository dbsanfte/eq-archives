Took me 5hrs to get it loaded and patched up just to get started.  The variances in the characters does seem to be very complex and could prove challenging and interesting, but i'm not sure the gameplay will pan out very well.  Been reading message boards on several different sites, and noone seems to like this game yet.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, and I'll give it a chance......but my advice is don't waste your money on the game just yet.  Additionally, having been JUST released, there are SEVERAL technical problems with the game atm, IMO, however I believe most of this will get straightened out over time.<br>
<br>
Also, rtfming helps u figure out the basic controls of the game, but tells you nothing about the ingame character enhancements available and seriously does NOT explain the game's version of spells (nano technology).<br>
<br>
A few of us have already purchased the game, and i'm sure we will ALL make our viewpoints public so that we can all make our own decision on weather or not to persue AO as a means of entertainment (or frustration as games tend to do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

After about 45 minutes of sitting there with the nano programs (read as spell scrolls) in my inventory a simple double right click memorizes the program. <br>
I'm now half way through level one and haven't managed to buy myself a nano regenerator (read Clarity) but surely that thing has to help. <br>
The game crashed on me twice when hitting the attack key. I still have no idea what I'm doing on some levels the apartment thing was a fairly horrid experience but I do have one.<br>
BTW, I'm Omni if anyone's playing might hop on tonight for a few still have family over and don't want to be overly rude. <br>
To add some pluses to the game there graphics KICK ass .. everything has (you are gonna shit yourself) A SHADOW!!!<br>
Hardware T&amp;L is already built in to the engine!<br>
The guards are phenomenally quick to coming to your aid.<br>
I have noticed there are buffs and debuffs that are built around the &quot;NCU&quot;. I was movement slowed by one of the mobs I ran into when I wandered as far off as I could before I died.<br>
Have yet to play with the quest system or team for that matter. <br>
The pet control is somewhat better than EQ's .. you can actually name your pet ... /pet rename Bitz and your pet is named Bitz<br>
I'm normally kicking a 100 - 200 ping to the server which does not seem to hamper the gameplay. Did take a nice spike once and killed a mob before I knew it was dead.<br>
Only warning on the nanotech is DO NOT move while casting as it will eat nano points as if you had. If you have nano you know how long it takes to regen it. Nano regens right now at 3 points everytime it goes up not in single point intervals.<br>
The exp system is built so you know exactly what you get from each mob. <br>
The shop does not allow you to buy back sold items from what I could tell so don't walk up and sell your weapon =). <br>
In the newbie zone you do not lose anything for a death (this could be level related do not know as I'm still level 1). All your equipment stays equiped only have to go back and pick up anything you looted off your corpse. <br>
Will update more if anyone cares.<br>
PEACES.<br>
PS - I don't hate the game yet the interface is a little confusing as was character creation Kreon hit the nail on the head the manual is ONLY good for the keyboard commands in the back fold out. <p><a href=http://www.etherealknighthood.com border=0><img src=http://home.kscable.com/ethereal/azzisig.gif></a><br><center>

OK after the rudimentary fuck ups that I half heartedly expected but didn't want it's not a terrible interface however if you run it in a window it is considerably slower than if you run it in full screen .. ie. the mouse movement is slower and the screen is quite erradic... however in full screen I don't suffer the same problems<br>
Their informational system on letting you know when a patch is going on is NOT functioning as they want it to .. in order to be able to get the info you have to be able to hit their main server and if it's congested you think it's F'd up instead of congested the errors are NOT what they always say they are. <br>
sometimes it's like an IE error when you can't reach the host because it's busy instead of just can't reach the host . 2 DISTINCTIVELY DIFFERENT THINGS!!!<br>
Anyways .. I was logged in the clan world with a good 40 people in my zone just now and it ran decently chatted a bit with some people and seems to be some decent people ARE playing the game.. tho there is only 1 dimension (read as server) up right now hopefully they will unF this and get something in the states.<br>
btw, the best resource I've found for info happens to be<br>
www.ao-basher.com<br>
or you can keep your eyes here for updates from me when I get bored. =)<br>
All and all once I've learned the interface (still don't have death and all that down) and the exp system I am moving quite easily through the &quot;newbie&quot; areas. Tho a warning to all that play there are drastic differences between 30 feet from the start area and 40 feet from the start area.<br>
If you see a humanoid form and are still level 1.. RUN YOUR ASS OFF!!!<br>
I have failed over 12 attempts at humanoid creatures.. I've come close to winning but w/o full nano energy I'm sure it's impossible if possible at all.<br>
