Anyone have any experience with these things and can tell me what to expect?<br>
<br>
Bandwidth is certainly going to be an issue, we will open with a single DSL line and a single server.  I will be purchasing the server within the next few months and will by the most powerful machine I can afford at the time.  At the low end I would expect to have at least a 1.4g Mhz P4 with 512 ram.  Not sure what OS I will use, but I am planning on trying to get a copy of Window XP.<br>
<br>
Eventually we might want to add additional servers and bandwidth.   A dedicated T-1 starts at $245 per month, with is a bit out of my price range.  Depending on the number of players we have, it might be possible to fund that through a community effort. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usiawnoverseas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siawn Overseas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Pawn</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/4/01 8:23:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Techincal Stuff</span><hr size=1> Couple of questions...are they planning on having the server run on any OS?  Ie, Linux?<br>
<br>
For at least some of the zones you can farm out the bandwidth a little...especially low combat oriented type of zones (think temple in lavastorm).  I'd like to at least test and see how my cablemodem goes...have 3 computers here, might as well test it.  P2 400, 512 MB ram...perfect if its a linux box.  Speaking of which, probably a good idea for me to upgrade to red hat 7.1...5.2 just won't cut it.<br>
<br>
As far as emergency power, unless you plan on investing in a home generator, the UPS systems they have nowadays won't keep the computer powered up for long.  They are basically designed to alert you when the power goes down and give you time to save everything and shut down your system.  Most are rated for around 10 minutes worth of power, depending on the draw (don't expect to play quake 3 on your geforce3 video card, max res for very long... monitor+cpu will drain a good amount).<br>
<br>
What they will do is give you an audible alarm that'll be VERY obvious.  The ones we use on the ship are like 90 db...you can hear it several spaces away.  They also stabalize the electrical current going to your computer.  Contrary to popular belief, the current going to your house isn't perfect.  Its got spikes that can play hell with computers...even with surge protectors.  UPS's are very good security to make sure the surges don't harm computer components.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, you could be talking about a generator with sensors to detect when the electrical power going to the house fall to low and automatically kick in...diesel/gas powered I'm guessing.  If so, ignore all of this... If you can afford this, hehe wow bud.<br>
<br>
All that being said, a UPS would be a great thing to ensure data is not lost on the server...providing your close enough to shut it down/force the game to save.  If it goes down at 8am and both your and Kal are at work, not sure if its gonna help much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/usiawnoverseas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siawn Overseas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Pawn</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/4/01 8:25:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Techincal Stuff</span><hr size=1> Did a little research, pasting it below.

Obviously, we are not going to have a Raid Arrary or anything of the sort to continually back-up data.  I don't think you can save the game without also closing the module for some period of time.<br>
<br>
Thus an obvious problem.   Considering we will not have a professional tech staff available to make sure player's data is routinely saved, I will need to develop some sort of schedule.  This will have to be some sort of compromise between the obvious need to save data at certain intervals and the players ability to play.   Since I do have a full time job, the times when I could save the module (unless there is some sort of auto-save feature) would always be during prime play times.<br>
<br>
Should I close the module every day at 6:00 PM to save the characters or save the module once a week on an early saturday morning when few people would be effected.  Not sure on that call.  During the first couple of months it probably wouldnt matter much since there would be almost daily content adds to the module. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#97694F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub26.ezboard.com/uirtumble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>I R Tumble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Master</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/5/01 7:21:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub26.ezboard.com/fapex71990frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Techincal Stuff</span><hr size=1> Network Administration and Enginering!

<br>
The biggest power hog out of everything you have running is going to be your monitors. I have a spare monitor switch in storage you can use which will conserve not only desk space for you but it will also conserve power in the log run.<br>
<br>
The important thing you need to consider here is how long you want the equiptment to continue running after the power is lost. In most cases an hour is more than enough time to contact any users and have them backup whatever they are working on and have them exit their system.<br>
<br>
In this case if you have the monitor switch, the server, your computer, a hub and a monitor connected to even the smallest APC unit you should stay operational for about 30 min. However, you could purchase a larger unit in the $500 range to provide about 2 hours of use for the above mentioned items.<br>
<br>
Beyond that range you start talking about the expandable units like I use here. While the individual battery packs are only about $200 the controller unit is about $2,000. But, you simply add a battery unit in a daisy chain any time you add more servers or other components.<br>
<br>
Somewhere here I have a program from APC which is supposed to help determine your power needs and which of their units would best adapt to that situation. I'll try to hunt it down for you sometime today.<br>
<br>
Oh! I also have copies of Windows NT and 2000 if you want to actually turn the computer into a server as opposed to it being another workstation on your network.<br>
