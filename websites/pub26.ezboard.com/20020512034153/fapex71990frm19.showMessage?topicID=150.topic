Downloading Modules <br>
Quote: RPG Junkie wrote: Will it automatically download it into like a &quot;modules&quot; directory under NWN or will it be like in Quake 3 and UT to where you manually install it ????<br>
<br>
In Windows and the strict sense of your question, it will be a manual download and install. This is because we cannot control where your web browser's default download directory. Some times its your desktop, sometimes its &quot;My Documents&quot;, etc. But, we are planning to make the downloads from our Community site come with a mini-installer that will extract the files and put them in their proper place, similar to The Sims, Need For Speed, etc.<br>
<br>
Quote: If you go into a server tha uses a module you dont have will it be automatically downloaded and installed correctly or would I still have to manually find/install the mod ???<br>
<br>
For modules, clients do not need the modules installed on their computers to play. No downloading occurs.<br>
<br>
Quote: Mokerr wrote: The bulk of the code is the game itself which you already have installed. So all you would download is the script, a few text files and sound files I would imagine. Probably be similar to CS or UT where the server sends everything you need to you and you just go from there.<br>
<br>
Nothing is downloaded if you the client playing on a NWN server. Information is streamed to the client, but it is not a file that is being sent.<br>
<br>
Quote: Becker wrote: Some of us wackos are making single-player downladable modules. We won't be hosting them. So someone goes to our site, gets the zip file, Unzips it, and then plays.

<br>
Well, we are even trying to make that a one step process, too. I can't comment any more on it right now, but we hope to have something for the solo module authors to make it easier for their users.<br>

Morbid Tilesets <br>
Quote: trc wrote: Bleak, desolate areas to include: lifeless forests burned out grasslands ragged rock plains swamps with nothing but dead trees &quot;Scottish highlands&quot; type settings moors lots of variations on rough rocky cliffsides Ruins, ruins, and more ruins and then some more variations on those ruins ...and, especially important, an ability to MIX tilesets in an area (albeit there are graphic implications for blending tiles, mixing mipmaps, etc.)<br>
<br>
The tilesets you suggest are a little morbid, don't you think? What about marsh filled with rotting corpses, hell city tileset with walls built from tormented souls? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  On the mixing tilesets issue, we build tilesets to keep unique texture and geometry counts down so our game doesn't require a 128mb video card and 512 mb of main system memory.<br>

Gibbed Creatures <br>
Chunks are in. Alex Scott, our local effects artist just re-did my old placeholders and they look good. There are few things in life that can bring as much joy as a freshly chunked Gnome Illusionist. <br>
<br>
Many things at the same time <br>
You can go into an &quot;active search&quot; which slows your movement rate to walking only. Stealth has the same effect with movement rate, forcing your character to walk. If you are in both modes at the same time you are moving at 1/2 walk speed (quite slow). IF you are also encumbered on top of ACtive search and stealth your movement rate will decline further.<br>

Animal Companions <br>
What exactly were you interested in knowing? Last time I saw they had both animal companions as well as the familiars in. The animal companions are pretty tough. Having a druid or ranger in your party with their dire wolf or mountain lion (or whatever the case might be) is pretty effective. Don't know how much specific information you're going to get at this point, though. How it works is still being tweaked as people are trying it out.<br>
<br>
Quote: I think the question is - to get an animal companion does the Druid have to find the animal in the wild and cast the spell on it (giving her the choice of an animal, but also limiting her to what is avialable) or is the animal &quot;summoned&quot; by the spell?<br>
<br>
Animal companions are summoned.<br>
<br>
Quote: Does she get to chose from a list or is the animal predetermined?<br>
<br>
You get to choose from a list. The animals also level up as you do.<br>
<br>
Quote: And I wanted to know if my Cleric with the Animal domain would get one! I've heard domain powers are out, but I've also heard domain spells will not be exactly the same, so I was hoping Animal Friendship might be a animal domain spell.<br>
<br>
Sorry...don't know about Clerics getting anything with regards to animals or domain spells. I doubt it, as it's meant to be a class feature for the Druids and Rangers, but I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
Quote: BTW, Mr. Gaider, are you on the NWN team?? I thought you oly worked on the BG series, if you're on NWN too... then.... er..... cool!<br>
<br>
Yep, I've been full time again on NWN for a while again, now. <br>
<br>
Druids <br>
If I remember right, I think the scimitars were given to Druids to make them more like the Celtic druids. Or was that the scythe? Do 3rd edition druids use scythes? Hmmm...if not, they probably should. <br>
<br>
Animal companions are a big plus for druids, too, don't forget that. The ability to carry on a coversation with the local fauna that's in-the-know is not to be underestimated, either. <br>
<br>
Simple features <br>
Quote: When you are the boss of a multi-year, megabucks, team project, feel free to decide what is easy to implement, and what is difficult. I'm continually amazed by all the programming experts on these boards. &quot;Why don't they put feature X in? It's so simple, I could do it with one line of code.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm afraid I have to agree with this one. Domain abilities are perfectly legitimate and no, not incredibly difficult to put in. However, we still may not have time to do it. There are numerous other things related to the rules we simply will not be able to put in the game right now, either...no matter how much we'd like to.<br>
<br>
I think the idea is to get in as much as possible, and make it work and be stable and be fun. Once we've got that accomplished, we can worry about getting in all the details. I don't know what the situation with domain powers is, personally...but somehow I think Clerics will still be quite well-off so long as they get access to their domain spells and auto-substitution of cure/cause spells. Those are, by far, the Cleric's bread and butter.<br>
<br>
Summoned creatures <br>
Let me tell you this. I don't know the exact list of summoned monsters in the game, myself, though I do know the one in the rulebook. And there are two things that come to mind that I think I can re-assure you with.<br>
<br>
1) The people doing the spells are very dogmatic about doing them as closely to the book as the engine will allow.<br>
<br>
2) The list of creatures that the game comes with (and yes, I know there will always be some monsters that you like that won't make it into release) has some, what I thought to be anyway, pretty obscure creatures. A lot of ones that you find on the creature summoning list, especially. I still remember doing a double-take the first time I saw the Lantern Archon.<br>
<br>
Whether all these things make it to final release remains to be seen, but there's a lot there already. As far as Monster Summoning and Summon Nature's Ally go, especially, there's a whole assortment of animals which will supply the normal/dire/celestial slots...not to mention the familiars and animal companions...that already exist.<br>
<br>
Hope that puts your mind at ease.<br>

Animal Companions <br>
Sorry for the wait folks. Here are some answers to a few of the Animal Companions Qs:<br>
<br>
I was wondering if you could tell me about Animal Companions. When you cast Animal Friendship does it summon an animal for you or do you have to find one to cast it on?<br>
<br>
[] ANSWER: You summon your animal companion. If you had to find an animal it would be module specific instead of game specific. Being at the whim of module designers is bad.<br>
<br>
As we get higher in levels does the companion get better or are we just able to cast the spell on more hit dice worth and end up with ton of creatures?<br>
<br>
[] ANSWER: The animal companion gets better as you go up in levels.<br>
<br>
About those animal companions: when you take possession of them (familiar), will you be able, when taking control of a bird, to fly up and see a farther? Or will the camera just be fixed on one altitude?<br>
<br>
[] ANSWER: Animal companions cannot be possessed, this a special power given to familiars only. <br>

In game voice <br>
Quote: Mokerr wrote: If there is no in game voice...Please do this.. Implement Radio text commands like CounterStrike. For those of you who don't know, CS's radio commands work like this. There is a main category which has a hot key and then subcategories with a numbered hot key. When you press x,3 you get a WAV file to play that says &quot;Hold this position&quot;. CS has voice now but most people still use the hotkeys because it's faster and gives clear direction. They take a while to learn but once you do, even in a twitch game like CS they can really aid strategy. <br>
<br>
Yep, we already have those. When you make a character you'll be able to choose a voiceset (which influence the actual verbal component that you hear when you press the hotkeys).<br>

Tile Modeling Info <br>
NWN tiles (and all the art) are built around base helper objects. These &quot;bases&quot; hold most of the game specific data (animation names, durations, etc). You can have a number of objects linked as children to the base and they will be exported as one model. Each child can have it's own texture, so you don't really need sub-object textures. You can model the grass and road, detach the road faces as a new object and apply a different texture. make the road a child of the grass and you should be just fine (just don't move the road). Tiling works fine as long as the texture can be completely repeated (you can't crop sub sections and repeat them). Basically, the system works quite well after you adopt a certain workflow pattern and it allows us to keep the native data formats quite clean and quite fast.<br>

Art Q&amp;A <br>
We received a few technical questions that were in Art Director, Marc Holmes, area of expertise. After a bit of back and forth with Brad and Trent to add their own bits and pieces here it is:<br>
<br>
Q) Am I right in assuming each 10mx10m tile is a separate file?<br>
<br>
A) Well, yes and no ? The source file in Max has all the tiles for one tileset but each tile is treated as single model on export. So a Max source file can generate a large number of model files. Getting source files to people that they can base their tiles on is something we are very interested in and we are looking into.<br>
<br>
Q) Does each tile have a dynamic poly's layer in the same file, and are<br>
there any conventions for these meshes. (in case you call them something different I'm talking collision systems)<br>
<br>
A) The collision system is based on a ?walk mesh?. The ?walk mesh? is just a simplified version of the visual mesh, and is made by hand. No special techniques are required.<br>
<br>
Q) There is some kind of bitmap for the UI map right? Is this stored<br>
separately and associated with the tile by naming it the same?<br>
<br>
A) As it stands, there is a kind of index for a tileset called a &quot;set file&quot;. The map icon, which appears in game, is specified per tile in the set file. There is not a 1-1 correlation with tiles and map icons. For instance the 7 types of flat open cobbles in city all associate with 1 map icon.<br>
<br>
Q) How is other information stored in the scene? Within nulls/locators? Or is it done afterwards within the toolset?<br>
<br>
A) Most other things should be done with either material colors on the walk mesh(for sound, visibility and walkability) or with triggers placed in toolset. Triggers are polygon objects as per BG trap triggers for example.<br>
<br>
Q) Do lights get exported with the tile? Do they need to be done in a<br>
special way?<br>
<br>
A) We feature lights that are preset on the tile and can be turned off and on, and set to different colors. You may also place lights by hand, as objects- i.e. torches, candles etc. The sun and moon properties and the ambient color are set by the area properties. Lights are created using our own custom defined in-game light objects within Max.<br>
<br>
Q) Is pathfinding done with nulls/locators at the modeling stage?<br>
<br>
A) Tiles have to follow pathfinding construction rules. Each tile must be made with one of the legal pathfinding templates. After we ship the game we will look into communicating this information.<br>
<br>
Q) How many textures do you tend to use per tile, or do you work it on a filesize quota?<br>
<br>
A) There should be a set memory footprint for each tileset which you cannot exceed. Otherwise you can organize as you wish within the 'pool'<br>
Those are the general answers.<br>
<br>
Many of these questions need specific answers, but we cannot do that just yet. We mainly don't want to be giving out information that may end up having to change for technical reasons. The last thing people want to do is start work and then have their stuff go out of date!<br>

Druids <br>
So all you really want to know is...<br>
<br>
1) Do we have different musical instruments? (Or any, for that fact.)<br>
2) Can you play them?<br>
3) Is there a Perform skill, and if there is is it available to all classes?<br>
<br>
That about sum it up? Well, of course you all want to know. Duh. Every question seems perfectly legitimate and important to all of you, I'm sure. At any rate, the last post wasn't the answer. I just wanted to make sure I had my bases covered when I went and asked.<br>
<br>
The answers, then:<br>
<br>
1) Do we have different musical instruments? (Or any, for that fact.)<br>
2) Can you play them?<br>
<br>
There's no musical instruments in the way that I think you're asking. There's no animation of using an instrument, at any rate. A regular item could be created that was an instrument, and it could be 'used' to make a variety of effects (and even play music, if the sound file was available). In fact, you could also make a check vs. Perform in the script lead into different effects or sounds.<br>
<br>
Again, though, there's no animation for actually wielding the instrument. That would be nice, but there's no plan for it currently. Bard Song ability is, of course, something else altogether.<br>
<br>
3) Is there a Perform skill, and if there is is it available to all classes?<br>
<br>
Yes. It's available to those classes which have it in-class at regular cost, anyway, and to the others as a cross-class skill.<br>
<br>
Toad Companions <br>
No toads, I'm afraid. <br>
<br>
Fog Control <br>
Quote: 2) Can the color of the fog be changed? And this raises the follow-up question: can it be changed while the module is running or only when the module is created in the toolset?<br>
<br>
The color of the fog is changeable, yes. As to whether or not fog or colors are changeable on the fly...not sure about that, myself. I'd say probably, but I haven't seen the actual commands.<br>
<br>
Quote: 3) I take it fog is something that applies to an entire area. We can't make sections of fog (i.e. volumetric fog) because of the tile-based nature of NWN. Are these presumptions correct?<br>
<br>
Correct.<br>
<br>
Quote: 4) It has been mentioned that when creating a module in the toolset you can specify its Ambient Light, Sun Light, and Moon Light. Can these all be altered independently of eachother while the module is running? If so, does this pose any significant performance hit on machines?<br>
<br>
If there are commands to change the types of light on the fly (you forgot Diffuse Light in that list, btw), then you will be able to change each one, I'm sure. No, it does not cause much of a performance hit. <br>
<br>
Are there enough polys? <br>
I don't think modem speed has as much to do with the polygon count as processor speed does (although a slow connection on a chugging machine certainly wouldn't help matters insofar as playability goes). When we make our final count of the number of players, NPC's and placeable objects that you can have in an area, it's going to have to be playable by a machine with the minimum specs. And we want the game to have as much as content as possible for those min spec machines.<br>
<br>
There is going to be adjustable detail...but you can only take that so far. You can take away grass effects and other cool but performance-hogging things...but you can't reduce the polygon count of models on the fly (at least, as I understand it you can't...I'm not an artist). You can be sure we'll be making all efforts to enhance performance as possible.<br>
<br>
If we were to raise the min spec requirement a la Luclin (and just what is the min spec requirement for World of Warcraft, anyway? I don't think they've announced that, yet), then certainly...I expect a lot more could be done.<br>
<br>
Should we do that? I don't know, personally. Right now the range in processing speeds out there is so wide. Is it reasonable to expect people to upgrade in order to play? There's a can of worms for ya. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quote: Do you think you could find one thing out for me? (David or Jay) If I add 50% more polys per scene in my mod, will the engine run it? If so i can just have a higher minimum spec for my mod.<br>
<br>
I will go and ask, but I'll tell you this: when we say what the basic limitation is regarding the number of players/NPC's/placeable objects will be in the game, that is primarily an official number. Meaning that if someone meets our min specs and comes to us saying that they're experiencing crashes when they meet those numbers, that's something we need to look into right away.<br>
<br>
Even with Vampire:Redemption's MP capability, the 'maximum' number of players was set at 4...but if your computer had a greater capacity, you could include more. I saw games that have 6 or even 8 players going in them in the brief time I played the game.<br>
<br>
So I expect that if you included models with higher details in your resources, that shouldn't be a problem so long as it meets NWN's other standards. You just have to keep in mind that anyone who's going to play the game has to a) download those resources from you and b) have an equivalent or greater system in order to run it with any degree of playability.<br>
<br>
I may be wrong, though, so I'll go check.<br>
<br>
Monster Tags <br>
If you create a monster, you can put whatever name to it that you like. Putting in a script that changes the name from 'monster' to 'Hutteroid', or whatever, after the players find out what the creature is actually called (setting the appropriate module global), might also be kind of cool, no?<br>
<br>
With 3rd edition, players shouldn't expect too much when encountering even the lowly goblin. If you look at the system, there's a whole big thing in there for the HD-ranges of monsters...never mind using humanoid creatures and adding classes to them. The first time my low-level party encountered a 5th-level Sorcerer kobold and his 4th-level Warrior kobold chieftan they learned to be wary. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(and, yes...putting these classes on monsters is easy to do, especially with the Creature Wizard.) <br>
<br>
Difficulty Indicator <br>
(Ed. Note: This post is in reference to an indicators used in MMORPG games like Everquest, and Anarchy Online, that would appear over a creature. Green is an easy opponent. Yellow is equal and Red is tough)<br>
<br>
No, there's nothing like that in NWN. If your party of 5th-level characters encounter a huge Black Dragon and decide that they can take him...well, they're always free to roll up new characters, aren't they? <br>
<br>
Placeable Campfires <br>
Yes, actually. I believe a campfire is one of the placeable objects. If not, I'm positive that there's a 'pile of wood' object and a seperate 'small fire' object to place on top of it. If you want to be detailed, you can also spread around some blankets.<br>
<br>
Once placed, these objects are only moveable/destroyable by the GM (unless they aren't marked 'indestructable' and are given HP...then the players or maybe monsters can destroy them, as well).<br>
<br>
Will you talk with us? <br>
No, no...after the game is released, we plan on dropping you all like hot potatoes. We'll have a wall of silence go up like communist Russia. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Seriously, though...while I'm not Bob, I have little doubt that we'll be free to chat about the story and whence it came once the possibility of spoilers is past.<br>

Anyone Scripting Battle Chess <br>
I've made one already. Well, I haven't finished the 'battle' part of it yet, but the chess part is completely working. Currently when one piece takes another the taken piece just disappears and the other just walks over and takes its place. But its still cool. When I get some time I am planning on making the pieces fight and stuff. Then it will be super-cool. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I honestly have no idea, but you never know. If it isn't I'll make it available over the web anyway.<br>

The problem arises if you want to create a computerized opponent. Had there not been security concerns with allowing scripts to have an interface to the rest of the machine, it would have been interesting to use NWN as a frontend to GNUchess.<br>

Yeah, I was thinking about Archon too. And you're right, the board and rules aren't that hard, computer opponents are the sticky bit. I haven't put in a computer opponent yet - I'm not sure if I ever will, it will depend on how much time and motivation I have. If I don't though, I'm sure someone else will.<br>

Um.... cows? They're close enough aren't they? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (just in case anybody doesn't know what we're getting at, think of what a knight is usually represented with, and what certain feature isn't in the game)<br>
