<p><b>Estate of Unrest</b></p>
<p align=left>A Dwarven noble once occupied this beautiful estate. Its gardens and fountains were admired by all. Even the Koada'Dal have commented on its elegance. During the Great War that Artillian so bravely triumphed in, this estate was overrun by the most wicked evil of all, the undead. The powers in the Estate of Unrest have been growing. If not checked soon they will grow to envelop Kaladim. It is our duty and our honor that we subdue the evil in Unrest. I do not know if we can completly vanquish the undead from this estate, but we must march there now and see if we had hold back the tide of evil. Erollisi willing, we will eliminate the danger of Unrest for a short time.</p>
<p align=left>OOC details: Cursus Honorum will raid Unrest on Thursday, March 29th. The raid will begin at 5pm PST and continue until approximately midnight. Levels 10 to 25 are welcome to come. We will break down into groups according to level and assault different parts of Unrest. The lowest levels will have a full time job killing death bettles and other wandering monsters outside the building. The mid and higher levels will camp outside while someone searches the inside of the estate to return with many fearsome undead from the first and second floors. If a group is strong enough they may elect to camp the bar and/or tower if it is available. Those above level 25 who wish to attend will be the pullers for our groups. If too many high level people arrive they can break off from the raid and go into the basement. Friends are welcome to attend. I will send this message to a few other guilds.<br><br>
Earning awards and points will be at the discretion of the host. If you can only stay for a short time or if other activities prevent you from participating, then no award will be earned. Those who break off to go fight in the basement will not earn awards either, unless they rotate members so that everyone has opportunity to support the groups above.<br><br>
For those of you who have never been to unrest here is how you get there. First make your way to Butcherblock Mountains. From Port Faydwer you follow the path and keep right at any intersections to find the pass to Dagnor's Cauldron. From Greater Faydark you follow the path but keep left at any intersections instead, or you can follow the left wall. Once you zone into Dagnor's travel down the mountain pass until you arrive at the lake. Turn right and follow the shore until you reach the tunnel that leads to Unrest at approximately /loc -1800, -700. The tunnel is easy to miss so you may want to travel up from the shore from time to time to make sure you don't over shoot it. Be careful of wandering Goblins and extra careful of the Goblin camp that you will pass on the way to Unrest. A map from www.eqatlas.com may prove useful. Once inside Unrest we will be forming up against the rear wall by the back door to the estate. Follow the right or left walls inside Unrest to arrive at the rear wall. Low levels may want to acquire invisibility or camouflage for their journey; Unrest can be extremely dangerous if you are ungrouped.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>We marched with confidence to the gates of the Estate of Unrest. We heard murmurs and saw shadows move, but the estate did not look over run with undead. A small detachment scouted the grounds and only found a few skelletons and zombies. They dispatched them and moved in further. Upon entering the main house a flood of terrible screams came down on them. Countless undead attacked and clawed at them. They had set a trap for us. Our people executed a fighting withdrawl and took losses as they came back to our base camp.</p>
<p align=left>We judged their defenses then marched forward, cutting a path through all who opposed us. Some creatures came out of the house to join the fight, but it soon became clear that their only hope was to fortify themselves inside. Our army surrounded the house and sent in sqauds to clear away defenders at all the key entrances. We fought them back and secured the first floor. It would seem that the undead here knew we were coming but were surprised with the force we arrived with. The undead were much better protected on the upper floors as well as the basement. However, our forces fought numerous skirmishes above and below with little or no losses. In time, we had thinned out the undead to a point where it became difficult to find them. Sometimes we would stumble onto one, or perhaps a few would emerge from the earth out out of a wall. I do not believe the evil of this place can ever be completely vanquished, but we were sucessful in curbing the danger for now.</p>
<p align=left>Most of our army were marching back to Kaladim when the undead presented one last fight. A stream of ghouls and skelletons charged from the house into the gardens. We were caught by surprise; no one could explain where they could have been hiding. Many brave fighters fell while trying to stand their ground. We got into formation and met the undead charge head on. After their momentum was broken they tried to flee, but we ran them down and ended the battle of Unrest.</p>
<p align=left>Benedain was lost in trance while we made final preperations to leave this cursed place. When he came to he informed me that our work here is not done. While he fought in the basement he felt a presence. Something was calling to him but he could not discover who. While in trance he journied in the spirit world to find his answers. He said that the Dwarven noble who once presided over this estate was still here, trapped and tortured. His spirit haunts the basement and he has asked that we free him. With most of our forces gone and the new unknown threat of the basement I decided that we will return to help the Dwarven spirit, but not today. Benedain looked sad but understood my reasoning. We finished our preperations and marched out of the estate. It was unnerving when the wind would howl behind us, I could not help but think it was distant moaning.</p>
