<p><b>Why join a guild?</b></p>
<p>editorial by Rohwin</p>
<p align=left>Do you need a Guild? You certainly don't require a guild but there are many advantages and few disadvantages, provided that you choose the right one for you. Everquest is based on the concept of teamwork and diversity. Every class has its own strengths and weaknesses. The most effective groups are always diverse in its players. A significant part of the game is spent seeking group mates to hunt with or explore a dark dungeon. In a guild you potentially have a large pool of known good players to draw from. If you are shouting for a group in a random zone, you never know what type of player you are going to get. I'm sure we all have been in a few groups that were simply awful. If you have a guild full of good players then you have a much better chance at forming a good group. However, if your guild is too small, then the benefits are lost because nobody is on-line, currently available, or not close enough to your level. So large guilds are desirable but strict recruitment must be enforced. If you have a large guild full of rotten players then it can be really terrible. It must be absolutely clear to everyone in the guild, especially officers, what type of player is good for the guild. To keep recruitment procedures clear, as well as all the rules of a guild, a guild must have a web-site so everything may be published. Consequently, the guildleader should be the web master, to make certain the web-site always exists as long as the guild does. Another advantage to a guild is for questing. Many quests require killing high-level creatures in dangerous areas without much reward for the group. Guild members are much more likely to assist in questing. Guild members know you much better and have the assurance that you may help them in return later. A stranger may never see you again, and may be hesitant to help out of good will. Also, some places have rare and extremely valuable loot. A group of guild-mates could decide ahead of time who is getting the valuable loot, or how it should be distributed. Strangers will certainly demand a "roll" for valuable loot even if they can not use it themselves. For example, if you got 30 people killing a dragon, who gets the helm of god power or similar loot? These types of raids go better when looting and questing details are worked out ahead of time, and much easier if everyone is in the same guild.</p>
<p align=left>There are two basic types of guilds, the role-playing and non-role-playing. Role-playing guilds try to add more depth to the game. They tend to have strict restrictions on the types of races and classes allowed into their guild. They try to maintain a theme or a story-line in the guild. The varieties of these guilds are extreme. Some are simply rouge only guilds, or maybe it's no necromancers or shadow knights allowed. Others can be very complex, involving many required quests or possibly requiring everyone to stay in character at all times. Role-playing guilds can be very rewarding. They are meant to increase the interest and fun of the game beyond the original programming. It is up to the individual to decide how much "role-play" they want in their guild.</p>
<p align=left>There are many potential problems with role-playing guilds. Many role-play guilds are too restrictive without adding significant role-play. Some guilds have nothing but a list of creatures you cannot kill, without offering any explanation why. Some are inherently weak because the types of characters allowed to join are too few. This makes the guild much smaller and too specialized. An all Paladin guild will have a very tough time trying to raid dungeons by themselves. Without the support of other classes a guild will become dependant on outside help. Some people feel their heavy restrictions in a guild are necessary for the elements of role-play, and they may be right. It would be very awkward to allow Necromancers into a Paladin guild. The problems of a limited guild can be overcome by maintaining good friends outside the guild. Also, forming alliances with other guilds that have proven themselves good players is important. </p>
<p align=left>Non-role-playing guilds are usually a collection of friends or competent players. They have very little restrictions on the types of players that are admitted. They tend to grow much faster and are very diverse. Consequently, tend to be very powerful. Their size and power are very attractive, but for some players, the lack of depth in the role-play aspect is unacceptable.</p>
<p align=left>The size of a powerful guild can also be a detriment. Unless extreme care is used in recruiting new members, lousy players may infiltrate the guild and ruin it. Many guilds do not address this issue because when they formed their guild they were all friends and pretty much agreed on what type of people they were looking for. As time goes on and they invite more friends and their friends' friends, then a problem starts to develop. Around the 3rd or 4th generation of new members, the people inviting new members have no idea what the guildleader originally had in mind. It is imperative that the rules and procedures are clearly documented on the guild web-site, and that they are enforced. Even if extreme caution is used you are bound to pick up a few "dudes" or "bozos" once in a while. If this happens then the guildleader has to be ready to remove the undesirables. The rules on removing a member need to be documented as well.</p>
<p align=left>Joining a guild is a very important decision and you should think carefully before applying to one. Always check out their web-site first. Read all their rules and regulations and make sure you understand and agree with them. Talk to the members of the guild and see if their playing style is compatible with yours. If recruitment is too fast then be cautious. If they are not screening you carefully then the other members of the guild probably weren't either. One of the best ways to check out a guild is to group with them. Fight with them and see first-hand how they are. If you have questions about a guild then ask them on-line or E-mail them if you can. Most Guilds will be happy to answer all your questions. The main thing is to join a guild that is right for you.</p>
<p align=left>These are just some of the basic pros and cons of the types of guilds available. The most important thing to remember is that in Everquest you will be dependent on other people. The type of person you group with or have as guild-mates will make or break the game. No matter what your playing style is, just make sure that you are enjoying the game and enjoying the people you play it with.</p>
