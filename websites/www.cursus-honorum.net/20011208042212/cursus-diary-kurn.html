<p>Mystery of Kurn's Tower</p>
<table cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 border=0>
<tr>
<td align=left colspan=2>My time in Kunark has made me more perplexed then when I began my journey. I knew that the Iksar emmisary was attempting to set a trap for us. We were prepared for their ambush and turned the tables on them quite nicely. When it was clear that they held no advantage over us, most of them fled. We did however manage to capture one. He spoke a crude, slurring form of common, but we did manage to question him. The Iksar offered no information of value regarding their military strengths or intentions, but he did provide us some insight on their history. By studying their past, hopefully we can learn more about these evil creatures. Their reptilian features are akin to dragons, and make them likely minons of them. However, after speaking with our captive I do not believe they are allied with the dragons. The Iksar claimed that their once great empire was destroyed by the Rune of Scale. The Iksar are certainly not our allies, but we may have a common enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>The field of bone is properly named. An evil scar is prevelant here. Even though it is not a very strong presense, it is alarming at how wide spread it is. The entire region is infested with many forms of undead skelletons. They are mindless creatures that attack virtually anything they see. Our party easily crushed all that opposed us, but the constant harrasment was unnerving and we got little sleep at night.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>Amongst the ruins in the field of bone are two places of interest. One is a forbiding tower that dominates the dry resiviour, the other is a collection of ruins surounded by a decaying wall. Our prisoner said the tower is called Kurn's Tower. It is abandoned, but sometimes strange sounds emenate from it. The ruins he called Kaesora. He said they were haunted and the evil that resides their is very strong. Cabilis has given up hope of ever recovering it. My party is too small I think to explore the ruins of Kaesora, but Kurn's tower intrigues me. We shall investigate the mysteries of the tower.</td><td width=100 align=center valign=top><img src="/images/pics/kurnstower1thumb.jpg" width=85 height=75><br><a href="cursus-pics-kurn1.html">Kurn's Tower</a></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>Kurn's Tower is an imposing structure that looks over the dry resiviour in the northern end of the region. Why the Iksar have abandoned it we do not know. It would seem that it is not wholely abandoned because we too have heard the strange noises rumored to come from within the tower, we must investigate. I have sent the bulk of our party back to Faydwer, but I have retained two to assist me in Kurn's Tower. First is my beloved wife Jezeb. Her talents in healing may prove benificial if the tower is more dangerous then it's rumored to be. Also, she has an eye as well as the hand for art. She has volunteered to make drawings of anything important we see. The other is my long time companion Benedain. He consulted his sacred bones in some kind of mystical cerimony. Then he agreed that the three of us should be sufficent to explore the tower. I do not understand the nature of the visions Benedain claims to see, but he has proved benifical to Artillian in times past, and I have never known him to be wrong in my presence in the years that I have known him.</td><td align=center valign=top><img src="/images/pics/fieldofboneresivourthumb.jpg" width=85 height=75><br><a href="cursus-pics-fob1.html">Dry Reservoir</a></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>Inside, it must have been a place of great beauty at one time, but now it is crawling with filthy skelletons. Upon our entry several of these bone creatures came at us. We smashed and sliced our way through them. We saw many others in the distance, but the comotion of our fighting did not seem to disturb them. We proceded carefully into the inner chambers of the tower. Many of the rooms we entered were occupied by frightful skelletons, but we had little trouble defeating them. We explored the tower room by room. We avoided most of the skelletons we saw rather then attemp to slay everthing. Whether we were too stealthy for them or maybe they chose to ignore us we do not know. Our adversaries were not strong nor prepared for our onslaught so we had little trouble subduing the ones we did fight, but I shudder to think what might happen if they coordinated themselves and came at us at all at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>On the second floor we saw fine engravings of Iksar and curious tapestries. Both were severely aged and tattered. Many of the tapestries had an odd symbol on them. A circle made from five somewhat trianglular pointed shapes. We only pondered them for a moment then pressed on to the upper levels.</td><td align=center valign=top><img src="/images/pics/kurnstower3thumb.jpg" width=85 height=75><br><a href="cursus-pics-kurn2.html">Tapestry</a></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>We continued to crush many skelletons as we advanced higher and higher. The upper floors all looked the same. There were broken down furniture and spiderwebs and plenty of skelletons. We found nothing of interest until we reached the tower's highest level. Here we found a great room with odd designs on the walls. The walls were texured in such a way to look like Iksar scales. The patterns made gentle swoops about the room. This room was clearly important at one time.</td><td align=center valign=top><img src="/images/pics/kurnstower5thumb.jpg" width=85 height=75><br><a href="cursus-pics-kurn3.html">Top Room</a></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>We pondered why these skelletons occupied the tower. Was is just part of the evil curse of the field of bone, or did they serve a master. Benedain pointed out that we have not heard any of the strange noises inside this tower. In fact, the skelletons were exceptionally quiet. Disappointed at the lack of evidence we decided to leave this tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>On our way out, we noticed something on the second floor that we did not see earlier. In the hallways there we long engravings along the walls. They looked exactly like the engravings on the top floor, except for two things. First was that these looked freshly engraved. They were clean and colored. Second, they formed the shape of a great serpent. These were not Iksar scales, they were snake scales. Its head was clear at the end of the hallway. It was hard to believe that we had not seen them earlier. As we examined these engravings, we were taken by surprise as a slain skelleton reassembled itself and attacked us from behind. We escaped any serious injury and slew the creature for a second time. Then we saw more skelletons begin to reanimate and rise from the floor. They were forming up in rows and began slowly advancing towards us. We decided to make our exit hasty and scurried down the stairs. At the entrance of the tower were hundreds of skelletons forming a wall of bone. We were trapped.</td><td align=center valign=top><img src="/images/pics/kurnstower2thumb.jpg" width=85 height=75><br><a href="cursus-pics-kurn4.html">Serpent</a></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>The skelletons behind us were coming down the stairs in formitable numbers now. We could not charge our way through the main entrance. We did not know where to go. Jezeb spied a staircase leading down. We saw no other choice so we bounded for the stairs leading to the basement. When we crossed the first floor the skelletons by the entrance reacted. They made strange squeals and chatters, almost like demented laughter as they charged after us.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>In the basement we raced through corridors and rooms, we could only pray that there was an exit somewhere down here. Ahead of us we heard low rumbling and thumping, it was the noise we had heard from outside, and it was getting louder. We crashed through many occupied rooms as we ran. We wasted no time smashing whatever skelletons we found. As we tired and suffered many minor injuries, we came to realize that we might not find an exit down here. We eluded our pursuing undead so far, but we knew that our luck would not last indefinatly. We stopped in a hallway to catch our breath for a moment. We heard a strange creaking sound echoing in the hall. I thought it came from ahead of us and Benedain thought it came from behind us. Jezeb was correct when she said it was coming from below us, then the floor gave way and we plumeted into darkness below.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>Our injuries from the fall were painful, but not severe. The only light was from the hole in the ceiling far above our heads. The grumbling thumping sounds were much louder down here. Jezeb soothed our injuries with magic then conjured a halo of light above her head. Now we could see where fate had taken us. We were in a dark cave with roughly cut walls. Someone was digging tunnels below the tower. Above us we saw skelletons crowding around the hole looking down at us. They did not jump down after us. I suspected it was too far a drop for their brittle bones.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>We walked through the caves with some caution. We rounded a corner and saw masses of Burynai digging at the walls. They were giant creatures that looked like moles who walked upright, as tall as a man, but twice as broad. They had very long and strong claws for digging at the dirt and rock. This was the noise that has been emanating from Kurn's Tower. Mixed among the Burynai were more skelletons. They worked side by side. They were working towards a purpose, but neither the skelletons nor the Burynai were in control of the other. They were both pawns of an unknown master. With no other options available, we attempted to sneak by them in the darkness. Jezeb extingquished her halo and we snuck along the wall. It seems the Burynai have excellent night vision for working in the dark, because we were spotted almost immeadiatly.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>The Burynai made shrill noises at deafening levels and rushed at us with the skelletons shortly behind them. I met them with my sword and cut the first few down. Jezeb and Benedain let loose their magic of destruction and Burynai and skelletons alike were falling all around us. I felt strength leave my body suddenly. The effect stunned me momentarily and a Burynai opened large gashes into my platemail with its claws. I beat back the Burynai, but many more of them were closing in around us. I saw the source of my sudden discomfort on the far side of the room. Several Burynai were casting spells at us. I was hit by a wave of green light; I could feel evil trying to seep into my skin. Only my devotion to Erollisi kept me from suffering further. I ordered my companions to exit out of the side of this chamber while I covered them.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>As soon as they had left the chamber I made a full retreat after my companions, with mobs of Burynai and undead in pursuit. I caught up with Jezb and Benedain a few hundred paces later. They were standing before an underground river with no other passages connecting with the tunnel we were in. Jezeb exclaimed that this river must go out somewhere. Benedain pulled some fish scales from his pouch and chanted far too slow for my comfort. Our pursuers were only seconds away when the fish scales disolved into light and I no longer felt it necessary to breathe. The three of us nodded at each other and jumped into the river.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>The swift current swept us downriver fast. I was repeatedly bruised as I collided with rocks. The river dipped completely into the ground, with no air above us. We had no idea where we were heading or how long Benedain's spell would last. I prayed for the exit of this river to come soon.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>After an inderminate amout of time we plunged into a muddy bank. I could see faint light above the water and I pulled myself onto a sandy shore. I found Jezeb and Benedain already out of the water and gasping heavily. I took my first breath of air after a long wait and coughed loudly. We were in a small cave with a sandy floor. The river made a sharp bend here and continued to flow into the darkness beyond. The light came from behind some rocks, and I could hear the sounds of birds and the surf of the ocean. We composed ourselves and staggered onto a beach with the vast Timorous Deep before us.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left colspan=2>We blinked as our eyes adjusted to the harsh light. It would seem that we escaped our pursuers and almost certainly death. Jezeb comented that the spells used against us were the type granted by Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule. The Burynai had entered into a pact with evil, but the question remained, who was their master. Benedain shook his seven sacred bones in his hands and cast them into the sand. Then he pointed down the beach, indicating which direction we should travel to rejoin our comrades. As we journied along the coast I looked inland and saw Kurn's Tower looming in the distance.</td></tr>
