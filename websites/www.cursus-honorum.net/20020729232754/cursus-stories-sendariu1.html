<h2><u>Stories</u></h2>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Sendariu's character history, brief version</b></p>
<br>
	<p align=left>The air of the dark elven forest, Neklutos, was chill on Sendariu's warm flesh. It always was. It has been rumored amongst the younger necromancers that the ancient necromancers that had been with some of the first to claim this forest as home had laid spells of death into the trees that any elf knowing where they were would turn and flee.
<br><br>
Sendariu was quite comfortable and accustomed to the deathlike chill for her very lessons in the dark arts were held in the company of quite powerful undead. This night seemed more chill than most however. There was something odd about the evening, something was…out of place. Shrugging it off, Sendariu continued towards the fallen tree which served as the landmark of the younglings hunting grounds. Normally the sounds of battle and chants of spellcasting could be heard quite a distance away, but it was now deathly quiet and she was nearing the log.
<br><br>
And then she saw the reason why. A beacon of shining silver stood atop the log. There had never been anything so brilliant and radiant as this. Creeping closer, as silently as she could, Sendariu leaned up against a tree, hoping to hide most of her figure. Her gray training robes helped her blend with the perpetual darkness.
<br><br>
She could now make out the form of a man. A dark elf, she thought. That thought was eliminated from her mind when the armored man turned and revealed the soft, pale flesh and sharp features of an elf. By his face, he was clearly also part human. His hand rested atop the elegant, very finely crafted hilt of a long sword in its scabbard at his side.
<br><br>
Sendariu gasped and took a step back, knowing that was a fatal mistake as soon as she did it. A twig lying in ambush behind her snapped, clearly echoing through the woods. Fear welled in her stomach.
<br><br>
The half elf turned his gaze to hers and focused his dark brown eyes on her emerald green. Sendariu found she could not tear her gaze from his, no matter how hard she fought herself. His lips formed a slight smile and he hopped down from the log, his silver plate mail rattling together as he landed.
<br><br>
"Good evening" said the half elf, his voice soft and calming. Sendariu felt her fears ease slightly at his calm manner, and the fact his weapon was still in its scabbard. His steps were slow, unthreatening, and the smile on his face was genuine.
<br><br>
Sendariu could not reply, she could not speak or move one inch either. Her muscles trembled and her legs threatened to give way beneath her. She swallowed a lump that had formed in her throat. This new fear was strange indeed. It was unlike the intimidation the elder Tier'Dal constantly pounded her with day after day. This fear was…something foreign. It seemed more purifying than simply disarming. The air around her seemed to thin and her breathing became difficult.
<br><br>
Before she knew, a mailed hand rested gently upon her forehead and very gently coolness seemed to flow through her veins, soothe the trembling of her legs. The burning in her cheeks faded and what small ache that ran through her head seemed to turn to a gentle chill, clearing the fear that had dulled her thoughts. She closed her eyes and sighed in relief. A gentle warmth followed the coolness, an inner warmth that seemed to loosen her muscles and continuously send little jolts of energy through her body. In the relaxation she seemed to have forgotten her need to balance until the half elven hand was removed from her forehead and reality came rushing back to her.
<br><br>
In the rush, her legs seemed to have been dropped on new ground, for she stumbled back into a nearby tree. Her eyes flashed open and found the same sight which shed closed them to: the wonderful dark brown eyes of the silver clad half elf.
<br><br>
"Mithaniel takes a liking to you. His blessings would take hold on none of the other drow that have approached." The paladin said. "Live well, good lady." He completed with a graceful bow. Raising, he gave her a brief smile and turned, walking away down the open path with a slight spring of happiness evident in his step.
<br><br>
Sendariu blinked repeatedly trying to figure out what had just taken place, the inner warmth still zinging through her body. Shaking her head as if coming out of a daze, Sendariu glanced around hurriedly, wanting to speak with the half elf now that her wits had returned. Unfortunately, he was no where to be seen.
<br><br>
Puzzled and a bit disappointed, Sendariu turned and decided to return to her studies, the desire to practice her arts receding.
<br><br>
Upon returning to the home of necromancy in Neriak, the ghouls that forever guarded the entrance hissed and shuffled towards her dangerously. Sendariu passed them nervously. Though they were forbidden to ever attack a practitioner of necromancy, they have never even dared to look dubiously at any passing Tier'Dal. Until now. The inner gates were odd as well; they seemed abnormally heavy. Shrugging it off, she continued foreword to her chambers, thinking some rest would remedy this all. As she reached her door, however, a crisp voice called out behind her.
<br><br>
"Sendariu! Halt!" The voice called so clearly it may well have been heard through her mind as well as her ears. Sendariu froze. This was the voice of her master, Xon Quexill himself. A man whom even the mightiest of the Indigo Brotherhood cower before. And now, there was clear anger in his voice.
<br><br>
Swallowing the lump of cold fear that had formed in her throat, Sendariu turned slowly, her head lowered carefully to keep her eyes on the ground only.
<br><br>
"You carry the stench of a paladin into my domain. You dare consort with a being of the Marrs and return here. And now here you stand, pretending ignorance." He growled out, slowly stepping closer. His anger radiated outward in a dark aura, turning Sendariu's stomach with fear. She'd not even thought about the half elf until now!
<br><br>
Sendariu felt the strength of her legs fade away suddenly, bringing her to her knees. Her master's hand, usually lending a sense of power and immunity to those who practice necromancy, bunt hotly on her forehead just where the paladins hand had been. Instead of a warming sensation, however, pain shot through head, a searing, burning pain that she'd never before suffered. She cried out and the pain broght tears to her eyes. Unwilling to show even more weakness, Sendariu closed her eyes tightly. The calming inner warmth waned and finally gave way to a violent nausea.
<br><br>
Throwing her violently to the side, her master turned and walked away with a sound of disgust. He stopped at the corner of the hallway and said over his shoulder, "And do not think to cast your gaze in my direction again. You are a disgrace to the art of necromancy and no longer any student of mine." He cast one more hateful glare at her and continued back to his chambers.
<br><br>
Sendariu barely heard anything through her painful retching, but the words 'no longer any student of mine.' Rang clearly. A large lump seemed to have formed in her throat as her retching subsided and she knew it would soon be replaced with sobs. The nausea remained, however, and most likely would for weeks.
<br><br>
Picking herself up, sendariu hobbled the rest of the way down the hall to her small chamber on shaky legs. She shut the door behind her and leaned her weight back against it. Thoughts of that handsome half elf ran through her mind, his wonderful brown eyes, the gentle wisp of hair that fell from the rest. Why had these thoughts returned to haunt her now? Damn Mithaniel and his cursed blessings! They had taken one thing she had loved from her. They had taken away the ability to practice and further the art she was born with.
<br><br>
Rough coughs wracked her body and sent her to her knees once more. She managed to crawl her way to her small, hardly comfortable bed and gazed at the bland celing above her. She knew, deep inside, that no matter how she cursed the light she found it interesting and somewhat beckoning. Ever since she'd learned about the Marrs and their cowardly, foolish ways she had thought day and night about what their followers would be like. She'd even gone so far as to think about how it might feel to actually follow in their worship. She kept these thoughts secret, of course, lest the diviners of Neriak discover and either torture her to death or until she subsided to their will.
<br><br>
Now, as she winced constantly in the painful curse that had both dispelled the holy magics and served as a punishment, wished she had followed one of the gods of light; she'd never heard of them tormenting their servants. Only that they would never grant true power to them for some reason or another. Most of what Sendariu had learned about the gods of light she did not believe at all. It seemed everything was either in ones benefit or ones demise, and to be kind is to be weak.
<br><br>
Sendariu cried out in pain again as it fealt a blade had been thrust into her side and withdrawn quickly. Holding her side she curled up and began to sob, knowing how futile it was. No one would hear, and no one would care. No one ever would in this city.
<br><br>
Several weeks past before Sendariu's condition finally improved enough for her to venture outside the city's gates. At first she left the city to simply wander about in the open air which was never fully open in the confining and dominating forest. After a while she began to take to watching the young warriors and spell casters fight their small battles with the more simple creatures. Watching the young necromancers advance in their art constricted Sendariu's heart painfully, her desire to see into the mysteries of death and the afterlife never to be satisfied because of her banishment from the practice of necromancy.
<br><br>
One day she even considered taking to battle one of the small creatures, but many of the other young drow knew of her punishment and cast her warning gazes when she began to cast a spell. She quickly extinguished the awakened magic and sulked back to her chamber.
<br><br>
Many, many months of agonizing torment within the cavernous walls of Neriak led her to the thought of leaving and pursuing necromancy elseware. "But where?" she thought to herself, "No one would welcome me aside from the poor Ogres and Trolls, and they have no skill in these arts."
<br><br>
"Then venture to one of the human cities." A very soft voice said behind her. The unexpected voice surprised Sendariu so much she very nearly jumped high enough to greet one of the tower guards watching over Neriak. Spinning around, she found that the speaker wore very dark crimson robes and appeared rather old for a dark elf. A diviner!
<br><br>
"What? A human city? They…they would slay me!" Sendariu exclaimed, trying to keep her voice down. She didn't know exactly what this diviner came for or what he would do with her now that her plot to leave and resume her practice of necromancy was discovered. The diviner only gazed at her with a bit of an amused look.
<br><br>
"The vile of Freeport would look upon you with envy that you could be so dark a creature, and the guards would simply marvel that a drow had been sighted. None would pose you any harm. Oh, and the drow have no jurisdiction there, so you neednt worry about your arts." The diviner said, still watching her steadily. He leaned a bit on his staff. "Oh, yes, do stop at your old hunting grounds before you depart. I believe you would find something interesting there." He added, his expressionless lips bending very slightly into a small smile.
<br><br>
Sendariu did not know what to do. This may be a trap, set to test her willingness to obey. Then again, it may be a man that understands her plight. After several moments of consideration, she decided that she could try it at least. Death would be better than living another moment in this damnable cave. She nodded. "I shall do as you say, wise one." She said with a deep bow that is expected of all when addressing the diviners.
<br><br>
The Tier'Dal in crimson simply smiled and spoke three soft words, then vanished. Sendariu felt a hint of fear as he left her, thinking it is more and more likely that this is a trap now. She closed her eyes and headed for the outer gates. No one cared to stop her or even question where she was going or why.
<br><br>
Sendariu arrived, finally, at her old hunting grounds. Immediately she noticed, as she did before, that something was not right. Just alike before, there was no sound of battle, nothing. There was, however a curious chanting. Spell chants, she realized. Her heart beat painfully and adrenaline ran through her body. It was a trap, she thought at first. Soon, however, she realized the chanting had ceased and all was quiet. After several very long moments of this silence, she decided she might as well head foreward and discover how this trap was laid out and if they'd planned a quick death for her.
<br><br>
Deciding that silence didn't matter any more, Sendariu continued foreward to the clearing carelessly and stopped in her tracks when she saw who stood on the log. There was no band of scowling mages, no troup of undead waiting to slay her, no fearsome member of the Indigo Brotherhood. There were two creatures that surprised her more than Innoruuk himself would were he standing there. The half elven paladin who had given her that original blessing and a high elven caster of some sort or another wearing a crimson robe and holding the exact staff she had seen the diviner carrying.
<br><br>
It was all she could do to stand there, blinking in disbelief and trying to regain her wits. The half elf mumbled something to his companion and the high elf stood, smiled, and began towards Sendariu. He stopped a short distance from her and spoke in rather soft tones, "Well, good evening my girl. I see you made it here well enough, and yes, as to your question, I am the diviner that spoke with you within your cities confines. My name is Neraful." Leaning a bit closer and speaking in soft tones, he added, "Or as lesser wits tend to call me, Netherfool. Do not puzzle on it, it truly makes no sense in the least." And withdrew with a bit of a smirk on his face.
<br><br>
Then the paladin was beside him and he seemed to fall strangely silent, the smirk still remaining on his face however. Sendariu's spirit already fealt lighter from the calm jesting between the two. "And I believe we need no introduction, aside from my name." The half elf said, smiling warmly. "Kalvaen Spiritblade." He finished, bowing his head slightly in introduction.
<br><br>
Sendariu was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Here were two very good aligned fellows conversing with a dark elven necromancer such as herself. Truthfully, she had hoped to see the half elf, Kalvaen, again. She had dreamed of his eyes, those that she gazed into right at this moment, almost every evening since the incident months past. She still could not make out what they had come to her for.
<br><br>
"Tell me…" Sendariu began, "what is it you have come for? I…I do not believe I can help either of you…" she said with a slight frown, suddenly, at the mention of it, desiring to be of some sort of help, some use to either of these two.
<br><br>
Kalvaen chuckled to himself and shook his head vigorously. "No, no. We do not come seeking your help, but your ears. No! No I do not mean that literally!" he said when Sendariu took a step back, her hands already raising to be ready to defend her ears. "No, we come seeking to inform you that there is an opportunity for you to leave this place, once and forever. You may practice your arts elseware and order what spells you need from courriers that ask no questions. Thus you may continue your studies, masterless of course, and under one condition. That condition being you use no live subjects, other than those allied with the dark, in researches of spell effects. All that is light would welcome you with open arms, you see how Mithaniel's blessing took spleanded effect…Ah, well, never mind that. I simply propose this alternative."
<br><br>
Sendariu looked from the paladin to the caster uncertainly. This thought had crossed her mind before. What would it be like to walk the light lands, to speak with humans and elves and dwarves, to walk the beautious lands of the Faydarks shes heard so much of. "But…how? I will be seen immediately as a Tier'Dal…and slain." She said, frowning and looking down a bit.
<br><br>
"Ah yes!" Neraful said hastily "Yes yes, we've brought just the thing for that sort of event!" He motioned to Kalvaen and the paladin removed from the sack he bore on his back very fine robes of the whitest hue. So white they seemed to take on a sort of glow in this gloom forest.<br><br>

"Yes, wear these and none shall mistake you for a child of evil." Kalvaen said, "They've been blessed, by a personal friend of mine who happens to be a priestess of Marr, with spells of holy refuge from lesser forces of darkness. A passing man would see nothing but a beauty in holy robes. You should be safe for the time being in the Commonlands. This is your decision. You may come with us, or you may stay here."<br><br>

Sendariu gazed longingly at the radient white robes, folded neatly in Kalvaen's hands. "What…what if I chose to accept?" she said, wringing her hands together nervously, never really thinking she'd be offered the chance to leave her homeland.<br><br>

"Well, then you would travel with us. You'd raise in power soon enough and would be finding the creatures we battle rather simple to deal with. You would also be easily remembered as a good person in the hearts of many with the good deeds we three shall be doing." Kalvaen said, offering the robes out to her.<br><br>

Sendariu bit her lip gently, closed her eyes, nodded a bit, and reached to take the robes into her own hands. The cloth was indeed fine and fealt incredibally light in her hands. She ran her fingers lovingly over the soft folds and smiled happily, a sort of inner fulfillment overtaking her.</p>
<p align=center>And thus it was that Sendariu donned the white robes. The three walked<br>
unhindered through the dark forest and into the commonlands where her<br>
first steps into the light were taken. Surely a kind god somewhere, not<br>
														revealing himself at the current moment, smiles.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p align=left>Notice: this story was indeed brief.  There are many things that are left out that tell much more the story of how Sendariu came to feel a strong need to leave her homeland.  Those shall most likely be doccumented at a later date.  Or, feel free to ask Sendariu about it any time you please.  I'm not sure how willing she'd be to talk about such things, but it would be worth a try.</p>
