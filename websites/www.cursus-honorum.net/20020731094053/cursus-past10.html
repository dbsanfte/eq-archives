<p><b>Maiden Platicia Alderelm held captive!</b></p>
<p align=left>While engaged in the siege of Castle Mistmoore, Rohwin Ardour received this letter from a young and weary Fier'Dal messenger...<br>
<br>
<br>
Tunare's greetings and blessings are sent to you, Regent Rohwin Ardour, from your most humble and faithful servant Tanulias, whose watchful eyes mind the woods about Kelethin and whose heart belongs to the good folk of Cursus Honorum. May all of Norrath receive the bounty of your gracious endevours.<br>
<br>
This messenger bears to you strange and disturbing news from the fields of battle. A soldier of Kelethin, returning from a bloody fray about the entrance to the Orcen stronghold known as Crushbone, mentioned to me (as I bound his many wounds) that he had seen a young Fier'Dal girl sneak through the front lines into the interior of that evil place. I became worried for her life, and therefore pressed him to recall her identity, but alas, he could not. I felt dread for this matter, and so, checked with the town's guard to see if perchance a child had been declared missing. The name was already upon their lips before I had finished - the name of the child was Platicia Alderelm. As you well know, she is the daughter of that great Elvish General Milutec Alderelm of Kelethin. She aparently wandered from the village the previous night, with notions of spying on the enemy. The General is presently in grief behind his guild's doors, sickened with the thoughts of his daughter's mistreatment. I must respectfully beg your assistance in this matter. I ask this of you, in part, to help the great leader who paid service to the mighty Artillian during the war, but also, as a personal favour for my own faithful service these many years. Should she be lost forever, I and all my people will be heavy of heart. I shudder to think what destruction of morale should occur if we cannot retrieve her safely from that place.<br>
<br>
I shall endeavor to gather as much information as I can before you arrive. Hopefully, I can be of some help to you and your brave companions. Until then, may Tunare's canopy forever stretch above you in safety.<br>
<br>
Your faithful servant,<br>
<br>
Tanulias<br>
<br>

Rohwin was very distraught from hearing this grim news. He decided that the girl must be rescued, but he was too involved in the siege of Mistmoore to leave for any period of time. The responsibility of Platicia's retrieval must fall on the shoulders of some of his most trusted and capable friends.</p>
<p>OOC details</p>
<p align=left>This raid and rescue operation is meant for our lower ranks. Anyone of level 22 or below is welcome to participate. Those of 23 or above may attend, but will be restricted in their participation. The higher level people must remain near the zone and only provide buffs, healing, and train derailing. It will be the responsibility of the lower ranks to find and rescue the girl. Friends of the appropriate level are welcome to attend as well. The raid is scheduled to begin at 1:00pm PDT on Sunday, October 14th. Due to the special preparations of this event please check with Rohwin or listen for announcements before begining the raid.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>Two brave volunteers ventured behind enemy lines to locate the daughter of General Alderelm. They were unknown to Cursus Honorum, but they came highly recomended from some of our nobles. They were Kiladine, a Fier'Dal druid and Lladarie, a ranger and also Fier'Dal. Since none of our own fighters could be spared from the siege of mistmoore I accepted the advice of my comerades and briefed the two young Fier'Dal volunteers. They slipped past the front lines into crushbone with little more then their wits and Erollisi's blessings. They avoided many patrols but were forced to fight Clan Crushbone on numerous occasions. Eventually they located Platicia chained in a secret room behind the throne in Castle Crushbone. Her chains proved very strong, but they were sucessful in picking the lock that held her captive. Once Platica was freed they made their way back through the castle and onto the surrounding grounds. The Orcs quickly discovered Platicia's absencse and sent several search parties after her. Our brave rescuers were set upon by many charging Orcs, but they prevailed in combat and also kept Platicia safe from injury. Many more Orcs pursued them as they scrambled for the safety of Faydark. Even ambassador D'Vinn sought them out. While they traveled through the broad tunnel that would surely lead them to safety it was D'Vinn who found them and halted their escape. However, before he could cause them harm Earl Elyar Klennix stepped onto the scene and let loose his firey magic. D'Vinn was severely injured and was forced to retreat. It is unclear if his wounds were mortal or not, as no one could afford to chase after him. The priority was to bring back Platicia safely, and so they did.</p>
