<p align=left>Lladarie has been succesfully retrieved from the forest of Faydark, but not without incident...<br>
<br>
When we thought we were safe at the ranger station, we were ambushed by a powerful group of Teir'Dal. They forced us out into the dark forest and left many of us mortally wounded. Lucky for us Lady Splendor remained safe behind a tree When the Tier'Dal left, she was able to practice her arts and saved everyone in the party. However, Lladarie was no where to be found.<br>
<br>
We deduced that the attack was meant as a diversion so that Lladarie could be abducted. After careful examination of the evidence at hand, we concluded that her abductors were not from Neriak, but were agents of Castle Mistmoore. We hastened to pursue Lladarie and shortly there after found ourselves below the great castle walls.<br>
<br>
The already present siege was furious and Mistmoore's defenses were at full strength. Lady Splendor's champion, a sturdy Dwarf named Belwair, knew of a place where a small party such as ours could sneak past the front-lines. We exploited this advantage and we soon found ourselves on the way to the front gates of Mistmoore. Once inside their defenses we were set upon time after time by Teir'Dal and their undead creations. We were able to fight our way into the castle, due to the majority of their forces being commited to the front-lines, even so, we found little time to rest as we were continuously attacked by small patrols. We rampaged through the castle in search of Lladarie.<br>
<br>
After an extensive search we found her bound in a chamber below the jail. Her captor had fled shortly before our arrival, but would no doubt bring back a substantial force to contend with in a short time, so Elyar channeled his power to open a shimmering portal that our rescue party and Lladarie stepped through. In little longer then a mere moment, we found ourselves in the safety of Greater Faydark, a short distance from Felwithe. Everyone was releived to be out of that evil stronghold.</p>
