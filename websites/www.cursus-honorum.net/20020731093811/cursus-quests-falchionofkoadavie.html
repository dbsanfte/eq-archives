<p><b>Falchion of Koada'Vie</b></p>
<p align=left>The falchion is a Paladin only quest one hand slashing sword. The stats are 6 damage, 24 delay, magical, lore item, no-drop, and Paladin only. It is a decent weapon for Paladins in their late teens to mid-20's. It is good for developing your one hand slashing skill since it is fairly fast. It also has in interesting graphic; the blade gets wider as it goes away from the hilt, then comes to a point near the end. I recommend doing this quest at around level 20, perhaps a little earlier if you can get some help.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Quest details</P>
<P align=left>After turning in the Orc runner's pouch to General Jyleel in the Paladin guild in Felwithe, he may tell you about another quest. If he does not then you do not have enough faction to receive the quest. You can check your faction and skip the Orc runner quest by saying to General Jyleel "I wish to prove myself a faithful Paladin of the court." If you do not get the quest info then you need to increase your faction with the Clerics of Tunare. You need to be high-amiable. You can increase your faction by turning in illegible scrolls dropped off Orc Oracles to General Jyleel, or turning in bone chips 4 at a time to the Cleric guildmaster in the adjacent Cleric guild. It took me around 250 bone chips to go from apprehensive to amiable to complete this quest. Once your faction is high enough General Jyleel will tell you about the quest for the Falchion of Koada'Vie. He wants you to bring him D'Vinn's black heart, the head of the Prophet, and a supply crate from the Ocean of Tears.</P>
<P align=left>D'Vinn's Black Heart and the Prophet's head: D'Vinn and the Prophet are found in the tower of Castle Crushbone. D'vinn is a Dark Elf Rouge in his low 20's. He is very hard for his level. He is difficult to hit, but he never seems to miss when he is double hitting you for 30's and 40's. He is a slow spawn with place holders (usually an Orc Centurion.) It is common to have to hold the tower for a couple hours before you see him. The Prophet spawns right next to D'Vinn and is an even rarer spawn with place holders (usually an Orc Oracle.) He has Shamanic spells and is in his upper teens. There are 2 other spawn points in the tower. The common spawns include, Emperor Crush, Royal Guard, Orc Oracle and Orc Centurion. Once the room is broken you can usually fight them one at a time. D'Vinn is easily the toughest spawn in the tower. The others are not too difficult, Crush is in his high teens and sometimes drops the Dwarven Ringmail Tunic for the screaming mace quest. The tunic is also nice for lower level small races to wear. It should be noted that the Prophet can see invisible, so be careful scouting out the tower. Also, the Royal Guard can make himself invisible and backstabs when you are facing away from him. A full group of 20's should have no problems holding the tower as long as you have a good mix of characters. A full group of 18's may have some problems if they are wounded when D'Vinn pops. You want to be especially careful of Orcs that try to run away. They run down the stairs and through the throne room. If you chase them in the throne room you may get swamped if it isn't camped, or the runner may return with lots of friends. If you get in trouble and have to run to zone you can jump out the window as a short cut. You take some damage, but it should be less then running through the throne room with everyone backstabbing you. D'Vinn drops the heart most of the time and on rare occasion the dragoon dirk. Since the Dirk is so highly sought after, it is common to find a high level character camping the room solo. This is frustrating, but if you want the heart they usually let you loot it if you can get to the tower. The heart is no-drop so you have to loot it yourself. D'Vinn also drops a note written in Teir'Dal I believe. It is a clue to locating the supply crate. The Prophet should drop the Blue Orc Head every time.</P>
<P align=left>Supply Crate: If you can decipher D'Vinns note it tells you about a rendezvous in the Ocean of Tears near the Alluring Sirens. When you are sailing from Butcher Block to Freeport, there is a group of small islands just as you zone into the Ocean of Tears. There are Goblins and Alluring Sirens on many of the islands. Find the island with only 3 alluring sirens. Sometimes it also has a named Troll on the far side of the island. If you stay away from the Troll you shouldn't have any problems with him. The Sirens are the placeholders for an Ogre Warrior named Brawn and 2 Dark Elf Dragoons. Brawn is level 24 and easier to kill then D'Vinn. Brawn drops the no-drop supply crate every time. It will not fit in a container so make sure you have an inventory slot open. The Dragoons are low 20 Shadow Knights. They will harm touch you and cast fear on you. At 3 or 4 am game time all the spawns will disappear. At 5 am Brawn and his 2 friends will appear for only one game hour. You will need to be fast and tough if you are to kill them all. There is a better way to kill Brawn. If you kill the Sirens at night time, then either Brawn or the Dragoons will spawn in their place until early morning when they all disappear, then all 3 appear for one game hour. Brawn's spawn point is the siren that is at the highest elevation. Kill this siren at night and you will get a Brawn all by himself. 3 20's can probably take down a single Brawn, but if his Dragoons are present then a full group of 20's will have some difficulty. If you are not sure which Siren is Brawn's place holder, then you can wait on a nearby island and see where he spawns at 5am. The worst part about this quest is when you have the supply crate and want to leave you need to wait for the boat to come. It will sail between some of the islands. You can swim out in front of it and it will pick you up when it runs over you.</P>
<P align=left>Now that you have D'Vinn's heart, the Prophet's head, the supply crate, and enough faction, you can turn in the items to General Jyleel and receive the Falchion of Koada'Vie.</p>
