<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>My recollections of my childhood in Felwithe 
are like a bright globe shining with warmth and 
love.  My father left to fight with Artillian 
Vincere when I was very young, so my memories of 
him are few.  But the infrequent letters that we 
received from him spoke of his love for my 
mother, for his two children and for his beloved 
country, Faydwer.  We read between the lines of 
his recounts of the fierce battles and saw the 
courage, honor and loyalty that shone there.<br>
<br>
My mother scratched out a meager living, 
making her children rich with her love, if not 
with material things.  My older brother was the 
light of my life; my hero, my joy, my protector.  
Even though there was seven years difference in 
our ages, he let me tag along at his side in all 
that he did.  My memories of those golden days in 
Felwithe with him will forever fill my thoughts.<br>
<br>
One day the letters from my father stopped 
coming.  We heard after several agonizing weeks 
that he had been killed at Crushbone.  My brother 
swore his vengeance on the Orcs and though he was 
only 16, vowed to join the fight.  My mother 
begged him not to go, but I knew what he had to 
do.  Early one morning, he awakened me to tell me 
goodbye.  As he hugged me close, I wondered if I 
would ever see him again.<br>
<br>
After he left, the days crept by painful and 
lonely.  His letters reached us late or not at 
all.  My mother’s health worsened and she was 
overcome with the fever that racked our village 
that winter.  Without kin or money, a kind 
neighbor family took me in.<br>
<br>
Feeling completely alone in this world, my 
one burning desire is to find my brother.  It has 
been two years since I received his last letter.  
It said that he thought he would be sent to 
Kunark to scout the country in preparation for an 
invasion against the Iksarks.  Although I am 
young, I want only to find him or his resting 
place.  I am setting off in search of him.  May 
Tunare bless my quest.</p>
