<p><b>The ailment of Daurkean's mother</b></p>
<p align=left>Scout Daurkean has written a letter addressed to Cursus Honorum. A copy of which is scribed below...</p>
<br>
<p align=left>I have recently learned that my mother, whom I owe my dear life to, has fallen ill. I know I have not spoke of her lately, I do not speak of either of my parents enough, but they are my parents and I love them dearly. She is sick and in need of great healings. She told me what she could remember. This is all I know of her ailment.....<br>
<br>
Telair (mother) and Clien (father) were on a brisk walk through the forests of Butcher Block. My father had told my mother, "Telair, I will meet you at home dear," then my father went to buy a gift for mother. On the way home, in my mother's old age, she had taken a wrong turn and crossed into Dagnor's Cauldron. She cannot see very well, but she is a stubborn woman, so she was confident that she could find her way home. She became lost and wandered further until she came across the Estate of Unrest. She was met somewhere in Unrest by a lady figure with a scraggly voice and was offered some drink for she was thirsty from walking so far. It was not water, it was a poison mixture. Unfortuanely, I am not sure what poison she drank, all I know is she was found by a young Elven Druid by the name of Kiladine. I am not certain about the name because my mother cannot speak well.<br>
<br>
I am currently in Kelethin, by my mother's side. She is fading fast, so if anyone knows of a potion or a cure for my mother please inform me as soon as possible. My thoughts on the lady who gave my mother the poison would be a hag, or something of the sort. I do not wish to leave my mother, but I fear that I must travel to Unrest to seek my answers. Any news of the cure will be greatly appreciated. With your help I may get my mother well agian.<br> 
<br>
I thank you for all the help I may receive and apologize if I am not my usual smiling, happy self. All my concentration is on my dear mother.<br>
