<p><b><u>Quests and Events</u></b></p>
			<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p align=left>The Quests and Events are divided into five sections. First is upcoming events. These may be scheduled raids, roleplaying events, or guild wars. Second, is <a href="cursus-pastevents.html">past events</a>. These are the archived results of any guild event. Third, is <a href="cursus-recenthistory.html">recent history</a> of Cursus Honorum. When roleplaying events add to our story line, then they will be recorded here. Forth, is <a href="cursus-quests.html">quest</a> information. When you have accomplished a quest within the game, if you wish, you may write an article describing how your guild mates might follow in your footsteps. It is nice to have quest information on our own web-site because we know that information from our guildmates is acurate. If we depend on each other then we will not need to visit sites like everlore for their highly questionable information. Lastly, are <a href="cursus-stories.html">stories</a> writen by our members. These stories are the histories of our various members and the true or fictional accounts of our experiences in Norrath. Upcoming events will be displayed on this page. However, the other four sections will have seperate pages to divide the bulk of information.</p>

<p><b>Upcoming Events</b></p>
<p align=left>Here are the guild events that are in the near future. Events will include, raids, roleplaying events, guild wars, and similar guild activities. For any guild event to be offical, it must be recorded here. Impromtu events will not earn players political points, save points for personal valor if it is reported and witnessed. Once an event has passed, then it will be moved to the past events page along with its results.</p>

<p><b>The search for our young volunteers</b></p>
<p align=left>When General Alderelm learned of his daughter's rescue he was overcome with joy. He thanked our efforts with enthusiasm and provided rewards for our young volunteers. He also saw fit to strengthen his alliance with Cursus Honorum. He has deployed a significant number of troops to relieve our forces at Castle Mistmoore. He has even volunteered to oversee the siege there for the time being. With his support I was able to offer rest to our fatigued troops, and I too have been relieved of duty for awhile. I will take this opportunity to attend to other matters of importance.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that while Platicia ventured foolishly and ill-prepared, she did gather important information as she intended, although its relevance is unbeknownst to her. Since her escape, the Orcs have been trying ever harder to recapture her. All their attempts at kidnapping have been thwarted. The cost of their efforts have out-weighed any ransom that they had hoped to gain nor has their efforts been consistant with the value and satisfaction of revenge. She must have seen or heard something that is of extreme importance. We have questioned her several times but have discovered nothing. Platicia has been shipped to a safer place, a place kept secret from everyone but her father. Our latest intelligence says that Tier'Dal operatives are now seeking out the ones who rescued her. It is believed that they may know something of great value, although its importance may not be recognized immeadiately. We too are seeking out the recuers, but since their mission was completed they have slipped away into obscurity. They must be found before the Tier'Dal get to them.</p>
