<p align=left>Even in our most recent history great wars have been fought. Twas not so long ago that Norrath stood on the brink of annihilation. Sadly however, mankind chooses to forget its past once again, and we witness our now familiar cycle. This most recent conflict should stand out from others of time past, but we are saddened because at the time of this writing Norrath's youth has already clumped this horrific war with all the others of the past few centuries. Shortly after the abduction of Princess Thex of Felwithe the evil of Norrath challenged all good people. Evil races such as Orcs, Gnolls, and Goblins began to organize themselves and made coordinated attacks against the great cities. These attacks were much more then raids of times past, they were stronger, better equipped, casted more powerful magic. It wasn't their new strengths that upset the balance of power, it was their timing. All the great cities were attacked in near unison. To the west Gnolls surrounded Qeynos, to the north Goblins laid siege to Halas, to the east Orcs scaled Freeport's walls. Goblins marched through the streets of Rivervale. Even those in Faydwer were not spared. Orcs drove deep into the Elven lands in Faydark. The Dwarves fortified themselves against Goblins. Even the curious Gnomes were attacked by Minotaurs and Kobolds. No boats traveled from Odus, we could only assume the Erudites had isolated themselves there. Every race sent runners to ask for help from neighboring allies, only to discover that all of Norrath was under attack. Fearsome undead rose from the ground and joined the fight. Many people blamed the Tier'Dal or the Iksar for what was happening. Rumors flew like dead leaves in autumn; many of the rumors said that the Tier'dal and Iksar, as well as the Ogres and Trolls were also under siege. No one knew for sure what was happening in the other cities, because everyone was trapped behind their own walls, and very few messengers ever reached their destinations. Counter-attacks were largely unsuccessful, due to the overwhelming fear of the situation and the conflicting strategies of how best to oppose the enemies.</P><br>

<p align=left>When the world was at its bleakest, one man made all the difference. A little known Human from Qeynos unified the people. He was a powerfully built warrior. His previous achievements were only known among small circles. He knew what must be done to defeat the Gnolls and break the siege, and in the chaos of Qeynos he spoke his mind and people listened. The Generals attempted to dismiss him as another fool with ill-conceived plans. He was not dissuaded, he had the people's ear and he continued to speak out. Soon many of the civilians took up arms and followed him, even the city guard listened to him and many of those followed as well. His first encounters with the Gnolls were small, but he was victorious. His reputation grew and more people followed him. He did what no one else could, he unified the people and set them to a common goal. He crushed the Gnolls battle after battle. Antonious Bayle appointed him as an honorary General of their army. Many of the city's guard protested but it was far too late, he had won the hearts of the people. He led his charges from the front and crushed the Gnolls by increasing margins of victory. His name was on the lips of everyone in Qeynos. He was a brilliant tactician, an impressive warrior, and a true leader. He was hailed by all as the Hero of Qeynos. His name was Artillian Vincere.</p><br>

<p align=left>After Artillian had defeated the Gnolls at Qeynos he rallied his army to march north. He found Halas under bitter siege by Goblins. He wasted no time and attacked their flank. The Goblins were unprepared for the might and determination of Artillian's army and were forced to withdraw into the frozen mountains. The Northmen were very grateful for his help, and many of them joined Artillian's army and marched east to vanquish whatever evil they could find. He liberated Rivervale, and again his army grew in size from Halfling recruits. They marched to Freeport and devastated the Deathfist Clan Orcs. It would seem that Artillian's army was unstoppable. With every victory his army grew more powerful. He not only won the hearts of Qeynos, but of all of Antonica. By this time Erudite ships began sailing into the ports of Qeynos. Their sailors told stories about war among Erudites. Many Erudites have taken the path of evil and launched assaults from their city of Paineel against the exquisite city of Erudin. The sailors said packs of kobolds rampaged across the countryside, and masses of undead creatures were at the command of evil Erudites. The Citizens of Erudin eventually forced the evil to withdraw for the time being, but for the first time in one thousand years the Erudites were seeking allies to keep evil forces out of their home. The fate of the Tier'Dal and other dark races were unknown. It was still proposed that they were somehow responsible. Artillian decided to construct a massive fleet and sail to Faydwer. Everyone believed that the Dwarves and Elves were in as much trouble as Antonica, and if there were more fighting to be done then Artillian would need as many allies as possible. Across the Ocean of Tears he sailed. Storms rocked his fleet but they braved the fierce weather and eventually landed on the shores of Faydwer. They found the rumors of Goblins and Orcs to be true. They freed the Dwarves of Kaladim and pushed back the Orcs in Faydark. The gnomes had built fantastic war machines to lift the siege of Ak'Anon. By the time Artillian had reached the Gnomes, they had nearly broken free from the Minotaurs and Kobolds themselves. Artillian's trail of destruction across Norrath was massive. The scars in the land would remain for decades. However, the world did not complain, Artillian had freed all the good people of Norrath from certain destruction.

<p align=left>After Artillian had taken power from its rightful owners, namely the Kings and other important leaders of our beloved cities, he continuously wielded his new found power without regard for the wishes of the people. He refused to march to Neriak or to make plans to land on Kunark. Everyone knew that the Tier'Dal were behind the recent attacks. It has always been their tactics to encourage others to do their dirty work. When he assisted Freeport in turning back the Orc hordes he should have made immediate preparations to march on Neriak. Instead he wasted far too much time building a fleet to sail to Faydwer, at the peoples expense mind you. Many people who helped build his ships were under the incorrect impression that he intended to sail to Kunark. Sailing to the Iksars was a valid option if somehow the Tier'Dal were found to be not responsible. While his massive fleet was being constructed he had plenty of opportunity to travel to Neriak and see for himself what their position was. If the Tier'Dal were not under attack then it would be proof that they had some kind of alliance with the evil powers of the land, if not in control of them. If they were under attack then he should have observed to fighting and then attacked who ever remained afterwards. Once Neriak had been dealt with then he could have taken his expensive fleet to Kunark and crushed the Iksars as well. However, during his several months in Freeport he was seen carousing in various taverns and consistently avoiding blame for any havoc he caused among the local populous. Now it is clear that the Tier'Dal and Iksar have had time to cover their tracks and prepare more defenses. He eventually sailed to Faydwer and the arrogant and aggressive Artillian attempted to take credit for the victories over the Orcs. The Elves in Faydark have been at war with the green Orcs for longer then our history records. The recent attacks in Faydwer were nothing unusual and merely coincidental that they happened at the same time as Freeport's attacks. The Elves have routinely turned back their aggressors time and time again. His assistance was far too late to be instrumental in Faydark's defense. In fact, he proclaimed himself savior of all of Norrath, when he did not ever assist the Gnomes in Ak'Anon. Nor did he ever set foot on Odus, where the Erudites were having a civil war of their own concern anyways.</p><br>

<p align=left>Artillian knew that the fighting was not yet over. He organized garrisons in every city and prepared his army to march into the enemies' territories. Much of his army was tired from so much fighting and wished to go home, but many decided to remain with Artillian. Also, there was no shortage of new volunteers from all the cities he rescued. Kings honored him with awards and supplied his army with the elements necessary to go to war. The people hailed him as Norrath's greatest warrior. He led several campaigns against the homes of the evil beasts that had threatened all of Norrath only a few years before. His victories became more difficult and costly, but he still returned with stories of conquest. In time, he became more powerful then any of the kings of the great cities. People regarded him as a leader above kings. Kings would adopt any policy he supported or risk losing the loyalty of their own people. Artillian became so powerful that even King Thex of Felwithe once knelt before him.</p><br>

<p align=left>Artillian Vincere remained focused on the destruction of evil throughout his rein. He spent most of his time far from civilization conducting his campaigns against the evil beings of Norrath. He suffered his first bitter defeat while trying to subdue the Crushbone Orcs in Faydwer. An army of undead came to the Orc's rescue and forced Artillian to withdraw while suffering heavy casualties. Artillian's subsequent attacks resulted in stand-offs or very minor victories. Evil was on the rise again in other parts of the world and he left a garrison in Faydwer to keep the Orcs in check so he could fight on different front lines. He could see that the evil was growing ever stronger. He managed to keep them contained in their own lands, but he could not continue this effort continuously. He learned many things very important to the survival of mankind. The different factions of evil did not cooperate with each other freely. There was a greater force at work. Artillian dedicated himself to learning the secrets of who was responsible for this surge of evil power. Artillian knew that evil would soon stand at the gates of the great cities again. He searched desperately for a solution that could end this war for good.</p><br>

<p align=left>Artillian proved his military prowess throughout his campaign, however, his repetative political failures inhibited his ultimate culmination into the savior figure of Norrath. The oblivious commander continued his warfare unconcerned of the impeding alliance dissolution. As long as finances and baggage trains continued to flow from his openly disgruntled liegemen, Artillian paid their discretions little heed. A comsuming desire kept the warrior far from the lands of his hollow compatriots- his desire to acquire ancient weapons of immeasurable power. No labyrinth or pernicious dungeon could retain its inigmatic artifacts from the determined general. This all encompassing quest eventually led to the dismantling of his political empire. The decomposing alliance began to distribute propaganda to sway his political powerbase, namely the lower class masses. Distracted by his crazed search, Artillian ignored the subversive material. The propaganda preyed upon the fears of the masses. It consistantly desribed the war as a distant nuisance claiming excessive amounts of energy and finances. Although many of the loyalists to Artillian spoke in defense of his demands, the overwhelming rumor mill swayed the public towards the desires of the petty warlords of various cities. The complete break down of the empire Artillian had constructed came soon after the general announced the mastermind behind the evil army. He said dragons controlled the influx of evil as pawns towards their unknown final intentions. Artillian was convinced that his powerbase would hold together long enough for a final coup de grace against the dragons. Artillian was soon after lost in one of his artifact retrieval quests. Numerous search parties sought after him and his party but to no avail. Artillian was pronounced dead and the empire he had so meticulously created was destroyed. The execution of Artillian's final testiment presented his would-be successors with a startling realization. Rohwin Ardour was named successor in the will, a landless battlefield Paladin from Freeport. What the general lacked in social graces was made up in his consistancy. His choice obviously reflected his desire to uphold the tactical war he had so efficiently managed. Rohwin Ardour, unknown to those that were supposed to swear fealty, inherited a hollow empire with nothing more than the principles on which it was founded, and enemies all around.</p>

<p align=left>I think no one was more surprised then I when the contents of Artillian's will were read aloud. There were instant murmurs throughout the room, none of which I heard were of a positive nature. I sat still with a blank stare trying to comprehend what I have just heard. I was to inherit Artillian's empire, or what was left of it. Some people began to shout protests openly against me. It was the executor who interrupted them and continued to read the will. Artillian listed his reasons for choosing me. He said I was the most qualified of his most loyal subjects to continue the fight in his name. I have been a member of Artillian's honor guard for quite sometime and have fought shoulder to shoulder with him on a number of occasions. There were many others who outranked me but it was Artillian's decision to choose who would best serve his cause and the good of Norrath. Many people spoke out against me again, declaring me unfit for such responsibility. The loudest of them was Duke Dentrius Waltan. He was largely expected to be Artillian's successor. Artillian had told me earlier that Dentrius's focus was cloudy, he had his own ambitions that did not coincide with the greater good of Norrath. I had no idea at the time that he would choose me over him, or any other of the higher lords for that matter. I needed to show them that I was not weak. I stood and addressed my adversaries. "Our Lord Artillian has chosen me to lead the war against evil. His reasoning is true and his cause just. I accept the duties he has bestowed upon me. I will not however declare myself King, Emperor, or Warlord. I will instead act as Regent during our Lord's absence. There is no evidence that our Lord Artillian is dead, despite the reading of his will. If we should find him or should he return on his own then I will return his throne to him. I ask you, who owe your own power and title to Artillian himself, would you do the same as I intend?" The outrage was more than I expected. Many lords needed to be constrained by their comrades. Duke Waltan asked if I called him a traitor. I replied, "Nay good Duke, I only ask that everyone loyal to Artillian look at the evidence that is clear before us and ask themselves, who do we serve? Is it Artillian? Or the good of Norrath? And who here will serve those ends faithfully?" Many people nodded at my comments and some even hailed me as their new leader. On that note the Duke stormed out, and many people followed him. I hope I did the right thing today.</p><br>

<p align=left>Today I spoke with all that remain loyal to me. There are only a few left, but I believe that all those who remain are truly loyal, and I believe that we can rebuild Artillian's power and prevail over evil. Over the past fortnight I have realized how many enemies I have acquired. I have avoided many deadly "accidents." Four days ago I was even assaulted by a rogue who jumped at me and my friend Gerdall from a dark alley. My companion and I had a difficult time striking back at the rogue, but eventually we slew him. I did not suffer a scratch, but my companion had a minor cut across his side. Among the Rogue's belongings we found a bottle of brandy with commander Cane's private label on it. Things are going so poorly, with so many different enemies at home and abroad. The majority of my armies have fled to either save themselves or join the banner of someone else. At least those who remain have said they will hold out as long as they can and urged me to finish Artillian's quests with godspeed. Two days ago Gerdall was bed ridden with fever. It would seem that Cane had employed assassins with poison to try to dispatch me. His condition worsened despite our best efforts. This morning he died. Gerdall will be sorely missed. The lessons of survival are hard learned. I will not expose myself or others around me to such dangers again. My speech this evening went quite well however. I outlined what our duties to Artillian and Norrath would be. First, we must never give up hope of finding our lord Artillian. Until he is found or the proof of his death, we will continue to search for him. Second, we lack the strength to defeat the evil that grows around us, but we must keep them at bay for as long as possible. We must keep them off balance and disorganized. If we can raid their supplies, assassinate their leaders, and disrupt their alliances, then we can buy the time we need to save Norrath. Raids and sieges against their evil strongholds will be critical to our survival. Third, we must search for arcane power in the forms of arms, armor, tomes, scrolls, magic objects and artifacts. We will search for these items as Artillian did, in the deepest dungeons, among our enemies, and even on the most fearsome planes. These items of power will make the difference between victory or defeat. Forth and final, we must move against the Dragons of Norrath. They are who are responsible for commanding the evil forces. We must destroy them all if we are to survive this war. If we accomplish everything except the destruction of the Dragons then we will eventually be overcome. I can only pray to Erollisi that we can accomplish this daunting task in time to save Norrath.</p><br>
