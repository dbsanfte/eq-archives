<p><b>Basic Levels of Power</b></p>
<p align=left>The basic power structure of any guild in Everquest is the Guildmaster, then the officers, and then the members. I have tried to expand on this structure and create a guild based on the feudal system of medieval Europe. There are four basic power levels in Cursus Honorum. The guildmaster is the Regent. Below the Regent is the High council, which will consist of guild officers. Next is the House of Lords, who will have voting power. Lastly, everyone else in the guild will be the ranks. The ranks are further divided up into high, mid, and low levels. Anyone joining the guild regardless of his or her level will be an initiate. They will be on a probationary status for two levels in the guild. This is to ensure they spend at least one whole level as an initiate in the guild. </p>
<p align=left>The Regent rules over the guild and can make summary judgements within the game if necessary. The Regent will also appoint a Vice-Regent to act as second in command. When ever the Regent is off-line, then the Vice-Regent can act in every capacity of the Regent. Any important decisions made by the Vice-Regent should be mailed to the Regent so it may be posted on the web-site.</p>
<p align=left>Most decisions however will be made by a vote of the High Council. Things like making rule changes, expelling members from the guild, giving out grants to other members will be voted on by a majority vote of the High Council. All voting will be done via E-mail. On-line meetings and votes simply never work out. If a decision is needed on-line immediately then a summary decision may be made by the Regent or if the Regent is off-line, then the Vice-Regent. If neither the Regent or Vice-Regent is on-line then a vote by the High Council members present will decide. Any on-line decision made will be temporary until an E-mail vote can be made, unless the situation is completely resolved and no further voting is necessary. Regardless, anytime a vote is made, the Regent should be informed by E-mail so the situation and the results of the vote may be posted on the web-site.</p>
<p align=left> When a vote is called for an announcement will be made on the web-site and the voting members will be E-mailed. The High Council will have one week to reply. A deadline date will be included in the E-mail. Anyone who fails to reply before the deadline will automatically count as a neutral vote. In the event of a tie, the Regent will decide the outcome of a vote, but does not get to vote otherwise. The individual High Council votes will remain secret. The outcome of the vote will be posted on the web-site as a High-Council decision. Any rule changes or other important decisions will be E-mailed to everyone in the guild and posted on the web-site. However, changes to the rules will not take effect for at least a week, to give everyone time to become aware of them. The date and time the rules take effect will be posted using the Pacific Time zone. For those members overseas in Europe and Asia etc., sorry for basing the time off of Pacific Time zone, but a standard reference must be used.</p>
<p align=left>For issues of lesser importance, like which dungeon do we want to raid as a guild or when and where do we want to host a trade faire, then the House of Lords will vote. The High Council members are also members of the House of Lords and get to participate in any House of Lords vote. The same E-mail voting will apply to the House of Lords. In the event of a tie, then the Vice-Regent will decide the outcome.</p>
<p align=left>The Regent will decide how important an issue is and determine which group in the guild will vote on it. The Regent may also make judgements alone if the Regent feels it is appropriate. Declaring martial law and bypassing our voting rules will only be used in a dire emergancy. The function of these rules is to give the members of the guild real power in shaping how the guild functions.</p>
<p align=left>A decision by the Regent can be challenged. If two High Council members E-mail the Regent to challenge a decision then the Regent will send out E-mails to the High Council to vote. Then, what ever the High-Council decides will be done.</p>
<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p><b>Branches of Power</b></p>
<p align=left>Each character class in the guild has its own branch of power beneath the Regent. Each Branch of Power will have its own High-Council and House of Lords representatives. The mininum number of guild members to warrant an individual Branch of Power is four. Some classes will be initially grouped together and form a single branch of power. When enough members join the guild, these branches that have multiple classes may be able to splinter off and create new Branches of Power. The begining class groupings of the Branches of Power are as follows:</p>
<p>Paladin/Cleric<br>
<BR>
Druid/Shaman<BR>
<BR>
Ranger/Warrior/Monk/Bard<BR>
<BR>
Wizard/Enchanter/Magician<BR>
<BR>
Rogue<br>
<br>
Liaisons</p>
<p align=left>Anytime a single class of characters reaches four members they may create their own Branch of Power. The only stipulation is that at least four members must be remaining in the origanal Branch of Power to maintain it. Also, if members leave the guild it is possible for branches to collapse and the remaining members of a branch to be assimilated into other branches, possibly causing sudden power shifts.</p>
<p align=left>For any class or group of classes that does not have at least four members total, then they are assigned to the liaison branch. The liaison branch is the only branch of power that may have less then four members. For role-play, the liaison branch will represent liaisons to other parts of Norrath (like the Soldiers of Tunare or the Hall of Truth), until enough members join the guild to create a new branch.</p>
<p align=left>Each branch of power will have members promoted to the House of Lords and the High Council depending on how many members you have in your branch. For every four members in a single Branch of Power, one member will be promoted to the House of Lords. Also, one member from the House of Lords of each Branch of Power will be promoted to the High Council and given officer status. High-Council members are only listed on the web-site in the High-Council section, but they are also considered members of the House of Lords.</p>
<p align=left>To be promoted to the High-Council you must be a high ranking member (35+). If you are not high enough to be promoted then you will remain in the House of Lords, but you are still promoted to officer. (effective April 1, 2001)</p>
<p align=left>When a branch reaches eight or more members then the two highest members of the House of Lords will be given officer status and be valid vouchers. (effective April 1, 2001)</p>
<p align=left>With the approval of the Regent some people may become Viceroys. A Viceroy will be given officer status, but they do not have the powers of regular officers. They will not be valid vouchers for recruitment and they will not be listed on the web-site as officers. What they can do is issue invite commands to new members with the permission of a regular officer. The purpose of this position is to make it easier to recruit new members when our officers find themselves far from civilized Norrath. The Regent may appoint Viceroys as necessary or members may make requests for certain members to be appointed.</p>
<p align=left>Promotions are based on your political points and noble title. Your power and prestige within the guild is reflected by the titles you possess. The distinction should be made between your noble title and the name of your class rank. Your noble title is based on how many political points you possess. Some noble titles may depend on how many points you have as compared to other members in the guild. You class ranking is determined by your character class and your level. If you possess enough political points to be promoted to the House of Lords or High-Council, then you will be given a special class rank regardless of what level your character is.</p>
<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p><b>Class Names and Ranks</b></p>
<p align=left>Your class and level determine what the name of your rank in the guild is. Each class is separated into three groups determined by a range of levels. Levels 10 to 19 are the lowest group. 20 to 34 are the intermediate group, 35 to 60 are the high group. Whichever group your character fits into determines the name by which your class is referred to. Also, if you are a member of the House of Lords or the High Council, then you will have a special title to reflect your higher status. I tried not to repeat any names already existing in Everquest to minimize confusion, but some duplicates are inevitable. If you have any suggestions for names and titles feel free to mail them to me.</p>

<p align=left>Note: For the Warrior class, the High Council member will be the Colonel and the House of Lords will be Majors until the Warrior branch reaches 16 members. With 16 members there will be 4 people in the House of Lords. The highest one will sit on the High-Council and be referred to as the General. In the House of Lords the next highest Warrior will be the Colonel and the two remaining members will be Majors. At 20 or more members there will be one General, two Colonels, and the rest will be majors.</p>
<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p><b>Political Points</b></p>
<p align=left>Promotions to the House of Lords and the High Council are determined by your political points. Low ranking members and initiates may accumulate points, but their points will have no value until they reach mid level or finish their probation. There are many ways to score political points, explained below. Who ever has the most political points will be promoted to the House of Lords when a seat becomes available. And subsequently, the House of Lords member with the most political points will be further promoted to the High Council. Each Branch of Power will have a High-Council representative, even if there are only four members in the single branch.</p>
<p align=left>Members who are low or mid ranks may not gain more then ten points. Any points in excess of ten will be lost, but when high rank is achieved (35+) points will be gained normally again. (effective April 1, 2001)</p>
<p align=left>It is possible for someone to steal another player's seat on the House of Lords or High-Council if they score more points. If two people have the same number of political points then who ever is the higher level will be promoted. If they are the same level as well, then no one will be promoted until either someone gains more political points, reaches a higher level, a duel is fought, or someone declines to take power. The incumbent of the position in contention will retain the position until one of the prior criteria is met.</p>
<p align=left>Even though your seat of power may be taken over by another player, your officer status is permanent. You would lose some voting rights and maybe some title. Do not be disgruntled if someone out scores you and steals some of your power. It is meant to be fun, role-play it. Congratulate your guild-mate then scheme to steal your power back, hehe. Sometimes life in noble circles can be cut throat, but remember that it is only a game and should not be taken too seriously.</p>
<p align=left>Political Points are based on guild participation. The more you play and the more you do for the guild the more points you score. Here is a list of how to score Political Points.</p>
<table cellpadding=6 border=0 cellspacing=6>
<tr><td><b>1.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point - Recruiting a new member. Being an officer is not required to score points this way. New members are asked who is most responsible for their recruitment. The person they name is awarded the point, regardless of who actually issues the invite command.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>2.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point – for achieving mid rank level</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>2 points – for  achieving high rank level</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>4.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>2 points – for achieving level 51 or higher.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><br></td>
<td><p align=left>Note: When you join the guild and you are currently of mid rank or higher, you will get the political points for achieving your current rank but will not get any points for the ranks you achieved before you joined the guild. For example, a level 40 character joining the guild will get 2 points for achieving high rank level, but will not get the point for achieving mid rank level. Furthermore, a level 55 character joining the guild would get 2 points for being level 51 or higher but will not get any of the previous points for lower ranks. This is to reward players who have been in the guild for longer periods of time.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>5.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>2 points – being promoted to the House of Lords. These points are a one time event and are permanent. If you lose your seat on the House of Lords you still retain these points.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>6.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point – for holding a seat on the High Council. This is a one time only point. If you lose your seat on the High Council and regain it back later you do not get additional points, but you never lose this point either.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>7.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point – for participating in guild events. Helping the guild make raids on various dungeons or organizing a trade faire or other similar guild activities will earn you points. You will be granted various awards for campaigns and other guild activities and earn 1 point for each award. However, only offical guild events will be elidgable for points. Impromtu raids and such do not count as guild events. An event must be listed on the Quests and Events page so that every one has the knowledge of a raid beforehand, and has time to act on that knowledge if they wish. Maximum of 5 points may be awarded this way, but no limit on the awards themselves.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>8.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point – for personal valor. For exceptional bravery, performance, generosity or sacrifice you may receive awards for your efforts. Each award you receive earns one point. A maximum of 5 points may be earned this way, but there is no limit to the number of awards you receive. Personal Valor must be reported and witnessed to be rewarded. You may report your actions yourself or be your own witness, but not both. A description of the events that took place should be sent to the Regent either by E-mail or within the game. Once the witness has confirmed the actions the award will be presented. Neither the reporter or the witness need to be guild members.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>9.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point – for High Council grants. If the High Council feels someone needs to be rewarded, but their actions do not fall within the general guide-lines of scoring points, then they may vote to award the player additional points. A maximum of 5 misc. points may be awarded this way.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>10.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point - for being appointed to Rohwin's Vanguard. Rohwin's Vanguard are members of Rohwin's house. They are the most loyal subjects and hold the cause of Cursus Honorum dear. The founding members are all a part of Rohwin's Vanguard, but others may be added later.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>11.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point - for performing the duties of the Herald for a period of six months. This award can only be earned once.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>12.</b></td>
<td><p align=left>1 point - for earning the title of tradeskill apprentice, and an additional point for advancing to a tradeskill master. A maximum of 5 points may be earned through tradeskills.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p align=left>Points earned by recruiting other players may be transferred to other players in the guild or to an alternate character for yourself. Inform the Regent in the game or by E-mail of the points you wish to give away and who is going to receive them. Once the points are transferred they can not be taken back. Only the new owner of the points may choose to transfer the points.</p>
<p align=left>When you recruit a new member and receive recruitment points, they will hold no value until the new recruit completes his or her probation. The web-site will show how many points you have coming to you, and who you recruited, and at what level you will receive them. If the initiate leaves the guild before his or her probation is up then you lose the points. Also, before any initiate completes probation, the points that are in limbo may not be given away until the probation is completed and the initiate becomes a full member. If a member leaves the guild anytime after their probation, the points remain but the member is listed on a previous member list. If they are later recruited again into the guild then no recruitment points are awarded because the point for that character is already in circulation. If a member leaves the guild as an initiate and rejoins later, then the recruitment points work normally.</p>
<p align=left>If you have multiple characters, you may wish to join more then one into the guild. As long as all your characters meet all our recruitment standards, then they will be admitted. However, no political points will be awarded for alternate characters. I cannot allow people to admit multiple characters into the guild for the sake of earning points. It should be known to our fellow guild-mates who your alternate characters are. I feel it is important that everyone knows when different characters are controlled by the same person. It will lessen confusion, reduce the chances of surprises being ruined, and possibly keep someones feelings from being hurt. This rule only applies to alternate characters that are members of Cursus Honorum. If you have other characters that are not in the guild then you may keep their identity as secret as you wish. If you want all your alternate characters to be listed on the web-site, then I'll be happy to post them on your profile. It is possible for someone to keep an alternate character's true identity secret. I can only appeal to everyones honesty and sense of fair play that no one will attempt to decieve us. The web-site will list who has multiple characters on the individual member's pages.</p>
<p align=left>Points may also be earned through tradeskills. By performing services to our guildmates and earning their praise, additional titles and points may be earned. The rules for guild profesionals are currently on our <a href="http://www.cursus-honorum.net/forums/viewtopic.php?topic=197&forum=1&0">fourm</a>, but will be added here soon.</p> 
<p align=left>The Regent does not earn points the same way other members do. Since the position of Regent is not flexible the Regent only scores points for recruiting members. The Regent may distribute recruitment points to other guild members as personal grants.</p>
<p align=left>If a member leaves the guild all political points he or she possessed are lost. If they ever return to the guild they have to start fresh like any other initiate. They may give away their recruitment points before they leave, but if they don't, then any recruitment points they had will go to the Regent. If a member leaves under bad circumstances and wants to rejoin later, then a vote by the High Council will determine if he or she is allowed back in.</p>
<p align=left>Political Points will add noble titles to your name. Depending on how many points you have you will be awarded certain titles.</p>
<table align=center border=1>
	<tr align=center><td width=200>Points</td><td width=200>Title</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>0</td><td>No title</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>1-2</td><td>Lord/Lady</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>3-5</td><td>Baron/Baroness</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>6-10</td><td>Viscount/Viscountess</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>11-16</td><td>Earl/Countess</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>17-23</td><td>Marquis/Marquise</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>24+</td><td>Duke/Duchess</td></tr>
</table>
<p align=left>Furthermore, if you have a noble title of Viscount or higher, then which ever noble has the most political points will have a special title to signify that he or she is the highest ranking noble of that type. If one or more people are tied for the higher title then the same rules apply as for determining who is promoted to the House of Lords or High Council. Also, there are a maximum number of high nobles allowed in the guild. As the guild grows the maximum number of nobles will increase, but for now it is 3 Dukes, 5 Marquises, and 10 Earls. This does not include the husbands and wives of high nobles unless they have achieved high noble title by their own right. Viscounts and lower never have a maximum number. The superior titles for the high nobles are as follows.</p>
<table align=center border=1>
	<tr align=center><td width=200>Title</td><td>Superior Title</td></tr>
	<tr align=center><td>Viscount/Viscountess</td><td>Count/Countess</td></tr>
	<tr align=center><td>Earl/Countess</td><td>Grand Earl/Grand Countess</td></tr>
	<tr align=center><td>Marquis/Marquise</td><td>Marquis Palantine/Marquise Palantine</td></tr>
	<tr align=center><td>Duke/Duchess</td><td>Archduke/Archduchess</td></tr>
</table>
<p align=left>The second in command will be the High-Council member who has the highest noble title. He or she will gain the additional title of Vice-Regent. The Vice-Regent may act in every capacity of the Regent when the Regent is off-line. If two or more people share the same highest title then who ever has more political points will be appointed. If their political points are equal too, then the highest level character will be appointed. If the levels are equal then the position will be decided by the same methods as determining High-Council members.</p>
<p align=left>Your full name in the guild will be your noble title, then your name, then your rank. For example, a Ranger in the House of Lords and possessing high noble title might be "Earl Gallian Hurgyne, Warder of Cursus Honorum." Full names are not expected to be used within the game, except for maybe certain ceremonies. They are for role-play elements only, but feel free to use them as you like. Initiates will use the name of the low ranks for their class until their probation is up. Exceptions are for members joining at level 35 or higher. They will have the rank of Vassal until their probation is up. Another exception is for Paladins joining at mid levels. They may use Sir before their names and have the title of Knight-Errant during their probation. If a Paladin joins at level 35 or higher then they would be Vassals like other high level initiates. Furthermore, if a low ranking Paladin completes his or her testimony quest at the Hall of Truth in Freeport they would no longer be a squire and become a Knight-Errant until he or she reaches mid-level. Female Paladins that have completed their Testimony quest or are mid ranks or higher would use Dame (pronounced dahm) instead of Sir.</p>
<p align=left>If a guild member marries someone outside the guild then his or her consort will be noted on the web-site. If guild members get married within the guild then the marriage will be noted on the web-site and who ever has less noble title will be promoted to the title of their spouse. The promotion is in name only, no seats on the House of Lords will change do to a marriage. Your political power is still determined by your own political points.</p>
<p align=left>I will try to update the wed-site as often as possible. Gaining title or power will not be official until I update the web-site and E-mail the affected people. If title or power is changing hands rapidly, then I may delay the update until someone has gained clear possession of the title or power. Having an up to date web-site is critical for the role-play of Cursus Honorum to work. At a minimum I will update the site weekly, but there may be times when this is not possible. Like if I go on vacation or my computer catches on fire. Any time you gain level, accomplish a deed worthy of award, or need anything updated relating to your character, then please E-mail me so I can update the web-site. I will depend on your input to keep everything current. After all, we may both play all the time but never be on-line at the same time.</p>
<p align=left>A volunteer of the guild will be responsible for the duties of the "Herald." The details of this duty are listed on the <a href="http://www.cursus-honorum.net/forums/viewtopic.php?topic=194&forum=1&0">forum</a> currently, but will be posted here soon.</p>
<p align=left>Note: Whenever sending me screenshots or pics of yourself, please send them in a .jpg or .gif format. Everquest screenshots are saved as a .bmp, which are quite large and take too much time to send by E-mail and too much time to load when viewing the web-site.</p>
<p align=left>As you gain points and title your position in the guild will increase. However, your guild-mates are gaining points as well. You could be outscored by your friends and lose title and power. You might get bumped from the High Council or the House of Lords. You might lose your title as a Grand Earl and become a regular Earl, or even be reduced to a Viscount. You should role-play the effects. Have fun with your guild-mates. Loss of noble title does not effect you in any way other then role-play. You are still going to camp rare spawns, auction off equipment, look for decent groups and fight and die like before. The system is designed to give players something to shoot for beyond the original programming of the game. It is based on guild participation. Hopefully I have covered most of the possibilities that may arise. I hope everyone enjoys the system I have created and enjoys a good role-play based on it.</p>
