<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>Rohwin was born in Greater Faydark, but moved to Freeport with his Human father at a young age. He learned the ways of Erollisi at the temple of Marr, and dreamed of being a Sentry of Marr. When he was old enough he was accepted into Paladin training. Rohwin trained hard in the sword, but had many difficulties in the realm of magic. Rohwin eventually learned the arts of channeling and casting. His trainers were pleased with his progress, but Rohwin had conflicting views on the tactics and stratigies they taught him. When the Orcs attacked Freeport in the Great War Rohwin fought on the front line in defense of the city. He was appalled at the many defeats he suffered at the hands of the Orcs. It seemed that the battle for Freeport might be lost when Artillian arrived. Artillian surprised the Orcs and smashed their army in a number of pitch battles. The beaten Orcs withdrew and Freeport was liberated. Many citizens joined Artillian's army. Rohwin took this opportunity to leave the temple of Marr and join Artillian. Rohwin sailed with Artillian to Faydwer and fought to rescue Kaladim, Kelethin, and Felwithe. Rohwin's fighting skills were noticed by Artillian's commanders and Rohwin was promoted to higher ranks over the years of his service. Eventually Rohwin was made one of Artillian's honor guard. Rohwin fought by Artillian's side and was a member of his expeditions on a number of occasions. Rohwin was a respected member of Artillian's army and a capable commander. He never found riches in his journeys like many of the higher nobles; he was too dedicated to serving Artillian. Rohwin was still landless when he was named to inherit Artillian's empire in Artillian's will. Now Rohwin struggles to save Artillian's empire and to save Norrath from the evergrowing evil.</p>
