<p><b>Shield of the Watch</b></p>
<p align=left>First off, the stats: Shield of the Watch, 10 AC, 10 WIS, 9.5 pounds, Paladin only, No Drop, may be worn on the back or held in the left hand, and it looks like a round, yellow, newbie shield when held in the hand. I recommend this quest for Paladins in their mid-20's or higher. I'll start with information about the quest then give a spoiler at the end.<br>
<br>
The quest begins in Felwithe. If you go behind the secret wall in the Paladin guild you will find a Lieutenant Rosaed. Talk to him and he will tell you about the missing Princess Lenya Thex. He sends you to talk with Tolon Nurbyte at the travelers home in Felwithe.<br>
<br>To find Tolon you will need to ask the office manager where Tolon Nurbyte is. Then once you find Tolon ask him about the Princess and he will send you to Tynkale in the Paladin guild to do the Jojungha quest.<br>
<br>Talk with Tynkale about the veteran quest and he will send you to the Innothule Swamp to bring back the hide of Jojungha, apparently a very large kobold. Jojungha lives near the tower in Innothule Swamp where the undead spawn, a little ways left when you zone into the swamp from South Ro. He is very rare and has place holders. I hear he is most likely to spawn on top of the tower and he is in his low 20's, but I can't confirm this because I never got to slay him. If you do get the hide from Jojungha then return it to Tynkale and he will tell you what to say to Tolon Nurbyte, however, a friend told me the key words to say to Tolon. You can find the key words in the spolier at the bottom.<br>
<br>Tolon is a member of the Silent Watch, a secret organization working for King Thex. The Silent Watch does all the King's dirty work. When I talked to Tolon he still wouldn't give me the quest. I was already amiable but after another 200 bone chips to the cleric guild master he finally told me what to do. I am still amiable so it seems you need to be high-amiable with the Clerics of Tunare to do this quest. Tolon will send you to Highhold Keep to find Tearon Bleanix.<br>
<br>Tearon is a Paladin who was sent to rescue the Princess but never returned. When you go to High Hold Keep you can't find Tearon but you may hear him cast spells. He is in the royal suite on the third floor and of course the door is locked.<br>
<br>As luck would have it, Highhold Keep is having a lottery and the grand prize is the key to the royal suite. Talk to Treasurer Lynn about the Highpass lottery. She tells you that last years prize was never claimed and gives you the winning ticket number. The owner of the ticket is rumored to live in East Freeport.<br>
<br>Go to Hallards Resales and talk to him about orc picks. He says he'll give you 4 silver and a Highpass lottery ticket for every 4 picks you bring him. Every time you give him 4 orc picks you get a random number lottery ticket. Check the number and destroy any tickets that aren't the winning number. Rumor is that you will get some coin if you turn in the runner-up ticket as well (numbers are in the spoiler). It takes awhile to get the winning ticket, there is something like a 1 or 2 percent chance of getting it. Also, I could never hold more then 3 tickets at a time and sometimes I wouldn't get a ticket at all. I think because they are lore items and maybe I randomly got the same ticket twice. Hallard laughs at you when he gives you the ticket because its for last years lottery, and I typically don't get the 4 silver he promised me either.<br>
<br>Take the winning ticket to Treasurer Lynn in Highhold Keep and win the key to the royal suite (lore, no-drop.) Now you can open the locked door and talk with Tearon. He is now an undead Paladin. He failed in his quest to rescue the Princess and is cursed. He gives you his bracer (lore, no-drop) and tells you to talk to the Highhold hussy. He is referring to Mistress Anna on the 4th floor. Ask her about the Princess and she will tell you that she was kidnapped by Lady McCabe and Milton Shirtov has the key to her lock and that a Dark Elf Tyrana Sillith has the means to rescue the Princess from her magical binds. Mistress Anna says Tyrana won't talk to you and you will need to beat the information out of her. She also asks you to kill Milton, but they are just having a bad love affair and you don't need to kill him.<br>
<br>Zone into Highhold Pass and find Milton at the Roosters Inn. Instead of killing him try talking to him. In exchange for the key, he wants a silk evening tunic for Mistress Anna. The tunic can be bought in South Qeynos near the Lion's Mane Inn for about 5 plat. Give Milton the tunic and he'll give you a brass key (lore,no-drop).<br>
<br>Now find Tyrana, she is a 30 or 31 female, dark elf, necromancer. You'll need to kill her to get a fish food container and a note that has the whereabouts of the Princess. She is on the 4th floor of Highhold Keep behind a secret wall. She walks between 2 rooms on the 4th floor. One has a guard and one does not. It is best to fight her in the unguarded room so she is alone. She has no pet and isn't terribly difficult to kill, though a little hard to hit. Kill her and loot the no-drop container and note. The note explains what to do with the container but it is written in Teir'dal. Luckily, I happen to speak the language of the dark elves and it says that the Princess has been turned into a royal fish in Lake Rathe.<br>
<br>Make fish food in the container by combining 3 fairy dusts and 1 Sands of Ro and then give that to the royal fish to make Princess Lenya appear. Fairy dust can be bought from players or looted off dead fairies and Sands of Ro may also be purchased from players or looted off sand giants. Once you have the components for fish food, don't combine them until you find the royal fish. I understand that fish food is edible and you may accidently eat it if you combine it too early.<br>
<br>Go to Lake Rathe and prepare for a wait. There are about 4 fish spawns between the gnoll camp, the arena, and the aviak flame tower. I don't know if there are place holders for the royal fish but I killed everything in the water trying to induce royal fish spawning. After three hours I found the royal fish. Hail it to make it stop swimming and then combine the fish food and give it to the royal fish. *Very important* sometimes the fish swims onto the land and is trapped in a pathing bug. If the royal fish is out of the water when you give it the fish food the princess will suicide and you will need to start over to get another fish food container. I got burned by this bug and the GM's did nothing to help me. If everything is working properly the princess will appear in the water and beckon you to follow her. After a short swim she will get to an island where you can talk to her. She wants her key to be released and proof that you are from the Silent Watch. Give her the brass key and Tearon's bracer and she will proclaim you her hero and give you an amulet (lore, no-drop).<br>
<br>Now, all you need to do is go back to Highhold keep and give Tearon the amulet and the royal suite key and he will give you the Shield of the Watch. *Very important* the door to the suite only stays open for about 10 seconds, once you give Tearon the key you will have no way of opening the door again. You could become locked inside the room. Give him the key and amulet and get out fast. Enjoy the Shield :)<br>

<p align=left>Many parts of the quest can be skipped. I don't know if you'll still need high-amiable faction to finish the quest if you skip parts of it. It's much safer if you make sure your faction is good enough before you start. If Tolon Nurbyte gives you the quest then your faction should be fine.<br>
<br>
Step 1)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>Ask the manager at the Travellers Inn in Felwithe, &quot;Where is Tolon Nurbyte?&quot; This will make him spawn upstairs, last door on the right. When you find Tolon tell him, &quot;The glory of the mother shines bright.&quot; Then accept the mission from him and he will tell you to find Tearon Bleanix in Highhold Keep. He says to tell Tearon, &quot;All is not bright above the clouds.&quot; You can probably skip talking to Tolon but it is safer if you know you can complete the quest ok.<br>
<br>
step 2)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>You are going to need the lottery ticket so you might as well get one while you are in Freeport. Put all your armor and gear in the bank so you can carry as many orc picks as possible. At 10 pounds each you are going to be heavily encumbered. There is a gnome merchant in West Freeport that sells orc picks. He is outside the gates in the newbie hunting grounds under a tent. Buy as many picks as you can carry. Getting a SoW for this part really helps. Picks cost about 2 and 1/2 gold each. Lug them over to East Freeport and give them to Hallard at Hallard's Resales. He gives you a Highpass lottery ticket (lore). The winning number is 16568. The second place ticket is 15600. Destroy any other tickets. I got a winning ticket after about 25 platinum worth of orc picks, but I have heard others were not so lucky and had to spend a lot more. Once you have the winning ticket get your gear from the bank and go to Highhold Keep.<br>
<br>
Step 3)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>Give the winning ticket to Treasurer Lynn near the bank. She gives you the key to the Royal Suite. Go up to the 3rd floor and unlock the door to talk with Tearon. Tell him, &quot;All is not bright above the clouds.&quot; Tearon gives you his bracer (lore, no-drop).<br>
<br>
Step 4)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>Zone into Highhold Pass and find the Roosters Inn. Find Milton and give him a silk evening tunic. You will need to get a tunic in South Qeynos. If you find yourself there before doing the quest make sure you buy one ahead of time. There is a merchant near the Lion's Mane Inn that sells them for about 5 plat. Once you give Milton the tunic he gives you a brass key (lore, no-drop).<br>
<br>
Step 5)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>Go to the 4th floor of Highhold Keep. Behind a painting is a secret hallway. There are 2 secret areas on the 4th floor. If you don't find Tyrana then try the other secret area. Once you locate Tyrana and she is in the room without a guard then kill her fast. You take some faction hits with Highpass but nothing to be alarmed about. It is safe to kill her when she is alone but there is a guard who occasionally walks by, I don't know if he will help her if he sees you attacking her. Loot the fish food container (lore, no-drop). You will need 3 fairy dusts and 1 Sands of Ro to make fish food. You might try to acquire these items before you come to Highhold to save traveling time.<br>
<br>
Step 6)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>Go to Lake Rathe and look for &quot;a royal fish.&quot; I swam around hitting F8 continuously to try to locate the royal fish. I also killed everything in the water, hoping it would help the royal fish spawn and so they wouldn't interfere with targeting. Both times that I did this part of the quest I found the royal fish in about 3 hours, swimming near the arena, though I hear the royal fish spawns in other places too. Hail the royal fish to stop it and then combine and give the royal fish the fish food. Princess Lenya will appear and swim to an island. Follower her and when she makes it to land give her Tearon's bracer and the brass key and she will give you an amulet (lore, no-drop), then disappear. *Very important* if the royal fish is swimming out of the water and up the side of the mountain then it is on a pathing bug. I gave it the fish food once while it was on land and the Princess appeared then suicided. I had to redo a lot of the quest because of that. Make sure the royal fish is swimming in the water before hailing it and giving it fish food.<br>
<br>
Step 7)<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>Return to Highhold Keep and go to the 3rd floor and find Tearon again. Give him the royal suite key and the amulet from Princess Lenya and he will give you the Shield of the Watch. *Very Important* Once you give Tearon the royal suite key you won't be able to open the door any more. You may become locked inside the room. Give Tearon the key and amulet then get out fast.<br>
<br>
The hardest part about doing this quest killing Tyrana. I was level 29 and had a 29 mage and a 23 warrior with me and she dropped fast. The second time I killed her I was still 29 and had a 35 Paladin with me and we both had to Lay Hands to finish her, but she died right after we healed ourselves. The Sands of Ro aren't too hard to buy and they drop fairly often on Sand Giants. The lottery is time consuming but not difficult. The worst part is looking for the royal fish. You can't see very far under water, especially at night or rainy conditions. Plan on spending some time looking for the fish, at least you'll get your swimming skill up :) 10 wisdom is great and 10 ac is better then a bronze cloak. It is a little heavier then bronze but overall I think the quest is worth doing. I recommend it for Paladins in their mid-20's or higher. Sorry if I miss-spelled any of the key names.<br>
