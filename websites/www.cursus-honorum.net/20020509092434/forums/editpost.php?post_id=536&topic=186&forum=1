The High council has voted on new rules when applying to Cursus Honorum. In addition to the current rules, all applicants will be required to post a story to our forums. A new catagory has been created called "Application Stories." The function of posting to this forum will be to introduce yourself to the guild. It will provide a basis for our role-play interactions and will demonstrate your desire and ability to role-play. "Evil-type" (Trolls, Ogres, Iksar, Dark Elves, Shadow Knights, and Necromancers) characters that are applying will need to include how and/or why they have chosen to follow the ways of the light. Your stories need not be very long so long as they are detailed enough for us to understand your character, but you are welcome to write as much as you like. Spelling and grammar counts! There are no needs to use abbreviations or short-hand when posting to the forum. Type-o's and such are understandable (Erollisi knows I am guilty of such mistakes), but please proof read your posts before submitting them. Current members are not required to post an introductory story, but everyone is certainly welcome to.

"Evil" characters will still be voted on by the High-Council before being admitted into the guild, however, they will now have an additional requirement of performing a quest for the High-Council. The details of such a quest are at the discretion of the High-Council.

Furthermore, any "evil" characters that are admitted into the guild will be restricted to the liaison branch of power. It will be possible for "evil" characters to move to another branch of power later, provided that two requirements are met. One, that there are enough characters of the class in question to support a seperate branch. Two, the "evil" character has earned a "Writ of Redemption." The precedence has been set with Sendariu. She has already earned a "Writ of Redemption" when she joined us, so she will remain in her current branch of power. 

The "Writ of Redemption" will be awarded to characters after performing an invloved quest at the direction of the High-Council. This quest will be custom tailored for each character that wishes to attempt it and they will all include the following:

Loyalty to Cursus Honorum
Dedication to the light
Ability to role-play
Leading the guild on a raid
A written account of their quest for publication on the web-site.

The prize for finishing this quest will be an award (Writ of Redemption), the freedom to move out of the liaison branch, and a political point. To provide balance for other guild members a similar quest will be available for "good" characters. The minimum level to begin a quest of this nature will be 35. Also, each character will only be given this award once. If you fail your quest you may attempt it again later, but once you succeed you will not be allowed to do an additional quest. Since the requirements of this award have been increased and more detailed after Sendariu joined us, she will be allowed to perform the "good" counter-part of the "Writ of Redemption."

You may petition the High-Council to undergo a quest, or the High-Council may call upon you to perform, but either way, the High-Council will decide who is up for such a quest. Since these quests are custom tailored and will involve a lot of extra work for certain people, you may be denied due to a lack of time, but rest assured that we will try to accomodate everyone as much as possible. If you don't have the time yourself to perform a quest, then you are welcome to decline without any worries.

More details on these new rules will be published as they are finalized by the High-Council.

Joureny well everyone,
