				<p>May 11, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>Our next raid will be at Castle Mistmoore on Sunday, May 20th. Rohwin will host the raid starting at 1:00pm pacific daylight savings. The raid is designed for levels 25 and higher. We will break down into groups according to level and occupy different regions of Mistmoore depending on our strength. Those below level 25 may still attend the raid if they wish, but no campaign awards will be awarded to them. Any and all friends are welcome to attend. Maps and invis potions are great assets for entering and leaving the castle without incident, esspecially if you cannot attend on time. Please see the quests and events page for story line details.<br>

					<p align=left>The raid on Unrest went quite well. We had over 20 participants at one point with people from Knights of Freedom and Maidens of Faydark as well as a few other guilds. Special thanks to Syndir from the Knights of Freedom who watched over one of our groups to ensure their safety. And extra special thanks to Jezeb from the Knights of Freedom who provided resuscitations for the few who got caught in the trains at the end of the night. We will schedule our next raid soon. Fare thee all well.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>March 25, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>The High-Council have passed a motion to add three new rules.<br><br>
1. Members must be of high rank (35+) to hold a seat on the High-Council. Since Benedain was promoted to High-Council prior to this rule he will maintain his position.<br><br>
2. When a branch of power reaches eight or more members, then a second officer position will be opened. The two highest members of a branch of power will be officers and vouchers.<br><br>
3. Low and mid ranking members may not accumulate more than ten political points. Points in excess of ten will be lost, but when level 35 is reached then points will be awarded normally again.<br><br>
These rules have been added to add goals to strive for and to reward advancement in the game. They will take effect on Sunday, April 1st.<br><br>

				<p>March 17, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>Today is a prosperous day for Cursus Honorum. With the recent recruit of our young Enchanter, those who study the arcane arts has formed their own branch of power. Countess Magnia leads this branch in their enigmatic ways as their Hierarch. Also, Benedain has been promoted to Ambassador in the liaison branch. Our guild grows slowly but surely. Journey well everyone.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>March 15, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>A minor rule addition has been made. A quorum was present for an impromtu vote and the following motion passed. The Regent my appoint Viceroys as required and/or members may make requests for certain members to become Viceroys. A Viceroy will be given officer status, but will not hold the same power as other officers. They will not be valid vouchers nor will they be listed as officers on the web-site. Their function is to make it easier to issue the invite command to newly approved recruits. This new rule has been added to the Hierarchy of Nobles and the Code of Nobility pages.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>March 8, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>It is Official. We have guild status. Thanks to  everyone who helped make this guild a reality. Our first officer promotions are Magnia and Marymary. I will grant their officer status as soon as we can meet on-line. Now I am going to take a short break to attend renaissance faire. When I return I will present some ideas to the House of Lords regarding our first guild activities. Keep safe everyone.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>March 6, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>Everything seems to be on schedule for Wednesday the 7th. I'll be getting on as soon as I can, possibily as soon as 10pm PST, but the offical meeting time will be 11pm to ensure that I won't be horribly late. As soon as ten people show up I'll petition a GM to come to us. After we are formed I will tally up political points and promote officers. As long as I have your application you will be eligible for promotion even if you can't attend the gathering. I hope to see you all at the Wizard Spires in North Karana.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>March 5, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>We have been approved by EQ to form our guild. I received their email on Friday, March 2nd at 10:08pm. Incindentally, we were leaving the chat room about that time. Now we need to get at least ten of us together on-line and petition a GM to come and grant us guild status. The scheduled time is Wednesday, March 7th at 11pm PST at the wizard spires in North Karana. So far two people have said they can't make it. If any more can't attend then we may need to bump the creation date to next week. Please mail me any scheduling conflicts you have.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>February 27, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>The tentative plan for forming the guild will be on March 3rd. I will create the chat room named "Cursus Honorum" around 7pm PST. Everyone should have received the password via E-mail, but if you don't know it then please mail me or send a tell sometime this week. If everyone can get into the chat room sometime on Friday evening and type #guildapprove, then I can fill out the charter and submit it to EQ. I'll stay in the room until midnight or when ten people have approved the guild. I will be AFK from time to time, but I'll make a point of being there around 9pm PST to answer any questions. If anyone has a scheduling conflict then please let me know as soon as you can. Also, it has been brought to my attention that we may need all ten of us to be in the chat room at once for the guild approval to work. Hopefully you can leave the chat room once you approve of the guild, but if your continued presence is required I'll send someone into Norrath to summon you back to the chat room. Thanks and stay safe.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>February 22, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>I have received eight applications so far. At least six more are expected soon. For those of you who wish to join but have yet to mail me your character's information, then please do so soon. At the very least get your E-mail to me so we can organize a date and time for everyone to be on-line so we can form this guild. Also, a rule has been added to the code of nobility; do not spam your guildmates. It is common sense, but it was brought to my attention that we should mention it in our code. Take care brave adventurers.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>February 10, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>A few name changes have been made to the Cleric and Monk ranks. Benedain found a few historical names for monks and other holy people and passed the information on to me. Also, the "Join" page is not functioning yet. Anyone who wishes to apply please E-mail me the requested information. I'll try to get the "Join" page working as soon as possible. Thanks.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>February 6, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>The time to activate this guild is coming soon. As soon as I have ten confirmed members wishing to join we will set a time and date to initiate the procedure. The first step is to get everone in a chat room. The name of the chat room will be Cursus Honorum. I will give everyone who is joining the password by "tell" or E-mail. Once you are in the chat room you will need to type "#guildapprove." When ten people have approved the guild I can fill out the charter and submit it to EQ. They will E-mail me in a few days with their approval or comments for our guild. Once they approve us then we will all need to get on-line again for guild creation. We will all need to be close together in the game and then petition a GM to come and grant our guild status.<br><br>Rohwin</p>

				<p>February 6, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>After cafeful consideration and consulting various people in Norrath, some rule changes have been made. Guild officers will only be those who have been promoted to the High-Council. Officer status is still permenant, so previous High-Council members will retain their officer status and are still eligable for vouching for new members. Also, all the founding members will be a part of Rohwin's Vanguard and will earn the extra political point as a bonus for helping to form the guild. The rules do not state this, but none of the founding members will be initiates. Everyone will become full members upon creation of the guild. Other minor revisions have been made, such as correcting spelling and grammer. Feel free to point out confusing or contradictory rules, as well as broken links or further grammer errors.<br><br>Rohwin</p>
