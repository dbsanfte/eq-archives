<p>
Prof. Klennix, currently on loan to the AAS from his Felwithe, Faydark
high council position, arrived in Freeport in 3190. Born in Felwithe 
to parents Elsyd Klennix, noted politician, and wife Reyna, 
Prof. Klennix spent his formative years studying under prominant
academic Tarker Blazetoss of Felwithe.
<p>
Upon completion of his training, he was asked to take the position of 
Ambassador of Felwithe to then warlord Artillian Vincere, a placement
which gained him some animosity amongst the High Elves, but suited
Klennix's tolerant personality well. 
<p>
After Vincere's disappearance, Prof. Klennix returned to Freeport
after a stay in Felwithe, to take a position with the Academy to teach 
his now famous Thaumaturgical Archaeology class. He is still active in 
field work, and continues to campaign with Vincere's alleged regent, 
Paladin Commander Rohwin Ardour.
