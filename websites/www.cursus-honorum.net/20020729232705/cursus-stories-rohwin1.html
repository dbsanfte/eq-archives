<P ALIGN="CENTER"><h3>Dolorous Emprise</h3></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
</B><P align=left>The old man coughed then gasped; he motioned the young boy to remain seated. "What!" he roared, sounding more surprised than he intended. He slammed down his wooden cup on the table, splashing its dark contents on his tattered wool sleeve. "Why in the world would you want to here a story like that?"</P>
<P align=left>The young boy scratched the dull point of one of his ears. He looked into the corner of the dark room, or at his feet, or anything that wasn't the old man. Nervously he said, "It's just that I heard that you knew Rowhin Ardour, grandfather." The boy started to think how much he would rather be outside playing with his friends. The old man grinned slightly, he was the boy's great grandfather but he wasn't about to correct the child.</P>
<P align=left>The old man's name was Demilin. His own son was killed many years before in the Orc war, but not before having a child. There have been many Orc wars through out the ages, but the most recent one within living memory was always referred to as the "Orc war." Its official name in historical books was the "Orc conflict of 3250." Two years after his son died in combat, his son's wife took ill and died leaving their four-year-old son Jonti. Demilin took Jonti and moved away from Freeport to a small village far away from the problems of the world. Jonti had little memory of his parents and called Demilin his father. Jonti grew up happily in the village. He helped Demilin brew a variety of beers, ales, and stouts that they sold to the only inn in town and to the occasional merchant the passed through. They made a modest living selling their concoctions. When Jonti was a young man he married a local girl and they had a child named Demlen, after his grandfather.</P>
<P align=left>Demilin's grin vanished and was replaced by a stare that could stop a dragon. The boy's eyes widened, and he hoped the old man didn't notice him gulp. The boy had never known a look like that and it frightened him. Sweat formed on his brow, all he wanted was to bolt out of the small house, but the fire in the old man's eyes bound the boy helpless, as surely as rope or chain. Long moments of silence passed. The boy tried to apologize, but the words wouldn't come out. </P>
<P align=left>"I can see you are too young and foolish to know better." the old man groaned. "You'll probably pester me till my grave. Fetch me another stout and I'll tell you a tale of great sorrow." The boy was surprised at how easily he got up; he hurriedly grabbed the wooden cup and took it to the cask to be filled. He seriously considered the consequences if he was to run away now. He decided against it, the old man would have his hide if he didn't return with his stout. He walked back slowly and gave the old man his cup. Demilin set the cup down and said, "sit boy." Then he leaned forward and grabbed the boy's attention, and he began the tale of Rohwin Ardour.</P>
<P align=left>"Aye, I did know Rohwin when I was a young man, a few years older than yourself. I was fishing on the docks of Freeport when the ship sailed in. The crowds of people were making their way either on or off the ship. I had to be careful or risk being forced into the water. I took notice of a young Half-Elf stepping off the gangplank with a Human, presumably his father. It was hard to make friends in Freeport; all the human children made fun of my ears. I was lonely and needed a friend."</P>
<P align=left>The boy was confused, Freeport was so much larger than the village they lived in now, and he had lots of friends. Demilin read the boy's face clearly. "Freeport hasn't always been as diverse as it is now. When I was young, Half-Elves weren't very welcome anywhere. At best we were tolerated. The full Elves looked down on us as if we were polluted or diseased. The Dwarves don't really like anybody. Only the Humans would accept us, if somewhat grudgingly. More and more Half-Elves were moving to Freeport. Resentment started to grow as we were blamed for increases in crimes and others said we were taking their jobs. Half-Elves had to stick together, which didn't help the Humans attitudes. Most Half-Elves lived in East Freeport, a very poor section of the city. I lived in North Freeport among the Humans. Humans generally didn't like me and other Half-Elves frowned at me, calling me Half-Human. For such a large city, Freeport was quite a lonely one." The boy looked as if he understood, but Demilin knew he would never fully understand the ways of the world until he experienced it himself. The old man paused to consider if he should explain further, then decided against it.</P>
<P align=left>"I was elated when the boy's father walked up to me," the old man continued. "He asked me where a decent Inn could be found. I gave him haphazard directions to a better part of town. He thanked me and pitched me a silver piece minted from Felwithe. I quickly said it would be best if I showed him the way, so he doesn't get lost. He laughed and told me to lead on. He probably thought I was looking to get more silver, perhaps not. On the way to north Freeport I learned that the boy's name was Rohwin and he was indeed traveling with his father from Felwithe. I talked a little with Rohwin and his Father. I learned that Rohwin's father was a tailor. He wanted to teach Rohwin his trade, but Rohwin had other interests. It seemed to be a sore point between them, or maybe they were just very tired from their journey. I guided them to an inn near my house. Then I gave my farewells and ran off before seeing if I was to receive more silver. In the days that followed I made it my habit to walk by the inn often. Sure enough, I did see Rohwin again, and we became friends. It didn't take very long for us to become the best of friends. We did everything together and were carefree and happy for years. We would fish at the dock, and watch the ships come and go. Though often as not, we would use our poles as mock swords."</P>
<P align=left>When he would look out to the sea, a little sadness crept into his eyes. If I asked him about it, he would assure me he had dirt or something in his eye. One time when we were skipping rocks on the water he told me of his mother. She was a High-Elf. His father and mother had separated when he was very young, but they both had lived in Felwithe. Rohwin was raised by his father, but visited his mother often and was very close to her. After his mother remarried, Rohwin's father decided to move back to his homeland. There were many protest from Rohwin, but father had decided. When Rohwin's mother didn't step in on Rohwin's behalf, he felt betrayed and sad. After that, I never asked what was the matter when we were at the docks. I never knew if he was upset with his mother or missed her, probably a little of both. The only time we weren't together was when his father took him to the priests of Mithaniel Marr. My parents and I followed the ways of Erollisi Marr. Rohwin always talked of truth and justice, but he sounded like he was just repeating someone else's words.</P>
<P align=left>Early one morning, Rohwin asked if he could come with my parents and me to the Temple of Marr and talk with the priests of Erollisi Marr. I said "of course" and we went to the temple. He talked at length with the priests, so long in fact that my parents left us there so they could eat. My stomach made its own protests, but I waited for Rohwin. When he was done it was well past noon and we went out to seek some food with the few coppers my parents had given me. We enjoined a meager lunch and went down to the docks for awhile. We watched the boats maneuver around each other, and examined all the people arriving and departing. Rohwin was especially quiet today. I was getting tired and wanted to go home, but Rohwin insisted that we could stay a little longer. We were looking out across the Ocean of Tears when a large shadow loomed over us. Before I could turn around Rohwin was jerked off the ground. "Rohwin!" his father yelled. I turned to see Rohwin hanging by his shirt from his father's grasp. "Where have you been?" his father yelled loud enough to turn a few heads at the docks. He lowered his voice a little and said "We were supposed to see the priests of Mithaniel this morning." His father dragged him away to continue his yelling in a little more privacy. I was surprised to see Rohwin did not look scared or sad. He went with his father with a determination that I've never seen on him before. They argued back and forth, though just out of earshot. After a short while his father walked him back and deposited him next to me. "If you want to follow Erollisi like your mother," his father grumbled, "then so be it. At least you still walk in the light." His father stalked off with a look of a little disappointment. Rohwin had no expression at all. He said he needed to be alone and walked off.</P>
<P align=left>In the years that followed no one spoke of the incident at the docks. Everyone got on well enough, but Rohwin's relationship with his father was never the same. Rohwin would attend the Temple of Marr with me. His father never stood in the way of one of Rohwin's decisions. In fact, his father even congratulated him (though not whole-heartedly) when Rohwin announced that he was going to train as a Paladin of Erollisi Marr. The priests told him he had a gift for channeling and if his faith was strong Erollisi would grant him the spells that a Paladin would use to help the weak and wage war against evil. He could not feel any power within him, but the priests assured him it was there. Rohwin walked around proudly in his training tunic and short sword. We still talked and spent time together, but his duties to Erollisi commanded much of his time. Soon after, I got a job in my uncle's tavern, cleaning up after the drunks. My uncle said that in time he would show me the art of his brewing. (The old man took a long sip from his cup, closed his eyes and smiled with satisfaction. Then dropped his smile and continued his story.) Now it seemed we had little time for each other. I didn't see him for months. Until one day he strode in the tavern and plopped a modest bag of coin on the bar and announced "drinks for everyone." The patrons responded with mock gratitude, but Rohwin paid them no heed. He told me that he had fallen in love. I congratulated him, even though I was a little skeptical, it wasn't the first time I've heard this from Rohwin. He had always talked how one day Erollisi would grant him true love, that he would marry the most beautiful girl in Norrath. He had been infatuated a few times, but they were always short lived. He would fall in love, she'd leave him, and then he'd cry a little and move on. I would tell him that she wasn't the right one for him anyway, but he'd never believe me until he met his next girl. Then we would repeat this cycle. However, this time was different. His face was all smiles but his eyes held that determination I saw on the docks so many years ago. A few moments later "she" walked in. Rohwin was right, she was the most beautiful girl in Norrath. At least in Freeport anyway. Her name was Sullairia. She was a Human with long red hair and green eyes that would light up a room at midnight. She walked with a grace that made you forget what you were doing or saying. Even the High-Elves would have been jealous of her beauty. The way they looked at each other spoke more than any poem of love. My uncle gave me the night off and the three of us drank the night away.</P>
<P align=left>The young boy had no idea his "grandfather" knew Rohwin Ardour so well, but he wanted to hear the stories of fighting the undead and the dervish. "But what about-"</P>
<P align=left>"Silence boy!" Demilin snapped. The boy felt as if he had been switched even though the old man never moved. "Interrupt again and I'll bend you over my knee." Demilin studied the boy. He knew that Demlen was growing bored of village life. The boy wanted adventure and excitement. Demilin tried to teach him about the world, but the boy held a romance in his heart that would not be swayed. Demilin recognized looks and attitudes from his own youth in the boy. The old man hoped that it would not get the boy killed. The boy sat still and listened carefully as the old man continued.</P>
<P align=left>"She was training to be a Cleric at the Temple of Marr. They studied and trained together whenever possible. She was nineteen, same as Rohwin. We thought we were all adults with the world waiting for our grand entrance. Now I realize that we were brainless idiots, mere fragile children in a world without mercy." The old man could see his warning to the boy had no effect. He sighed silently to himself and got on with his tale.</P>
<P align=left>Quite a pair they were though. They would have already been married, but Rohwin insisted on sending word to his mother first, so she could attend the ceremony. I saw Rohwin often during the next month. He talked of the wedding and his bride to be. I have to admit Sullairia was everything he ever wanted. She was intelligent and wise for her age. She had a laugh that could ease the darkest feelings and was so very beautiful. Rohwin's studies were falling behind. Understandably so, but not acceptable according to the priests. Rohwin assured them that he would be back on track soon enough, but the priests did worry about him. Rohwin and Sullairia were to attend a small caravan of Priests of Erollisi, Clerics, and Paladins to Rivervale. The Temple of Marr was delivering some artifact or something. They were trying to increase the Temple's favor with Rivervale in hopes of one day establishing a Temple there. Both Rohwin and Sullairia were so excited because neither had ever ventured so far west.</P>
<P align=left>A day before they were to leave Rohwin was told his studies were too far behind to go on the trip. Rohwin argued with the priests and tried to justify why he should go, but they knew he only wanted to be close to Sullairia. Finally he submitted to the priests, and hid himself in his room for an agonizing two weeks of intense study. After a few days he came to me late at night, close to closing time. He said he couldn't stand being away from her so long. He thought he might run away to be with her. I convinced him quickly that that was a foolish plan. Instead he decided to write her a letter. I had a few days off coming up so I volunteered to deliver it personally. By myself I could catch the lumbering caravan in no time. Rohwin hastily wrote several letters, crumpling one after another. Then he paused, closing his eyes for several minutes, and wrote one last letter. He folded it and sealed it with wax then handed it to me. I took it and said I would leave at first light. He left with a smile; he looked refreshed and energetic.</P>
<P align=left>I got up well before dawn and gathered the supplies I would need for the short trip. Some food and water, a borrowed short sword, and a blanket. I packed light so I could make the best possible time. I knew the immediate surroundings well so I headed out thirty minutes before dawn. The Commonlands were beautiful, gentle hills and tall trees. The leaves were turning colors falling to the ground. I followed the well-worn path that snaked through the green grass. In a few weeks the rains would begin, the hard packed dirt trail would turn to mud making journeys to and from Freeport very difficult. I felt strong with my short sword belted to my side. Of course, I knew the Commonlands were not terribly dangerous. There were bears and wolves that I didn't want to meet, but I wasn't likely to find any. As long as I stayed alert I could avoid any complications. The first day went without incident; I even avoided any spiderlings or fire beetles rather than take any chances. My infravision allowed me to travel for a few hours after dark, but when the moon set the ambient light was too scarce to see. I made camp several paces off the trail. I ate what I thought a day's rations should be and tried to sleep. My thin blanket was entirely inadequate. I shivered though the night but the thick layers of dead leaves were soft enough to sleep on. I got up early the following morning, ate a cold breakfast and set out on the beaten path to Rivervale. The woods were very quiet and peaceful; I wish I had the time to enjoy them more, but I knew I needed to travel fast. Rohwin would be a jumble of nerves until he learned Sullairia had received his letter, and my uncle was expecting me back in a few days more. After the sun had passed noon I came across a band of merchants headed for Freeport. They confirmed that the caravan was on the path and that I could probably catch them in three days. I politely refused to look at their goods. I had no time to haggle with merchants. Their leader grunted something, but I was off before he could finish. The waxing moon was staying a little longer in the sky each night so I made it a little further that night. I finally decided to stop and make camp a short way off the path. After eating I curled up as best I could and slept. I awoke that night with a startle. Something was near my camp. I peered into the night but the swaying trees and bushes played tricks on my eyes. I though I heard a low murmur, but I couldn't be sure. My imagination ran wild. Perhaps those merchants were really bandits. Maybe they came back to rob or murder me. Nonsense, they could see that I had nothing of value. Only the sounds of birds and insects remained now, but I didn't get a wink more sleep. I spent the remainder of the night sitting with my back to a tree with my sword across my lap. The sun's first light started to creep across the horizon. I gathered my things and left without eating breakfast. I needed to get far away from there. By mid-afternoon my hunger finally overcame my uneasiness. I stopped for a quick bite of some stale muffins and water. I felt so much better after eating that I all but forgot the creepy night before. I managed to sleep a little that night, but I did keep my sword unsheathed under my blanket. The next day went without incident. This trip was longer and harder than expected. I was thinking of all the ways Rohwin could repay me later. The sun had set, but there would still be plenty of light for awhile. I smelled the smoke from a campfire accompanied with smells of cooking meat. If I had come across the caravan already then I had made very good time indeed. I followed my nose off the trail and was relieved when I saw the banners of Marr displayed around the camp. Lucky for me I didn't pass them in the night.</P>
<P align=left>I walked directly towards the camp and was stopped suddenly by a sword resting on my shoulder from behind. "Who goes there?" a voice boomed from behind. I was relieved to see that his white surcoat bore the symbol of Erollisi. A single rose with a thorny vine spiraling beneath it. He was a Human Paladin. His chainmail reflected thousands of points of moonlight. My own sword seemed completely inadequate when compared to his gleaming steel long sword. He was tall and very powerfully built. The confidence in his voice, stare, and posture commanded respect. I quickly told him I had a message for Sullairia from Rohwin. He grabbed the letter when I displayed it for him. He studied the letter and me for a few moments, a little longer then I would have found comfortable. "Come with me" he said, as if I had a choice when he gripped my shirt a dragged me behind him at a pace too fast for me to walk easily. The priest he presented me to frowned at the letter, and after a short conversation he directed me to where I could find Sullairia. He said I was welcome to stay at their camp tonight and let me go with my gear and sword still strapped to my side. Then he directed the Paladin, "Gamadel" he called him, to return to his sentry duty. The camp was larger then I thought, maybe two score Paladins and half as many Clerics and half a dozen priests. The bulk of the camp was made up of servants, I estimate eighty or more people running around tending to fires, wagons, or beasts of burden. I found Sullairia scrubbing pots with an unhelpful, plump woman standing over her saying "hurry girl, if everyone is to eat tonight." I'd never seen Sullairia so filthy. Her hair was a mess and her dress was soiled, but she was still beautiful. I'm sure I was a much worse sight to behold. The women tried to shoo me away but I explained my business and she let me deliver the letter with a grumbling resistance about chores and eating and such. I blocked her out of my mind and delivered the letter to an excited Sullairia. She read it quickly with the woman staring at her and tapping her foot expectantly. Sullairia's face brightened and her smile made me forget all the aches, pains, and tiredness I was feeling.</P>
<P align=left>"Oh you must return a letter for me, would you please..." she exclaimed, while the plump woman grew ever more impatient.</P>
<P align=left>"Of course" I said, "I would be more than-."</P>
<P align=left>"Yes, Yes, all fine and good" the woman interrupted. "Now be on your way young man, there is still much work to be done. You can speak with Sullairia when her duties are done." On that note, I made my retreat and found the warmth of a nearby fire very comforting. Dinner that night consisted of stew, bread, water, and bear meat. It seems a Paladin had slain a bear earlier that day and there was enough meat for everyone, even the servants. The bread was durable and the meat tough, but it tasted better than a winter's feast day meal to me. I sat with the servants that night and listened to their jokes and stories with great interest, but Sullairia was nowhere to be found. After eating I was recruited to help clean up and they worked me until nearly midnight. When they finally released me they showed me to a servant's tent and actually provided a cot for me. I was exhausted; I looked forward to a good night's sleep tonight.</P>
<P align=left>"Psst" came from the darkness outside the tent. Most of the servants were asleep so I groaned as I got up from the cot. I poked my head out of the tent to see Sullairia beckoning me outside. Of course, I had forgotten. We went off a little ways so we didn't disturb the others. The campfires were nothing more than glowing embers now. A few torches were still alight around the camp, but would not last much longer. Also, the moon had just set. It was dark in the camp, but it was easy to see Sullairia's face. She handed me a letter folded and sealed as neatly as Rohwin's. "Thank you so very much" she whispered. "I can't tell you how happy I am." Then she plucked a wild flower from the ground, its colors a swirl of red and white. "Please give Rohwin this too, he'll understand." she said as she gave me the flower as well.</P>
<P align=left>"As my lady commands," I said in a playful and complimentary way as I bowed to her. She giggled slightly, hugged me, and gave me a small kiss on the cheek. She thanked me once more and disappeared back towards her tent. I stood there a few moments longer then started back to my own tent.</P>
<P align=left>That was when the first scream shattered the night. Then another scream sounded from somewhere else in the camp. Suddenly the whole camp was turned inside out. Inhuman yells drowned out all other noise. Then the sounds of steel against steel and war cries and the screams of men dying raged all around. "Orcs!" was the cry from all around the camp to add to the din. My tent rustled violently as men came running out, many of which were half dressed. Then the side of my tent was cut away to reveal an Orc standing there with blood dripping from his scimitar. Some of the servants, groaning in agony, laid mortally wounded at his feet. I could see the hate in his red eyes as he stared right at me. My sword was tucked safely under my cot, not that it would have done much good. This Orc stood taller than any man did, with dented and scarred armor from long use. His breath in the cold night air looked like plumes of smoke streaming out of his wide nose. I thought that surely he would strike me down with a breath of fire or something equally nasty. He bared his chipped, glistening fangs then ran towards me faster than I would have thought possible. I tried to run but I was frozen in place with fear. I couldn't even turn my head so I closed my eyes tight. Then there was a huge crash and grunts, which caused me to open me eyes. A Paladin had intercepted the huge Orc. His long sword flashed furiously in the night, but the Orc parried repeatedly and counter attacked with such force that the Paladin was now on the defensive, but he expertly deflected the blows with his shield. A dim torch silhouetted the Orc, making his features difficult to see, but the Paladin's chainmail shined brightly. The Paladin almost seemed to radiate light from the effect. Only the Orc's eyes and scimitar showed clearly against dark backdrop of the forest. It was literally a fight between light and dark. Strength returned to my legs and I rushed by the pair to my ruined tent. I pulled out my short sword, leaving the scabbard behind. My sword seemed so puny and worthless against the might of an Orc, but I had to do something. I turned to see the Paladin beating back the Orc now. The Paladin's sword swung with precision and grace, his attacks were impossibly fast, scoring numerous glancing blows. However, the Orc was an experienced warrior as well and suffered little damage. Then the Orc hit the Paladin squarely in the left shoulder. Shinny bits of chainmail and blood sprayed from the wound. His shield dropped to the ground as his arm hung limply by his side. The Paladin didn't cry out but was clearly out-matched now. Every swing of the Orc scimitar forced him back. I rushed the Orc from the side and swung my sword wildly. I was surprised to see my sword sink easily into the Orc's arm. I stood there transfixed on the wound I had caused, then the Orc bashed me with the pommel of his scimitar and I went sprawling backwards racked with pain and my vision all a blur. The distraction was all the Paladin needed, his long sword buried itself in the Orc's neck. Blood sprayed in a huge fountain soaking his once shiny chainmail. Without a scream, the Orc fell with a thud and then the Paladin sank to his knees.</P>
<P align=left>I looked around to see for the first time that the battle was all around me. Orcs were everywhere, swinging swords and stabbing with spears. More than ten Paladins laid dead or dying, with as many Clerics fallen by their side. Orcs littered the ground as well. As many as forty lay motionless with grotesque expressions of pain or hatred on their faces. A Cleric rushed to the side of the Paladin who saved me. She stood motionless for a second then points of blue light showered around her like dandelion petals in a soft breeze. The Paladin retrieved his shield and stood. He glanced at me, gave me the slightest of nods, then rushed back into the battle. Only now did I recognize him as Gamadel, the same one who brought me into the camp. The Cleric signaled me to follow her and I stepped quickly to do so. Fifteen Paladins and five Clerics had formed a defensive semi-circle around many of the servants and priests alike. Two overturned wagons formed an insecure wall to the back of the semi-circle. Many of the servants had taken up spears to guard any holes in the defensive line and keep any would be attackers in check. Sullairia was among those in the circle, thank Erollisi she was unharmed. She stood tall and casted her spells along side the other Clerics. Beyond the circle was chaos. The Orc's numbers stretched out past the light of the camp; there was no way to know how many there were. Paladins hacked and swung and dropped many Orcs fast, but it seemed inevitable that the Orcs would eventually overwhelm the camp. The only thing holding back the masses were the Clerics casting spells of destruction into the ranks of massed Orcs. Brave souls pulled wounded Paladins and Clerics from the battlefield, back to the relative safety of the circle. The Clerics would cast their magic of healing on the wounded. Once any of the wounded had the strength to stand on their own, they would replace one of the members of the circle so the other could rush out to join the melee. This process continued to keep fresh fighters out in the battle. However, the strain of so much casting would soon exhaust the Clerics, and there seemed to be an unlimited supply of Orcs. The Paladins casted some spells too, but were generally too busy swinging their swords to have the time for the complex movements associated with spell casting. Sullairia's strength was in healing; her offensive spells had little or no effect against the Orcs. Serious wounds had to be healed by an experienced Cleric, but her own healing was instrumental in keeping Paladins ready for action in far less time than resting alone. Many Orcs fought through the melee to reach the circle, but were quickly killed or turned back by the well disciplined men and women defending. The disruption of the advancing Orc lines and the confusion of the melee worked to our advantage by not allowing a coordinated Orc attack on the circle.</P>
<P align=left>To my horror I saw an Orc march through two Paladins, cutting them down like unmoving practice targets, then a third fell to its two-handed sword with a blade as black as night. The blade was more then just black. It was like an absence of everything where a blade should have been. What could be seen were its effects. Men and women were being slaughtered. A Cleric directed all his attention at the fierce Orc. Fire engulfed the Orc, but it only seemed to wash over him around a transparent sphere. Then the Orc extended his hand and energy shot forth, blowing the Cleric back a dozen feet on to his back. He did not get up. By now many Paladins were grouped around this Orc. Their swords were deflected harmlessly by an unseen barrier. One Paladin fell, but rest kept the Orc too busy to advance any further. Large gaps opened in the melee and Orcs poured through to attack the circle in force. Instantly the circle shrunk under the pressing weight of so many attackers, but the defensive line held. Cries came from behind as Orcs encircled the defenders and started climbing over the wagons. The inexperienced servants, wielding their spears were knocked aside as several Orcs penetrated the circle. The Clerics inside responded with their maces and beat down the rampaging Orcs. Now the Clerics formed the rear defense of the circle, there would be very little casting from them now. I swung my short sword as best I knew how, more often than not as a deflecting blow from spear or sword. Sullairia was one of the few who could remain casting. Her healing was strengthening the delicate shell of the circle from fatigue and dropping moral. The noise was so deafening. Yells, screams, grunts, the heavy clanking of metal, but through all that, the sound of soft flesh ripping and tearing was clear in my ears. A spear went past my defenses and tore into my thigh. I screamed and collapsed under the intense pain. The Orc who stabbed me stood over me now, with many more piling up behind him to take advantage of the new hole in the defensive line. The Paladins to either side of me moved quickly to seal the hole. They fended off the attackers but their backs were to the Orc inside the circle. I was clutching my leg with both hands; I don't know where my sword was. The Orc hefted his spear above his head, then Sullairia swung here mace and struck him in the temple. The Orc's scream was short as he toppled over sideways. Sullairia looked at my bleeding wound and closed her eyes as she cast. My leg was still in agony, but the bleeding had stopped. Someone was shouting orders, but I could not hear over the din. I tried to stand to test my leg, but the pain wouldn't allow me to get past a kneel. I looked around frantically for my sword. It was lying nearby, but the stretch to reach it was at the threshold of what I could endure. More commands were shouted and people were shifting positions in the circle. I redoubled my efforts to stand; Sullairia took my arm and pulled me up on to my feet. I was hunched over, but supporting my own weight now. Then I was struck from behind. A powerful bash sent me crashing to the ground. I was face down in the red mud, which I realized was the spilt blood of the dead and wounded, then my vision faded away.</P>
<P align=left>My eyes opened slowly to the sight of two women standing over me. I was in a tent, lying on a cot. I was one among dozens lined up on our backs. I tried to sit up, but dizziness washed over me and I quickly fell back on to my cot.</P>
<P align=left>"Your wounds are not serious, you'll be well in a day or two." said one of the women. Then they moved on to the next person wrapped in bandages and began casting their spells of healing.</P>
<P align=left>Lanterns provided flickering light inside the tent. Outside the flapping entrance I could see it was twilight outside. But was it morning or evening, for that matter, what day was it. I could still hear the sounds of battle echoing in my head. When I closed my eyes I could see the faces of Orcs and blood, so much blood. If it wasn't for the throbbing in my head and the pain in my leg I could have convinced myself that it had all been a bad dream. I managed to look down towards my toes. I slowly pulled my blanket up off my feet. I had heard stories of people who thought they could feel limbs that were lost. Relief filled me when I saw two bare feet with toes that could wiggle. My joy was short lived; I saw others with bloody bandaged stumps.</P>
<P align=left>The woman who had watched over Sullairia's pot washing hurried over to my cot. "You must rest if you ever expect to get well again." She lectured. She covered my feet and pushed my head gently back against a folded blanket as a pillow.</P>
<P align=left>"What of Sullairia?" I asked her.</P>
<P align=left>"Rest child" she answered. "You need all the strength you can muster. I will fetch you some soup. You haven't eaten in some time. Surely you must be starved." She tried to dash off but I grabbed her arm firmly.</P>
<P align=left>"Where is Sullairia?" I yelled too loudly for my aching head. She looked at me with worried eyes but did not answer. A pair of strong hands gently pulled my hand from her and she scampered off. I looked to see that it was Gamadel who had released her. The once elegant pattern of his armor was jumbled broken in many places. There was no shine left at all, only stains of reds and browns. Dried mud and blood filled the gaps between the small links. The symbol of Erollisi wasn't recognizable on his ripped and stained surcoat. He looked exhausted, but his hard, unblinking eyes stared at me with unrestricted strength.</P>
<P align=left>"I am sorry friend, Sullairia did not survive last night." I did not believe what I had heard. Perhaps there was some mistake, he must have meant another girl. He did refer to her by name though. Maybe this was the bad dream I was waiting to wake from. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I wanted to cry but I couldn't do that either. I only stared back at Gamadel; I was as motionless as a mountain. "She fought as brave as anyone could" he continued. "The Orcs broke through our defensive line, the circle was completely disrupted. She forced her way through the fighting to reach our wounded. When she was concentrating on healing one of the wounded, an Orc ran her through with his spear. Her wounds were beyond our help and she died quickly. Soon after, we killed the Orc leader. Without his command the Orc's attacks became disorganized and we reformed our defenses. After a few more unsuccessful rushes they gave up and ran. We were still outnumbered by three to one, but they could not function without leadership. Without her help we may not have lasted long enough to get the upper hand. I am sorry for the loss of your friend, she will be remembered with honor for her actions. We are still in danger though, our scouts report that their numbers are scattered though the countryside, and they are slowly reforming. We have sent runners to Freeport and Rivervale to bring reinforcements. Rest friend, we may need your sword again before we can go home." I could smell the soup under my nose, but could not eat. I couldn't recognize the woman trying to feed me. I was not aware of anything around me, except that it was getting darker. It must have been evening. I faded back into unconsciousness.</P>
<P align=left>I woke from a terrible sweat. I expected to see Orcs all around me, but there was only the wounded. My heartbeat started to slow down as I realized I was having a nightmare. I was thankful that the details were quickly slipping from my memory. All I could remember was Sullairia calling out to me, asking for my help, but Orcs surrounded me. I tried to fight my way through them but my sword was too heavy to swing. The Orcs attacked, but wouldn't kill me, it was more like they were taunting me. As terrible as the dream was, I was more fearful of the nightmare I had awoken to. Physically, I felt much better so I tested my strength by sitting up. The pain was still lingering, but not so much that it would keep me from leaving this tent and finding some food. It was dark outside but I heard a little activity going on in the camp. It must be early in the morning. I found my clothes beneath my cot and dressed quickly. I stepped softly out of the tent so I wouldn't disturb the others. The brisk cool air was refreshing. The sky was just barely beginning to lighten in the east. Debris still littered the ground. Weapons, bits of armor and clothing, and a variety of indistinguishable trash was scattered over the churned up soil. Not many were up and about in the wee hours of the morning. Just sentries walking around the camp and a few servants starting their day's chores. The putrid smell prevented me from locating food with my nose, so I wandered aimlessly around the camp. Most of the bodies had been lined up for counting and identification. The Orcs were being piled into a shallow pit outside the camp for burning. I could see that the others had been erecting defenses around the camp's perimeter. A low earth wall nearly surrounded the camp with sharpened stakes pointing out like a phalanx. The earth for the wall came from a ditch just outside the wall. Finally, I saw some women stirring large bronze pots with giant wooden spoons. The women told me that the porridge would be ready soon. I took an empty wooden bowl and spoon and waited. Soon people were starting emerge from the tents. The camp was becoming more and more active as the sun rose. A half-hour later one of the women rang a bell once. Immediately people were forming up behind me, with bowls and spoons ready. I ate very quickly and dumped my bowl and spoon into a waiting trough. I was still hungry but did not complain. I looked around for Gamadel, to see where I could help. I found him hard at work digging out the trench deeper and adding the dirt to the wall. He was stripped to the waist, but still wore his chainmail leggings. The upper half of his armor was hanging on some of the many spikes protruding from the wall.</P>
<P align=left>"Glad to see you off your back, take this knife and start sharpening those sticks." He said while gesturing over to an impressive pile of branches and small logs. I took the broad bladed knife and sat on a nearby stump to begin my work. By an hour after sunrise the camp was in full swing. Dozens were digging in the trench and Orcs were being piled high a hundred paces outside the camp. I few helped me make stakes and place them into the wall. The work was hard and dirty, but it kept my mind from thinking too much. Even though the day was cool I sweated continuously. I talked to no one, unless it was absolutely necessary for the work to be completed. Occasionally, someone would make a round around the camp and bring everyone some water. When the sun was nearly set I heard the clang of a single bell. A Cleric issued some quick commands as to who could go eat now and who would wait for the next bell. I was among those who got to eat now. When I looked up from my work, I was impressed with how far we had gotten. The wall encircled the entire camp now. It was a little low in places, but another days work and I thought it would be complete. There were plenty of stakes ready to be placed in and around the wall, so more of us could concentrate on digging tomorrow. I ate my meal among the servants again. This time there was no laughter or stories, it was a truly glum affair. Now that night had set in I was released from my duties. The night was cold and quiet. The camp was dark; no campfires were set tonight. The quarter moon provided enough light for me to see, so I walked around the camp. Plenty of people were around, but no one talked. By chance I looked down and saw a red and white flower beside a sealed letter. I had completely forgotten about the message from Sullairia. I must have dropped them in the confusion. I picked them up, amazingly they were completely undamaged from the battle. With nothing else to do I walked back to the tent full of wounded. My cot was unoccupied so I laid down and wondered what I would dream of tonight.</P>
<P align=left>I awoke earlier the next morning. I didn't recall any dreams but the sweat on my body said they were there. The camp looked much better this morning. Most of the trash had been cleared and even some of the people looked a little higher in spirits. Another day and I bet you wouldn't even be able to tell anything had ever happened here, except for the lines of bodies. Fifty-seven dead was the last number I heard, some of the wounded were not expected to survive much longer. No one made an accurate count of the Orc bodies, it was estimated at more than one hundred fifty. After eating I set out to begin working on the defenses again. I left the flower and letter on my cot; I would not lose them again. By mid afternoon it was clear we would finish our defenses today. Morale was slowly increasing, I even heard someone laugh once. The rhythm of the beating of stakes and shovels hitting the earth started to sound in unison. The even thuds were clear in my ears and slowing getting louder. What confused me was my eyes did not agree with what my ears heard. The shovels and hammers were swinging at random, but the beat was steady. Others noticed this too, and when some stopped working to listen, the beat did not diminish. In fact it was getting louder. "To arms!" someone cried. Everyone scurried over the wall and found their armor and weapons. No one thought the Orcs could have regrouped so fast. I strapped on my sword belt and stood at the edge of the wall, peering out into the forest. The sounds were coming from the west, but we spread out along the entire wall, to check for surprise attacks from another direction. I gripped my sword hilt too tightly, I was so anxious. The steady thudding was getting louder and louder. How many were coming? I didn't have any idea, but it was certainly much more than we had. I was even more scared now, then before the first battle. This time I knew what to expect. The first sight of the marching troops showed their banner flapping proudly in the wind. It was the standard of Rivervale. The Halflings were here, we were saved! They looked like children clad in armor, but even at five hundred paces their discipline and courage was apparent. They marched four wide and two score deep. At the front of their ranks a human or elf marched with them. It was too far to see who it was but I could recognize the rose of Erollisi on his tunic. They halted their march two hundred paces from the camp, and a single Halfling strode forward to our wall. One of our own climbed over the wall and met the Halfling half way. They exchanged bows and talked briefly. After a few moments our representative started to hurry back to our camp and the Halfling signaled to his men to continue marching. When our man returned within shouting distance he exclaimed, "The Orcs have been routed from this land! Lord Hallack and his troop came upon them last evening and crushed them! There are many more still loose in the hills, but the other have of his troop are tracking them down, there will be no more attacks on this camp!" Cheers rose from all over the camp. The marching Halflings were welcomed into our camp with great enthusiasm. The priests greeted Lord Hallack at the wall and lead him and a few of his men to one of the tents. Many of our men remained on sentry duty, and a few of the Halflings joined them, but most celebrated with our rescuers. Someone started playing a flute and people were dancing between the tents. There weren't enough women to go around but nobody seemed to mind. Men danced with Halflings, women, or men, whoever seemed to be closest. A Halfling woman even approached me. She removed her helm and tried to pull me towards the other dancers, but I wasn't feeling very joyous. Now that we were saved I would get to go home. What would I tell Rohwin? I hadn't a clue. I sulked off, away from the festivities. The female Halfling shrugged and grabbed the person that was next to me.</P>
<P align=left>The priests made an announcement that evening. "Our business in Rivervale is done. Lord Hallack will see to the delivery so we may return to Freeport. With the new Orc threat developing we have much to discuss and plan with the Elders. We will break camp at first light." On that note, I returned to my cot and tossed and turned the whole night.</P>
<P align=left>I woke up early again, though I got no rest at all, and proceeded to help with disassembling tents and packing supplies. The stakes were removed from the walls and turned into makeshift pallets and litters to stack the dead on for the sullen trip home. The dead numbered sixty-one now, but the remainder of the wounded were expected to survive. In fact, half of them were able to walk on their own again. The rest either rode on a beast of burden or were dragged behind a wagon on a litter. The Halflings bid their farewell at mid-morning and marched out of the camp with an ornate chest being carried by four Halflings. Thirty minutes later our caravan set out back to Freeport. Just before leaving the pile of Orcs was set ablaze, and left to burn on its own. The excitement of being rescued had wore off, our caravan was quiet and depressed. The overall mood was an improvement over the past few days, but just barely. The day went without incident. Scouts reported very little Orc activity. Any Orcs in the area were staying well clear of our caravan. The only discussion amongst us was what the appearance of so many Orcs this close to Freeport meant. Many thought it was a prelude to another Orc war, others were a little more optimistic. It was known that an occasional Orc would travel near Freeport, and prey upon unsuspecting travelers, but only if the odds were clearly in their favor. However, there was more danger from human bandits then any Orcs, and even bandit attacks were rare. I had never seen an Orc, until that fateful night. The thought of an invasion scared me to death. I couldn't image thousands of them, or maybe tens of thousands, storming Freeport's walls. I knew Orcs were real, but I thought they were too far away to affect me and my humble life. I wondered if I should join the militia, or move away, or I don't know what. Nonsense I thought, I'm just scaring myself to no good end. I should wait until the real danger has been assessed. I slept lightly that night, but at least I slept.</P>
<P align=left>The following afternoon we got word that five hundred men and women of Erollisi were marching towards us. We should meet before sunset. Cheers rose from our group. We quickened our pace so we could reach them before we had to stop to make camp. The Orcs were of no threat for the moment, but you never knew for sure, we would all feel a lot safer once we reached our comrades. The sun was low in the sky when I saw the banner of Erollisi peaking over the next hill. Others saw it too, we all but ran to greet them. We met at the summit of the low hill. They looked magnificent, all shinning armor and clean white surcoats of Erollisi. They marched in even rows five wide. Of course, I thought the same thing of our battered and broken caravan only a few days ago. The leaders made their greetings and talked about what happened while the rest started to make preparations for camp. A young man from the middle of their columns came running to the top of the hill. It was Rohwin. How could I tell him about Sullairia? I stepped in front of Rohwin as he approached. When he reached me he asked where Sullairia was. I choked on the words. One of the priestesses stepped over to us. Maybe she would tell him, I couldn't think of any words to say. Apparently, my face said plenty. He shook his head, "no" he said quietly. Before anyone could say anything he dashed by me yelling for Sullairia. I followed him, still trying to say something, but I simply couldn't find the words. Then he found her. She was lying on a litter beside three others. Her hands were clasped over her stomach, as if to hide her wound. She looked so peaceful, like a deep sleep, except she looked so very pale. "No!" Rohwin cried out. He knelt beside her, "No" he cried again. Rohwin's face was flushed red. 'It can't be' he nearly whispered. Then he gently cradled her head between his hands. With his eyes shut, he held her for a moment. Soft blue light radiated from him. Then she started to glow as well. The intensity of the light increased sharply until it was difficult to look at them. He trembled for long moments. She shook ever so slightly, her chest heaved. Then the light faded away and was gone. The forest seemed much darker now, much more than the setting sun could account for. She did not move again.</P>
<P align=left>"I am sorry Rohwin, the dead cannot be healed" said the priestess. He ignored the priestess as he looked at Sullairia. "We did all we could for her, but her injuries were too severe," continued the priestess.</P>
<P align=left>Rohwin looked to the sky, his face had so much color compared to Sullairia's. "Erollisi, how could you do this to me? Surely you must be Cazic-Thule in disguise, but I doubt even he could conceive of anything so cruel."</P>
<P align=left>The priestess looked aghast. "We understand your pain Rohwin, we all will grieve-"</P>
<P align=left>"Your understand nothing!" barked Rohwin.</P>
<P align=left>"We are at war with all the evil deities, Erollisi did not take her from you. Here, friends surround you. In fact, this is the first time you have channeled successfully, Erollisi is grieving with you."</P>
<P align=left>"Successfully? What success did you witness?"</P>
<P align=left>"Few can channel as much as you just did, sadly, not even Erollisi herself could heal Sullairia."</P>
<P align=left>"If I could have come with her maybe I could have prevented this."</P>
<P align=left>"Perhaps, probably not, there were capable people there who did their best to save her."</P>
<P align=left>"No! I could have saved her if I had been there. You said it yourself, that few can channel as much as I. If not through magic then by my sword."</P>
<P align=left>"We have no way of seeing the future, the decision to keep you behind was correct at the time."</P>
<P align=left>Rohwin stood up and faced the priestess. His expression was of frustration and anger. "Maybe Erollisi isn't Cazic-Thule, maybe she is Bristlebane instead. What a great joke it is to grant me the power to heal after it is too late to use it. Why couldn't I have channeled earlier? If I could have then you would have let me go. I have never sinned against Erollisi. My faith was always strong. I walked in the light and believed in Erollisi, until now."</P>
<P align=left>"Rohwin, you speak in haste. We will help you through this, we are your friends and family."</P>
<P align=left>"Maybe I don't want to get <I>through this</I>." Rohwin mocked the preistess. "Like I said, you understand nothing." Then Rohwin tore his training tunic from his body and cast it down before the priestess. His stare was cold as he walked past us. I was still at a loss for words, but it wouldn't have mattered. He was not going to listen to anyone right now; he needed to be alone. I was clutching the letter and flower tightly, I would give them to him later, when he was ready to grieve.</P>
<P align=left>"You are welcome back whenever you are ready Rohwin." Said the priestess. "May the light shine on you." But Rohwin ignored her and everyone else as well. He walked steadily out of the camp and he did not return. After awhile, the priests sent someone to see where Rohwin was. A young man reported back that his tracks showed that Rohwin was headed back to Freeport, but he couldn't find him.</P>
<P align=left>The rest of the journey home went smoothly. We did not find Rohwin. When we got close to the city his tracks became indistinguishable from all the other tracks in the area. We could only assume that he made his own way home safely.</P>
<P align=left>I was glad to be back in Freeport. I returned to my uncle's tavern where he and my parents were relieved to see me unharmed. Word of the Orcs had spread quickly. The patrons of my uncle's tavern swamped me with questions about what had happened. I reluctantly told the facts of what I experienced, but I glossed over many of the details. I quickly tired of telling the story and refused to tell it anymore. The patrons were clearly disappointed. I couldn't blame them. If I was in their position I'm sure I would have asked the same questions.</P>
<P align=left>The day after we returned Freeport the funerals were held for the dead. It was a big affair for the whole city. Sixty-one people had a lot of friends and family. I searched through the crowds for Rohwin. I brought the letter and flower with me. I don't know if he was ready for them, but I wanted to be prepared just in case. The funeral was long and sad, so many people crying or angry. I couldn't find Rohwin, so I resolved myself to just sit through the remainder of the ceremony. When they were reading a list of the dead I saw a disturbance in the crowd after they called out Sullairia's name. A hooded figure was working his was out of the crowd, with many murmurs and grumbles as he forced a path. I couldn't see a face, but it must be Rohwin. I tried to work my way towards him and got my share of protests from the crowd. I did reach him as he nearly exited the back of the crowd. "I am sorry Rohwin," I said to the figure's back. He turned, and I stepped back when I saw his face. It was Rohwin, but he looked like he hadn't slept in days. His eyes held a fury that stopped my breath. His face was a sculpture of pain and anger. "Are you OK?" I asked. He had no response, he only stared from beneath the depths of his hood. I would have been surprised if his jaw was capable of moving. I wondered if he had been eating. He was pale except for his eyes, which were bloodshot. He looked much older now; he had the look of someone who had campaigned too long. "Sullairia gave me these for you," I said while holding out the letter and flower."</P>
<P align=left>"I have no need of such things," he said grimly. I was surprised to see him speak, not because his jaw moved like I had thought, but because his voice was so different. He spoke quietly, but I expect I could have heard him from a thousand paces. His voice was clear and direct, but lacked all emotion. His words did not speak of pain, more like suppressed pain. "Erollisi has taken my heart from my body. I don't know how I have wronged her, but she has taken away my capacity for love. I will prove to her that I do walk in the light. Maybe someday Erollisi will smile upon me again, but I know I will never find another like Sullairia." Then he turned to leave and walked away, disappearing into the city. </P>
<P align=left>"That was the last I ever saw of my boyhood friend." Said the old man. </P>
<P align=left>"What about the rest, his campaigns and stuff" said the young boy meekly.</P>
<P align=left>"I've heard rumors and stories about him, probably the same ones you've heard before." replied Demilin. "He never entered my tavern again and I never saw him at the temple. I asked the priests about him often, but they had little to say. I heard that he did very rarely return to the temple, but only to ask a few quick questions regarding swordplay or magic. The priests and trainers indulged him and tried to talk him into returning into the service of the temple, but he said he would serve in his own ways and would leave without a trace. Over the years I heard drunken tales from the patrons of my tavern. One man said he had witnessed Rohwin storm into a Dervish camp and single handedly cut them all down, when I pressed him for details his story quickly contradicted itself. He probably heard that I knew Rohwin and thought he could get a few free drinks if he told a high enough tale. Other rumors included Rohwin crusading against an army of the undead, and campaigns against the Deathfist and Crushbone Orcs. I even heard that he had joined a group of ruffians who called themselves "Knights of Freedom." The stories I heard were always third hand or worse and they could never be substantiated. The stories were just the fanciful words of drunken fools. Rohwin did go out and fight the enemies of the light, that much is certain. Feats of great heroism and the like are surely exaggerated. More likely they were great acts of foolishness that failed to kill him. There might be a little truth to the stories, but I don't believe the bulk of them. Rohwin is probably long dead, at the bottom of a dark dungeon or in a common grave with other forgotten souls after a senseless battle." The old man stared into the bottom of his empty cup and said nothing for several seconds.</P>
<P align=left>"I am tired, why don't you go outside and play with your friends." It sounded more like a command then a suggestion. The young boy was happy to oblige. The boy went to the door, but before he left he turned and said he was sorry for Rohwin. Then he ran out of the door to find his friends. The old man got up and made his way to the window. It was getting into late afternoon; the village was busy, but not crowded. His great-grandson found his friends and they pretended to slay each other much like he and Rohwin used to. An old man was pulling a cart down the street hawking his wares. He must have been a fletcher; his cart was full of bundles of arrows and a few bows. He looked older than Demilin. The fletcher's clothes were of fine quality, but were in disrepair. He walked with a heavy limp as he dragged his cart behind him. A young villager approached the fletcher and started negotiating over a fine oak bow. The young man handed over a bag of coin and the fletcher gave him a bow. They talked a little while longer then the villager walked off, looking eager to try out his new bow. The fletcher pulled his cart near to the children playing outside the old man's house. Then he approached the children playing and spoke with them briefly; he gave each of them a silver piece and left his cart where it was. He walked to the front door of the old man's house. Demilin watched him approach and opened the door for the fletcher. They looked at each other for a while, then without speaking he invited the limping fletcher into his home. He led the fletcher into the common room and seated him in his chair. Demilin got another cup off a short stack and filled it with dark stout from his cask and gave it to the fletcher. Then the old man went into his bedroom and retrieved an old, dusty, leather bound tome. He brought it back to the common room and sat opposite the fletcher. He undid the leather straps and opened the tome. He turned the tome around and held it out open before the fletcher. Between the pages were a letter and a dried flower, pressed flat and preserved for decades. The fletcher set down his cup and gently removed the letter and flower from the tome. The flower was so fragile; he took extra care not to destroy it. The flower had left an image of red and white on both the letter and the pages of the tome that had protected it for so long. He broke the wax seal on the letter and slowly opened it. He read the letter silently, and then he set it down by his cup. Rohwin looked at the flower for long moments, and then he closed his eyes and wept.</P>
