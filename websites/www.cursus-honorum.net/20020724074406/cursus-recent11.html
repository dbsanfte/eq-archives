<p align=left>I received a letter from a courier today. Its contents struck me somewhat peculiar:<br>
<br>
<br>
My Lord Rohwin,<br>
<br>
My name is Vivesanguine de Mortechair.  You will not have heard of me, undoubtedly, as I disappeared into relative obscurity many years ago.  Formerly, I was a paladin in the service of Tunare.  But that was a long time ago.   These days, by sheer force of will, I am merely a knight.  I do not follow the will of any god.<br>
<br>
I have recently learned of your association, Cursus Honorum, and wish to pledge myself to its cause.  Many of your goals are the same as mine.  I would like to work with you toward those.  Enclosed with this missive is a signed oath of fealty, should you accept it.  At the very least, I should like to meet with you, or one of your representatives.  We can have dinner, and perhaps, discuss things further.<br>
<br>
VdM<br>
<br>
<br>
I asked the courier about who sent this letter, but he knew very little. All he told me was that Lady Vivesanguine had given him two gold peices to deliver the letter. I have never heard of any noble family with the surname of Mortechair, but the courier used the term "Lady" quite clearly, she must have a strong pressence. I asked the courier to wait while I scribed a reply. I should like to speak with this faithless Paladin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well met Vivesanguine,<br>
<br>
I received your missive in good order. I have asked our scholars about your family name, but no one could recall the House of Mortchair. We can only conclude that it must have been completely destroyed along with many other townships during the Great War. Such a loss can cause doubt to ones faith, howsoever, I'm sure in time you will once again embrace Tunare. I would indeed like to speak with you further upon the topics at hand. A messenger will arrive for you soon to instruct you where we should meet.<br>
<br>
Journey well,<br>
<br>
Rohwin Amoure Ardour<br>
Regent of Cursus Honorum</p>
