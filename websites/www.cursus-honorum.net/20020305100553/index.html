<h3><u>Welcome to Cursus Honorum</u></h3>
			<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p align=left><i>Cursus Honorum</i> is a guild of brave adventurers who have made their home on the Brell Serilis server within the game of Everquest. <i>Cursus Honorum</i> is literally translated from latin as "Course of Honors." Romans used the term "Concursus Honorum" to describe a ladder of public appointments and elected positions that raised citizens closer to the Consulship. It was designed to show that individuals were truly dedicated to the public and not overly ambitious. The Romans considered honor among the highest virtues, and to serve the people truthfully a great honor. As a guild we have adopted the concept that the Romans held so dear. It is through guild participation and loyalty and honor that players are advanced within <i>Cursus Honorum</i>.</p>
<p align=left>We are a roleplaying guild that tries to emulate a hierarchy similar to medieval European feudalism. We have a simple point system to assign noble status to our members, such as Dukes, Earls, and Barons. The methods of earning points are based on guild participation. The more you do for the guild and your guildmates, then the higher your power within the guild will be.</p>
<p align=left>Our members maintain an active storyline while playing Everquest. We represent a collection of fighters and casters sworn to vanquish evil and restore peace to Norrath. Unfortunately, some classes, races, and religions will not be admitted into the guild, namely, those that are evil. We have many guild events that are for roleplaying. They may not be productive to the mechanical advancement of the game, such as gaining experience and loot, but they are wonderful for exploring our characters in a roleplaying fashion in the world of Everquest. Fear not however, we will also have many guild events that lay siege to our enemies strongholds. Raids against the evil of Norrath will be commonplace. Guild wars will not happen too frequently, but they will occur. When we do have a guild war it will be in the name of roleplay. We will be real life friends with our adversaries. Both sides will understand what roleplaying aspect the guild war is being fought over. There will be rules set up for each guild war that occurs, including when it will happen, if a particular battlefield is declared, and if there are any special objectives to complete. We will only fight with genuine roleplayers that understand the roleplaying that makes a guild war fun. Enjoy the wars when they happen, it will be a time to really roleplay our characters.</p>
<p align=left> A quality guild depends on quality players. The standards we have in Cursus Honorum should be conducive to generating a quality guild as well as growing and maintaining the highest standards of quality. The rules and regulations are largely complete and clear, hopefully there will be no need to amend them later. However, when changes or important decisions need to be made, the power of the guild lies within its members. The higher ranking members of the guild are given officer status and have voting power that shapes the way this guild funtions. If we all work together then we are destined to truly enjoy our time spent playing Everquest.</p>
<p align=left>So, if you are an avid Everquest player and a roleplayer, then click through these tomes of knowledge and learn how we function. If you feel we have something to offer you, then talk to us on-line or send us an E-mail. We will always be happy to recruit the best roleplayers of Norrath to join our ranks against the evil forces that be.</p><br>
