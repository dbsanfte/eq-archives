<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>Selio was orphaned at an early age because of his race. He does not know his parents, for it is assumed that his mother was ashamed of being with a human, and she was looked down upon by her peers for having a tainted child. He grew up in different Taverns around Freeport doing chores and such for a place to sleep and food to eat. As time passed, he developed an admiration of the bards and lore weavers that passed through. He heard about many foriegn and dazzling places, and he yearned to some day see these places for himself.<br>
<br>
He grew quit close to an aging human bard by the name of Tanis who settled down and spent the majority of his time in Freeport. Tanis taught Selio many aspects of a Bard. He taught him how to play instraments, use his voice in a way he has never before. He also taught Selio how to use the blade. Selio was in awe of Tanis's ability to wield a blade, one day he inquired as to how Tanis can Sing and Sworddance so well. When Tanis heard Selio's question, he grew grim in the face, and made Selio to never ask that question again. Selio, surprised at his teachers sudden change in mood, agreed.<br>
<br>
Time continued like this for awhile untill one day when he went in to Tanis's room to bring him his breakfast, he found Tanis gone with a note on his bed. The note read:<br>
<br>
<br>
"Selio, I am sorry for leaving you in this manner, but I know my time is drawing close to see Erollisi herself soon, and did not want to you to find my cold, lifless body in this cramped room. So I have departed, to spend my final days in a place unknown to you, so that I may clear a few things off of my conscious before I breathe no longer. I taught you all that you may comprehend at your age, and left you most of my personal equipment that I no longer need. The other items that are missing, I will need to finish my final Quest before I depart this world.<br>
<br>
I have watched to grow from a child, to a young man, and know you will use the skills and talents I have taught you to do Erollisi's bidding. You have seemed like a son to me, so I wish that you take my last name as well, Fiercesong. Before, you inquired as to how I can sing, and wield the blade so well. Now I believe you may know the truth.<br>
<br>
Many, many moons ago there was a viscious battle in Kithicor forest, where the vile Tier'Dal tried to expand the underground empire. It was a nasty and brutal battle, with many deaths. I took part in this battle, not to any pride. Before the battle took place, I was just a normal Harper, all I did was play and sing. I lended my songs to the good for the fight to come. As the battle raged, my cohort was flanked by an unseen enemy force, and when they attacked, half of ouf party was taken from us. I was forced to draw a blade, just to survive. I did not wish to, but if I did not, I would have passed long before you were ever thought of. I came to find out that wielding a blade came quite naturally to me. I was no Master at Arms, but I did hold my own during the battle. We eventually turned back the attackers, and regrouped with the main force of our allies. Most were surprised when they saw me hacking and slashing my enemies while I sang the chants of war. Some were shocked even. The Goddess Tunare witnessed my battle finesse, and saw what I added to our forces, what type of inspiration I gave. As it turned out, we won the battle, turning back to would-be invaders. After the battle, I was given the name Fiercesong by the survivors. Tunare, as a reward for assuming an unpleasant and unexpected role in the fight, granted me a long life, longer than almost all humans. I never gave my last name out, for many times after the battle, I was called upon to join a party or more in a task to vanquish evil somewhere. My name became too popular for my likes, I grew quit powerful with the blade, too powerful for a Trabadour. I did not like to take lives from people, but it had to be done. One day, I decided to just go incoginito, because I could not wield the blade against others any longer, so I settled in Freeport, and met you.<br>
<br>
Now you know my story, and why I never spoke of my last name when asked. I wish you the best in life, Selio, and if you follow the code that I taught you, the code only two people know of, I know you will make a name for yourself in the future, as is every bards dream. I must draw a close now, for you will be delieveing me my breakfast soon. Fair thee well Selio......"<br>
<br>
<br>
First at reading this, Selio was shocked. He did not know what to do. As time passed, diffen't emotions passed as well, anger, hate, sorrow, awe, mourning. He spent alittle while longer, trying to replace Tanis in the Tavern, but to no avail. NO one could replace Tanis. So he decided on a change of lifestyle. He decided to go out into the world, and see some of the sights he has only heard about.</p>
