<p><b>Xxaiver's Redemption</b></p>
<p align=left>While recouperating in Kaladim after the fighting in Unrest, Rohwin received a missive from Felwithe. A young Koada 'Dal man gave him a cursory bow and a letter sealed with the symbol of King Thex's royal guard. Rohwin dismissed the messenger then broke the seal and read the letter.<br>
<br><br>
The Mother's blessings embrace you, Rohwin Amoure Ardour, from Senior Sentry Jall'tal Embrine of the royal guard of his majesty King Thex of Felwithe. Your fearless deeds continue to serve the Mother, Faydark, and all of Norrath. May our good will towards each other make our combined efforts successful in all avenues.<br>
<br>
It has been brought to my attention that you have recently sheltered a young Koada'Dal man. While it is not uncommon for the wayward to seek you out for guidance and protection, I fear that I must warn you of this man named Xxaiver. He is none other then Xxaiver Kinslayer. He was to stand trial for the slayings of his parents and siblings before he evaded our royal guard and fled from Felwithe. We are certain that you would never harbor wanted criminals within your ranks knowingly. We would appreciate it if you would detain Xxaiver and deliver him to us so that justice may be served. A word of caution, he has studied the arcane arts for his foul purposes. He has the ability to alter his appearance to accomplish his dastardly deeds and will certainly be difficult to subdue unless no precaution is spared.<br>
<br>
We look forward to your expedient delivery. May your pursuits be victorious and worthy of high praise and may the Mother of all bless you and keep you.<br>
<br>
Your ally in arms,<br>
<br>
Jall'Tal Embrine<br>
Senior Sentry<br>
<br><br>
Rohwin clenched the letter in his hands as rage enveloped him. He remembered the day he welcomed Xxaiver among his ranks. He had seemed nothing more then a nervous young apprentice, but now he is exposed. He should look nervous with King Thex's royal guard looking for him. Xxaiver shall wish he turned himself in long ago by the time Rohwin is finished with him. Rohwin hastily wrote his orders to his ranking officers.<br>
<br><br>
To our honorable and valiant nobles of Cursus Honorum,<br>
<br>
A traitor has been found among us. Xxaiver Kinslayer is masquerading among our ranks as an obedient sevrant of the light. He is wanted in the courts of Felwithe for the brutal murders of his own family. Our relations with Felwithe are in need of strengthening. The sooner we can bring this man to justice the better Tunare will look upon us. For failure to do so may injure our relations with Felwithe beyond repair.<br>
<br>
Bertoxxulous has surely influcenced Xxaiver's will. Although his appearance does not seem overly dangerous, he is to be treated with the utmost caution. Bring Xxaiver before me in chains. Once he is safely in our custody we can deliver him to Felwithe and restore justice.<br>
<br>
May the Hammers provide justice for us all,<br>
<br>
Rohwin Amoure Ardour<br>
Regent of Cursus Honorum<br>
<br><br>
Rohwin took his letter to his scribe to be copied and ordered them to be sealed and delivered to all the members of the House of Lords. Rohwin paced around the room waiting for the scribe to finish the letters. He paid no attention when he turned and knocked over a vase on a small table. The scribe carefully penned each letter while Rohwin looked over him impatiently. Finally Rohwin could wait no longer. He stomped out of the room to return to his own quarters. Rohwin strapped his sword belt to his waist and donned his cloak on his back. He returned to the scribe briefly. "Sign my name to them when you have finished. If anyone is looking for me I'll be out looking for Xxaiver. I will return to Kaladim later." The scribe nodded aknowledgment and continued to write out the letters. Then Rohwin stepped quickly out of the room and headed for the countryside beyond Kaladim, in search of Xxaiver Kinslayer.<br>

Excerpt from Rohwin's diary, May 10th, 2001<br>
<br>
"Xxaiver proved to be very elusive. Few people could comment on his where-abouts. It would seem that someone had tipped him off that we had discovered his history. He cannot hide forever, but if we are to repair our standing with Felwithe then we need to find him soon. It was Baron Kolvaran that first brought Xxaiver to us. I think I shall seek him out to see if he knows where Xxaiver might be hiding. It has been proposed that perhaps Kolvaran himself might be hiding Xxaiver, I surely hope that is not the case, but I am prepared for that contingency. If Xxaiver Kinslayer cannot be found soon then I think our Prophet might be useful. Count Benedain might be able to seek him out more easily in the dreaming world then we can upon Norrath."<br>
<br>
Excerpt from Rohwin's diary, May 13th, 2001<br>
<br>
"Xxaiver had the courage to finally show his face. He walked through our encampment as if nothing were wrong. I stood before him and openly accused him of the heinous crimes that he was wanted for. At first he pretended to be surprised, but that facts came forth soon enough. He admitted that his family was murdered and that he was accused of the crime, but he continuously professed his innocence. I would hear nothing of it. The court of King Thex could decide whether or not he was guilty. I ordered Count Benedain to detain Xxaiver imeadiately. I was shocked when Benedain refused to. He said that the Hammers had given him a vision. The Hammers told him that we should not bring in Xxaiver for then justice would not be served. They spoke of one we must seek out to learn the truth, a young Fier'Dal man. He is known to frequent the taverns of Kelethin. His name is not known to us; Benedain could only describe him as a 'peppy wood elf guy.' After much deliberation, it was decided to allow Xxaiver to remain free for a short time. I took a huge gamble not arresting Xxaiver that day. If Felwithe ever discovers what I have done it may damage our favor with them beyond repair. I have always trusted Benedain's judgement, I can only pray to Erollisi that I have done the right thing today."</p>
