Greetings, good friends! Apologies for my absence, but a brief business trip
to Erudin to meet with Al'Kabor regarding the Vah-Shir turned into a somewhat
extended vacation upon tropical Kerra Isle. I was able to scribe 
some lovely images for you during my visit, I hope you enjoy them as much as
I enjoyed my trip.
<p>
For those of you who are unaware, Kerra Isle is a small ridge situated
off the west coast of Odus. Long ago, the Erudites fought a long and
bitter war with the Kerran cat-people, culminating in the unleashing
of magics so powerful, the Kerrans were nearly destroyed. The remains
of this battle can be seen today in the twisted ruins known as The
Hole.
<p>
Scholars have long wondered about the history of the Kerrans, but the
Erudites have been tight lipped about their dishonorable war. No suprise,
given their general attitude. Fortunately, the great Wizard Al'Kabor
maintains some sanity, and agreed to see me to discuss some of his 
latest findings.
<p>
Ancient texts found by Al'Kabor in the ruins of the Iksar city of
Kaesora suggest that the Kerran people were once known as the Vah-Shir,
a race descended from cats. Legends state that when the Erudites
eradicated the Vah-Shir, some of them escaped to Norrath's moon, Luclin.
Several of the runes and texts found by Al'Kabor suggest that magical
means exist to reach Luclin, hence my visit.
<p>
I left Al'Kabor's study and journeyed to Kerra Isle to speak with the
Kerrans to try and learn of their history, but it became quickly 
obvious that the shamanistic cats no longer posessed the memory of
their forebearers. Fortunately, the cats were kind to me, so I stayed
some time and enjoyed the tropical climate.

Here on the left you can see the foreboding entrance to the island. The 
defenses are strong, as the Kerrans constantly fear continued violence from
the Erudites. Whether war is again in their future, one cannot be sure,
but they continue to harbor ill will against each other to this day.
The sick tinge of the Toxxulia forest gives this whole area a feel of
decay, but the tunnel leads to a bright and clear tropical paradise.

On the right, a picture of Rrialli, a lovely woman who kept me well fed by
cooking all manner of treats. The cat women in general were very friendly, 
and equipped me with fishing implements while teaching me how to catch 
the elusive Kerran Catfish, a truly delectable morsel found only in Kerra
Bay, off the Abysmal Sea. This swimming was also wonderful, although
there were a few piranha to contend with.

Here's a fine sunset as the Kerrans prepared for a Luau to celebrate my
visit. Although they had never heard of me, they welcomed me with open 
arms. They were wary at first of my ties to Erudin, but after a few drinks 
and some tales of Erudite silliness, they warmed to me considerably.
They seem relatively indifferent to most visitors, but are quick to
trust those who show them kindness. I would not suggest entering Kerra
Isle, however, if you are of Erudite blood.

Before I left, I was summoned to visit the resident priestess of Kerra.
She was interested in the purpose of my visit, and we spoke at length.
She was quite interested in my knowledge of Kerran history, and requested
that I and my associates in Cursus Honorum endeavor to learn more of
the Kerran saga, and make our assistance when we can. In return, she
promised the goodwill of her people and all the catfish we can eat.

I hope you enjoyed the tale of my trip. It was a well needed vacation,
and I shall look forward to returning to your service when I arrive
in Freeport. Good journeys, my friends!
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Elyar Klennix, Wizard and Viceroy of Cursus Honorum
