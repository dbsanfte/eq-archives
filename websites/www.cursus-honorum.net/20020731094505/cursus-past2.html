<p><b>Discovery of Mistmoore</b></p>
<p align=left>Our garrison in Faydwer has not been heard from in far too long. The last two messengers sent to them have not returned. While searching for Xxaiver Kinslayer, Rohwin examined the countryside of Faydwer for the missing garrison as well. Rohwin spoke with many of the local Elves. The last reported location of the garrison was patroling the expansive forests of Faydark. Nobody could offer anymore clues, it seemed that they simply vanished.<br>
<br>
It was in the dark and remote depths of Lesser Faydark that Rohwin found his clues. There was evidence of a battle. A large patch of grass was churned into the mud. It was growing back, soon it would be very difficult to see that the ground had ever been disturbed. Bushes were trampled and low banches were broken on the surrounding trees. The battle was of a grand scale, much too large to be accounted for by the Orc presense here. It was too far from the Brownies to suspect them. There had to be another foe involved, but who else occupied this region. Any large armies marching through Faydark would surely been noticed by the Elves. Rohwin spied a shiney object sunk in the mud. He dug out a steel helm. After wiping it clean he recognized the crest of Mistmoore engraved upon it.<br>
<br>
Castle Mistmoore was rumored to have once ruled over Faydark ages ago. The Tier'Dal that occupied the castle preyed on anything that dared enter the forest. Eventually, the Koada'Dal and Fier'Dal declared all out war on their leader, Mayong Mistmoore, and defeated him. Very little is documented about the battle at castle Mistmoore that took place so long ago. There are no details regarding the Elven victory. All that is mentioned is that castle Mistmoore will no longer threaten the Elven cities. In these enlightened days, many don't believe it ever existed. Many rumors have been spread about Mistmoore. Some say it is nothing more than a scary story, others say the stronghold was completely obliterated, but the most prevalent rumors say that Mayong was never killed, but cursed. Mayong made a pact with Innoruuk. He traded his soul to defend his castle. Innoruuk cast out the attackers and turned Mayong and his minions into vampires. Their soulless bodies never die, but continue to commit atrocities on any who fall into their grasps.<br>
<br>
Stories decribe many details about Mistmoore, many of them writen in recent times, but there are ancient drawinings of Mistmoore's standard that looks very much like the crest on the helm that Rohwin found. It could either be a group of people trying to portray the ancient evil, or perhaps the rumors are true. What if Mistmoore still wields power in Faydark. However grim and remote the possibility, it could explain the scale of the battle that took place here, and possibly the disappearance of the garrison.<br>
<br>
Rohwin searched for anything that might lead him to where the army had marched to. He thought he saw a trail leading away, but it could have easily been the light playing tricks on him. Any path that the army left had been reclaimed by the forest. Rohwin followed his shadow of a trail and walked until he was unable to even imagine a path before him. The day was entering into twilight and Rohwin had no desire to be so far into the woods and night, so he decided to turn around and abandon his search when he saw a curious sight. A short distance away, the Fae Drake fluttered harmlessly in and around some old ruins. There was quite a number of them. The intensity of their colors made it easy to spot them. It seemed that they must have chosen this place for their breeding grounds. A wolf ran through the ruins, jumping and snapping at the Fae Drake. The Fae Drake flew in annoyed cirlces and dodged the persistent wolf. However, a flock of Fae Drake were frightened and flew off. The entire flock turned and flew directly into the hill side and vanished. It was so odd to Rohwin's perceptions that he had to investigate.<br>
<br>
The wolf scampered off at the sight of Rohwin. There was a crevice in the hill side that was very well hidden. It's contours and colors made it difficult to spot until you were nearly upon it, but once Rohwin stepped into the crevice it became hard for him to imagine how he could have ever missed it. It was a wide pass cutting through the hills and mountians that bordered Faydark. The pass was big enough to allow an army to march through without being hindered.<br>
<br>
Rohwin proceeded carefully into the pass. There were very few places that one could hide, but the sun was setting now and any observers would have a difficult time spotting anyone among the shadows. Rohwin made it through the pass without incident. The far side of the pass opened into a long ramp leading to a huge pocket within the mountains, with a small lake in the foreground and a large castle rising over it. It banners were torn and weathered, but the standard of Mistmoore could still be recognized. Rohwin observed scores of Tier'Dal marching in patrols and others peering from lookout posts. A stone Gargoyle made heavy beats with its wings and flew by magic to the base of a tower. Once there, it solidified and remained absolutly motionless. A female Tier'Dal, with skin so pale that virtually no indigo could be detected, walked on all fours. She hopped along like an animal and when the moonlight reflected off her eyes, they shone bright yellow.<br>
<br>
If Mistmoore was long dead, then it was back in full force now. Too many details matched legend and rumor. It was not certain that they were responsible for the garrison's disappearance, but all the evidence at hand pointed squarely at this vile place. Rohwin would have to return with armed men and women to further investigate this place. The threat of Mistmoore to Faydark had to be assessed, and evidence relating to the garrison had to be found. Rohwin sleathily made his way back through the pass. Then he began making preparations to lead an armed reconnaissance party back to castle Mistmoore.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>Our brave volunteers crept towards the castle in the calm cold night. The Tier'Dal sentries patroled in small parties. They did not seem to keep good watch over the pass. I doubt they expected anyone to find them. However, the volume of them would make it difficult to avoid detection. Benedain and Elyar conversed quietly then agreed on a plan for us. They cast their magic on us, allowing us not to be seen by the Tier'Dal, but we could all see each other. We would still need to step carefully. A broken twig or careless grunt could reveal us. We made slow advancement towards the castle. It was difficult to trust that we would not be seen, but the spells cast upon us worked without incident.<br>
<br>
The entrance to the castle looked too heavily guarded; we sought an alternate way inside. Overlooking the small lake near the castle was a tall tower. It was connected to the main part of the castle by a stone bridge. We decided to scale the walls to gain access to the tower. The climb was not too treacherous, Benedain's magic made us feel as light as air. Rohwin stepped onto the bridge first. He peer down its length each way; it seemed to be safe.<br>
<br>
 The others were starting to climb onto the bridge when a figure stepped from the darkness of the tower. A tall dark Tier'Dal woman stood with a leashed creature at her feet. The creature looked like a very pale Tier'Dal female, but it was hunched over on all fours and it snarled like a watchdog. The dark Tier'Dal released this creature and it lept at Rohwin. He swung wildly to beat back the ferocity of the creature, but he was completely vunerable to the attack spells of the dark Tier'Dal. Frost blasted through his armor and nearby guards from each side of the bridge rushed to join the fight. Rohwin took repeated hits from all sides, his armor held together, but he could not last long.<br>
<br>
The others in the party leaped onto the bridge to join the melee. The Tier'Dal were surpised by the reinforcments and one of their guards attempted to run away to raise the alarm. Kolvaran cut down the guard and quickly returned to the melee. Elyar took delight in casting against the dark Tier'Dal. The force of his spell sent her lifeless body sprawling into the interior of the tower. Without their magical support we finished off the remaining guards and the odd creature.<br>
<br>
We were exhausted after the fight. We heard no alarm and spied no patrols in our vicinity. It looked like we may be able to rest safely. If anyone found us now it would not go well for us. We piled the bodies into the dark recesses of the tower. The pale creature was already very cold and its wounds did not bleed. It must have been an undead creature.<br>
<br>
Rhone scouted ahead into the tower alone. No one else was here, but he found a platform that could be raised to an upper level. He reported back to us that no one else was in the tower, but there was a labratory of sorts that we should see. We followed him to the platform and were lifted to a large round chamber above. This room was a labratory, filled with flasks, glass tubes, and jars with unidentifiable things suspended in them. There was a table with a half finished experiment on it. There were several beakers with different colored fluids and a shallow bowl with a thick fluid the looked like blood. There was also an ornated dagger with fresh blood still glistening on the blade. The oddest thing was in the center of the room, two stones shaped like a stalagmite and a stalagtite positioned over each other with a translucent crystal hovering and spinning between them.<br>
<br>
Elyar pondered over the items in this room but could not make good logic from them. He scribbled rapidly in his journal for further study. Benedain cast his  sacred bones to the ground then shook his head. He said the powers here are too strong, the Hammers will not speak with him. We decided to wait for someone to return to this lab so we could capture and question them. We sat in the shadows as best we could and waited patiently for the sound of the creaking platform.<br>
<br>
It wasn't too long before the platform slowly decended away from the lab. We all crouched and were ready to pounce on who ever entered. We saw three Tier'Dal heads slowly rise into view. We waited for them to step off the platform before attacking. They saw us first and immeadiately drew their weapons. The two of them that wore armor charged us while the other channeled her magic. We met the charge head on and quickly took the advantage. Lightning flashed in the room and struck one of our men. Elyar responded in kind and lightning shot forth from his hands to strike the Tier'Dal caster. The two of them were locked into a contest of magic while the rest of our party bashed and cut down the Tier'Dal guards. The guards fell and Elyar bested the female caster. She had collapsed but was still alive. We questioned her aggressively, but she would not provide us any information. She would only say that Garton Viswin would come for us. This name concerned Elyar. He had heard of him, but until now he presumed he was dead. He told us that Garton was known for his terrible experiments on the living and dead alike. We can only speculate what the true purpose of his experiments were, but Elyar said that his atrocities were so horrible that the Tier'Dal forced him out of Neriak. However, this all happened long ago. He disappeared into obscurity and he is only known to those that delve into very old texts.<br>
<br>
The Tier'Dal said nothing more before she expired. We pondered how this threat would endanger Faydark and beyond when we heard commotion below us. People were shouting and bells began ringing. It would seem that someone found the bodies we had hidden. We were trapped in the tower. It was only a matter of time before they found us. Rohwin looked to Elyar for ideas, but he was too mentally exhausted to be of service. The Druid who was among us sat down and began to chat. Light formed around him and the room grew warmer. The platform began creaking its decent and we prepared to fight. Then the Druid grabbed the empty air before him and pulled open a seam of reality. He motioned us to step through the tear he had made. We nodded to each other and jumped through the opening one at a time. The Druid was the last to enter, with the opening snaping shut behind him.<br>
<br>
We found ourselves disoriented but well in Greater Faydark. We escaped the danger of Castle Mistmoore for now, but we knew we would face it again soon enough. The Druid pointed to the directions the Elven cities layed. Rohwin dismissed the party, saying that he would send word when help was needed again. We ran off in various directions to attend to our own business. Rohwin and Elyar ran towards Felwithe to alert King Thex of the new threat of Castle Mistmoore.</p>
