<p><b>Investigation into Runny Eye</b></p>
<p align=left>Troubles near Rivervale have worried the Halflings there. Tier'Dal presence in Kithicor Woods is unnerving to the Halflings and they have diverted much of their sheriffs and deputies to safeguard the east entrance to Rivervale. The Humans in Freeport have been unresponsive to pleas for assisstance with the Tier'Dal. The Runny Eye Citadel  has been reletivly dormant since Artillian liberated Rivervale more then ten years ago, however, recent events have the Halflings very concerned. Unknown activities within the citadel have been heard emanating throughout the peaceful woods of Misty Thicket. They fear that the Goblins are gearing up for war. They lack the resources to maintain their defenses against both the Tier'Dal and Clan Runny Eye. They have asked Cursus Honorum to investigate the status of the Runny Eye citadel and restore the security of Rivervale.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>Halfling deputies were in force, marching up and down along the wall in Misty Thicket Woods that protects their city. No Halflings could be spared to assist us, save for two that guided us to the entrance of Runny Eye before turning around. Grand Earl Kolvaran Angelborn led his squad of adventurer into the dark entrance. There was surprisingly no resistance as they slowly marched deeper and deeper inside.<br>
<br>
Kolvaran's party was gone for most of the day. No noise or other disturbances could be detected, there was only an eerie silence. The day was well into dusk when his party returned to Misty Thicket. They had a few sacks of trinkets to show what could be found inside. These items were not made by Clan Runny Eye; the style was distinctly different. The Citadel looked like it was being renovated or repaired. Tools, paints, lumber, and other materials were scattered around the hallways and chambers. It was difficult to tell if these items were in use or recently abandoned. When they came across a few Goblins they recieved the welcome they expected. Kolvaran was well prepared for the attack and the goblins fell quickly. The futher they went into the citadel the more Goblins they found. They looked like Clan Runny Eye Goblins, except for the style of clothing they wore and the items they carried. They managed to capture one that spoke broken common. They knew he spoke some common due to his oddly rhyming battle cry. Under questioning he would only say that the Pickclaws had finally liberated the citadel. Kolvaran wanted to take the Goblin with his party, but a small ambush distracted his party and the Goblin was allowed to escape. It was only a matter of time before the main alarm would be raised, and everyone agreed that the damp dark halls were becoming increasingly disturbing. Kolvaran decided that enough information was found, and he ordered the party to turn around and make their exit.<br>
<br>
The Halflings were very interested in Kolvaran's tale. They scrutinized of the items that were retrieved and talked amongst themselves. Then they asked if we could send word to Freeport that they would need help soon. They wanted a strong military pressence in the Commonlands to repress the Tier'Dal and they asked for supplies so that they could arm and train more of their people. Kolvaran agreed to send the message to Freeport personally. The Halflings thanked him energeticly, but there were worries behind their eyes.</p>
