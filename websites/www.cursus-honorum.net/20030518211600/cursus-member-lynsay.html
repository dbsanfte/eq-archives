<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>The young druid glances up at the unimposing villa, checking it against her 
memory. Yes, this is the place. With a distasteful glance at the city around 
her, she breathes shallowly through her mouth and walks up to the main doors. 
Feeling the eerie sense of deja vu she always has when following her dreams, 
she disdains the large knocker and raps delicated knuckles against the portal. 
A dull booming rings out, much louder than one would expect from her 
diminuative form. A human female answers the door, quite tall. The druid 
smiles wryly. Of course, all humans seemed tall to her. Looking slightly 
confused, the human asked if she needed anything. Setting her tiny shoulders 
and somehow managing to look down her nose at the human despite the size 
disparity, she calmly and with great confidence says, "I am here to join you. 
We are to be companions."<br>
<br>
Falling silent, she waits for the inevitable incredulous response. The human 
merely nods and beckons her inside.<br>
<br>
"Your name?"<br>
<br>
Impressed with the stability of this human, she nonetheless grins in 
anticipation. "My name is Lynsay, my dear Wintry." She cocks an eyebrow and 
awaits Wintry's reaction.<br>
<br>
Suddenly nonplussed, Wintry stutters but quickly recovers. "V..Very well 
Lynsay, I will announce you to the Lord Regent."<br>
<br>
Sighing at the necessary formalities, she lets the Regent speak on his 
organization's goals and beliefs. Knowing this already from her dreams and 
research, she reassures him of their compatible natures. Though young in 
body, her spirit is that of her druidic ancestors. The wisdom of generations 
comes to her in dreams, in knowledge, and in a few select females of her line 
that existed as memory inside her. The eternal fight against the dark...it is 
hers, in a way that few can comprehend. Perhaps this group would be able to, 
perhaps. No matter, she was intended to be here. All of her being said so, 
and Wintry was the focus of that. Somehow. Realizing her interview was 
coming to a close, she returned her full attention to the Regent.<br>
<br>
"...will consider your petition and will be in contact with you regarding my 
decision."<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Lord Regent. Wintry will know where to contact me." Leaving him 
with a slightly confused look she walks out, stopping only briefly to drop a 
piece of pounded bark with an address into Wintry's hand.</p>
