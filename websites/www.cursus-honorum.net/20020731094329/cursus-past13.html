<p><b>The Search within Runny Eye Citadel</b></p>
<p align=left>A missive from Rohwin to the loyal nobles of Cursus Honorum...<br>
<br>
We are ever closer to solving this puzzle presented to us by Lladarie. However, there seems to be much debate over the information provided by Reston, not to mention the quality of the source. I have traveled to Rivervale and inquired about a "Captain Bosec", but they have not heard of him. However, they did express concerns over the security of the Runny Eye Citadel.<br>
<br>
The Teir'Dal have been appling more and more pressure on Halfling territories in Kithicor woods. Freeport has offered little or no assistance to Rivervale. Human relations with the Teir'Dal have calmed for the time being, but Freeport has been getting increased Orc and Troll activity to the south. As a result they have pulled resources from the commonlands thus allowing the Teir'Dal a greater advantage against Rivervale.<br>
<br>
I have agreed to help Rivervale suppress the threats of Runny Eye. It will strengthen our alliance with the Halflings as well as provide an opportunity to investigate the clues provided by Reston.<br>
<br>
I call for all able-bodied people to gather in Rivervale. We shall form into squads and venture into Runny Eye to seek our answers. Those of lesser experience will remain near the surface, and those of greater experience shall travel deep into its caves. The dangers inside will not be slight, but so long as we remain true to our faith, then we will prevail.<br>
<br>
May the light guide us to our answers,<br>
<br>
Rohwin Amoure Ardour<br>
Regent of Cursus Honorum</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p align=left>While militarily successful, the search within Runny Eye Citadel proved unfruitful. We found no messages, nor any indication that the Teir'Dal are aligned with the Goblins there. Our mission was not in vain though. We found the Citadel lightly defended, which enabled us to penatrate deep into its recesses without discovery. When we chose to strike we caught them off-guard in sensitive areas. As it turned out, the bulk of their forces were away on an escort mission to bring in arms and other supplies. They were preparing for an invasion of Rivervale, just as the Halflings had suspected. However, when news of our presence came to them they mistakingly thought we comprised an all out siege on their Citadel. They diverted the majority of their forces back to stop us. This left their supply caravan vulnerable, and enabled the Halflings to decimate it. We managed to exit the Citadel before their reinforcements could arrive. The Halflings were very pleased with our efforts that day. If war has not been averted, then it has at least been delayed for a time. I see an even stronger alliance in our future, but we are no closer to solving the puzzle that brought us there. Lady Vivesanguine believes the answers are to be found in High Hold Keep. I pray that she is correct, for I fear that if we don't solve Lladarie's clue soon we will miss out on a critical advantage.</p>
