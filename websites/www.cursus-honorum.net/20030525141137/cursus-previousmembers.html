				<p align=left>Below are lists of three kinds of people. First is the list of previous members who left with honor. They are not honorary members unless listed on the honorary members list. Next are those who left without honor. They cannot be readmitted into the guild without High-Council approval. Last is the black list. The few people in Norrath that we cannot tolerate.</p>

<p><b>Members who left with honor</b></p>
<p align=left>These people are simply members that have left the guild without ill will or controversial circumstances. Names in red indicate members that left the guild before their probation was completed. If a previous members wants to rejoin the guild then they may apply like normal initiates, except that no recruitment points will be awarded because the point for them is already in the system. The exception is for members who left before their probation was up, then normal recruitment points would apply.</P><use font 880000>

<p><b>Black list</b></p>
<p align=left>The people on this list have never been members of the guild but are those that have truely offended the fair players of Everquest. These are the kill stealers, professional farmers, and hopeless idiots. They are not recomended for any grouping and can not join the guild. If they redeam themselves later, only a vote of the High-Council can remove them from the list.</p>
<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=6 cellspacing=2>
		<tr align=center><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Offense</b></td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Gizzmoe</td><td align=left>Rohwin witnessed this Gnome caster willfully and openly kill stealing from a group of adventurers camping the Orcs in Highhold pass.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Tirtle</td><td align=left>Rohwin observed this Dwarven warrior repeatedly take dervish cut throats away from a long standing group in the western commonlands. He totaly ignored all pleas from the rightful group and even disregarded invatation into the group in favor of continuing his plunder of kill stealing.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Calian</td><td align=left>This female Wood Elf druid was Tirtle's partner in crime. She was with Tirtle during his kill stealing efforts and also ignored all pleas from the surrounding people.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Arlynda</td><td align=left>Rohwin was grouped with this Wood Elf druid in the eastern wastes of Velious. It was decided that everyone in the group should receive some loot of worth. Once you received some loot then you would not roll for any further loot until everyone got something. Arlynda had already won a Ry'Gorr bracer, but when she looted Ry'Gorr leggings she felt that she deserved them, even though there were two others in the group who had yet to receive anything. While arguing why she should get the leggings, she suddenly needed to camp and gated out.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Loradandal</td><td align=left>Eternum was asked to sell some very expensive items for Loradandal, then she would be allowed to keep any extra money. She had no success selling the items and traded them amongst several people through out the course of the day in the hopes of acquiring more sellable items and perhaps earning even more money. When Loradandal returned to see how she was doing he was furious over the trades, he claimed that the value of the new items were worth about half of what he had given her (which is highly disputable). For his losses he demanded that she hand over all her belongings. She was confused and upset over the matter and complied. Eternum gave Loralandal everything she owned, including her banked items and money, all she was allowed to keep was a backpack and some food. Regardless of the outcome of the trading, Loralandal had no right to ask for her life's savings as payment. She did not intend any wrong doing and was terribly upset over his accusations.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Luchang</td><td align=left>While waiting for a raid into the Hole to gather, Luchang consistantly interfered with the group that had been camping the entrance. He ignored repeated pleas from the group to stop. Then he proceded to sit on the spawn point of the Rock Golem for the express purpose of kill stealing it from the group by claiming that it hit him first and he was only defending himself. His blatant disrespect for other players has earned him a place on our blacklist.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Eteocles/<br>Lothiel</td><td align=left>Eteocles premeditated and willfully executed a plan to ninja-loot a pair of Donal's boots for his alt named Lothiel. Rohwin was invited to his group in Karnor's Castle where he said that we were going after the Warlord. A short while latter he said that he had a friend bringing the Warlord to us near the zone. The group was ill-prepared for this fight, for there was little warning of the incoming Warlord, no one was properly buffed nor were mana checks made. A very tough fight ensued and after repeated summonings, Rohwin fell to the Warlord. Then the group finished off the Warlord and Eteocles looted a pair of Donal's boots. Rohwin commented that it was a shame that we did not have a Cleric among us, and Eteocles said that we did. He claimed his alt to be a 60 Cleric named Lothiel, and the only peice of Donal's armor he was missing were the boots. The group disbanded and no attempts were made to roll for the boots. Rohwin asked Eceocles if we had grouped for the express reason of farming him some boots. He replied, "No, we grouped for experience and happened to get some boots." Eceocles told Rohwin to ask a particular Cleric in Karnor's for a ressurection, which Rohwin did, but the Cleric replied that he was too busy. Then Rohwin asked Eceocles if his alt Cleric could provide ressurection, but Eceocles replied that he too had died and he was looking for a ressurection for himself first. So Rohwin made the run back to Karnor's and was lucky enough to get a ressurection from a groupmate of a friend. Once Eteocles had recovered his body to the zone Rohwin suggested that we could now roll for the boots. Eteocles refused to roll, claiming that we had agreed ahead of time that the function of the group was to get him the boots. A quarrel followed, which accomplished nothing other then underscoring Eceoles selffish behavior. For his blatant disregard for others, lying, and ninja-looting, Eceocles and his alt Lothiel have earned a place on our blacklist.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Dubmasta</td><td align=left>Reston witnessed this character training numerous creatures onto his party in Paludal Caverns. After Dubmasta died in the commotion, he returned to his body and accused Reston's group of training him and killing him to steal his camp. To make himself look even sillier he accented his arguement with misspelled profanity. Dubmasta has earned a spot on our blacklist for extreme immaturity and a low grasp of reality.</td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Katrakis</td><td align=left>After repeated complaints from different guild members and different times, this Iksar Monk has earned place on our blacklist for being immature, rude, and vulgar. </td></tr>
		<tr align=center><td>Qumdaan</td><td align=left>This high level mage trained a party of low level adventurers on the first floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. It was unclear if it was intentional or through idiocy, but his behavior shortly there after was compeltely out of line. He held no remorse of causing the deaths of several people and when the party talked to him he became very defensive. Then in an effort to make things right he offered the group somewhere on the order of 30 plat and a fine steel weapon. After the group refused the pointess buy-out *boggle*, he gave the /rude animation and said he "tried" but the party wouldn't cooperate. His guild was the Legion of the Chosen, and after complaining to their officers, they said that they have recieved many complaints over Qumdaan. However, to my knowledge no action was taken against him so now he resides on our blacklist.</td></tr>
