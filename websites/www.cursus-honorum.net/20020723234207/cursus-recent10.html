<p align=left>While in Felwithe on business, I happened to speak with an elderly man fishing in the lake. His name was Tolkar, and he seemed quite distressed. He was upset over his missing daughter. She went out to see the world and has not returned. He fears the worst, but will not give up hope while there remains a possibility of her survival. When he learned who I was, he became excited. He had heard what Cursus Honorum had done for General Alderelm's daughter and he asked if I could do the same for him. I could not refuse any such request, but the problem was I had no idea where she was, nor could I begin an intensive search of all of Norrath. He then offered more information, the last known place she was seen in was the Lavastorm mountains. This sparked my interest, because I have heard rumors about the ruins of a stronghold near there called Najena. Najena is known to be abandoned, save for a few bandits who stash their loot there and perhaps the occasional traveller who wishes to avoid heavy weather. Howsoever, I have heard recent rumors that say some powerful and evil magic is growing there. The local Lords and Ladies of the region say that only a few bandits inhabit the ruins and they are growing more bold, but it is nothing to fret over. Yet these rumors persist in the close villages and even in the streets of nearby cities. It is possible that Tolkar's daughter has been overpowered by the inhabitants of Najena and imprisoned, and with the increasing rumors about that place, it is warranted to explore these gloomy ruins. I will send word to those loyal to me who are available, to search for the daughter of Tolkar and unveil the secrets of Najena. If proof of her imprisonment can be presented to me, then Cursus Honorum shall commit itself to freeing her and ridding Najena of evil.</p>
