<p><b>Investigation of Solusek's Eye</b></p>
<p align=left>The magic of Norrath is very powerful, but most of the ancient knowledge has been lost. Small clues are uncovered from time to time, but for every question answered a score more come forth. The active volcanos in Lavastorm Mountains have burnt and melted intricate tunnels into the rock. One collection of these tunnels is known as Solusek's Eye. It is rumored that many secrets of the arcane arts are to be found there. However, it is well guarded. Fire Goblins have established themselves inside the caves. They are using the deep tunnels to gain easier access to the precious metals and jewels trapped in the rock. To make matters worse, they have employeed Gnomish miners to help them extract their treasures. The gnomes are unusally loyal to their employers, and will assist in defending their mines. Artillian was heavily criticized by Ak'Anon when he did not discriminate Gnomes from Goblins while searching these caves several years ago.<br>
<br>
Elyar is organizing an expedition to venture into Solusek's Eye. He hopes to discover greater understanding of the magical properties of fire. There are also rare metals and gems that will greatly assist our war efforts. We will attempt to reason with the Gnomes there, but if they choose to remain loyal to the Goblins then we will be forced to fight them if they offer resistance. This operation will be conducted as quietly as possible to avoid any diplomatic incidents with Ak'Anon. The loses of those who resist will be regretable, but the knowledge and treasures trapped in Solusek's Eye are critical to the war against evil, and we must think of the greater good of Norrath.</p>
<p>OOC details</p>
<p align=left>The raid in Sol A will begin at 6pm PDT on Wednesday June 20th. Levels 20+ will be eligable for points. Elyar will be availble for ports prior to the raid. Please refer to his thread in the general discussion forum called "Help Wanted - Solusek A raid!" for more details, comments, and/or questions.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>Our covert operations in the mines of Solusek's Eye were, unfortunately,
not as covert as we might have liked. Initially, I had planned to lead
a small team deep into the mines to retrieve some magical items that
I require for my research, but we were quickly beset upon by hordes
of goblins. These goblins bore a remarkable resemblance to the picklaw
goblins which infest HighHold Keep, although they appeared to be allied
with the gnomish miners and clockwork mining machines employed in the
mines.<br>
<br>
Once our team discovered the extent of the goblin presence in the mines,
a messenger was sent out to bring forth the guard of the Cursus Honorum
to distract the goblins, while a small team snuck deeper into the caves
in search of precious minerals, metals, and relics for my research.
The guard was able to penetrate and hold a large portion of the upper 
caves, thanks to the unflagging efforts of Regent Ardour and squad leader
Lady Splendor. Alas, the goblins (or perhaps their gnomish
allies) had secreted away many of the items we saught once they learned
of our plans, although we did manage to relieve them of some rather 
nice looking goods.<br>
<br>
The speed at which the goblins set upon us and their seeming cooperation 
with the gnomish miners makes me wonder if they had somehow been tipped
off to our secret offensive... I will have to consult with Vice Regent
Benedain to see if he can scry any insight into this matter.<br>
