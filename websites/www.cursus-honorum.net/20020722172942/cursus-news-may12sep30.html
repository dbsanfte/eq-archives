<p align=left>Thanks to everyone who attended the raid in Mistmoore. We took more casualties then we would have liked, but I think everyone had at least a positive net gain. Everyone I talked to said they had a good time, so it is safe to call the raid a success. Special thanks to Safphires for the services he provided and the hardships he endured. His actions that day earned him the Shield of Nobility.<br>
<br>
Also, a low level raid and quest has been set for Saturday, October 13th. Please read the quests and events page for more details.<br>

<p align=left>Congratulations to Canoni for earning an award. He came to the aid of Safphires while adventuring in Lesser Faydark. Canoni engaged a very formidable Brownie scout that had set upon Saphires. Canoni's selfless act and actions of past have earned him the Sword of Valor.<br>

<p align=left>Congratulations to our newest member, Watz. He is a human warrior of 24 seasons. Welcome to Cursus Honorum Watz.<br>
<br>
I would also like to say that the role player's ball held on September 15th was fun. There was decent turnout of about 20+ players at any given time. A variety of guilds were present, most notably the Order of Elder Dragons and Violent Harvest. At times it was difficult to understand everything that was going on, due to so many messages, but it was clear that some guilds had previous roleplaying scenarios in place. I look forward to the next one, and I encourage everyone to attend one as well. Hopefully, next time we will have a more active role.<br>
<br>
Last thing, as a reminder or a notice if you aren't already aware, Elyar is hosting a raid in Mistmoore on the 29th. This will be an official guild raid. See his forum post for more details.<br>
<br>
Travel well everyone,<br>

I hope your times with us are enjoyable and beneficial for everyone. Also, I would like to congratulate our new Vice-Regent Benedain, and Marymary has returned to the High-Council.<br>

<p align=left>Congratulations to Marymary for earning the Shield of Nobility for her actions on August 26, 2001. She came to the aid of a group of adventurers (one of them yours truly) who needed to recover six bodies in the depths of Kaesora. She made it possible for two unarmored and poorly equipped fighters to fight their way past the spiders (some of which see invisible) and into the undead section of the dungeon. Then with the cloak of invisibility to undead, she escorted the fighters to the bodies and proceded to resuscitate them all.<br>
<br>
Also, Daurkean has initiated a quest. You can read about it on the "Quests and Events" page or in the message forum.<br>
<br>
I would also like to remind everyone that if you have any character updates, including pictures, stories, or level updates, then please mail them to me so I can update the web-site. Journey safely everyone.<br>

<p align=left>The raid in Unrest went very well. Many people in the groups dinged twice while they were there. Special thanks to the guild "Solus", who participated in the raid. They are a guild of good role-players. I highly recommend seeking them out if you are ever looking for more people.<br>

<p align=left>Welcome to our newest member, Safphires Goldenleaf, a 40 Wood Elf Ranger. With Safphires addition the Rangers have formed their own branch of power. Also, congratulations to Kolvaran for being the first to finish the quest of Xxaiver's redemption. Our next raid will be in Unrest on Saturday the 18th, starting at 12 noon PDT. Please read the "forum" and "Quests and Events" page for more details. Keep Safe.<br>

As a result of their union Dacia is now listed as an honorary member and will share her husband's title. Congratulations you two, may Erollisi provide you love and happiness forever.<br>

Welcome to our newest members. Vivik has the distinction of being our first Rogue as well as our first Gnome and greetings to Kazgroth who is also a Rogue. May your journeys with us be pleasant ones.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Elyar who has become our new Vice-Regent. May your services to the guild continue to be a great asset.<br>

<p align=left>Congratulation to Kolvaran. He has completed his Soulfire quest. He now wields the flaming holy sword in his never ending pursuit for rightousness. Also, Kolvaran and Dacia have set the date of their wedding for June 24th, 5pm PDT. It will be held at the waterfalls in East Karana. Follow the river south from the wooden bridge and you will find the falls. Everyone is encouraged to attend, hope to see you all there.<br>

<p align=left>Gragar has joined the ranks of Cursus Honorum. He is a 14 Barbarrian Shaman. I'm sure we will all enjoy our times together.<br>
<br>
Also, our next official raid will be in Sol A on Wednesday, June 20th. Elyar will be hosting the raid. Please direct comments or questions to his thread on the general discussion forum - "Help wanted - Solusek A raid!" Levels 20 and higher will be welcome to attend. High 30's and beyond will see very little experience, if any, but they are welcome to help run the event. The raid is scheduled to begin at 6:00pm PDT, but Elyar will be on-line earlier to port people in as necessary.<br>

		<p>June 13, 2001</p>
<p align=left>A warm welcome to our newest members. Splendor is a 19 Cleric of Tunare and Avekin is 10 Cleric, also of Tunare. I'm sure their contributions will be welcomed by everyone.<br>
<br>
Also, the High-Council has voted on some new rules.<br> 
<br>
First, it has been determined that Rogues will be allowed to join our ranks. Their skills in clandestine operations will be a valuable asset. Those that act with nobility and hold the greater good of Norrath dear will be considered for invites.<br>
<br>
Second, reformed Tier'dal will also be allowed to join us. Those that can prove to us that they walk in the light will be treated as equals. In addition to the regular inviting procedure, we will require that Tier'Dal offer a written account of their past that justifies why they prefer to leave their kindred behind and follow our banner.<br> 
<br>
Those who still follow evil deities are not yet allowed into our guild. However, the discusion continues on the subject of redeemed minions of Innoruuk and the like. If it is truly possible for previous minions of Innoruuk to forsake their past and join our cause, then it may be possible for those who study the arts of Necromancy and the Shadowknights to join us. I see a grand oportunity to study this question. Please read the post by Sendariu L'Vol in the general discussion board. Speak with her and judge for yourselves if we can ally with her, then post your thoughts so that we all may know. It is logical to think that intelligent beings will understand that our cause is rightous, and that they would choose to support us. Erollisi demands that we judge her with our hearts, not with our eyes.<br> 
<br>
We will be accepting applications from rogues and most Tier'Dal currently. I am in the process of updating the web-site, until it is finished please make any corrections to applications in the "other comments" box.<br>

<p align=left>The High Council has voted on some rule changes. The ban against twinking has been lifted. We still encourage people to earn their own equipment, but everyone may play as they see fit. After all, only you can decide if you are having fun with EQ. The new rule in the "Code of Nobility" is as follows:<br>
<br>
7.	We discourage twinking, but you may play your characters any way you see fit. Use your own judgement on what is acceptable twinking. Also, it is not the funtion of this guild to twink its own members. No one will ever be obligated to give away equipment, or to sell at extremely good deals. Please do not ask your guildmates for free equipment. Remember, it is much more rewarding if characters earns their bounty on their own. Twinking is hard to define, but I have written an <a href="cursus-twinking.html">editorial</a> that attempts to define twinking. I hope it helps.<br>
<br>
Also, the "message of the day" has new rules. It has been added to the "Code of Nobility" as such:<br>
<br>
16. The "message of the day" is reserved for the Regent and Vice-Regent only. Also, it should only be used to notify the guild of important matters of concern to everyone. The only exception is if there is an emergency situation where the guild needs to be informed in less then 24 hours, then any officer may post a "message of the day."<br>
<br>
Journey safely everyone,<br>

					<p align=left>It is always sad to see someone leave, but alas these things will occur. Magia has decided to leave Cursus Honorum for another guild run by her old friends. There she will find more guildmates of her level and will be better able to accomplish the things in the game that she must. All is not too sad however, her minstral, Weaverofsong, will be remaining with us to sing songs of heros and glory. Magnia will be listed among our honorary members. Best of luck to you Magnia.<br>

					<p><b>Wedding Anouncement</b></p>
					<p align=left>Viscount Kolvaran proposed marriage today to his beloved Dacia. She has accepted his invitation and they have made plans to be wed this Friday, June 1st. It will take place by the waterfalls in East Karana at 7:00pm Pacific Daylight Savings. Everyone is welcome to attend. Jezeb will be presiding over the ceremony. Kolvaran's proposal took place shortly after taking down Sir Lucan for his Soulfire quest. Congratulations Kolvaran on two accounts.<br>
<br>

<p>News amendment</p>
<p align=left>Kolvaran will need to be out of town on his wedding day, so it is being rescheduled. I'll post the new date as soon as it is known.</p>

				<p>May 26, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>Greetings to our newest member, Wuflaven. He is a 39 Dwarven Warrior. His dedication to Brell and to vanquishing evil will be an asset to us all. Also, Kolvaran will be attempting to remove the oppresive Sir Lucan from power on Saturday (today) at 7:00pm pacific. Join in the fight, or just watch the bloodshed, it should prove entertaining.<br>

				<p>May 25, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>Greetings Lords and Ladies. Our High Templar Kolvaran is calling for assistance. He is attempting to finish his quest for Soulfire. All that he has left is to retrieve the glowing hilt from Mistmoore and the testimony from Sir Lucan in Freeport. He is organizing his efforts on the Knights of Freedom message board. If anyone would like to help him then please visit the <a href="http://www.spyhunter1.com/kof">Knights of Freedom</a> website and go to their "Roundtable." Then go to the "LFG" catagory to find Kolvaran's message. The glowing hilt comes from a level 40 troll shadow knight; I recommend being at least level 35 to camp his room safely. Sir Lucan is level 48; I recommend being at least level 40 to participate. A word of warning, killing Sir Lucan will make you KoS to the Freeport militia in West and East Freeport. Kolvaran will greatly appreciate any assistance you can offer. Which reminds me, I too need the testimony for my own Soulfire. At some point in the future I'm sure you will hear me asking for assistance too. Take care everyone.<br>
<br>
Rohwin</p>

				<p>May 22, 2001</p>
					<p align=left>Warm welcomes to our newest members, Nicklasy, Weaverofsong, and Selio. With their additions to our guild another branch of power has been formed. Canoni has been promoted to the House of Lords to lead the warriors/rangers/monks/bards branch. On a seperate note, the raid in Mistmoore went well. We only had one full group, but we did manage to take the tower with the help of Pathfinder Rhone. Many people had prior real life commitments so the raid only lasted a couple hours. Raids will be better when our ranks grow more. I encourage everyone to keep an eye out for potential members. Just remember, never sacrifice quality for quantity. May Erollisi watch over you.<br>
