<p><b><u>Quests and Events</u></b></p>
			<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p align=left>The Quests and Events are divided into five sections. First is upcoming events. These may be scheduled raids, roleplaying events, or guild wars. Second, is <a href="cursus-pastevents.html">past events</a>. These are the archived results of any guild event. Third, is <a href="cursus-recenthistory.html">recent history</a> of Cursus Honorum. When roleplaying events add to our story line, then they will be recorded here. Forth, is <a href="cursus-quests.html">quest</a> information. When you have accomplished a quest within the game, if you wish, you may write an article describing how your guild mates might follow in your footsteps. It is nice to have quest information on our own web-site because we know that information from our guildmates is acurate. If we depend on each other then we will not need to visit sites like everlore for their highly questionable information. Lastly, are <a href="cursus-stories.html">stories</a> writen by our members. These stories are the histories of our various members and the true or fictional accounts of our experiences in Norrath. Upcoming events will be displayed on this page. However, the other four sections will have seperate pages to divide the bulk of information.</p>

<p><b>Upcoming Events</b></p>
<p align=left>Here are the guild events that are in the near future. Events will include, raids, roleplaying events, guild wars, and similar guild activities. For any guild event to be offical, it must be recorded here. Impromtu events will not earn players political points, save points for personal valor if it is reported and witnessed. Once an event has passed, then it will be moved to the past events page along with its results.</p>

<p><b>Lladarie's puzzling clue</b></p>
<p align=left>We questioned Lladarie intensely about the events she took part of in Crushbone on October 14th, 01. She did say that her abductors from Castle Mistmoore also wanted information about her mission in Crushbone, but Lladarie truly did not recall any information of importance. Luckily for her, we rescued her before the agents of Mistmoore had time to use more effective methods of extracting information. We could not fathom why Mistmoore was interested in Crushbone's affairs. Then a revelation struck Lladarie. It was not information about Crushbone that was important, it was information about Neriak. She retold a story that she had heard from Platicia Alderelm while in Crushbone.<br>
<br>
Platicia had said that some Teir'Dal were present in crushbone, in particular Ambassador D'Vinn. Sometimes D'Vinn would sit across from her and gaze upon her, many times for hours on end. He would never speak to Platicia, he would only sit in the dark corner and stare. As disturbing as this was to hear, it was not a clue we could act on. However, D'Vinn had a companion that would visit him on occasion, a female Teir'Dal. She would ignore Platicia completely. She would walk in and address D'Vinn in the Teir'Dal language. The two of them would speak openly in front of Platicia. Either they were not aware that the general's daughter was schooled in the Teir'Dal language, or mayhaps they did not care. The things they talked about were of no relevance to us, but Lladarie now remembered one statement that may be important. D'Vinn's companion did say that she would leave an official message to their followers across the serpent's spine.<br>
<br>
Could this statement be what everone was looking for? It seemed unlikely, but it is the only thing that has risen any interest among us. We knew that Crushbone, Neriak, and Mistmoore were taking this matter very seriously. This must be a vital clue. We shall analyze this information as thoroughly as we can. Perhaps if we can solve the meaning of this clue we will gain advantage over Neriak.<br>
<br>
Vice-Regent Elyar has offered to bring this information before the Felwithe council in the hopes that their resources may shed more light on the matter. It was also brought to our attention that Mistmoore will still be seeking this information. Lladarie is still in danger, and for that matter, so are those of us that retrieved her from Mistmoore. Even though we slew all who engaged us, we must asume that others saw us and maybe recognized some us. We will all be more careful in the times ahead.</p>

<p><b>Longing for Jezeb</b></p>
<p><b>Note: This quest has been completed twice so far, but I will continue to offer the reward one more time. -Rohwin</b></p>
<p align=left>A letter has been sent to the nobles of Cursus Honorum from Regent Rohwin Amoure Ardour...<br>
<br>
<br>
Fondest wishes are sent to you, the nobles of Cursus Honorum, may Erollisi provide all that you will ever need, from Regent Rohwin Amoure Ardour, the keeper of Artillian's rightful place.<br>
<br>
Our military victories are certainly something to rejoice over, yet I have not felt such uplifting spirits as of late. It has been too long since I have seen my beloved wife, Lady Jezeb Amoure Ardour. She has been serving as our liaison to the Knight of Freedom. Their expeditions have kept her far away, too far for any correspondence. I have asked their officers of her whereabouts, but they told me that the missions she was accompanying were delicate, and I could not be told where she was for her own safety and the safety of the Knights of Freedom.<br>
<br>
Please seek her out, I must know that she is well. She could be anywhere on Norrath. If you can find her, then please tell her that I miss her dearly, and if you could deliver a flower to her, then you would earn my gratitude. I patiently await your news from abroad.<br>
<br>
May Erollisi guide you,<br>
<br>
Rohwin Amoure Ardour
Regent of Cursus Honorum</p>
