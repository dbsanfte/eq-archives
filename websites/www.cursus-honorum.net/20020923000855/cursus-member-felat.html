<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>I was birthed in Rivervale by me Mama and Pappy 
Taggelfoot. They are wonderful parents and 
raised me proper and humble. Me heritage folk 
were corn growers for many generations. Me 
parents still live on the corn farm in Rivervale.<br>
<br>
Schooling wasn't a big concern in my house so I 
took it upon myself to go to the library at a 
young age and be lessoned in reading and 
writing. It wasn't really a library then. It was 
just a shack where old hermit lady boobybop 
lived. She kept a book shelf with about 337 
books on it. She taught me the reading and 
writing mostly because she wanted someone to 
talk too. Me pappy called it a fruitless waste 
of good time, however I kept learning. Me 
brothers and sisters made fun of me for it and I 
was kinda considered a trouble maker by the 
towns folk for not listening to me Pappy and 
helping more with the corn. I think me Mama 
secretly liked me learning to read, because she 
would always tell Pappy to leave me be about it.<br>
<br>
In me teen year’s lady Boobybop died; very sad 
for me it was. Her books and belongings were 
left locked in the shack for months. A town 
meeting was held about the books. That’s when I 
was appointed head of the Library Committee. 
This was kind of a joke by the town’s folk, 
because there was no Library committee until 
they put me on it. Since they made a Library 
Committee and I was the head of it, I rebuilt 
the shack and made it in to the Boobybop Town 
Library. I was quite proud of the place. Many 
townsfolk were outraged, because they either 
wanted the Library torn down and the books 
burned, or the wanted it named after them. They 
held a meeting and tried to remove the Library 
Committee form the books, but the laws wouldn’t 
allow it to be removed until three years passed. 
I was the Head of the committee and they 
couldn't do a thing about it.<br>
<br>
One day, I suspect someone; they burnt down the 
Library and all the books in it. I was hurt 
badly by the smoke, trying to save the books, 
and spent many days under Mama's care in bed. I 
didn't get any books out, it was just too hot. 
Many of the town’s folk felt bad about what had 
happened. That’s when they appointed me to the 
corn growers committee. Partly because of me 
heritage and partly to cheer me up. It was 
really a prestigious position with only 15 
members on it. The meetings were full of 
squabbles and opinions, but we did manage to 
accomplish some things. I personally wrote the 
new detassaling handbook for the farmers press.<br>
<br>
One day, Bly Babbinsbort took me into his cellar 
and opened a big dusty locked chest. IT WAS 
FULL OF BOOKS! Old books and scrolls about 
Adventures and Magics. The Babbinsborts were 
known for adventures and such, but it was all 
stories, so I thought. I read them all and 
leaned them as much as I could. That gave me a 
new dream. No more boring corn meetings for this 
adventurer. I decided I was gona be a Druid and 
explore the world. I resigned my corm committee 
positions and spent my time studying and 
exploring the Misty Thicket. But those are 
other adventure stories to be told....<br>
<br>
I haven't told me parents, that I've been over 
at the Babbin's cellar reading and learning 
about magic’s, and when I'm away long they worry 
about me. But, I want to use my magic’s to 
explore and help others. In time I will become 
a powerful Druid explorer and helper of many.</p>
