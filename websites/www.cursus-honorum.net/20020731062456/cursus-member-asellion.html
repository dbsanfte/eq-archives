<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>Asellion was born in Freeport, though he did not know who his parents were. At a young age he was forced to live on his own in streets of Freeport. He could not take to the actions of other youths in his position, which relied on their unlawful skills to survive, so he fled into the wilderness. It was certain he was to die there, alone and unnourished, when he was found by a Halfling druid. Though her ways were pagan to the teachings of the light bringer, Asellion accepted her as a guardian and protector. She taught him the value of humility, making him work and hunt for her to gather various components she required. For some time he worked for her, and she cared for his needs. Then one day the druid decided that it was time for Asellion to stand on his own feet and prove himself. As a reward for his service, she gave the warrior some money, but also a sinister looking blade. She knew little, or spoke little, of the origins of the weapon, other than stating it was a powerful blade for those who learned to master it. Asellion thanked her kindly for the gifts as well as her guidance, then left to explore the wide world.<br>
<br>
Asellion had several adventures, and eventually came to the eastern lands of Feydwer. Here he came under the teachings of Tynkal, a paladin of Tunare. Though they served different Gods, their strengths and goals were the same, and Asellion quickly rose through the ranks. In time he faced the horrors of the Estate, and proved himself time and time again there in the dark trials of that dungeon. He learned hardships, and he learned victory, but before all he kept to himself the principals of nobility and paladin hood. It was after one such victory, when Asellion was nearing his knighthood, that he had learned what had befallen the armies of Artillian. When he learned that a new leader had been chosen, and indeed that the fight still continued, Asellion pledged to find the Regent and swear his oath of fealty. And thus Asellion set off on a quest that would change his life forever.</p>
