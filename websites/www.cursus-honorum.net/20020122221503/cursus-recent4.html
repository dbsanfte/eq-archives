<p align=left>The Temple of Marr has responded to my inquiries regarding the resilient disease present in Daurkean's parents. They fear that his parents are suffering from lycanthropy, however, this particular strain must be considerably stronger since no treatment so far has had any effect. The most knowledgable people on Norrath about this horrid disease are the Priests of Life. The Temple of Marr sent word to them as soon as they expected the nature of the disease. The Priests of Life were quick to respond and confirmed that it did indeed have the signs of lycanthropy. They have recently become aware of newer, stronger forms of the disease and have had similar unsuccessful results when attempting to treat it. The Temple of Marr sent me a duplicate of the letter they received from the Priests of Life describing their recent research into the matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
To the Temple of Marr and her devoted priests, may the Prime Healer always watch over you.<br>
<br>
The evils of lycanthropy are very difficult to purge from the body. Even the strongest of people are usually destroyed while trying to be cured. New strains of this disease have been even more difficult to treat. However, we have been working on a potion that may rid people of this horrible disease. One of our own, Lempeck Hargrin, has been diagnosed with lycanthropy. He has fled the city and is hiding in the plains of western Karana. We are struggling to finish this potion before it is too late for Lempeck, but there is an ingrediant we lack. We believe Kizzie Mintopp of Rivervale can provide the missing ingrediant, but the last time we spoke with her she was having difficulty procuring it. If this cure works we believe we can imbue its magical essense into one of our relics. I can only pray that we can finish in time.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Astaed Wemore<br>
Priest of Life<br>
<br>
<br>
When I arrive in Qeynos to speak on Elysoun's behalf, I shall also take the time to speak with the Priests of Life about this disease.<br>
