<p>Log entry, January 1, 01</p>
<p align=left>As is the tradition of many organizations, with my recent appointment of Regent, a new log will be kept to record the history of our brave fighting men and women. From this time forward let our loyal followers be known as "Cursus Honorum," the course of honors. For it is our duty and our honor to safeguard the good people of Norrath. Our primary objectives are four in number.<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> Find our lost leader Artillian Vincere. We will search for him until we find him or proof of his death. Should he be returned to us then this skelleton of an empire that we are attempting to preserve will be returned to him. Until then I, Rohwin Ardour, will remain as the Regent of "Cursus Honorum."<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Conduct raids and sieges against our enemies. Evil is on the rise and we may not be able to stop them. Our forces are depleated and Norrath is once again divided. Even though we cannot defeat them today, we can hold them back. If we raid their supplies, assassinate their leaders, and disrupt their communications and alliances then we can buy the time we need to regain our strength and vanquish evil from these lands.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b> Search for arms, armor, and magic to support our cause. Hidden throughout Norrath and across the planes are items of great power. To defeat evil we will need to harvest as many of these sacred and powerful artifacts as we can. The strength of our magic and our equipment may make the difference between final victory or defeat.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> Slay the Dragons of Norrath. It are the dragons who are responsible for the swelling evil waves that torment our lands. As long as they live evil will continue to grow and prosper. We must slay them all before it is too late for Norrath.</p>

<p align=left>The war does not go well. In the frozen north our armies can barely maintain a stalemate. I have diverted all the supplies I could to assist them in their efforts. Most of Artillian's wealth has been reclaimed by those who gave it to him. I did manage to save a small villa in the commonlands as well as a large tract in the desert of Ro. I have nearly depleated all the supplies in my possesion, but there are still a few who support our cause. As long as the army to the north receives this shipment they are confident that they can hold out. The east is less promising. I have lost all contact with the army on Faydwer. I have sent two messengers to see what has happened, but neither have returned yet. To make matters worse I have received reports that the Estate of Unrest is growing powerful. I will need to recall everyone who can be spared to march against the undead there. We will need to be swift to ensure Kaladim is not put into jeopardy.</p>

<p align=left>Warning to all members of Cursus Honorum. Xxaiver is known to the residents of Felwithe as Xxaiver Kinslayer. He is wanted in Felwithe to stand trial for the slayings of his family. He is to be arrested immediately and brought before Regent Rohwin Ardour. Xxaiver has been studying the arts of enchantment, so let no caution be spared while detaining him.</p>

<p align=left>The threat of Unrest has been greatly diminished. We suffered realitivly light casualties and showed Norrath that even though Artillian is not among us we still wield power. The Dwarves of Kaladim were esspecially pleased. They compensated us for our efforts in supplies. We were negociating a longer term agreement with them when they learned about the Dwarven spirit trapped in Unrest. There were many aurguments and comotions regarding what should be done about it. Many thought that we left Unrest too early. It hampered our negociations to a point where they would not provide more supplies to us until we returned proof that the Dwarven noble has been laid to final rest. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to return to Unrest. Our forces are allready afloat bound for Antonica, where they will be marching hard to assist our army in the north. Also, I need to discover what has happened to our army to the east. I promised to return to Unrest to free the Dwarven spirit, but I do not know when it will be possible to do so.</p>

<p align=left>Xxaiver's guilt is not assured. It seems that the Hammers have acted on his behalf through Prophet Benedain. We are to delay his detention until we find a little known Fier'Dal known to frequent the taverns of Kelethin. He could only be described as a peppy wood elf guy. It seems strange that Xxaiver's fate rests with such an obscure person, but the Hammers said justice would not be served unless we found him.</p>

<p align=left>A reconnaissance mission into the hidden Castle Mistmoore have revealed disturbing news. Mistmoore is growing in power, if left unchecked it will pose a great threat to Faydark. We believe they were responsible for the disappearance on the garrison of Faydwer, but hard evidence is lacking. Regardless though, we must take action against Mistmoore. We witnessed their unholy experiments with the undead and know now that they are aligned with Innoruuk. Elyar and I brought this news before the courts of Felwithe, but they all but refused to listen to us. They still harbor ill will regarding the return of Xxaiver. Elyar convinced them that we were having difficultly locating him, I hope the issue of Xxaiver can be resolved soon.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Rosaed of King Thex's royal guard spoke with me in private. He told me that the Royal Court knows of Mistmoore, but they have been keeping its knowledge well hiden. The people of Felwithe were not ready to hear about it. The rumors and lore of that evil place were enough to deeply frighten the people, to have these rumors substantiated would cause wide spread panic. The King would rather wage a secret war against Mistmoore, by hiring mecenaries. He has offered Cursus Honorum modest supplies to support our efforts there. The general populus of Felwithe feels animosity towards us and King Thex will not deal with us publicly. The supplies will help us, but without commiting large numbers of troops I fear that Mistmoore will not fall. However, we will do our swore duties and keep them at bay. Perhaps when our reputation has been restored with Felwithe we will get better support.</p>

<p align=left>High Templar Kolvaran has returned from the Runny Eye Citadel. He says that Clan Runny Eye has been expelled from the Citadel and replaced by another band of Goblins. He believes they are related to the Pickclaws that are found in the surounding mountains, but where ever they come from they are equally, if not more hostile towards us. The Halflings of Rivervale seemed especially disturbed with this news. They have asked Kolvaran to send word to Freeport, asking them for help with men and supplies. They requested that the Humans could keep the Tier'Dal at bay in Kithicor woods and the Commonlands so that they could concentrate more with the issues with the Goblins.</p>

<p align=left>Cursus Honorum rejoices today. Evidence of Xxaiver's innocence has been brought to the attention of the royal court of Felwithe. They have examined the evidence in their laboratories and have agreed that Xxaiver did not commit the crimes he was accussed of. They did not really apologize for their accusations, but King Thex did issue Xxaiver a pardon, clearing his name.<br>
<br>
While in Faydwer, I was contacted by Kaladim. They are applying pressure towards us to return to Unrest and forfill our promise. I feel that the timing is right to do so. Even though our garrison here is gone, Faydark seems to be quiet and stable. I have sent letters to our nobles and to our allies to gather what troops can be spared to march against the estate of Unrest again and to release the tormented soul of the Dwarven noble trapped there.</p>

<p align=left>It was difficult to mobilize a force of substantial size in a short time. I am greatful to our allies for providing the support they could. Upon arriving at the Estate of Unrest we saw that it was recovering much faster then anticipated. We still held the advantage and were victorious in our initial encounters with the undead. Our good fortune faded when we entered the basement. The narrow hallways negated our advantage in numbers. The undead also coordinated their attacks in ways unseen by them before. We were ambushed several times in the dark depths of the basement. Although we were successful in thwarting their attacks, we could not penetrate deeper into the basement. The Dwarven noble's spirit was close, but the undead seemed to put all their efforts into protecting him. Eventually we were forced to withdraw and reform our lines on the grounds surrounding the Estate.<br>
<br>
We will need to reconsider our strategy for releasing the soul of the Dwarven noble. I have left a garrison around the Estate of Unrest to keep them in check until the next attempt can be made. I am traveling to Kaladim to update the Dwarves on the situation. Hopefully they will understand the difficulties we are having.<br>
<br>
A point of interst though is a discovery that Elyar made. He found a bronze key on a peculiar looking Ghoul. The key had an inscription on it written in an ancient language. He is taking it to Felwithe for futher study.</p>

<p align=left>The siege against Castle Mistmoore has been intense. We have scored devastating damage to them, but at horrific costs of our own. We did manage to infiltrate the castle at one point and confusing and deadly fighting ensued within their hallways and chambers. We exited the castle before they could gain the upper hand. We now lay more conventional seige against their outer perimeter. It is interesting to note that we have not heard any word from their leaders. We have yet to receive any reply to our charges against them. I cannot say how long this siege will last, but it will be a trying experience with the bulk of our forces so far away. At this time I am unwilling to recall our garrison at Unrest or to pull any troops from northern Antonica.</p>

<p align=left>I have received a <a href="cursus-letter1.html">missive</a> from a trusted servant and friend of mine, Tanulias. He has brought me disquieting news about the daughter of General Milutec Alderelm of Kelethin. His daughter is of need of rescue from the Orcs of Clan Crushbone. I am indebted to the general for the support he provided Artillian during the great war. She must be saved, but I cannot leave the siege of Mistmoore. I have decided to delegate this responsibility to my friends and nobles of Cursus Honorum. I have asked for volunteers to lead this daring mission into the Orc's homeland.</p>

<p>Log entry, October 14, 01</p>
<p align=left>Two brave volunteers ventured behind enemy lines to locate the daughter of General Alderelm. They were unknown to Cursus Honorum, but they came highly recomended from some of our nobles. They were Kiladine, a Fier'Dal druid and Lladarie, a ranger and also Fier'Dal. Since none of our own fighters could be spared from the siege of mistmoore I accepted the advice of my comerades and briefed the two young Fier'Dal volunteers. They slipped past the front lines into crushbone with little more then their wits and Erollisi's blessings. They avoided many patrols but were forced to fight Clan Crushbone on numerous occasions. Eventually they located Platicia chained in a secret room behind the throne in Castle Crushbone. Her chains proved very strong, but they were sucessful in picking the lock that held her captive. Once Platica was freed they made their way back through the castle and onto the surrounding grounds. The Orcs quickly discovered Platicia's absencse and sent several search parties after her. Our brave rescuers were set upon by many charging Orcs, but they prevailed in combat and also kept Platicia safe from injury. Many more Orcs pursued them as they scrambled for the safety of Faydark. Even ambassador D'Vinn sought them out. While they traveled through the broad tunnel that would surely lead them to safety it was D'Vinn who found them and halted their escape. However, before he could cause them harm Earl Elyar Klennix stepped onto the scene and let loose his firey magic. D'Vinn was severely injured and was forced to retreat. It is unclear if is wounds were mortal or not, as no one could afford to chase after him. The priority was to bring back Platicia safely, and so they did.<br>
<br>
When General Alderelm learned of his daughter's rescue he was overcome with joy. He thanked our efforts with enthusiasm and provided rewards for our young volunteers. He also saw fit to strengthen his alliance with Cursus Honorum. He has deployed a significant number of troops to relieve our forces at Castle Mistmoore. He has even volunteered to oversee the siege there for the time being. With his support I was able to offer rest to our fatigued troops, and I too have been relieved of duty for awhile. I will take this opportunity to attend to other matters of importance.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that while Platicia ventured foolishly and ill-prepared, she did gather important information as she intended, although its relevance is unbeknownst to her. Since her escape, the Orcs have been trying ever harder to recapture her. All their attempts at kidnapping have been thwarted. The cost of their efforts have out-weighed any ransom that they had hoped to gain nor has their efforts been consistant with the value and satisfaction of revenge. She must have seen or heard something that is of extreme importance. We have questioned her several times but have discovered nothing. Platicia has been shipped to a safer place, a place kept secret from everyone but her father. Our latest intelligence says that Tier'Dal operatives are now seeking out the ones who rescued her. It is believed that they may know something of great value, although its importance may not be recognized immeadiately. We too are seeking out the recuers, but since their mission was completed they have slipped away into obscurity. They must be found before the Tier'Dal get to them.</p>

<p align=left>We have had some success in locating one of our volunteers that rescued General Alderelm's daughter from Crushbone. Kiladine remains unseen but the young ranger named Lladarie has been found. I just received word from the Fier'Dal rangers in Lesser Faydark that she has sought shelter with them. Apparently while she was hunting in the forest she noticed that she was being followed. She tried to see who her pursuers were but they proved too elusive. She did manage to see a few silhouettes, but their identity remains a mystery. Fear of being attacked by unknown assailants caused Lladarie to seek protection with the rangers stationed in Faydark. They are guarding her now until we can retrieve her safely from the forest. The rangers of Lesser Faydark have made sweeps of the area to find her pursuers. They found evidence of numerous people close to the station, but they cannot say who they are or what their motives may be. We shall send a well-armed party to escort her safely from the Forest.</p>

<p align=left>We questioned Lladarie intensely about the events she took part of in Crushbone on October 14th, 01. She did say that her abductors from Castle Mistmoore also wanted information about her mission in Crushbone, but Lladarie truly did not recall any information of importance. Luckily for her, we rescued her before the agents of Mistmoore had time to use more effective methods of extracting information. We could not fathom why Mistmoore was interested in Crushbone's affairs. Then a revelation struck Lladarie. It was not information about Crushbone that was important, it was information about Neriak. She retold a story that she had heard from Platicia Alderelm while in Crushbone.<br>
<br>
Platicia had said that some Teir'Dal were present in crushbone, in particular Ambassador D'Vinn. Sometimes D'Vinn would sit across from her and gaze upon her, many times for hours on end. He would never speak to Platicia, he would only sit in the dark corner and stare. As disturbing as this was to hear, it was not a clue we could act on. However, D'Vinn had a companion that would visit him on occasion, a female Teir'Dal. She would ignore Platicia completely. She would walk in and address D'Vinn in the Teir'Dal language. The two of them would speak openly in front of Platicia. Either they were not aware that the general's daughter was schooled in the Teir'Dal language, or mayhaps they did not care. The things they talked about were of no relevance to us, but Lladarie now remembered one statement that may be important. D'Vinn's companion did say that she would leave an official message to their followers across the serpent's spine.<br>
<br>
Could this statement be what everone was looking for? It seemed unlikely, but it is the only thing that has risen any interest among us. We knew that Crushbone, Neriak, and Mistmoore were taking this matter very seriously. This must be a vital clue. We shall analyze this information as thoroughly as we can. Perhaps if we can solve the meaning of this clue we will gain advantage over Neriak.<br>
<br>
Vice-Regent Elyar has offered to bring this information before the Felwithe council in the hopes that their resources may shed more light on the matter. It was also brought to our attention that Mistmoore will still be seeking this information. Lladarie is still in danger, and for that matter, so are those of us that retrieved her from Mistmoore. Even though we slew all who engaged us, we must asume that others saw us and maybe recognized some us. We will all be more careful in the times ahead.</p>

<p align=left>While militarily successful, the search within Runny Eye Citadel proved unfruitful. We found no messages, nor any indication that the Teir'Dal are aligned with the Goblins there. Our mission was not in vain though. We found the Citadel lightly defended, which enabled us to penatrate deep into its recesses without discovery. When we chose to strike we caught them off-guard in sensitive areas. As it turned out, the bulk of their forces were away on an escort mission to bring in arms and other supplies. They were preparing for an invasion of Rivervale, just as the Halflings had suspected. However, when news of our presence came to them they mistakingly thought we comprised an all out siege on their Citadel. They diverted the majority of their forces back to stop us. This left their supply caravan vulnerable, and enabled the Halflings to decimate it. We managed to exit the Citadel before their reinforcements could arrive. The Halflings were very pleased with our efforts that day. If war has not been averted, then it has at least been delayed for a time. I see an even stronger alliance in our future, but we are no closer to solving the puzzle that brought us there. Lady Vivesanguine believes the answers are to be found in High Hold Keep. I pray that she is correct, for I fear that if we don't solve Lladarie's clue soon we will miss out on a critical advantage.</p>

<p align=left>The diplomatic mission to Sanctus Seru of Luclin has not gone well. I have been in the city for more then a week awaiting an audience with Lord Inquisitor Seru. I have had plenty of time to explore the city. While it is well kept and beautiful, some would say exquisite, it seems to me that such beauty has come at a high price. Few of the citizens here have been willing to talk to me. They were afraid to speak, but I don't believe it was me they feared. I have noticed that over the past few days I have been followed, by members of the Eye of Seru I suspect.<br>
<br>
I did manage to talk with a shop owner in private. He advised that I leave this city soon. He cautioned me that the walls have ears and the "Eye's" are everywhere. No one can be sure who among us is doing the Lord Inquisitor's work. He also added that a friend of his had told him that the reason I was being kept so long was that they were researching my background. Furthermore, they had discovered that I had Teir'Dal serving me. I quickly tried to explain that these Teir'Dal were different, that they walked in the light, but he cut me off. He said it doesn't matter, the Lord Inquisitor will not tolerate Teir'Dal under any circumstances. He urged me to leave while I had the chance.<br>
<br>
A few hours later I was approached by Optio Sora in one of their orderly gardens. He told me that Lord Inquistor Seru would see me now. While we walked I saw that several people were shadowing our movements. We passed near the shop of the man who had cautioned me. I noticed that the curtains were drawn over the windows and his "closed" sign was displayed unusually early. Optio Sora asked me casually if I knew someone by the name of Sendariu or of her child Selveterm. I indicated that I did, they were both in my service. He nodded as if the information was of little importance. He told me that no one may be armed in the pressence of the Lord Inquisitor. So I unstrapped my sword belt and gave it to him. I asked if there was a place where I might refresh myself briefly before meeting with Lord Inquisitor Seru. He indicated to a nearby public bath house. I entered the bath house to find myself alone. It was identical to the other bath houses I had visited earlier. It had two doorways, one on each side of the building. Shortly after I entered a few other people entered the bath house from each doorway. I quickly washed my face and tried to exit the building at the opposite door way from where I entered. A hulking Human moved to block my path. He politely, yet firmly indicated that I should use the other door. All the eyes in the building were fixated on me.<br>
<br>
I channeled quickly and struck the Human with a stunning blow. He staggered momentarily and the others in the room ran towards me. I dashed around the Human and out of the door. When he turned to follow me I cast a spell adhering his feet to the ground. He struggled to free himself. His mass was large enough to make an effective blockade in the doorway. The other people in the room tried to squeeze by him to no avail. I ran away from the bathhouse as quickly as I could. I had a good lead on my pursuers, but who knew where more might emerge to capture me. I knew that the city gates would be secured and defended long before I could reach them, so instead I ran away from them. I was certain that the heavy clanking of my running would alert everyone in the city. I glanced over my shoulder to see that people were in fact behind me. I still had a decent lead on them, but they were gaining steadily. I found myself approaching the city walls. There was a small guard house at the base of some stairs that led to the battlements on top of the walls. A guard stepped out of the guard house in front of me with a crossbow. He leveled it at me and fired. I held up my arms to protect my face and I felt the bolt strike the side of my breastplate. It was a glacing blow and did not penetrate my armor, but it left a sharp dent that rubbed against me as I moved. The guard tried to quickly reload his crossbow, but I was running too fast for him. I lowered my shoulder and crashed into him. The sounds of cracking bones rang in my ears as we fell into the guard house. Thankfully, none of the broken bones were mine. I got up and dashed up the stairs to the top of the wall. My pursuers were quite close behind me now, with there weapons drawn. At the top of the walls I could see the desolate expanse of Marus Seru below me. To the right and left of me guards were quickly approaching. I reached into my belt pouch and withdrew a small vial of greenish liquid. I removed the stopper and consumed the liquid in a single gulp. "This had better work Benedain!" I shouted as I lept from the wall into the desert below. For a moment I thought I might be ill from the taste of the potion, but I contained my composure and felt the weight of gravity alleviated from me. I Fell quickly, not so fast as to injure myself. I landed on my feet on the hots sands of Marus Seru and continued my run for freedom. Arrows and bolts clattered around me as I ran, but I escaped further injury and capture. There was much more to Sanctus Seru then what first impressions gave.</p>
