<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>Me background? You’re not with the Champions of Tunare are ya? No? Good (takes a large pull of mead) well then, I was born to a long line of scamps and tricksters. Me ma was a Scout of Tunare and me who me da is as good a guess as anyone’s (smiles sheepishly). Me ma was killed by some Orcs when I was seven, after that I was raised by the guild. I never really started training to become a Scout of Tunare, just sort of happened. One day the guild master saw me fiddlin with the stuff the apprentices where workin on and I was doin what they where doin. He trained me then on, I was fully trained at 13 and was the guilds messenger boy for a long time. All was fine till I was 16 and their was power struggle in the Champions of Tunare. The new guy didn’t like us scouts, he thought we was just a bunch o brigands. Things started gettin bad after that, rumors were a spreadin about hoe we was bad news and a gang o thieves. Recruits started comin in slow and soon died off all together, turns out that blow hard at the Champions was spreadin more lies about us and steppin on our feet about recruiten scouts. Any case right know were in a tight spot, the idiot unfortunately has friends high up in Kelethin and is close to gettin us in deep trouble. I’m hopen it doesn’t open up into Guild warfare. We will win of course Rangers aren’t very good at dodgen blades in their sleep (smirks grimly). In any case I've been around Feydwer a bit and hope ta share a drink with ya again some time. Cheers friend (raises his mug in a toast)</p>
