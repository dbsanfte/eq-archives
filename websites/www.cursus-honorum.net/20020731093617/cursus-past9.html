<p><b>Battle at Castle Mistmoore</b></p>
<p align=left>Some time ago I mentioned that I was interested in raiding Kaesora, however, I have unearthed new research. Scrolls which dictate the movements of Tier'Dal armies in conjunction with minions of Innoruuk have been discovered and traced to Mayong Mistmoore. In accordance with the Felwithe Accords seven years ago, I have leave of the council to enter the borderlands of the lesser Faydark and mount an assault on the castle walls.<br>

-excerpt from a letter written by Earl Elyar Klennix<br>

<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>The defenses of the Tier'Dal were unprepared for the assault we set down upon them. Their sentinels and patrols either fled quickly or were cut down as we advanced. They managed to form a defensive line before their drawn draw bridge. We reorganized our own lines in the graveyard that lay in the shadows of Castle Mistmoore. The aging castle had many weak points due to crumbling mortar and previous sieges. One of our soldiers noticed a vine covered cavity at the base of the castle in the corner of the graveyard. One by one we slipped through the crevice and found ourselves inside thier defenses. From within we executed numerous attacks against those within the castle. Our attacks were devastating, but due to the confusing nature of the castle many of our people became lost or seperated from the main group and ambushed. Our casualties were high on the first day, but we dealt a blow that they would not soon forget. Eventually, our forces were becoming too scattered and lack of communication was a growing danger. We chose to exit the castle and regather our forces. Now the Tier'Dal have organized a formidable defense. We continuously press against them, probing for another weak point, but I doubt we will have another windfall like the first day of siege for quite a while.</p>
