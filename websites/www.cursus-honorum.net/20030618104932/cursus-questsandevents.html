<p><b><u>Quests and Events</u></b></p>
			<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p align=left>The Quests and Events are divided into five sections. First is upcoming events. These may be scheduled raids, roleplaying events, or guild wars. Second, is <a href="cursus-pastevents.html">past events</a>. These are the archived results of any guild event. Third, is <a href="cursus-recenthistory.html">recent history</a> of Cursus Honorum. When roleplaying events add to our story line, then they will be recorded here. Forth, is <a href="cursus-quests.html">quest</a> information. When you have accomplished a quest within the game, if you wish, you may write an article describing how your guild mates might follow in your footsteps. It is nice to have quest information on our own web-site because we know that information from our guildmates is acurate. If we depend on each other then we will not need to visit sites like everlore for their highly questionable information. Lastly, are <a href="cursus-stories.html">stories</a> writen by our members. These stories are the histories of our various members and the true or fictional accounts of our experiences in Norrath. Upcoming events will be displayed on this page. However, the other four sections will have seperate pages to divide the bulk of information.</p>
			<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p><b>Upcoming Events</b></p>
<p align=left>Here are the guild events that are in the near future. Events will include, raids, roleplaying events, guild wars, and similar guild activities. For any guild event to be offical, it must be recorded here. Impromtu events will not earn players political points, save points for personal valor if it is reported and witnessed. Once an event has passed, then it will be moved to the past events page along with its results.</p>

<p><b>The worst names in Norrath</b></p>
<p align=left>This is a recurring contest where we seek out the very worst names found in Norrath. You are free to define "worst" for yourselves. Whether it be a bad pun, a phrase, horrible spelling, a rip-off, something completely incoherant, or any other anti-roleplay name. The rules for competing are as follows: <br>
<br>
1. To enter, all you need to do is email me a screenshot of the character with the offending name. The character model must be clearly visible in the screenshot. Names seen in a chat window will not count. The name you are submitting should also be included in the text of the email in case there are multiple people in the screenshot or the name is unclear. Feel free to add additional comments to why you feel the name is particularly bad. Emails can be sent to <a href="mailto:regent@cursus-honorum.net">regent@cursus-honorum.net</a>. Everquest screenshots are quite large at over 1MB each, so please convert them to a smaller format such as .jpeg before mailing me to save on bandwidth and space. Also, some free email services such as hotmail may not allow such large attachments.<br>
<br>
2. Names will be collected from anyone who wishes to participate. Once at least 10 names have been submitted, then I will stop taking names on the last day of the current month. Any names submitted late will be applied to the subsequent contest.<br>
<br>
3. People outside of the guild are welcome to participate.<br>
<br>
4. 2 entries will be allowed per person. If you send me more then 2 entries per month, only the first 2 received will be considered. All other entries will be discarded.<br>
<br>
5. When the requisite names have been collected, I will post a list of names that were submitted at the beginning of the following month. Each person in Cursus Honorum can cast 1 vote by replying on the forum for the name they feel is the worst. The dead line for voting will be midnight on the 15th of the month the list was posted on.<br>
<br>
6. Once the voting is complete I will add up the votes and determine a winner. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place will be announced allong with who submitted the screenshots. A link to a webpage will be posted so you can see the screenshots for yourselves. In the event of any ties I will determine a winner.<br>
<br>
7. The first place winner will get the additional bonus of earning a prize. The winner may select any item from our guild vault. Please contact Shmool or Elyar in game to collect your prize. Prizes must be collected within 1 month. On the 15th of the following month any unclaimed prizes will remain in the guild vault.<br>
<br>
8. If duplicate names are submitted, then the first one received will gain the credit for the name. I will email anyone who sent a duplicate name so they may enter a new name before the deadline. Also, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place names for each month may not be submitted again. Names that did not place in the top 3 may be resubmitted for future contests, but you will need to email me to indicate that you wish to reenter a name, I will not reenter any thing automatically.<br>
<br>
You can see the worst names we have found so far by clicking on our <a href="cursus-pastwinners.html">past winners</a>. Enjoy the contest. I'll look forward to seeing what else we can find.</p>

<a name="bencom"></a><p><b>Search for the City of Mist</b></p>
<p align=left>Benedain sat stiffly upon the splintering wooden floor of the shaman guild hut in Firiona Vie. The elders were in their circle of power conducting the dream-walking, while the visiting shamans protected them with ancient chants of the ancestors. Benedain chanted in rythmn as it was taught to him in Halas, and his mind floated on its melodious pitch. Soon the elders awoke from their dream-walking, and they turned their gaze towards Benedain.<br>
<br>
"Heyokah Benedain, the spirits are angered and restless within the ancient city of Torsis deep within the Emerald Forest. The elders have determined that your experiences with that cursed city make you the perfect canidate to lead a war party. Gather your forces and go to the city. There, lay the miscreant spirits to rest and find the answer to the riddle of why these spirits became so angered."<br> 
<br>
Benedain stood up from his cramped position to face the elders. "I shall call to arms the soldiers of the Cursus Honorum. We shall lay them to rest."<br>
<br>
...and the soilders of Cursus Honorum marched through the dense Emerald Jungle. At the front of the columns was Benedain, leading and searching for the ancient City of Mist so that prophecy may be forfilled. (Continue on with this tale below with "Benedain's Puzzle.")</p>
<p><b>Benedain's Puzzle</b></p>
<p align=left>A lull in the fighting allowed the nobles of Cursus Honorum to rest for a moment. They had taken a defensive position near the stables, and the leaders were quickly discussing a plan to break through the courtyard to access the inner portions of the city before the next wave of undead came. During this time Benedain scratched a circle into the dirt floor and knelt inside it. Then he retrieved a few items from is tunic and placed them at specific points around him. He spit on his roughly carved wooden totem and began to chant quietly with his eyes closed. Those near him watched intently but gave him plenty of room. Benedain's chanting became louder and more quickly paced. The military leaders began to speak louder to overcome Benedain's chanting. Benedain held his arms to the sky and chanted ever louder, until suddenly he stopped and opened his eyes. At that moment, a lieutenant speaking among the leaders said in a loud voice, "but why move into that quarter, I don't even know why we are here."<br>
<br>
Benedain stood up and addressed him, "I'll tell you why we are here. The spirits here are angry. They have lost something and are searching for it. The hammers have let me know that an injustice has occured here, and we are duty bound to set things straight. Here among the spirits of this city of mist, I have traveled into their realm to seek our answers. They have spoken to me in riddle.</p>
<p>"Our city disturbed, thats our tale<br>
thieving hands of a one-eyed male<br>
<br>
Where bones once lay now space reside<br>
gone to human city licked by western tide"</p>
<p align=left>"We must solve this riddle before we can do more" said Benedain. Those present pondered its meaning and ideas were quickly tossed around. The lieutenant asked, "Is there any more?" Benedain replied "Perhaps. I shall seek advice from the Hammers." Benedain spat on his idol again and resumed his chanting. After a few moments he cast down a set of etched bones before him and studied them. "The hammers have answered, but it is cloudy. I cannot make sense of these symbols."</p>
<p> A I H F L S S E</p>
<p align=left>"When we know what this means, then we can do more, but for now our work here is done." On that news the leaders changed their plans to force their way back to the gates of the city of mist.<br>
<br>
(Please visit the forums and look at <a href="http://www.cursus-honorum.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1777#1777">Benedain's Riddle</a> to see how this quest develops, or to offer your ideas and other contributions.)</p>

<p><b>Lladarie's puzzling clue</b></p>
<p align=left>We questioned Lladarie intensely about the events she took part of in Crushbone on October 14th, 01. She did say that her abductors from Castle Mistmoore also wanted information about her mission in Crushbone, but Lladarie truly did not recall any information of importance. Luckily for her, we rescued her before the agents of Mistmoore had time to use more effective methods of extracting information. We could not fathom why Mistmoore was interested in Crushbone's affairs. Then a revelation struck Lladarie. It was not information about Crushbone that was important, it was information about Neriak. She retold a story that she had heard from Platicia Alderelm while in Crushbone.<br>
<br>
Platicia had said that some Teir'Dal were present in crushbone, in particular Ambassador D'Vinn. Sometimes D'Vinn would sit across from her and gaze upon her, many times for hours on end. He would never speak to Platicia, he would only sit in the dark corner and stare. As disturbing as this was to hear, it was not a clue we could act on. However, D'Vinn had a companion that would visit him on occasion, a female Teir'Dal. She would ignore Platicia completely. She would walk in and address D'Vinn in the Teir'Dal language. The two of them would speak openly in front of Platicia. Either they were not aware that the general's daughter was schooled in the Teir'Dal language, or mayhaps they did not care. The things they talked about were of no relevance to us, but Lladarie now remembered one statement that may be important. D'Vinn's companion did say that she would leave an official message to their followers across the serpent's spine.<br>
<br>
Could this statement be what everone was looking for? It seemed unlikely, but it is the only thing that has risen any interest among us. We knew that Crushbone, Neriak, and Mistmoore were taking this matter very seriously. This must be a vital clue. We shall analyze this information as thoroughly as we can. Perhaps if we can solve the meaning of this clue we will gain advantage over Neriak.<br>
<br>
Vice-Regent Elyar has offered to bring this information before the Felwithe council in the hopes that their resources may shed more light on the matter. It was also brought to our attention that Mistmoore will still be seeking this information. Lladarie is still in danger, and for that matter, so are those of us that retrieved her from Mistmoore. Even though we slew all who engaged us, we must asume that others saw us and maybe recognized some us. We will all be more careful in the times ahead.</p>
