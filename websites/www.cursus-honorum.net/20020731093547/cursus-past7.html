<p><b>Retrun to Unrest</b></p>
<p align=left>While in Felwithe, resolving the issue of Xxaiver with the royal court, Rohwin received a missive from Kaladim. The letter was urging Cursus Honorum to return to Unrest and put the Dwarven noble to final rest. Rohwin pondered the feasibility of returning to the Estate of Unrest, then he decided that now would be a good time to forfill his promise. Although the garrison on Faydwer was gone, Cursus Honorum had accumulated a few allies in recent times. He wrote letters to his nobles and to his allies asking to gather what troops could be spared and to gather at the gates of the haunted estate. This time he was determined to overwhelm the undead creatures there and release the soul of the Dwarven noble who has been tormented far too long.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>The undead creatures of the Estate of Unrest have been recovering faster then expected. The extra forces we brought kept the advantage on our side, but this battle was not going to be as quick as we had hoped. We learned precious lessons from our first trip to Unrest and now used new tactics to ensure our victories. We chose our battle grounds and opponants carefully and drew them into traps. Although we were consistanly victorious, our victories were costing us too much time. The undead creatures fortified themselves and better organized their defenses. It was as if they were all working under a single command toward a common goal. The intelligence they possess is still a mystery. No one knows if their behavior is set when they are created or if they can grow and learn. The only thing that was certain was that the Dwarven spirit was trapped in the basement and the undead were heavily defending it.<br>
<br>
After the grounds and the house were secure we took the fight into the basement. Skeletons, zombies, and werebats attacked us in force. We fought our way through the narrow hallways and eventually entered a large chamber. It was a prison of sorts. There were many alcoves with shackles hanging from the walls, but in its center was a dias. Bones and blood were scattered about the floor. It had the feeling of a torture chamber more than a prison. The battle to occupy this room was more heated then any other fight that day. Numerous times our rear was attacked by a flood of ghouls and skeletons. We could not fight past the torture chamber, but at least we defeated the attacks to our rear so that we had an avenue of escape.<br>
<br>
After one attack from behind Elyar noticed something odd. A ghoul was dressed differently from the others. It wore a robe that was not ripped and torn like what the remnants of their clothing usually looked like. Around its neck hung a bronze key. There was an inscription on the key, but it was in an unfamiliar language. Elyar took the key for further study.<br>
<br>
The defenses of the basement proved to be too strong. Even though we had superior numbers, we could not use them to our advantage due to the narrow halls of the basement. We fought our way out of the basement. Once we returned to the grounds we easily defeated any assult the undead offered. We were at a stalemate, so we decided to maintain a garrison around unrest to keep them subdued until another plan could be formed to attack the basement. Now Rohwin must travel to Kaladim to update the Dwarves on the situation in Unrest and Elyar is travelling to Felwithe to study the bronze key he found.</p>
