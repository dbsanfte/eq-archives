<p><b>Definition of Twinking</b></p>
<p>editorial by Rohwin</p>
<p align=left>What is the definition of a twink? The common answer is any character who has equipment beyond his or her level of capabilities. There is a lot of room for interpretation here so I will try to expand on the definitions of the many forms of twinking. But first, I will explain some of the dangers to being twinked.</p>
<p align=left>It is important to minimize the amount of twinking. While some low-end twinking is acceptable, high-end twinking can be damaging to the game and to the person being twinked. If you are a genuine newbie and have never played the game before, you should resist being twinked. A large part of the game is spent discovering what is available. To bypass the learning process and except gifts of great value will steal away many experiences in the game. Many times I have talked with players who have an item that they cannot describe how to get. They often do not even know what zone the item drops in or who drops it. It is the journey within Everquest that is important, not the end goal. To be ignorant is a detriment and will cause you problems in the game. If you earn your own equipment and wealth you can take a lot more pride in your character's achievements.</p>
<p align=left>A low-level character with lots of money can offer a lot more platinum for equipment. I have been out-bid many times by someone half my level. It is nice for the person selling equipment, but if enough twinks are out there buying equipment above its value, then the going rate of equipment will increase. It could potentially mean that a player who plays honest could never afford to buy equipment appropriate for his or her level. Inflated prices will also encourage increased farming. I don't think there is anything worse than a profession farmer. The problem is not too severe yet, but every time someone is twinked it contributes to damaging the fragile economy of Everquest.</p>
<p align=left>The higher level your character is, the more dying effects you. You lose more experience and have increasingly harder corpse recoveries. At low levels dying is not enjoyable, but it is a relatively light punishment compared to dying at high level. Your time at low levels (say less then level 20) should be spent learning to play the game. Learning good group communication, recognizing early when a fight will not go well, identifying a group that is going to get you killed, learning tactics of exploring dungeons, and learning the strengths and weaknesses of the other classes. A twinked low level character will be able to solo creatures more effectively and advance much faster in the game. They will not be in as much danger of dying as others. The lessened risk of playing takes away real-life experience from the game. Twinked players tend to "grow up" into an inexperienced player and will have a lot of catch-up to do to work well in high level groups. The higher level you are the more you will depend on other players for your survival. Even though a twinked character has a statistical advantage in a fight, it is the smarter player who will survive Norrath's most dangerous areas.</p>
<p align=left>Gifts to other players or to yourself as an alternate character is a form of twinking. The expense of the gift determines the severity. If you are giving away crap that is worthless to anyone but a newbie then that barely qualifies as the slightest of twinks. If you are giving away items that are not worth much to your character but are valuable to someone else then that can be considered a twink. For example, a level 40 character giving away bronze armor to a level 5 character. As long as the gift isn't too high above the recipient's level then the twink is not severe. In the above example, the gift of bronze is a light twink, but steel plate would be a moderate twink, and quest armor would be a heavy twink. The circumstances also play a factor in the severity of the twink. If a high level character has equipment that he or she does not want to sell to a vender and does not want to waste the time auctioning, then they may decide to give it away to a worthy character. This does happen often due to overfull bank accounts or encumbrance. After all, why would a level 40 character try to auction a piece of bronze for 10 platinum? It really isn't worth his or her time. In these cases some lucky adventurer or a friend might be twinked. It would be a different matter if the high level character set out to gather certain items specifically for lower level characters. Predetermining a gift for another character is twinking. The severity will depend on the expense of the gift and the recipients ability to acquire the item for themselves. On the other hand, rewards given to characters for services rendered is a less severe twink. If a low level character healed a high level character at the end of a very close and important fight, then the high level character might bestow a gift of great value in appreciation of the services rendered. Other ways to receive rewards may include raffles or participating in contests. When giving out rewards it is important to make the prize appropriate for the task. Too little a prize is disappointing and possibly insulting, while too high a prize is twinking. Many people grant exceptions to twinking for a spouse in the game. Even though it is more acceptable to twink a loved one, you should be very careful when doing so. You do not want to deprive them of the experiences of playing and learning the game. </p>
<p align=left>When someone has multiple characters it is common for the alternate characters to be twinked. Since the player has presumably played and learned the game already it is less damaging to be twinked this way. It is acceptable to get a boost from a higher level character to get through the lowest levels quickly. It is good for newbies to learn the value of the platinum piece by killing countless rats and spiderlings, but sucessive characters need not go through it again. At some point you should sever the contact between your own characters and let your new character go through the game on his or her own. If your character cannot earn his or her own equipment, then I do not see the point of continuing to play. It is up to the individual to decide how long your alternate characters will be dependent on your primary character. This type of twinking may not effect your own ability to play but it will encourage other players, especially newbies, to twink themselves and others. If you must twink yourself then please keep it to a minimum and keep the level of equipment appropriate to your level.</p>
<p align=left>Grouping with high-level characters and looting valuable items is twinking. If the levels are so far apart that you can't get experience and the people killing the mobs do not require your help then you are getting twinked anytime you loot. It is good to gain the knowledge of higher level areas in the game, such as how to pull safely and who drops which items, but if you gain items that you couldn't possibly get normally then you are being twinked. If you are gaining experience in the group then more power to you, but if you are level 35 hanging out with 5 level 50's, then you are probably in the wrong place and getting twinked. Only you can decide if the group you are in is acceptable to be in. It is very tempting to stay in very high level groups to get rare and valuable equipment, but if it is beyond your own level you should not seek out these groups. On the same note, high-level characters should not invite people into their group unless they can significantly contribute to the efforts.</p>
<p align=left>Many times people are being twinked as help for a quest. Guidelines similar to grouping would apply here. If someone simply kills a mob for you and lets you loot it then you did not earn the prize of the quest for yourself. If you aren't getting experience for the kills your group makes, then you are too low. If you are killing the mobs yourself but a high-level character is watching over you to provide support, then the twinking is less severe. The severity of the twink depends on how much assistance was required. To give away quest items or trade amongst your own characters is a minor twink, but usually acceptable depending on the value of the prize compared to the level of the recipient. To buy quest items is not a twink, provided that you earned your money honestly. There are many reasons to buy items from other players. Sometimes there is a faction adjustment that is undesirable, an item is too rare to be obtained easily, or perhaps you do not want to invest the time necessary to complete a quest by yourself. However, there is a certain satisfaction of completed a quest without help. It is up to you to decide how you want to go about playing the game.</p>
<p align=left>Many guilds will twink their younger members. Also, there are some people who seek to join guilds so they can be twinked. Both of these scenarios are undesirable. The line between assisting a younger member and twinking one is not very clear. Everyone has their own thoughts and opinions about what is acceptable and what is not. You need to ask yourself why you are playing the game. Do you enjoy earning your own equipment and learning the secrets of the game, or would you rather skip all the middle steps and go straight to the end. Determine for yourself where the line between assisting and twinking is, then stick to it. I feel that light twinking as gifts appropriate for ones level or maybe assisting someone who is currently under-equiped is fine. Helping people with quests or babysitting to help them level is fine as long as they are capable of completing the task themselves. You would be providing insurance just in case something goes wrong. Power leveling lower levels falls under the same situation. As long as they are capable of killing the creatures themselves everything is fine if you provide some back-up. Perhaps you will pull for them, or heal them between fights so there is less down time. While you are power leveling others you should explain to them how the fight the creatures if you weren't present and provide tips on pulling and secrets of the area. It is certainly more important to not twink people's first character, but the same rules apply to alternate characters, just to a slightly lesser degree. When you encounter someone who is clearly twinked don't put them down or discourage them, but you might be hesitent to group with them. Make sure they are a competant player before entrusting your life with them. Chances are that if they are not opposed to twinking and you are, then their playing style may be radically different from your own. Even if they are competent players, you might not enjoy their company, and it is good people that make Everquest worthwhile to play. If their level of being twinked is offensive to you then your only recourse against them is to not deal with them. Perhaps refusing to group with them, refusing to buy from them, and possibly refusing to sell to them. Otherwise, just let them be. Don't be discouraged when you see someone much lower then you with much nicer equipment. If they want to be twinked and  they enjoy playing the game that way then, so be it. They will never learn the joy and satisfaction of earning your money and equipment for yourself.</p>
