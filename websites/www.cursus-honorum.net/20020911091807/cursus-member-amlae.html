<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>Again, the child Amlaith screamed. The 
Crushbone Clan had killed her mother in the 
initial attack. Her father stood with the 
guards, she didn't know if he was alive or not. 
The guards managed to hold off the orcs long 
enough for those that couldn't (or wouldn't) 
fight to make their escape. Amlaith took her 
younger brother's hand, and told him not to let 
go. Together they ran to the far end of the 
city, hoping to slip down and make their escape 
into the forest. Soon the panicked crowd, mixed 
of an equal number of wood elf residents and 
outlanders alike, surrounded them. No one saw 
the young girl and her even younger brother. 
Soon, someone ran into the boy, knocking him to 
the ground. In their panic, they either didn't 
notice, or didn't care.<br>
<br> 
"Amlae," he screamed, "Help." And she tried, 
but she couldn't pull him to his feet. The 
crowd kept shoving her away from him. Soon, the 
crowd was gone. Amlaith made her way to her 
brother's side. He was injured, but still 
breathing.<br>
<br>
A figure stepped away from the battle. The girl 
had never seen a Dark Elf, but one stood before 
her now, and she shivered with fright. He came 
straight towards them. He kicked her brother 
away from her, and over the side of their 
precious city in the sky. "He was weak," the 
course voice, "But you, my little one, I sense 
strength in you already. Join me and I can show 
you what that strength is capable of."<br>
<br>
"Never," Amlaith shouted, slowly moving towards 
the edge of the platform. Just before she 
jumped off, she shouted, "I'd rather die than 
join the likes of you."<br>
<br>
She expected a thousand horrible fates. To have 
an arrow shot through her from the dark elf 
above, to painfully slam into the forrest floor 
and die. What she didn't expect was that for 
her fall to slow, and to land safely on her 
feet. The wolf before her changed shape into 
its natural Elven form. Amlaith had heard of 
these shape-shifter druids, but she'd never met 
one. Even so, instantly, she knew what it 
was. "Stay with my friend here. Salayas will 
protect you." She indicated the wolf by her 
side.<br>
<br>
"Is he... Like you?" Amlaith asked.<br>
<br>
"No, he's not a druid, just a wolf. But don't 
be frightened, he'll protect you."<br>
<br>
The druid morphed back into a wolf form, and 
made her way back to the sky city to join in the 
fight, and Amlaith and her new companion slipped 
away into the forest. Amlaith would not return 
to the city, nor see another person, save for 
the occasional druid or ranger, until she was an 
adult. (Ok.. the stories A LOT longer, but you 
said brief, so I'm summing up a bunch to say she 
was raised in the wild and taught to be a druid 
by wolves, trees, and the occasional other druid)<br>
<br>
Many years went by. Eventually, Amlaith came 
upon the wood-elf city of Kelethin again. One 
of the guards asked her for her name. She gave 
the only name she could remember. The one her 
brother used to call her, the one he shouted 
before his death. "Amlae" <br>
<br>
Though the memories of that day had long since 
faded, the impact was still strong. She took a 
lift to the top of the city, and started walking 
around this foreign environment. Again, she was 
surrounded by people, shopping now instead of 
running. She became dizzy, disoriented, and 
very frightened. Soon, blackness came over 
her. When she awoke, she found herself in a 
cool building. Someone calmly spoke to 
her. "You're safe here. This is the home of the 
Kelethin's druids."<br>
<br>
She stayed with them until they were sure that 
she was ok. Quickly, they saw in her the skills 
of one of their own. They taught her a few 
things she hadn't yet learned. They knew she 
was one of their own, though she would probably 
not often frequent the city. When she left, 
they told her she should come back as often as 
she wanted to learn new things. (Again, 
skipping LOTS for the sake of brevity)<br>
<br>
More years passed. Very infrequently, Amlae, as 
everyone now new her, came to the city to learn 
a new spell, but for the most part, she stayed 
to the wilds of Norath, where she was far more 
at home. Her travels eventually took her to 
Luclin, where she met the Paladin Rowhin. A 
frenzied wolf had chased her up a tree. She was 
trying to figure out what was wrong with the she- 
wolf, but Rowhin killed the wolf, saving her 
life in the process. At first, Amlae was angry. 
He had killed the wolf before she had determined 
if it was necassary or not. She stormed off, 
leaving him confused.<br>
<br>
Later, when her temper cooled, she went back to 
the tree, and tracked the paladin to his camp, 
apologizing for her anger.<br>
<br>
That night, the two spoke of many things 
concerning the growing evil. He invited her to 
his fight, but she declined, explaining to him 
her problems with crowds, though not the origin 
of those problems. They went their seperate 
ways. Amlae continued to try and learn why the 
wolves of Luclin were so strangely afflicted. A 
few nights later, a sickly wind blew threw the 
trees, killing everything it touched. It 
whispered a name of evil that she couldn't quite 
understand. As the wind blew past her, she a 
cold deeper than death itself overcame her, 
bringing her to her knees as the breath was 
knocked from her. She didn't know what the 
message meant, and the only person she could 
think of that might was the paladin she had 
recently encountered.<br>
<br>
After a few inquiries, she found him in the 
rathetear mountains, trying to keep the current 
frenzy of giants at bay. She joined him in his 
effort against this foe, much stronger than she 
was, keeping him healed for his battles. In the 
small breaks they had, she told him of the 
message. She also told him that she was ready 
to join his fight. He told her he knew of one 
that might be able to discern what the message 
meant, perhaps even tell what the name she 
couldn't understand was. She agreed to the 
meeting.</p>
