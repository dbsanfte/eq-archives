<p><b>Character History</b></p>
<p align=left>My earliest memories are those of being left on my
own in Qeynos yard with a few scraps of food and
little more than a sharpened butter knife as a
weapon.Clearly, I was to fend for myself.<br>
<br>
I made my way, but grew angry and resentful as I
questioned many things Why was I here and who was
responsible for putting me here? Why did they
abandon me? Or had they met an early demise? I had
eschewed the gods and goddesses early on - they
weren't offering any help nor answers. Even today,
I hold them at arms length, though I have made
peace with the Light Dieties and better understand
their roles in the universe.<br>
<br>
The true turning point in my life was meeting
Juseanus near the Wind Spirit Song in Qeynos. He
saw the anger I held and recognized that the path
I would likely follow would be dark and tormented.
He befriended me, and being the clever fellow he
is, drew me into the League of Antonican Bards bit
by bit. I had always enjoyed listening to him sing
and play. Recognizing this, he and his mates at
the Wind Spirit tutored me in music and on various
instruments. In return, they asked me to run
errands for them, such as running reports for
their network of watchful eyes in Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Jeseanus eventually encouraged me to venture out
of Qeynos. "Musicians are a breed destined to
tour," he had told me all the time I had known
him. The stories of his days of travel made me
eager to begin my own journeys.<br>
<br>
I spent a few revolutions in the hills outside
Qeynos, then a couple more in the western Karana
plains. After that, my travels took me across
Antonica, but I felt the need to learn more of my
Elven heritage, so I sailed to Faydwer, spending
five revolutions amongst the Wood Elves and High
Elves who warmly accepted me. Still, the travel
beetle had bitten me hard, and I needed to move
on. Sailing back to Antonica, I grew familiar with
Freeport, but I preferred to set my camp outside
in the desertlands south of the city in lieu of
renting a room within the city walls. Two
revolutions later, we come to the area I presently
call home - the isle of Kunark. I'd heard stories
about it from the High Elves of Felwithe, but the
adventurer in me wanted to experience it
firsthand. For the past two - almost three -
revolutions, I have been enamored with the lush
lands and the still impressive ruins in the areas
I have explored.<br>
<br>
It seems so long ago before the disclipline of
music shaped the wayward energies I had, and the
companionship of the Qeynos bards instilled a
faith in many of my fellow Noratthians and a
desire aid in protecting the lands from the
ever-present forces of evil.</p>
