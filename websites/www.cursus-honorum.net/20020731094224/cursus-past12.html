<p><b>Mission into Nektulos</b></p>
<p align=left>Well met Lords and Ladies,<br>
<br>
Conflicts with the Teir'Dal have been on the rise in recent times. They have been growing more bold and threaten all that is benevolent. It is disturbing that they poison themselves with their beliefs in Innoruuk, but even more disturbing is they have taken up the practice of spreading their beliefs beyond their dark city.<br>
<br>
I have seen Barbarians, Halflings, and Humans bow before them. It is sickening that the Teir'Dal can corrupt the minds of others, for no sane being would willingly become one of their slaves. I had an opportunity to speak briefly with a Barbarian while attempting to rescue her. She proclaimed her alliegence to a sect of Teir'Dal known as the Violent Harvest. She refused to leave and called the guards upon me. I made a hasty exit and escaped, after a lengthy chase. I cannot forget the look in her eyes. At first she was cold, as if she had no soul, however, when she called for the guards, her voice was enraged but her eyes were sad. Despite her proclamation I am not convinced that she is there by her own will.<br>
<br>
Most Teir'Dal will never walk in the light, but there are hope for some. A few have proven themselves to possess good intentions. I believe that it is the doctrinal and oppresive upbringing that clouds their minds. It may yet be possible to save many Teil'Dal before they are irrevocably commited to a life of anguish.<br>
<br>
On the 19th of January I intend to lead a band of faithful follows into the Nektulos Forest. We will make our way to a fallen tree where younger Teir'Dal hunt and preach to them the benefits of the light. We will offer our blessings and try to save as many as we can. Should we find amongst them those who are not Teir'dal, then we shall double our efforts to restore logic to their minds and hope to their hearts.<br>
<br>
Many of those we encounter will not listen and some may become angry, and even call for the guards. We will come in peace, but we must be prepared to face a potential conflict. It is vital that the bridge spanning the Nerrius river remains passable for us, in case we are forced to withdrawl from the forest. A group of volunteers will maintain watch over the bridge to ensure our safe passage.<br>
<br>
It is our duty to save as many as we can before condeming them to their fate. The task will not be easy, but few things worth doing are.<br>
<br>
I await your reply with eagerness. May you enjoy Erollisi's embrace.<br>

<p>Results</p>
<p align=left>The Teir'Dal offered as much resistance as expected. A scarce few listened to our words but were quickly overshadowed by General Zirrix. He clearly demonstrated that he remained in control of the woods surrounding Neriak. Teir'Dal would grovel before him and make excuses for their being there, most of which blamed me. As resolved as ever, I continued to preach the benefits of the light, I even recited the thirty rules of courtly love, but few would listen with the general looming over them. I fear that the Teir'Dal are quite determined to remain shrouded in darkness, at least as long as their leaders remain in power. It is a shame, for many that could be saved will certainly fall to the sword. So be it, we did try to save them peaceably in earnest first. We cannot be held responsible if Innoruuk grips them too tight. I keep thinking of that old Human proverb, "Feel no guilt, ye who wields thy blade in the name of Erollisi Marr." The time for war has not yet come, but I will make sure preparations are underway.<br>
<br>
Even though it seems that the Teir'Dal are to be condemed, I will still try to save the non-Teir'Dal who have fallen under Innoruuk's curse. There is one Barbarian in particular that I will pay attention to. I believe she calls herself Payle. Last time I heard from her she was making explicit threats against me, howsoever, she still listens to what I say. She is defiant for now, but there is hope for her. In time she may yet be saved.<br>
