<p align=left>Welcome to our newest member, Caivn. He is a 26 Human Monk. May you find peace with Quellious.<br>

Our Gnome race went off today with success. Participation was good and I got a lot of positive feedback from our players. Special thanks to Gnomore of the Legion of Heroes who graciously donated 5,000 platinum to our purse. Thanks to Ciranaxil for being our race director and making sure everything went smooth.<br>
<br>
Travel well,<br>

<p align=left>Congratulations to Elyar on achieving your 51st level.<br>
<br>
The Gnome race is getting ever closer. Please reply to the message on our <a href="http://www.cursus-honorum.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=282">forums</a> or talk to Ciranaxil in-game or by email if you wish to participate. Some players will receive special instructions just prior to the race. This is an offical Cursus Honorum event so points for events and campaigns will be awarded to you or a character of your choice if you are playing a gnome runner.<br>
<br>
Safe journeys,<br>
<br>

<p align=left>Welcome to our newest members. Filivaa is a 10 Koada'Dal mage. I am certain that he will make us proud. Also, you might remember the druken Dwarf who provided clues regarding the serpent's spine. He is a 12 Cleric and joining us has not curbed his taste for frothy brews in the slightest.<br>
