<p align=left>To my friend and Lord, Rohwin Ardour,<br>
<br>
Forgive me for my absense, but a matter of great importance has consumed me. Two moons ago my mate sailed across the Ocean of Tears on a matter of business for her Lord. The waters were filled with unforgiving storms. Her ship never reached its port on Faydwer. Since I learned of her disappearance, I have been searching the seas.<br>
<br>
At first, I booked passage on the Siren's Bale, but Captain Jibb was unwilling to take her very far from her normal course. He was more concerned with arriving to his port with as much haste the sails would provide. To conduct a better search, I chartered a sea-worthy vessel with a crew of eight. We sailed to the known islands and explored the open sea, but no sign of my beloved could be found. My wealth was depleting rapidly and before long I was forced to charter a smaller vessel with a crew of three. I wanted to sail ever further into the unknown reaches of the ocean, but the crew became worrysome of storms and sea-beasts. I insisted on continuing our search, and risked mutiny several times. When it became clear to them that I would no longer be able to pay them they set sail back for Erollisi Island and left me on its beaches. I constructed a narrow boat with outriggers, much like the ones my ancestors used to make. The island offered no suitable material for a sail, so used my own furs to catch the wind, but most of my traveling was propelled by the large double ended paddle I carved. I spent weeks floating in the waters. When the seas were rough I was rocked by waves and when it was calm I was blistered by the sun. The elements gave me no rest. After I was weakened by thirst and hunger, the weather, and my boat taking on water, I finally came to feel the reality of my loss. I headed back for Erollisi Island.<br>
<br>
The Island was in sight when my boat finally submitted to the sea and sank beneath me. I abandoned my heavy equipment to the depths and swam the remaining distance to Erollisi Island. The sisters there restored my body, but my mind was still uneasy. After a few days the Siren's Bale made a routine stop at the island and the sisters convinced Captain Jibb to haul me back to Freeport, where I was uncerimoniously dumped onto the docks.<br>
<br>
With little more than my tartan, and nothing to protect my feet, I ran through the country-side. I ignored all the onlookers and ran as fast as I could. I stopped for nothing; I ran day and night. I neither slept nor ate while I ran. I can only account my survival to the Hammers. My focus was so intense that I did not feel the cold or the pain, I never slowed, I just ran continuosly. I do not know how long I ran, I climbed mountains, swam rivers, and out-paced many beasts. Near the end of my journey I trudged through waist deep snow. My steps were slower, but my heart still pounded as all my strength was devoted to keep moving ahead. All my senses were numb, my vision was a mere blur, but I saw a light ahead of me and traveled towards it. It must have been night-time, for everything around me was dark, except for a single light ahead of me. It got brighter as I approached it. Finally, I was standing before the source of the light, and for the first time in a very long time I stood still. I stared at the light for a long time, then realized it was a torch. Below the torch was a banner, I reached out and touched its surface, as if to try and feel the pattern that was woven into it. I could not feel my own fingers, but I could now see the banner after much concentration. It was the banner of Halas, I was home. Then my vision faded and I slumped into the snow.<br>
<br>
Someone found my body and dragged it into the city, where the elder shamans examined me. They used their magiks to help my body recover and saved my life. Even after I was conscious and my senses returned to my body, I was still very weak and my body filled with pain. I felt like running again but my legs were unwilling to let me stand. An elder came before me and told me that I must find myself before I can leave Halas again. I asked him how I could do so, and he said that only I can know the answer to that question, but he would help me.<br>
<br>
He had me carried to a cave on the out-skirts of the city. In a larger chamber deep inside there was a fire burning. I was placed before the fire with a bear skin draped over my shoulders. He knelt before me and painted my face with blue designs of my ancestors. While he painted, he explained that he would send someone to bring me food and drink once a day, and four times a day someone would tend to the fire. He said I was to remain here until I found my answers.<br>
<br>
I stared into the flames day after day, never knowing what I was looking for, but it was very peaceful. My mind searched for a solution to my problems, but eventually I stopped trying, I just stared at the flames. I thanked the fire for its warmth and I thanked the cave for its shelter. I thanked the bear for the use of its fur and for the meat that I ate. I began to think of and speak with other spirits. I spoke to the trees whose wood I was burning, to the ground which I was sitting on, to a spider that crept along the walls. One day I spoke with my caretaker. She jumped when I greeted her. Even though she has been tending my fire four times a day, this is the first time I ever really noticed her. She was a young female. She would not be fully grown for another five years I suspected. When I tried to speak with her, my words came out garbled and hoarse. I realized that I had not actually spoken aloud for weeks, when I spoke with the spirits it was mere mumbling. The girl watched my with curiousity and caution as I coughed and cleared my throat. I asked her how long I have been here and she told me that she has been tending to my needs for more then two moons. I was alarmed that I had been here so long, then I asked her for a quill and paper. She ran off to fetch them for me. It was when she returned that I began to scribe this letter for you.<br>
<br>
I have been gone so long that you must have thought I was dead. I pray that things go well for you and for Norrath. I will return to you again, but for now I must remain here and finish what I have started. I believe I now understand what it is I seek. I do not know how long it will take to find my answers, but I am confident that I will recover.<br>
<br>
May the Hammers watch over you,<br>
<br>
