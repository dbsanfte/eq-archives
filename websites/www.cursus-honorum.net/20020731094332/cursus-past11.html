<p><b>The search for our young volunteers</b></p>
<p>Official log entry: October 14, 01 by Regent Rohwin Amoure Ardour</p>
<p align=left>When General Alderelm learned of his daughter's rescue he was overcome with joy. He thanked our efforts with enthusiasm and provided rewards for our young volunteers. He also saw fit to strengthen his alliance with Cursus Honorum. He has deployed a significant number of troops to relieve our forces at Castle Mistmoore. He has even volunteered to oversee the siege there for the time being. With his support I was able to offer rest to our fatigued troops, and I too have been relieved of duty for awhile. I will take this opportunity to attend to other matters of importance.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that while Platicia ventured foolishly and ill-prepared, she did gather important information as she intended, although its relevance is unbeknownst to her. Since her escape, the Orcs have been trying ever harder to recapture her. All their attempts at kidnapping have been thwarted. The cost of their efforts have out-weighed any ransom that they had hoped to gain nor has their efforts been consistant with the value and satisfaction of revenge. She must have seen or heard something that is of extreme importance. We have questioned her several times but have discovered nothing. Platicia has been shipped to a safer place, a place kept secret from everyone but her father. Our latest intelligence says that Tier'Dal operatives are now seeking out the ones who rescued her. It is believed that they may know something of great value, although its importance may not be recognized immeadiately. We too are seeking out the recuers, but since their mission was completed they have slipped away into obscurity. They must be found before the Tier'Dal get to them.</p>

<p>Official log entry: November 12, 01 by Regent Rohwin Amoure Ardour</p>
<p align=left>We have had some success in locating one of our volunteers, a young ranger named Lladarie. I just received word from the Fier'Dal rangers in Lesser Faydark that she has sought shelter with them. Apparently while she was hunting in the forest she noticed that she was being followed. She tried to see who her pursuers were but they proved too elusive. She did manage to see a few silhouettes, but their identity remains a mystery. Fear of being attacked by unknown assailants caused Lladarie to seek protection with the rangers stationed in Faydark. They are guarding her now until we can retrieve her safely from the forest. The rangers of Lesser Faydark have made sweeps of the area to find her pursuers. They found evidence of numerous people close to the station, but they cannot say who they are or what their motives may be. We shall send a well-armed party to escort her safely from the Forest.<br>
<br>
OOC: This event has been scheduled for Saturday, November 17th at 700pm PST. Gather at the zone to Greater Faydark and we will make a procession to the ranger station. After the event we will hold an impromptu raid. The location of the raid will depend on who shows up. Feel free to invite any role-playing friends you know.</p>
<br>
<p>Results:</p>
<p align=left>Lladarie has been succesfully retrieved from the forest of Faydark, but not without incident...<br>
<br>
When we thought we were safe at the ranger station, we were ambushed by a powerful group of Teir'Dal. They forced us out into the dark forest and left many of us mortally wounded. Lucky for us Lady Splendor remained safe behind a tree When the Tier'Dal left, she was able to practice her arts and saved everyone in the party. However, Lladarie was no where to be found.<br>
<br>
We deduced that the attack was meant as a diversion so that Lladarie could be abducted. After careful examination of the evidence at hand, we concluded that her abductors were not from Neriak, but were agents of Castle Mistmoore. We hastened to pursue Lladarie and shortly there after found ourselves below the great castle walls.<br>
<br>
The already present siege was furious and Mistmoore's defenses were at full strength. Lady Splendor's champion, a sturdy Dwarf named Belwair, knew of a place where a small party such as ours could sneak past the front-lines. We exploited this advantage and we soon found ourselves on the way to the front gates of Mistmoore. Once inside their defenses we were set upon time after time by Teir'Dal and their undead creations. We were able to fight our way into the castle, due to the majority of their forces being commited to the front-lines, even so, we found little time to rest as we were continuously attacked by small patrols. We rampaged through the castle in search of Lladarie.<br>
<br>
After an extensive search we found her bound in a chamber below the jail. Her captor had fled shortly before our arrival, but would no doubt bring back a substantial force to contend with in a short time, so Elyar channeled his power to open a shimmering portal that our rescue party and Lladarie stepped through. In little longer then a mere moment, we found ourselves in the safety of Greater Faydark, a short distance from Felwithe. Everyone was releived to be out of that evil stronghold.</p>
