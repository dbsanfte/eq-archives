		<B><U>Code of Nobility</U></B><BR>
	<br>
			<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p align=left>The Code of Nobility is designed to keep our guild in good standing with other players in Norrath. It also describes the characteristics we desire in our own members. It supports good role-playing and good will towards others. It also details the characteristics that make for an undesirable player, and attempts to define such terms like farming or twinking. The majority of the code is simple common sense but it is important to document any rules that we hold dear.<p>
<p align=left>No in-game meetings will be held. They simply do not work. There is always someone who cannot make it. In the game people may wish to bring up issues, but they will not be resolved on the spot. All voting will be done by E-mail. If there is an emergency and an on-line decision is needed immediately, then the Regent or Vice-Regent may make a summary decision, until an E-mail vote can be made. If neither the Regent or Vice-Regent are on-line then a vote can be made by any High-Council members present. Any such on-line decision should be mailed to the Regent.</p>
<p align=left>Any code of conduct is only valid if it is upheld and enforced by those who have sworn to live by it. I understand that there are exceptions to every rule, but we must strive to set an example to the other players on Norrath. If we can do this and maintain a reputation of being a quality guild, then we truly are noble.</p>
<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p align=left>
1.	Be courteous to others. This includes guild-mates and those outside the guild. Always be polite to fellow players, even if they are being rude to you. As long as you are fair and honest, people will respect you even if they disagree with you. Always show respect for others and be supportive. Behind every character is a real person and we are all here to have fun.</p>
<p align=left>
2.	Teach other players the skills of successfully playing the game. If you see someone doing things that are foolish or possibly going to kill players then give them advice on how to play better. But never come off as superior, rude, or arrogant, otherwise people will automatically become very defensive and disregard whatever you have to say.</p>
<p align=left>
3.	Role-playing is highly encouraged. The more you role play your character, the more interesting and fun it is for everyone. Role playing doesn't necessarily mean speaking in old english, but it is often fun to do so. It really means controling your character how they would respond to differnet situations, not how you personally would resond. Role playing also means, not refering to modern devices or real life things and events. Sometimes it is necessary to break character to communicate with those around you more effectivly, like when auctioning or seeking a group. However, an extra effort should be made when talking in "say" or "guildsay" mode. People who don't know you might not realize that you are role-playing. If they become confused or offended you might send them a tell explaining that you are only role-playing.</p>
<p align=left>
4.	Assist guild mates when possible. We are all here for each other and should lend a hand whenever possible. You are by no means obligated to help when asked. If you are too busy or the request is unreasonable then say so. You do not need to offer discounts to guild members when selling loot or trade skill items. By the same token, do not price gouge guild-mates either. Just be honest with everyone and lend a hand when you can.</p>
<p align=left>
5.	Do not exploit loopholes in the game. This is a role-playing guild and an adventure game. We are not here to see if we can "beat" the game. It is the journey that is important, not the end goal. The experience of playing the game is what makes it worthwhile.</p>
<p align=left>
6.	There are no creatures that are exempt from hunting. The intention is that if you are role-playing a character, then your character will not wish to hunt certain creatures. Don't hunt guards and merchants for their experience. If you have a quest to kill them then do so, or go hunt the guards of our enemies, but don't kill friendly guards just because you can fix your faction later. Also, don't hunt guards that are protecting newbies. New players depend on guards for safe hunting.</p>
<p align=left>
7.	We discourage twinking, but you may play your characters any way you see fit. Use your own judgement on what is acceptable twinking. Also, it is not the funtion of this guild to twink its own members. No one will ever be obligated to give away equipment, or to sell at extremely good deals. Please do not ask your guildmates for free equipment. Remember, it is much more rewarding if characters earns their bounty on their own. Twinking is hard to define, but I have written an <a href="cursus-twinking.html">editorial</a> that attempts to define twinking. I hope it helps.</p>
<p align=left>
8.	 Do not farm items that are below your level of experince and deprive honest players of loot and experience. However, do not miss out on the game either. If there is an item that you have never looted before, by all means go hunt for it, but once you have it do not continue to retrieve the item for easy money. Also, if the item is far below your level of experience and another group wishes to hunt there that is appropriate level, then you should step down and give them the spot. If the loot in question is something you really want or need then use good judgement and be fair with those around you.</p>
<p align=left>
9.	Do not kill steal. Killing another group's target is totally unacceptable. You cannot deprive another player of loot and experience, especially when the creature in question may be carrying something very valuable. Accidents happen, if you accidentally kill someone else's creature, then you should apologize and give them what ever loot you got from it. If someone is intentionally kill stealing your targets then you should tell them to stop, if they do not then report them to a GM immediately.</p>
<p align=left>
10. Do not spam your guildmates. Many of the E-mail addresses listed on this site are primary and personal addresses. Do not give away other peoples addresses without their consent. The addresses are listed so that we may contact each other if necessary, but frequent or unnecessary E-mails can be cumbersome. Also, most E-mail accounts have a space limit. Sending screenshots or other large files can fill someone's mailbox rapidly and prevent them from receiving mail that is truly important to them. We will be using E-mail frequently, but please use good judgement on what is appropriate to send.</p>
<p align=left> 
11.	Do not swear across guildsay, shout, ooc etc… It is mixed company and you cannot be sure someone won't be offended. If you don't know who you are talking to it shows very poor taste to swear at them. Even if someone deserves it, it shows a lot more class to say something more creative without swearing and without breaking character.</p>
<p align=left>
12.	If you have a problem with a guild-mate and you cannot resolve it yourself, then send a tell or E-mail to the Regent or your High Council representative. Do not make a private problem public by announcing over guildsay what is happening.</p>
<p align=left>
13.	When using guildsay, do not spam your guild-mates. Do not use guildsay as a private channel, unless you feel everyone needs to hear you. Do not use guildsay in place of your groupsay. The exception is when there is a guild event and several groups are hunting together, then using guildsay may become necessary. There is enough information rolling across everyone's screens already. When you have a lot of guild-mates on-line,  guildsay could go out of control.</p>
<p align=left>
14.	Don't take advantage of a player's mistake or inexperience. If a player makes an honest mistake in your favor do not exploit it. Do not cheat someone else of there rightful property.</p>
<p align=left>
15.	Participate in guild events and be an active member. The more we do together the stronger we will become. The more active our guild is the better our reputation will be.</p>
<p align=left>
16. The "message of the day" is reserved for the Regent and Vice-Regent only. Also, it should only be used to notify the guild of important matters of concern to everyone. The only exception is if there is an emergency situation where the guild needs to be informed in less then 24 hours, then any officer may post a "message of the day."</p>
<p align=left>
17.	Most important, have fun playing the game. We are all here for the fun. If you are not having fun then we need to do something to change that.</p>

<p><b>Recruitment Standards</b></p>
<p align=left>
	Recruiting new members is the duty of every member of Cursus Honorum. The more people we have the more powerful we will become, but it will all be for naught if the wrong people are recruited. Anyone that you think would fit well into the guild should already follow the Code of Nobility, or some kind of similar standards. It doesn't matter if they are not the best players in the game. As long as they are nice and cooperative things will be fine. We can always teach people how to play, but if they're a bunch of loud mouth whiners then we want nothing to do with them. I have written an editorial, "<a href="cursus-whyjoinaguild.html">Why join a guild?</a>", to help explain what people should look for when seeking a guild.
</p>
<p align=left>No members will be recruited below level 10. This is to ensure players learn something of the game for themselves and establish how they wish to play before being influenced by the guild. It also lets them experience grouping with undesirable people so they know what to look for in a bad player and can further appreciate belonging to a quality guild.</p>
<p align=left>Cursus Honorum is a role playing guild. Those who join should enjoy role playing. If someone does not have a specific history for their character before they join, this is ok. Many characters will form motivations and histories as they play. What is important is that members of this guild have the desire to role play their characters.</p>
<p align=left>Since this is a role playing guild with an active storyline, some characters will not be allowed to join. Evil races, such as Trolls, Ogres, and Iksar will not be allowed in. Tier'Dal may be allowed in as long as they choose to role-play their characters in a good manner. In addition to the regular recruitment procedures, Tier'Dal will need to submit a written account of their character's history, justifying why their character has joined the forces of good. The classes Shadow Knight and Necromancer will also not be allowed in. Also, those who worship evil deities like Innoruuk, Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, and Veeshan cannot join this guild. The decision for not allowing these types of characters into the guild is solely for the role-play element. There are no good methods to check what deity someone follows. It is trusted that our members will be honest about this fact. People who wish to role play their characters typically choose their deity carefully and wish to role play their characters accordingly, so I do not forsee any problems with anyone attempting to bypass our character restrictions.</p>
<p align=left>Should some who are not allowed into the guild based on class or deity want to join us, then it will be the discretion of the High-Council to decide if an exception should be made. Being made an exception to the rules will not be easy. We will certainly require the prospective member to undergo much more effort then other applicants, to test their role-play skills and sincerity about wishing to join us and play "good." It should be said that the mechanics of the game will restrict evil characters who are played good. Even though everyone should be good aligned, it is understood that there may be times when a character needs to break from role-play to satisfy some element of the game, such us completing an evil epic quest. When one of these reformed evil characters needs to complete an evil quest, they may not find support from their guild-mates. Other players may not wish to incur a faction penalty against "good", or there may be a simple role-play issue, like refusing to help kill Halflings. Reformed evil players need to be aware of these potential problems and accept the consequences of their choices.</p>
<p align=left>People with "funny" names typically don't work out so well. Good role-players usually have a name with a more "fantasy" feel to it. I have noticed that people who put more thought into choosing a name are typically better players. There are of course many exceptions and we will deal with them as they come along.</p>
<p align=left>Before recruiting someone, you should spend some time with the prospective recruit. If you can't group with the prospective members then recommend them to guild-mates that can group with them. The prospective members should want to join us, or least want to learn more about us. When talking to them about the guild always be very truthful, it does no good to talk someone into joining if they decide they don't like it and quit early. Talk to them about ordinary stuff, get a feel for what kind of person you are talking to. Observe them in action, possibly help them out a little and see how they perform and how they treat their group mates. See how appreciative they are for what little assistance you can provide for them.  Always send them to the web-site to check us out and tell them to send you a "tell" after they've been to the web-site. If they contact you again later then they are probably serious about joining.</p>
<p align=left>Recruitment should be difficult to ensure we get the right people. Once you have determined that they will make a good member and they want to join then it is time to apply. An officer in the guild must vouch for the new applicant. Officers are any members or previous members of the High-Council and of course the Regent. Officer status will be noted on the individual member profiles. Once an officer has vouched for the new applicant then all they need to do is go the web-site, read the rules of the guild and understand and agree with the rules. If they have questions or problems with the rules then they should ask someone before they apply. They can talk to their recruiter, any officer, or the Regent either on-line or by E-mail. Once they agree with the rules then they can apply on the web-site. Part of the application asks them who vouched for them and who is most responsible for recruiting them into the guild. The voucher can be any officer in the guild. It is the responsibilty of the voucher to ensure that the applicant will make a good member. The recruiter can be anyone in the guild. New applicants must choose who is most responsible for their recruitment. They can only choose one person. Whoever they declare as their recruiter will be the one who earns the political point. The recruiter and the voucher might be the same person, but not necessarily. Once the Regent has confirmed that the new recruit has a proper voucher then the Regent will E-mail the guild to announce that we will have a new member. At this point the next officer who finds our newest member on-line may issue the invite command. You may of course tell the Regent ahead of time that you are vouching for a new member to speed up the process, but the recruit must visit the web-site to read all the rules and apply before anyone can be invited into the guild. Some members of the guild have been appointed as Viceroys. They have officer status and may invite new members with the permission of a regular officer.  A Viceroy is not a valid voucher. Their funtion is to make it easier to invite approved applicants.</p>
<img src="/images/spear2.gif" width=550 height=15>
<p><b>Discharging and Punishment</b></p>
<p align=left>

If a member is blatantly disregarding the guild rules in the extreme then they may be summarily judged and booted from the guild by any officer on-line. They should be warned that their actions are inappropriate, if they refuse to change their ways then you should tell them the specific reasons they are being booted and then boot them. The regent should be involved in such a serious case but if he isn't on-line then proceed without the Regent and E-mail a detailed report of the removal. Understand that this would have to be an extreme case to warrant such action. An example might be intentionally training griffons on newbies for the fun of it, then bragging about it and saying how stupid everyone else is. The report will be mailed to the High Council where they will either affirm the decision to expel the member or call for a trial (see below.)</p>
<p align=left>
In cases that are less severe then a complaint should be presented to the Regent or the offending player's High Council representative by "tell" or by E-mail. Either may try to rectify the situation, but if the problem cannot be resolved and enough evidence is presented, then a trial will be called for. A detailed description will be mailed to the offender and to the High Council. The offender has a few days to reply (a deadline date will be included in the E-mail) in his or her defense then the High Council will vote a few days later. The High Council may vote to keep, remove, or punish the offender. If someone wants to look into the matter further then he or she may E-mail the parties involved, ask on-line, or ask the Regent to seek answers for the High Council. If more time is needed to vote then someone on the High Council may move for a postponement. The Regent will decide if a postponement is warranted and when the new voting deadline will be. What ever the High Council votes will be done. If punishment is called for then High Council members may suggest what will be done but the decision will be made by an agreement between the offender's High Council representative and the Regent. If the offender is a High Council member then the offender may not vote of course and the Regent will decide any punishment. If the Regent is the offender, then he may not be removed from the guild but may be punished. The High Council may determine the punishment and the Regent will comply. Punishments should fit the crimes. It is trusted that nothing outrageous will be demanded of a minor infraction. If members are discharged from the guild or leave before completing their punishment, then they will be added to a list of previous members with dishonor.</p>
<p align=left>
	When members leave the guild their names will be put on a list. There are those who left with honor and those who left with dishonor. Members who simply quit the guild on there own accord will be listed as previous members with honor, unless there are special circumstances surrounding their quitting. The Regent or anyone on the High Council may call for a vote to determine if a leaving member has dishonor. Members who are leaving the guild will also be noted whether or not they were an initiate for determining future political points. If a previous member with dishonor wants to rejoin the guild, they may get a voucher and apply like any other prospective member. However, before they will be allowed to join, the High Council will vote on whether or not they will be accepted back into the guild. Furthermore, if they have been punished, but failed to carry out their punishment, the High Council will vote if punishment is still necessary and to what extent. Previous members with honor my apply and join as normal, but any political points they had are lost and they have to start fresh.</p>
