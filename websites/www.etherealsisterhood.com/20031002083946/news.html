<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0" width=40%></FONT></B></CENTER>
Starting Thursday September 4, 2003 there will be a recruitment contest open 
to all members and officers of the Ethereal Sisterhood.
<BR><BR>
So here's how it works:
<BR><BR>
First you find 5 players over level 40 and get them to join the sisterhood. 
Tell them to come to the message boards and post their application. Two 
officers then interview the recruit and if all goes well they are tagged 
into the guild. Make sure when they post their application that they were 
referred by you.
<BR><BR>
The first Sister to refer 5 40+ players gets 3,000pp!
<BR><BR>
Conditions**:
<BR><BR>
1. These must be new players, former sisters do not count.<BR>
2. No alts! If you find someone with 5 level 40 characters that still only 
counts as 1 player.<BR>
3. The new recruits must stay members for at least 1 month. Make sure once 
your referals are tagged that the dates of tagging are posted on the message 
boards.<BR>
4. This contest is only open to current sisters. If someone joins tomorrow 
they may not participate.<BR>
5. As it stands this contest will end November 4, 2003. Thats 2 months to 
find 5 members.<BR>
6. The money will be paid out of my pocket not the guild fund.<BR>
7. No one is allowed to /ooc for new members. Prospects should be friends or 
players you have at least grouped with.
<BR><BR>
Good luck to everyone! Please be careful who you recommend, we want good 
players who will stay with our family. No jerks!
<BR><BR>
**conditions subject to change if I find I've left anything out that would 
be unfair to the guild<BR><BR>

      color=#c0c0c0 size=3>  Guild Raid * Runneyeye* May 17th! 
<P>
 There will be a raid set tentatively for Sat. May 17 at 5pm PST. This will be an 
 ES only raid. There will be no XP as Llinda will be leading the raid but all 
 levels 13-30 are welcome. Loot will be rolled on for decent drops and for garbage 
 sold to vendors and money will be given to guild bank. Please let Llinda or Serenah 
 know if you will be coming so we know if the turn out will be enough to hold the 
 raid proper.

      color=#c0c0c0 size=3>  Jaed Week 5/16/2003!
<P>	  	  
I am committing to play Jaed all this week. Both to get some xp to stay with 
the pack and also because Jaed's Bday is on May 16th!
<P>
To celebrate this I would like to get some xp and also hit some milestones 
(quests) that I have been working on for some time.
<P>
I know Jaed week sounds really vain (more like something Suchos would do 
hehe) but I think it will still be a lot of fun and it would be nice to 
finally get these quests out of the way. Part of the reason I havent been 
playing Jaed so much of late is because I feel frustrated because I have 
felt stuck.
<P>
I ask my sisters to help me in this my time of need. (I guess its like 
having a mid-life (or mid-level) crisis. OMG Im a year old and still dont 
have my epic kinda thing. hehe)
<P>
So with Jaed week in mind.
<P>
Mon - Jaed needs a new ring. ( I have been working on my Coldain ring quest 
for some time however I need a solid group of 50+ (or 2 of 40+) to kill the 
last few mobs.) I have most of the quest done, its just a matter of a few 
key kills to complete it. It will take 2-3 hours to complete. Everyone who 
wants to help please meet at the PoK book in Great Divide around 6pm PST 
Monday May 12th
<P>
Tues - Reavers! - We proved last Sat we could handle the Reavers with a 
little help from our friends. Within an hour we had a force together and 
were in CoM beating down Black Reavers. With the advance notice I hope we 
can put an equal sized (or larger) group against the Reavers. Several 
members are in need of the Jade Reaver as well as me so lets cross our 
fingers and plan on camping them for 3 hours or so and hope we get at least 
1 or 2. Lets meet at Nexus stone in PoK at 6pm PST Tuesday May 13th
<P>
Wed - Jaed xp day! I wont be on until later that evening 9-10 pm PST (I 
would like to get an all sister group going then and keep it going for 
awhile. I dont really care where.)
<P>
Thurs - Reavers revisited? Depending upon our success on Tues lets either do 
it again (or if we get the Jade reaver on Tues, possibly go after Venril 
Sathirs remains. Everything I have read says if you are able to do reavers 
the rest of the epic isnt much harder except the final part where you kill 
Innoruuk. I am not expecting to complete my epic, in a week however, it 
would be nice to get closer. Lets meet same time same place Nexus stone POK 
at 6pm PST. We will decide on target area at that time depending on how 
things go from earlier in the week.
<P>
Friday - Jaeds bday. I will have a party with plenty to drink! We havent had 
a naked, drunken, swimming party in a long time. Perhaps its time for a 
night of debauchery! Presents are welcome but not necessary
<P>
Where becomes a problem. The best zones for this I think are Felwithe and 
West Freeport, however, I know many in the guild are unable to go to Felwithe
and probably even more or unable to go to West Freeport. (There are places 
to swim and alcohol readily available in both places) I am open to 
suggestions of other places. The location will be announced in guild chat. 
The Time will be 12am (thats midnight) on Friday the 16th. I always get 
confused myself so I will spell it out. Thats Thursday evening as soon as it 
turns midnight right after whatever we do on Thursday night. (I have RL 
plans for Friday evening so cant celebrate then)
<P>
I dont expect anyone to join me every night. I know we all have other 
committments in RL and even within the game. Its supposed to be fun so lets 
all have a great time and I thank you ahead of time for making Jaed week an 
awesome and fun week hehe.
</P>

<P><a href="pic/GetSebKey.jpg">Picture of Seb Key Turn in Spot.</a></P>

<P>	  
	Well we raided and we had a pretty good time.
<P>
The raid started off with me logging on after 5...so bad raid leader hehe. 
We were all at the TT/EJ zone by 5:15 so that wasn't so bad.
<P>
It did take us another 45 minutes to actually reach Sebillis due to agro and 
a few people getting lost. Not bad for a first time trip but could be 
better.
<P>
We zoned in and of course NG was camped. The bank was open though and I knew 
our force could fare well there. Gradually we began clearing the Zone in 
towards the Jail. As we pulled 3-spawn though we had a small problem and 
Jaed was killed. We were however saved by someone's friend Epyionn and he 
rezzed Jaed and hit us all with BoA. With our new buffs and after the death 
we were determined. We cleared through and managed to clear the bank for 
quite a while.
<P>
We got a few spells and we also made a bit of money for the guild bank.
<P>
Thank you all for coming, it was fun. Sorry to those who were unable to 
attend.
