<u>**Guild Raid** Monday December 8th, 2003</u><BR>
  
Ok this is it! We are going to the Temple of Veeshan to try our luck in the Halls of Testing!
<P>
Who: All 50+ Sisters with dubious or better Claws of Veeshan faction.<BR>
Where: Temple of Veeshan(ToV)<BR>
When: Monday December 8, 2003 6:30 PST 9:30 EST<BR>
What: Halls of Testing (HoT)<BR>
Why: For Skyshrine Armor drops!<BR>
Raid Leader: Suchos<BR>
<BR>
BRING YOUR RESIST GEAR! ALL OF IT! There will be fire/ice dragons as well as some poison and disease casters.
<BR><BR>
How do you test your CoV faction? Get a port to cobalt scar and con any of the wyverns. If it says threateningly or scowling then you are KOS. Only those with Ally, Warmly, Kindly, Amiable, Indifferent, Apprehensive or Dubious are able to attend a HoT raid.
<BR><BR>
Why can't you be KoS to CoV? Because you will get yourself and others killed too much.
<BR><BR>
How can you raise your CoV faction? Killing Giants in any of the Velious zones.
<BR><BR>
Since this will be the first time for many of you entering ToV we'll travel together. If a guild druid/wiz is available we'll try to set up ports to Cobalt Scar from the PoK bank. To save time though, it might not be a bad idea to get a ride to CS from any one you can.
<BR><BR>
We will hang out at the CS ring until the majority of the raid force has arrived.
<BR><BR>
When we head out we'll swim to Siren's Grotto and evac across the zone to the WW zone. We'll sow up and run through the western wastes to the Temple of Veeshan. 
<BR><BR>
This should be a fun night and one of the biggest challenges we've come across. Hopefully we'll get some good drops.

<u>**Guild Raid** Monday November 17th, 2003</u><BR>
Where: Veksar<BR>
What: Highborn Nobles<BR>
Who: All 45+ are welcome to attend.<BR>
When: Monday at 9:30pm EST 6:30pm PST<BR>
Hosted by: Suchos<BR>
<BR>
Our last raid went really well. We learned where a few of the named spawn.
<BR><BR>
We didn't get a good chance at the nobles last time, and I left one of the PHs untouched not knowing he was a PH. So hopefully we'll see what those nobles have for us.
<BR><BR>
We'll also check in on the chef in the kitchen, and those drogmors with the sweet caster hats if time permits...or if we find the nobles are being stingy.
<BR><BR>
MEET IN Veksar at 9:30 EST! If you don't know the way be in PoK at 9pm EST at the FV stone.
