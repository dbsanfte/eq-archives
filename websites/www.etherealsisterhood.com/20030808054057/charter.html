	<CENTER><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=4><b><u>Guild 
      Charter of the<br> Ethereal Sisterhood</u></CENTER></FONT></P>
     
 <P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=3><b>The Ethereal Sisterhood is dedicated to the
  advancement of the image of the Female Adventurer in society by being positive role models
   for young women who wish to follow in the footsteps of our pioneering and adventurous
    foremothers.</FONT></P>

 <P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=3><b>The orphanages of Norrath have been a constant
  source of young, starry-eyed dreamers, whose only role model, however, who has been offered
   is a sexy looking woman with red hair in a revealing, chain mail bikini, who is portrayed
    as a brawny man-hating loner.</FONT></P>

 <P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=3><b>While there is nothing wrong with being sexy, or
  red-haired, and the choice of clothing is truly a personal matter, other role model choices
   must be given to these young women that are more realistic, and feminine to them.  An
    intelligent sorceress, a wise woods-woman, a cunning rogue, a virtuous paladin, a
	 resourceful nature-loving druid, the clever enchantress, the caring and sharing
	  cleric and the courageous beastlord all make truly excellent role models for young
	   women, as do the many other professions pursued by the membership of the Ethereal
	    Sisterhood.</FONT></P>
		
 <P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=3><b>Through our skills, we demonstrate that we are
  every bit the equal of our male counterparts.  We sometimes even exceed their skills at our
   chosen trades.  Everything women do is done with style, grace, and compassion; and while we
    recognize that men do have their little Achilles' heels, it is not our role to belittle
	 them in any way, nor even to highlight their weaknesses.  The Sisterhood even has a
	  small number of men within our ranks. But these men have proven they believe in, and
	   fully support, the image of the capable female adventuress.</FONT></P>

 <P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=3><b>We attract membership through our good deeds, and
  our "Family-like" atmosphere of caring and sharing with others.  We provide members, and
   others, with less means than ourselves, assistance and aid, without being asked.  We are
    kind to all, friendly to most, and caring beyond measure to our fellow sisters.  We
	 neither seek to be the biggest nor most uber guild around.  But we do consider
	  ourselves to be the most considerate, fun-loving, and supportive guild in all of
	   Norrath.</FONT></P>
