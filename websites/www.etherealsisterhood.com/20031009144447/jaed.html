            Esmerelda waved goodbye 
            as her Father Neldo was lowered to Greater Fay by lift.&nbsp; He was 
            traveling to Felwith to perform.&nbsp; He often did as a bard.&nbsp; 
            Esmerelda clutched tightly the gift of the jade necklace her father 
            Neldo had just given her.&nbsp; He said her eyes were like the jade 
            in the necklace only her eyes were more bright and intense.&nbsp; 
            When news arrived that he had died, killed by a patrol of Crushbone 
            orcs her mothers heart broke, she was never the same.&nbsp; 
            Esmerelda refused to buckle and swore to avenge his death.&nbsp; 
            Taking the name Jaed Neldorath&nbsp; ( Vengeance of Neldo in Elder 
            Feir'Dal ) she began studying under the Champions of Faydark.&nbsp; 
            They taught her the skills to track down and kill her enemies.&nbsp; 
            Early in training Jaed met Xita of the Ethereal Sisterhood.&nbsp; 
            Xita helped Jaed on her path to vengeance but she also showed her 
            that others had been through misfortune.&nbsp; If you have the 
            ability to help those around you their life and yours would be 
            enriched.&nbsp; You have the choice every day to focus upon 
            yourself; to wallow in vengeance, death and destruction or to seek 
            to make the world a better place.</FONT>  <BR><FONT face=Arial
