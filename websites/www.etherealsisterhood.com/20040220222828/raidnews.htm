BRING YOUR RESIST GEAR! ALL OF IT! There will be fire/ice dragons as well as some poison and disease casters.
<P>
How do you test your CoV faction? Get a port to cobalt scar and con any of the wyverns. If it says threateningly or scowling then you are KOS. Only those with Ally, Warmly, Kindly, Amiable, Indifferent, Apprehensive or Dubious are able to attend a HoT raid.
<P>
Why can't you be KoS to CoV? Because you will get yourself and others killed too much.
<P>
How can you raise your CoV faction? Killing Giants in any of the Velious zones.
<P>
For some of you, its only your 1st or 2nd trip to ToV. If you know the way to ToV then meet at the zone in.
<P>
If you are unsure of how to get to ToV. Get a ride to Cobalt Scar and head for Siren's Grotto. 
<P>
To get to Siren's grotto from the Cobalt Scar port in, go north until you reach the wall and follow it west until the 2nd number in your loc is 1500. When you go under water you'll see sirens and a cave. Invis is a plus, those sirens can be mean charmers. Inside the gave is Siren's Grotto.
