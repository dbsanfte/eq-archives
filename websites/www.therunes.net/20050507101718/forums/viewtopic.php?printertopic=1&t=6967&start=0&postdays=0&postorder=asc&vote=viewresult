<span class="postbody">Just some of the conversations I have had as an IT "Professional" with folk. I was collecting "new" calls, so i still get a lot of simular ones.
<br />
This is a short sample of the list - the one i give to the folk i train up, to break them into the stupidity they are about to face... enjoy.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Some random person (I hope it was a wind up)
<br />
Them: I'm in &lt;site&gt;. I'm in Word. My computer isn't working.
<br />
Us: What's wrong?
<br />
Them: Every time I press the spacebar it puts a space in-between the words.
<br />
Us: Umm. Right.
<br />
Them: Can you fix it?
<br />
Us: (Fear is not an option) Give me a sec and I'll put you though to the typists. They use word more often than us and can probably help you better.
<br />
Solution: Sacrifice.
<br />

<br />

<br />
One of the "Secretaries"
<br />
Them: Mr Boss's laptop is encrypted, every time he tries to print it comes out with encryption.
<br />
Us: Yes...?
<br />
Them: Is it possible to copy the document onto a floppy and print it from one of the network machines?
<br />
Us: Of course.
<br />
Solution: Re-Install the printer driver (but I'm not going to tell them that).
<br />

<br />

<br />
Traffic.
<br />
Them: The monitor is broken. Every time we turn it on the light goes green then after about 10 seconds it goes orange.
<br />
Us: Could you try re-booting the computer?
<br />
Them: Doesn't do anything.
<br />
Us: Could you pull the power cable out of the back of the computer and then power it back up.
<br />
Them: Same problem.
<br />
Us: OK, we will send someone to have a look.
<br />
Solution. Turn up at the site and turned the computer on at the wall. Monitor "magically" came to life. (so much for them having re-booted it)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Education/school liaison
<br />
Them: The printer is broken again. (long standing whine)
<br />
Us: We'll send someone to have a look.
<br />
Solution. Take 1 look at the LCD display, load paper and it prints... (The display said "out of paper")
<br />

<br />

<br />
Managment
<br />
Us: I hear your printer is broken, is it OK if we come up and have a look?
<br />
Them: It doesn't work.
<br />
Us: Yeah, is it OK if we come up and have a look?
<br />
Them: Its broken.
<br />
Us: What is wrong with it?
<br />
Them: Its in bits all over my desk.
<br />
Us: Umm, could that be why it doesn't work?
<br />
Them: Dunno, its broken.
<br />
Us: So can we come up and have a look then?
<br />
Them: Sure, but it doesn't work.
<br />
Solution: Turns out they had been using their office printer as a "portable" printer and dropped it, oddly it broke - they get a real portable printer now.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Reception:
<br />
Us: Hi, I'm here to pick up 2 hire car keys for the IT department.
<br />
Them: Uh?
<br />
Us: Keys, for the hire cars, for IT. I'm here to collect them.
<br />
Them: Oh, you're here for the keys then?
<br />
Us: Yes...
<br />
Them: Who for?
<br />
Us: IT.
<br />
Them: Umm, who?
<br />
Us: (I have a polo shirt with the IT logo on it) IT (whilst pointing at said logo)
<br />
Them: Oh, I have 3 keys here. Which ones do you want?
<br />
Us: Dunno, what's the paperwork say.
<br />
Them: Umm.
<br />
Us:... (looking over their shoulder and waiting for them to catch up)
<br />
Them: Ah, this one is for <insert name> and this for... etc.
<br />
Us: Those 2 are our team leaders so it will be those keys we need.
<br />
Them: OK, so which one do you want again?
<br />
Us: (taking the keys) This and this, want me to sign for anything?
<br />
Them: Nah, I'll do it. Its a pretty simple system.
<br />

<br />

<br />
School Liaison
<br />
Us: Hi, I'm here to fix your monitor.
<br />
Them: Its working fine.
<br />
Us: Umm, I have a job under your name for the "broken" monitor.
<br />
Them: Oh, that was yesterday. I kicked a cable out of the computer and the monitor broke. When I phoned IT they asked if all the cables where in, I told them that they were. Later I tried that cable that had come loose and it worked again.
<br />
Us: Funny that.
<br />
Them: Do you think I should have phoned back and said it was working?
<br />
Us: Sure, good excuse to get out of the office for an hour though.
<br />
Them: Oh, that's OK then.
<br />
(They might go to school but it doesn't mean they are educated there)
<br />

<br />

<br />
5 March
<br />
Us: Hi, i'm looking for &lt;name&gt;. Hes logged a call with us, he has forgotted his password.
<br />
Them: Why do you think he is here?
<br />
Us: Because he just logged a call.
<br />
Them: Well hes not here, I know.
<br />
Them: Hang on a minute someone said he is. I will transfer you.
<br />
Time passes...
<br />
Them: He isn't answering the phone, i'll go find him.
<br />
Time passes...
<br />
Them: He must have left.
<br />
Us: Umm, OK. I can't change his password without speaking to him first, any chance you could leave a message?
<br />
Them: Sure, i'll send him an E:mail.
<br />
Us: Ah, he will not be able to get that. Could you leave a note?
<br />
Them: Oh, is the E:mail down again?
<br />
Us: Something like that.
<br />
(So how does someone that can't remember their password logon to get the information about their password?)
<br />

<br />

<br />
22 March
<br />
Us: I hear your printer is not working.
<br />
Them: It's always out of paper!
<br />
Us: The cover isn't on, there that should fix it.
<br />
Them: That makes a difference?
<br />
(Having your printer in pieces tends to make a difference)
<br />

<br />

<br />
22 March
<br />
Us: I believe that your computer is broken.
<br />
Them: Yes it won't work.
<br />
Us: Ah, I see the problem. It's not there.
<br />
Them: Really?
<br />
(Mouse, Keyboard and Monitor but no Base Unit. One wonders how long it would have taken them to figure it out.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
14 April
<br />
(Crouched, to one side, at the top of the stairs with a big printer balanced on my knees, waiting on the rather loud person comming up the stairs)
<br />
Us: Hi
<br />
Them: Hi
<br />
&lt;pause&gt;
<br />
Them: You want a hand?
<br />
Us: Nah, thanks though.
<br />
Them: You sure?
<br />
Us: Yep.
<br />
&lt;pause&gt;(By this time the printer is getting really heavy)
<br />
Them: You sure you don't need a hand?
<br />
Us: Yes.
<br />
Them: Oh, where you going?
<br />
Us: Down.
<br />
Them: Ah.
<br />
&lt;pause&gt;
<br />
Us: Can i get past...
<br />
Them: ?
<br />
Them: I'm going upstairs.
<br />
(they proceed upstairs whilst i try to get my legs and arms to function)
<br />

<br />

<br />
16 April
<br />
Coca cola was spilled on the monitor causing it to trip the residual curent device cutting power to several computers.
<br />
New monitor is required.
<br />
Thats the job description, the actual story behind it is a little different;
<br />
On the 15th someone called the Helpdesk on their mobile saying that "mysteriously" the computers and the phones had died "all of a sudden". No other details were given. Guessing that this was an electrical fault the person that took the call phoned maintenance and asked them to have a look. It would take them about 10-15 minutes to get to the site.
<br />
About 10 minutes later we got a call, from the same mobile, to say it "might have been" the spilled coke that caused the problem.
<br />
As if the clunk, BANG - "what happened to the lights", wasn't a clue?
<br />
(The call was logged to IT after maintenance stopped laughing)
<br />

<br />

<br />
26 April
<br />
The computer cannot find the domain.
<br />
Us: I was wondering what the computer was called or where you are?
<br />
Them: Why?
<br />
Us: So we can try and fix your computer.
<br />
Them: Oh, its in the &lt;place&gt; but the person that logged the call isn't here.
<br />
Us: Thats OK, is now a good time to have a look?
<br />
Them: Sure.
<br />
10 Minutes later I walk into the room and take 1 look at the computer, the network cable is lying on the floor next to it.
<br />
Us: thats it fixed.
<br />
Them: You're joking right.
<br />
Us: Umm, no - look.
<br />
Them: Oh, we have been joking all day that all IT would do is ask us - "Have you re-booted" and "are all the cables in".
<br />
Us: Yeah...
<br />
You would think they would have at least checked before making it into the days joke...
<br />

<br />

<br />
27 April
<br />
Unable to get past the black screen - ntldr is missing press any key to restart - which she has done!
<br />
Resolution: Other "any key" used to eject the floppy disk.
<br />

<br />

<br />
27 April
<br />
Printer isn't working (printer was fine, the computer wasn't)
<br />
Us: Have you tried re-booting your computer recently?
<br />
Them: It's off every night.
<br />
Us: Nah, thats the monitor.
<br />
Them: Oh...
<br />
(bit later)
<br />
Them: OK, thats it working now.
<br />

<br />

<br />
12 May
<br />
TFT monitor is broken, only displaying gray colours on one side.
<br />
Them: See...
<br />
Us: Umm
<br />
(rubs the screen with finger, wanders off to get a damp cloth)
<br />
Us: Thats it fixed, looks like whatever you used to clean the desk was sprayed onto the screen. Just use a damp cloth to wipe it.
<br />
Them: Oh, didn't know you could wipe them.
<br />
Them: Whilst you're here this application keeps opening up over there, see. (its a dual monitor system)
<br />
Us: Open up the screen control.
<br />
Them: Yeh?
<br />
Us: See that box "prevent split windows"
<br />
Them: Yeh?
<br />
Us: Tick it.
<br />
Them: Yeh?
<br />
Us: Now try it.
<br />
Them: Damn it! Its not doing it anymore.
<br />
Us: ?!? We just fixed it.
<br />
Them: Oh...
<br />

<br />
28 May
<br />
From a conversation during a different job
<br />
Them: Do you know why our access database keeps loosing information?
<br />
Us: Nope, don't know anything about Access, sorry.
<br />
Sometime later.
<br />
Us: Thats your computers installed, anything else you need on them?
<br />
Them: Yes, Access and Winzip.
<br />
Us: What do you need Winzip for?
<br />
Them: To open the database.
<br />
Us: What database?
<br />
Them: The Access ones.
<br />
Us: (imagine a lightbulb comming on) Ah, you don't really open the database in Winzip and then save it - do you?
<br />
Them: Yes.
<br />
Us: Winzip is basically for compressing a file to send somewhere, its not supposed to be used like that.
<br />
Us: It is probably why the file keeps on "loosing information".
<br />
Us: Try unzipping it to a location and then opening it from there. Forget about Winzip.
<br />
Them: Oh, thats how you are supposed to use it!
<br />

<br />
2 June
<br />
Internet access to the laptop not working - not getting a dialling tone again - needs this connection all the time.
<br />
Us: The laptop isn't plugged into a phone line... (again?)
<br />

<br />
10 June
<br />
Just went dead, all wires and connexions checked.
<br />
Them: We were moving the cables about and it just died...
<br />
Us: Ah.
<br />
Turned the 4way extension block back on.
<br />

<br />
10 June
<br />
The Secure Server is dead.
<br />
I was asked to reboot it as no one else was available (8pm). Had phoned the folk involved and they said that everything was working fine except this server, they hadn't done anything and needed the system now. Didn't seem to be anything wrong with the server, before or after the reboot, but i couldn't check properly as i'm not trusted on its Domain. Eventually the IT Manager gets called, their boss, messages are left everywhere for the "Secure Server" administrator. Chaos.
<br />
"They", the users had moved the desk and pulled the cables out of their computer...
<br />

<br />

<br />
24 June
<br />
The desktop is working faster, but I do not have MX Studio or MS Project icons or applications loaded, and I am missing netweet.
<br />
Sorry about this. Looked at my profile and I have no desktop settings in it.
<br />
Reply:
<br />
Its a new build, the programs do not exist.
<br />
Who has the software?
<br />

<br />
What do you know, after rebuilding the computer and chatting to them for 4 hours they forgot to tell me about the extra software that they needed installed. Then they wondered where it was.
<br />

<br />
29 June
<br />
Them: The cable that goes from the laptop to the projector has some bent pins, what should i do?
<br />
Us: Buy a new cable (straightening out the pins would be to complex a procedure to explain)
<br />
Them: Where from?
<br />
Us: A computer shop.
<br />
Them: Do i want a cable just like this one?
<br />
Us: Yeah, its a VGA cable, but you want one with straight pins.
<br />
Them: Oh, so what is one like that called?
<br />
Us: A VGA cable, to go from a latop to a projector....
<br />
(I think they thought the fact it was to have straight pins would give it a different name.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Your story about the coke and the monitor remnded me of an incident that happened about thirty years ago <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I worked with large mainframes at the time. And one day one of the computers just locked up. The display on the monitor froze, they couldn't IPL (Initial Program Load - think 'reboot') nor could they reload the computer's microprogramming. So IBM was called and when they came out they ran through the same sequence and then opened up the floppy drive that contained the computer's programming. The disk hub had been shredded due to the disk having stuck to the sleeve. Due to *coffee* (apparently with cream and sugar) having dripped (well, maybe a bit more than *dripped*) onto it.
<br />

<br />
It seems that one of the night operators (and noone fessed up) had put their coffee on top of the operator's console - against the rules to have coffee in the machine room (for now obvious reasons) - and had spilled it on top. It spilled through and dripped down onto the floppy drive, causing the problems when the coffee dried and caused the disk to stick to the sleeve. IBM had to open up the monitor and clean it up and replace the floppy drive and disk. And the 'no food or drink' rule was emphasized.
<br />

<br />
At another employer I heard about an incident that happened...
<br />

<br />
It seems that every morning about the same time this one remote location's modem would stop working and they would try to fix it and then mysteriously it would start working maybe 20 minutes later. Every morning! They investigated the site and couldn't see anything. So one of the guys decided that when the modem went down next he'd run over there and see what he could see. So, the next time it happened he ran over there and found... one of the women there had *unplugged* the modem so she could plug in her hair dryer! So he "explained" (he was 6 foot tall, 240 lbs with a bad attitude) to her that she was *not* to unplug the modem!

<span class="postbody">Unplugged cables has got to be the bane of tech support. My cousin does tech support for the navy when he's not out on a ship for 3-8 months at a time. You'd expect naval officers to be smarter but they are some dumb dumb people there. Unplugged cables has got to be the #1 problem.

The most memorable case had to be this heavyset lady who worked at one of the bases. She would complain about her keyboard acting all wierd when she typed. Mainly that it would either emit beeping sounds or type a lot of random letters she did not press. After going there and watching her type. My cousin's suggestion was for her to sit up straight and not type leaning forward. Mysteriously this problem fixed itself when she did that. A few days later, she called tech support again and my cousin was called over to her office again to fix the keyboard problem. After watching her type again, my cousin bluntly told her what the problem was. Being heavy set and heavy breasted when she leaned forward to type her breasts inevitably fell forward and rested on the keyboard as she typed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I received a problem ticket that was escalated from level 1 support. They claimed that the users laptop was not working in the docking station. I followed them to the users cubicle, where the lvl 1 support person hits the power switch on the docking station, then starts hitting keys and moving the mouse in order to "wake up" the laptop. I look down and calmly say "you may want to put a laptop in that docking station" turn, and walk away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
