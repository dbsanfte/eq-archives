<br />

<br />
One of our goals with EverQuest II is to make it as easy as possible to group up with the people you want to be playing with. Over the past few weeks, we've been working on a way to let friends adventure with friends, no matter what level anyone is.
<br />

<br />
With that goal in mind, we're pleased to announce EverQuest II's new Mentoring system.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is Mentoring?</span>
<br />
The idea behind Mentoring is a straightforward one. It should mirror the analogy of a dedicated teacher offering valuable lessons to an eager student.
<br />

<br />
Higher level characters (Mentors) are able to teach lower level characters (Apprentices) about the world, the creatures in it, and how foes can best be defeated, by grouping up with them and taking on challenges appropriate to the growing skills of the Apprentice.
<br />

<br />
While the Mentor and Apprentice are grouped up with each other, both can learn valuable lessons (experience) in the process. Apprenticing to a skilled Mentor can also be a faster way to learn than just trying repeatedly on your own
<br />

<br />
Further extending the analogy, having a whole team of trained Mentors offering different perspectives on life's lessons will naturally cause the Apprentice to learn even faster.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">How does it work in game?</span>
<br />
When you right click a lower level group member, you will see an option to Mentor them.
<br />

<br />
Selecting "Mentor" will make you appear and perform as if you were the same level as your Apprentice. It will be as if you were that level with a full bar of XP, and had all of the abilities that a person with a full experience bar of that level would have (for levels in which you get new abilities part of the way through).
<br />

<br />
Mentors will be able to continue using their existing equipment. There is no need to get diffferent sets of equipment for mentoring people of different levels.
<br />

<br />
Mentors can use any spell or combat art for their class that is in line with their Apprentice's level. 
<br />

<br />
The Apprentice will receive an experience bonus while under the guidance of a Mentor. Up to 5 other players can act as a Mentor for a single player at the same time. Each subsequent person Mentoring an Apprentice adds to the bonus experience that the Apprentice receives. A single Apprentice can be mentored by up to five other people.
<br />

<br />
The Mentors and Apprentice will receive experience, loot, and quest credit as if the Mentor were the same level as the Apprentice. 
<br />

<br />
Mentors do receive viable amounts of experience and advance toward their actual level while mentoring, though at a slightly reduced rate. The rates will fluctuate while this feature is in testing. 
<br />

<br />
The one exception to Mentor experience gain is taking an Apprentice who is under level 10. Helping someone through the most basic parts of the world doesn't provide sufficient opportunities for the Mentor to learn new things, and the Mentor doesn't gain experience during that period.
<br />

<br />
Apprentices must have their Experience Gain turned on in order to be Mentored. (The optional XP disable can't be in use.) Mentors can have this setting any way they prefer. We are sensitive to the possibility of creating a new way for people to retain arbitrary levels for the purposes of bot-farming, and don't wish to create a system that encourages it.
<br />

<br />
A Mentor can right click their Apprentice and select "Stop Mentoring" when they wish to stop acting as a Mentor. 
<br />

<br />
If the Mentor or Apprentice leaves the group, the Mentor will go back to their original level. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">In Closing</span>
<br />
Mentoring will be arriving on Test Server in its next major update, this week. It is currently scheduled to be available on all live servers two updates from now. 
<br />

<br />
Depending on the issues that arise on Test Server, we may decide to offer it in a Beta form to the live servers an update early. Our goal is to get this new feature out there for everyone to use as soon as possible.
<br />

<br />
There are more and more people arriving in EverQuest II every day and many of them have friends already playing who are higher level. We're thrilled to be able to offer a way they can play together, right off the bat.
<br />

Was CoH the first game to incorporate the idea of lower levels grouping with upper levels?
<br />

<br />
It's kinda funny...they are basically adding in PL, except the PLers get xp too. Even so, one aspect that makes this an interesting idea is that players will be able to return to their old haunts to hunt and still get something out of it. I would love to be able to return to Seb just for the fun (gear wouldn't mean anything) if I could actually get decent xp while there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Finally I will not have too worry about out levelling my GF. I can play as I like when she is not playing and drop back to play on equal terms when she is.
<br />

<br />
Not only that but a good friend is thinking of taking up EQ2 and I had the options of :-
<br />

<br />
a) Start a new character and play up. Knowing that if he plays he will out level me.
<br />

<br />
b) Dumping equipment, spells/arts, and cash on him to help speed his levelling.
<br />

<br />
Both of these options are awful. The first would just put stress on both of us. The second would spoil his enjoyment of the game and I would not be able to play with him for several weeks.
<br />

<br />
Now if he plays, I can play with him and so can my GF and we will all be on equal terms.
<br />

<br />
He can play when I am not on and so should gradually catch me up. He can do all the quests I have already done while I am not on and we can do some I missed when we are together.

<span class="postbody">Farming like that will not work very well. Sure you can duo the mobs that drop the books, assuming you and the warrior make a good pairing, BUT the lower level toon will level up.
<br />

<br />
In effect you get an extra chance at getting the drops but this offers no real benefit over finding a group with your warrior and simply rolling for the books. Most people will let you have the books if you say you are there to get a particular type.
<br />

<br />
If you want to farm the books then start a new toon and level it up to 11. This should only take an evening. Then play the two toons and when they are at a level where they can take the mobs, and still get the drops, switch off the getting of exp.
<br />

<br />
This is essentially what the plat farmers do.
<br />

<br />
Oh and Sinhuit could not be more wrong. This is not a good way to PL people. PLing almost by definition means that a stronger character helps a weaker character. Since the higher character here is reduced to the level of the lower it is a most inefficient way to do it.
<br />

<br />
For example if I wanted to power level someone [and had the time to do it] I would create 4 (or more) pairs of characters, at say 50, 40, 32, 24, then switch off exp for them and PL a 3rd character (or more) up with the help of a few quests. This would be far more efficient than mentoring.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I made an alt to level 9 and stopped her.  I was about to make another and take it to level 19 and turn its exp off too.  Then do a 3rd up to level 29... That way i would have toons at every level to play with him.

I love this new system.  Good in every way except, I really hope that the Mentor dosnt get TOO much exp.  I think some is good, but if I dinged once in the time he dings 20 times I think that will be about right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
