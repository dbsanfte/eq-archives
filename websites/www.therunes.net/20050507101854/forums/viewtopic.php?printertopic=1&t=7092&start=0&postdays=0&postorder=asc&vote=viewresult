<br />
 
<br />
- Tons of new quests, mostly for solo players!
<br />
- New Character Differentiation option: Training!
<br />
- Lots of artisan recipe and ability fixes!
<br />
- Eat healthy! New examine information to explain the benefits of food and drink!
<br />
- Brawlers get built-in shields!
<br />
- Guild followers can spend the status they earn at city merchants!
<br />
- Now easier to equip rings, wrist items, and weapons!
<br />
- Slash that dot! Maps now show your current heading!
<br />
- Lots of UI tweaks and enhancements!
<br />
- More bug fixes than you can shake a moss snake at!
<br />
 
<br />
*** Training ***
<br />
 
<br />
- Characters now receive a new character differentiation option every ten adventure levels: Training!
<br />
- Training allows you to choose one of four new abilities. Each of these spells or arts builds off abilities you've been using but substantially increases their effectiveness and benefit.
<br />
- The choice is yours whether you prefer a stronger attack, a more potent buff, a heartier heal, or a handier utility function. Training allows you to enhance specific aspects of your character and be a bit unique.
<br />
- These Training abilities have a longer span of effectiveness than most common spells and arts, so they'll prove very useful to you.
<br />
- Note: Characters who reach levels 10 and 20 will not be prompted to make their Training selections until they leave their current zone and enter another. This is a known issue that will be corrected in a future update.
<br />

<br />
IMPORTANT!
<br />
- You will not be able to receive quest rewards until you make any pending character differentiation choices available to you.
<br />
 
<br />

<br />
*** Gameplay ***
<br />
 
<br />
- Group members can now join other group members in a specific instance of a zone even if that zone has reached its capacity.
<br />
- If a character dies and is given the option to be revived in a different zone, the revive window will allow the player to choose from multiple instances if they are available.
<br />
- Harvesting quests can no longer be completed by purchasing the items from a broker.
<br />
- Spells that debuff the target's maximum health or power now work appropriately.
<br />
- Fixed a bug that could cause you to fall under the world while swimming.
<br />
- Removed the restriction that only guild patrons can spend status points.
<br />
- You are no longer able to swap bags into your shared bank if one of the bags contains a lore or no-trade item.
<br />
- You are no longer able to drag lore items from your overflow slot into the shared bank.
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused rare mastery quest items not to drop from solo encounters.
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
*** Controls, Commands, and UI *** 
<br />
 
<br />
- Character Select: If you choose to delete a character, you will now be asked to type in the character name.
<br />
- Inventory: The overflow slot now features a context menu that allows you to examine the item, move it to your inventory, or destroy it.
<br />
- Inventory: The default behavior when dragging a stack of items or coins has changed to drag the entire stack. To choose a quantity, hold down the Shift key while dragging. Holding down the Control key while dragging still picks up a single item from the stack.
<br />
- Inventory: You can now drag bag windows if your mouse pointer is over an empty slot.
<br />
- Inventory: If you attempt to equip a weapon that is not compatible with what you're wielding, your current weapons will be unequipped for you. For example, if you are currently holding a sword and shield and attempt to equip a two-handed weapon, both the sword and shield will be unequipped.
<br />
- Inventory: Equipping items in the wrist and finger slots is much easier.
<br />
- Inventory: Double-clicking a second dual-wield weapon in your inventory should now allow it to be equipped properly.

<br />
- Guild UI: Guild UI now displays the guild status earned by each patron in the "Standing" column.
<br />
- Guild UI: Fixed the confirmation screen for guild demotions.
<br />
- Main UI: The society window's members list will now sort correctly on rank, level, current status, and total status when you click on the column headers.
<br />
- Main UI: Fixed a bug causing only the first embedded item link to get the link color.
<br />
- Main UI: Custom chat channels now use their assigned channel colors.
<br />
- Main UI: Maps now have a heading indicator instead of a dot.
<br />
