We finished the kill-55 adventure with 15 minutes to spare and nobody died (easy dungeon, few healing mobs, nobody charmed or feared the whole time)... I gained 27 percent of an AA (but I did have leadership on).  He's a 65 paladin with virtue and self buffs -- we had 65 cleric and 2 druids in group, but no shaman.  He had 5180 or so hp and 1300 or so AC.
<br />

<br />
He's in my guild, but plays just one night a week the last few months.  He's actually done his share of raids in NTOV, first-tier PoP, his epic, and lots of dragons in Kunark and Luclin.  I have to believe a true non-raider would have less.  He owns GoD and OoW and we've visited them, but his gear really doesn't cut it there.  When he left the only tank we could find LFG was level 62 (that was 8pm Monday, practically prime-time).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

To be honest, if the tank is 61+, the HOT is basically a complete heal in all the older content, and far more preferable because I don't have to bite my findernails wondering if the tank has paper AC and will drop like a stone.  With my buff extensions, it does on the order of 7K over time.

Last night though, I talked my husband into logging his enchanter to Charm a mob in Valor to MT for me.  (I'm desperate for large shards of stone for my pottery addiction...sigh).  A guild ranger joined us to snare, pull, and shoot in order to speed up kills.  It's kind of entertaining to Crit heal the pet at 50% life, and do 12K.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif" border="0" />   Told our ranger that the tank had 20K+ life and he almost choked...hehe.  )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Yep, my cleric used to ONLY use HOT on my warrior in Nadox.  Poor cleric only had FT 1 and was in acrylic armor.  Some of the old zones were easy!  Any casual player can make it to 65 in Nadox.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" />  But neither my cleric nor my warrior dared to join regular groups in PoP zones.  By the time they all hit 65, my chanter was the only one that went to PoP.  He never told people he was in gatorscale sleeves.  Errr.  it might scare people away.  But one thing I love about a chanter is as long as you can mezz, mana is usually not a problem.  Even now, at 70 and 500+ AA he's still holding a grandmaster smith hammer.  People laugh at him.  LOL.  Many try to remind him he forgot he was doing craft.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif" border="0" />  Then he tells them that's his combat gear.

If you enjoyed your chanter because of the mezzing thrills ("bringing order to chaos") and ocasional charming, I have a question for you.
<br />
</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure how to reply to this, because I used to enjoy my Enchanter for many reasons... It is the whole experience, really. The following is from my point of view, what <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> view an Enchanter to be. This will most likely be a bit outdated (a bit, hah!), but <span style="font-weight: bold">hopefully</span> still at least slightly relevant. 
<br />

<br />
1: Messes: Bringing Order to the Chaos
<br />
Yes, this would have to be the first reason. It is (or was, I suppose from reading posts... :/) the definition of an Enchanter. It is our role, our calling... it sets (or set) us apart from the other classes, makes (made) us unique. Yes, people <span style="font-weight: bold">could</span> get by without our assistance, but our presence makes a difficult situation much easier to handle.
<br />

<br />
2: Stuns: Stunningly Beautiful!
<br />
Our stuns enable(d) us to derail trains, start AE groups, survive a beating, and get that last mes off without biting the big one! I never went anywhere without at least one stun up, and almost always had two.
<br />

<br />
3: Debuffing: The Mobs Are Not Tough... When We Debuff!
<br />
With the Tash (though my memory could be failing here, the best magic debuff line in game at the time. My apologies if I have this wrong, not even <span style="font-weight: bold">thinking</span> about a game in years makes you forget things...), the second best Slow in game, Cripple, Strength debuffs and mana sieving we are (were?) a handy asset.
<br />

<br />
4: Aggro Raising/Reducing: Hey, Mr. Horror Overmind! HE did it! *points!*
<br />
This is something that I remember loving to play with - Reducing Aggro here, Raising it there - and I actually remember it making a difference. Making a difference is the reason I play an Enchanter.
<br />

<br />
5: Buffing: 
<br />
Admittedly buffing really is not my favorite thing in the world to do, but it made me feel useful to be able to cast the best mana regeneration spell in game on anyone (except for pure Melee and Necromancers, of course), the best Haste... not to mention the usefulness of a Group Resist Magic spell. (I'd mention Umbra, but who really even used Umbra?) 
<br />

<br />
6: Rune: The Walls of Air
<br />
Though its use was limited because of the expensive (yes, I left when dots were still considered expensive - in the dark ages! <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif" border="0" />) reagents, Rune could mean the difference between life and death in certain situations. If an Enchanter was too broke to use a Peridot to cast Rune, the Enchanter could always use Bedlam instead.
<br />

<br />
7: Adaptable
<br />
Enchanters were always one of the most adaptable classes. As Enchanters we can root, stun, slow, mes, charm, give increased mana regen, rune, raise aggro, reduce aggro, raise magic resistance, turn others into lifetapping werewolves, turn ourselves into most anything, lower magic resistance, debuff, DoT, DD, save the day. I love all of it, every aspect. The skills Enchanters have (had?) complimented each other perfectly.

For augments they have types, something (I think 3)-8. I dont remember the specifics of what slot can go where (I never did Ldon much), but to combine (and remove) augments, you go to what looks like a birdbath at any of the wayfarer camps. You put the aug and item in it and hit combine. To remove you need to purchase a distiller from a gnome at the bb wayfarer camp, each aug has a certain class of distiller (the aug says what it needs to be removed).

<tr><td class="printline">
<span class="postbody">Not a lot of people do LDoNs anymore since OOW was released.  The experience in them isn't anywhere as good as the OOW zones.  You can also do instanced adventures in the new OOW zones (called expeditions).  The difference between these and LDoNs is expeditions will last for up to 6 hours, there is no set goal (and no rewards for achieving one therefore), and the group members can fluctuate after you receive the expedition.  Mobs in a 67 avg expedition will hit for around 400 (v. 900 in a 65 Hard) but will give FAR better experience.  Names in expeditions have a chance to drop loot and runes (for 66 - 68 spells).
<br />

<br />
As stated for a LDoN, you need 3 - 6 people in your group, all within 7 levels of each other.  Avg of the group determines the level of the adventure.  The adventure levels are tuned for every 5 levels.  So there are level 45, 50, 55...etc addies..  If your avg group level is 58.0 - 62.99999, then you'll get a 60 addy at normal difficulty.  If it's 63.0+, you'll get a 65 addy.  Generally speaking, the Hard setting will bump your addy up 1 difficulty level.  So a hard 55 = a normal 60.  Exception to this is hard 65s.  Whereas a normal 65 addy will have mobs that hit for around 200, the hard 65s can quad for up to 900, are only partially slowable, and resist paci about 90% of the time.
<br />

<br />
There are 5 Wayfarer camps located in the following zones:  North Ro, Butcherblock, East Commonlands, Everfrost, and South Ro.  You can port between these camps if you have an adventure stone (which is an augment to your charm).  You get the stone by first visiting your homecity and talking to a guy to get information, then speaking to one of 5 key NPCs in any of the camps to receive your stone.  You do not need the stone to do an adventure, but you do need it to port.  Also, for every 10 wins in a given camp, your stone (which is an augment) will increase in stats (you'll need to hail NPCs to make this happen).  I believe the final augment is +10 to all stats/resists and +100 HPs/Mana.  But that takes on the order of 70 - 80 wins per camp.
<br />

<br />
Key to LDoNs is speed.  When you get an adventure, you'll be given a set goal.  You'll have 30 min to travel to the correct zone and enter.  Once you enter, the clock starts.  You must complete the goal before 90 min is up to 'win'.  If you win, you'll gain points that can be used to buy gear/spells/augments in the LDoN camps.  The higher the level addy, the greater the number of points for a win.  (Normal 60 is 20ish, 65 is 50ish, Hard 65 is 100ish).  The highest level group members get the most points, but the variance is only a couple points between group members.
<br />

<br />
The choices of adventures include:  Collection (Collect X items - generally easiest), Slaughter (Kill Y Mobs - next easiest), Rescue, and Assassination (hardest).
<br />

<br />
From what I understand, there is 1 flavor of mob in each of the LDoNs that are charmable.  (The flying monkeys in Everfrost addies for example).  I believe there is a sticky somewhere on this site which will explain more.
<br />

<br />
The highest level goodies you can buy from each camp cost 1492 points.  I've heard that the high end armor when given the right augments is roughly equivalent to elemental gear, but since I'm not elemental, I can't personally comment.
<br />

<br />
If you're interested in the kind of gear available, this is a good link:  <a href="http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi" target="_blank">http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi</a>
<br />

<br />
Generally speaking, trash OOW drops from places like WoS & the OOW tradeskilled armor are going to be almost as good as top end LDoN gear, but only have 1 augment slot.  The advantage to LDoN gear is you can get focus effects, FT, +HP/Mana etc augments and add to it.  And LDoN gear has 3 upgrade slots v. 1.  HOWEVER, you will spend a TON of time getting the points needed for LDoN armor.
<br />

<br />
This is why virtually no one is doing LDoNs anymore as pickup groups.  The experience and drops in places like WoS are so much easier.
<br />

<br />

I think you misunderstood.  Broken good = way to good.

Charming mobs in PoP is very good.  Charming mobs in a L 65 LDoN hard or L 70 LDoN normal is very good.  Charming mobs in two GoD zones (tipt and vxed) is sickly good.
<br />

<br />
The quality of charm in Tipt/Vxed, and after them (before they removed charm), is possibly the main reason why OOW charm is stupidly bad.

A little from column A, a little from column B.

To get the a flag to a locked zone, you either need to do the entire flagging process, or get back-flagged, or do a single group side-flag quest.
<br />

<br />
Sol Ro's tower and Tactics have sidequests.  CoDb has a no-prerequisite raid that lets you in.
<br />

<br />
Fire, Air, Water, Earth and Time do not have single group flagging methods.
<br />

<br />
Backflagging for a zone requires you to be in a raid that for the zone.
<br />

<br />
Every one of the 'boss' mobs of the PoP tiers now gives out a limited number of 'get every prerequisite' uberflags for backflagging purposes.  Such uberflags do not upgrade your charm.

They are correct, healing potential has gone WAY up. Pious Elixir (level 67 HoT) does 1100 HPs/tick, and I can crit heal 5K+ with Pious Remedy (1.8 second cast).

Not a lot of people do LDoNs anymore since OOW was released. The experience in them isn't anywhere as good as the OOW zones. You can also do instanced adventures in the new OOW zones (called expeditions). The difference between these and LDoNs is expeditions will last for up to 6 hours, there is no set goal (and no rewards for achieving one therefore), and the group members can fluctuate after you receive the expedition. Mobs in a 67 avg expedition will hit for around 400 (v. 900 in a 65 Hard) but will give FAR better experience. Names in expeditions have a chance to drop loot and runes (for 66 - 68 spells).

 Generally speaking, the Hard setting will bump your addy up 1 difficulty level. So a hard 55 = a normal 60. Exception to this is hard 65s. Whereas a normal 65 addy will have mobs that hit for around 200, the hard 65s can quad for up to 900, are only partially slowable, and resist paci about 90% of the time.

Arcane Rune is a L 61 spell. Buy it now. Cast it. Keep it memorized at all times. Get as much enhancement haste you can find to bring it's casting time down to 2.5 seconds.

It is a 1500 point self-rune that stacks with other runes and costs 400 mana.

There are L 65 and 70 cap stun spells.  They take ALOT of mana, last 5.25 seconds on mobs, and have a 2.0 casting time, and 8+ second recast.  They are also all recast-linked, so meming both has little advantage over meming one.

<br />
1 Million plat is nothing now a days, plat for the most part is easy to get. I solo in OoW collecting runes for guild and to sell, the ones i sell i can get 20k each. 
<br />
        In LDON to get the best points, yes you have to win, though if you don't, your given 30 mins to complete the task for fewer points, bout half of what you would of won maybe less, not sure since i don't do em often now, and when i do, i don't lose since i do em with the same group of people. 
<br />
         Don't worry bout rushing it, you'll catch up quickly just give it time and have fun, if your not having fun, playing any game is pointless. 
<br />
As for the equipment enchanters can get, My equipment isn't the best by far, but i am a raider and have respectable gear, just look at my magelo for a decent idea. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
         The 1495 points is a lot, but at 70 i get 100 points for a normal ldon, and it takes about 50 mins for the group i do em with, when we do them anyway to finish. It will take time, but it's not hard by far use it as practice time. 
<br />
         Pacify line is a awesome line now, everything up to Pacification rocks. We got a new paci in OoW, Placate, but i haven't made up my mind if iI like it or not.Also visit the server wide channel anytime, I'm usually in it, and you can send me a tell anytime. Just type ;ta brill.dolaorn &lt;message here&gt;. 
<br />
          In the Elemental Planes, you get the flag for each zone by killing the god for that zone, and hailing the projection, which gives you a shield thingy, and a flag for that zone, but dosn't give you the flag for the zones before that, or after into time, unless you have all 4 and combine them. In Time you can be raiding in at the 5:1 ratio, and Time keys drop during phase 3, about 8-10 per raid. Once you loot one and you zone out, you can zone in again, and your time flagged.
<br />
DC is useful in some places, maybe pov if you are exping there, and in Plane of Earth A you can DC one of the baby armadillo's, and maybe for CBQ i would DC, otherwise, I don't use it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Well, I've had a couple run ins with some not-so-friendly people since I've returned that couldn't bring themselves to understand why I needed directions to places because I had never been there before... eventually, this is where I finally gave in and learned the mapping system. After the initial frustration, I found it to be quite lovely. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Sadly, however, I haven't had many opportunities to group lately... even with the looking-for-group feature, a level 61 Enchanter just can't get a group to save their life! Because of this, I have been trying to learn Charm Soloing. This has been an... interesting experience. To put it plainly, I suck at it. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" /> I haven't died while trying, but I haven't exactly been rolling in the experience points either! 
<br />

<br />
I was <span style="font-style: italic">this</span> close to quitting EverQuest again upon waiting <span style="font-weight: bold">nine hours</span> for a group last week. After nine hours I just had to log off. This seems to be the norm: Log in, throw up Looking-for-group tag, run around and explore, try to charm solo - fail, go to Sebilis - hack frogs, look at the clock - hey, have to go to work in three hours! Log off... rinse, wash, repeat.
<br />

<br />
Most of my experience gained has been from tearing apart Sebilis with - as I've seen him referred to here - Shiny Bob. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" /> The experience isn't fast, and I am <span style="font-weight: bold">extremely</span> sick of seeing frogs, but it's better than no experience at all. 
<br />

<br />
I did try zones like Plane of Disease for Shiny Bob - but things just hit too hard for the poor guy to be effective.

I haven't even been inside any of the new planes with the exception of Disease, Nightmare and Innovation (promptly zoned out of there! Mean, nasty things!)

The best grouping zones, 60-65, should be Plane of Valor then BoT at 62.  If you can't get groups there, you won't find groups anywhere.  You should be aware that the only thing you can do in PoV before 62 is slow and buff.

The best advice is to get used to charm soloing.  If you really are a novice at it, look for zones with low MR mobs, the older the expansion the better (so that breaks hurt less).  Mob AI has been revised a couple of times, and caster mobs really like to dispell a lot now, as well as fear.
<br />

<br />
Having said that, the zone in area of PoN is open enough to be a good playground for charming.  You'll see a lot of disagreement as to which is the best pet - raven, spider or treant.  If you can find a ranger (preferably) or druid to join up with you, charm is a lot easier that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I like to charm for exp. It's fun sometimes, but be prepared to not look away from your screen for awhile. DC pets make charm a little more bearable, so you can go answer the door. I'd suggest getting a cleric to duo with.
<br />

<br />
Clerics have Complete Heal for 7500 and your pets will have more than that HP and then some. Your cleric friend can also buff the pet with a nice HP buff. Then there is the charm breaks on non-DC pets. The cleric wins again, just have your cleric friend use Root. You can pull the next few mobs right up to your rooted charm pet, it will get their attention quickly (hasted-pet toys). Druids make ok charm partners, but they don't rez, so I still pick clerics since rez and start over is pretty fast with a cleric. Getting a wolf form from a druid will make solo normal charm easy, you can run backwards at sonic speeds. The wolf form lasts for about 2 hours if the druid has buff extensions. You only need the buff when you zone into the zone, after that you are really really fast, no need for snaring the pet.
<br />

<br />
Sitting on a Drog or Horse and DC charm pet tanking is ok. I think POV armor or HOH has some easy DC pets. Buff the little bugger and give it some pet toys that proc a nice aggro dd. You wont have any problems medding and watching the DC pet do its thing, but youll need a healer to help keep it standing. 
<br />

<br />
Charm Solo by yourself using COD 64 charm and a level 60ish pet can be the best solo exp you get as a chanter. Its also the most dangerous and requires the most attention. Enchanters really do require you sit and watch and be present in Real Life, but its such a rush sometimes. Charm solo 64 COD is the best solo aa I have found for enchanters. There are some bot programs for exp grind with other classes that don't require you actually be there. They are not 'legal' and I have not seen one for enchanters.
<br />

<br />
Easy exp get a DC pet, difficult but fast exp use 64 COD charm. Having some good friends that invite you because they like you there, the best exp all around. You might not have those friends around when you are logged in, but the funnest gametime is going to be when you are playing with a group, IMO enchanters are strongest in groups. Using your DC pet in groups is a pretty good DPS method because your group will get used to its consistant output. The shamans pet is similar to your DC pet. COD 64 pets can work if snared. I found this to work ok, but the breaks to resnare and near party wipes were a real slow down in overall kill rate and make a major break in the group's 'Mantra' (cleric dead and group not even looking at the charmpet that did it).
<br />

<br />
Pulling and having no pet is not a bad option once you get your critical hit spell AA up a bit and can nuke for over 2k on a regular basis. If you are running 20 worn mana regeneration and using the 70 mana buff with all mana regen AA, then using nukes after pulling should not be a problem.

SOW potions depend on the user level to determine its speed increase, level 50+ is 55%speed for SOW potions. RUN5 makes a good compliment for SOW potions such that you won't lose much speed when it fades or is debuffed. Pulling indoors there is no equal to RUN5.
