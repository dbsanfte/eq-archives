Moorgard has talked about this on the SOE boards. His response is that they know about it, but to fix it at this point would be much worse than for them to just leave it for the time being. He did also warn that it WILL be fixed eventually, so no crying when it is.

Just have someone get you a craftsman essentials volume 10 and your good to go. It takes a bit of luck to get a pristine though. Since your skills cap out you wont get upgraded spells in that area, just your own area of expertise.

Part of the problem is the players themselves though. They price their stuff so high, it's hard to afford. This morning I was looking for some temper. Prices ranged from 32s  <img src="images/smiles/icon_butt.gif" alt="icon_butt.gif" border="0" />  to 2s. Needless to say I bought up as much as I could afford of the 2s.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Godwilling, the TS patch will drive player prices down. I know people are complaining that it hurts, but it's a good kind of hurt. The patch was an emergency stopgap; by making it impossible to sell to mercs, players who want a return have to sell to other players, which will drive prices down. They said they'd let people sell stuff to mercs eventually, but I'm guessing that you won't get much from it. All that points to a strong desire by soe to keep the player-made stuff on the players' market, which is pretty essential because TS requires many different people to work and there ain't all that many because the game is new.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">The problem that I've seen is that there are not many people making the tempers, so it's a matter of expertise charging rates comparable to the claim of "expert". Much like going to a company that makes something rare or unique, they can charge you whatever they want and you pay it. In this case everyone makes armor (for example) and no one makes tempers. So temper prices are high because no one makes them and those that do can charge anything they feel like. The only way to drive prices down is going to be undercutting these people and forcing a correction, but as soon as you stop the prices will go back up. It would also mean having to spend all your time being the one that makes the tempers...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Yah, the problem is made worse by alchemy being a power gobbling skill, compared to some of the others, which slows production and the fact that the stuff that everyone needs has an extremely low level, like 10, 20, etc.  Means that it continues to suck up a lot of power/time to make the things, but you get squat for xp out of it.  And that means people want to be compensated for it.

In the long run, it won't matter, of course, with the vendor npcs selling most of the stuff and pristine not mattering, but for now, the interdepedency is annoying, not just for alchemy, but for a lot of the other tradeskills as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I'm really regretting going Alchemist as my "primary" output ought to be potions and poisons but they're broken and don't sell, even if you can make them (many require bottles from jewellers, and good luck finding one).

<br />
I can't sell tempers/washes for more than a few copper (like, 25c). Even neolith, which is a bitch to make. (Takes all my power (breeze, canni, decent drink) to struggle to a pristine on those.) OK maybe I could sell that for 1s.
<br />

I just don't get the insane prices that some people are charging for what ought to be commodities... don't they realise that they're only shooting themselves in the foot, when they want to buy the output and it's priced in gold?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I have one more suggestion if you plan on doing tradeskills 30+.  Get some kind of wrist support tool.  You are going to be key pounding so much we wouldnt want anyone to get carpeltunnel syndrome.
<br />

<br />
And yes friends are a good think, join your cities crafting channel and you'll find after a couple weeks you know everbody on there, and visa versa.  Guilds are also great for this, or having them trade you some finished something for raw ingredients.  And if your lucky you can find a very high level guild to join so that you may buy one of thoes in house work benches.  If your going to be over 30 tradeskill your gonna do alot of selling, so if you can craft and sell at the same time, bonus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Well I'm making headway with the tradeskills.  I recently heard about the bug with the 10th lvl books being scribable by all but I don't think I will buy them because it will get nerfed eventually.  I just made an alt who is a 13 craftsman now and he made me my quills.  I want to make maple strongboxes too.
<br />

<br />
I have 3 characters tricked out to lvl 16 with their appIII spells/essences and 2 more up to their lvl 10 spells.  I've decided Belldin will be a jeweler because he is an enchanter and it seems fitting.  Jeradim will be the alchemist.  My buddy from work is going to be a sage so I think I will have my next alt be a tailor so I can make nice 10-12 slot backpacks.
<br />

<br />
With most stuff even with just tier 1 skills I can make a pristine almost every time.  You just have to know which skills do what for how much power then determine how much you can buff in between rounds for maximum effect.  You get a "feel" for it after awhile.  Some recipes seem harder though...I never did make a pristine elm strongbox with only tier 1 skills.  That was likely due to my lack of skill in woodworking at the time though.  If your skills are at or near the cap you should be able to pull off a pristine every time, though it may take all your power to do it.  I tradeskill on 2 characters at once so while one is crafting the other is medding back up.
<br />

<br />
I definitely forsee some carpal tunnel in the future....it's like playing a bard except your twisting skills instead of spells!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

500 essences for five levels? Doesn't sound too bad to me. I think made over 3000 neoliths and probably the same thylakoids and over 100 inks with all the entailed reagent->dye->ink steps plus required washes and oils to get from 25 -> 26 Alchemist.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

A couple friends were leveling up alts this past week and told me that you can't scribe the level 10 books for other artisan classes any more.  However, everyone (like me) who already did still has the recipes... for now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
