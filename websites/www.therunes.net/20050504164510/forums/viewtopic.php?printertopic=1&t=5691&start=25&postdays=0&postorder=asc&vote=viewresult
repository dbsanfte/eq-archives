Sorry. That's not even close to a precedent.  It would be a precedent if there were level 53 mobs in Cazic Thule that were charmable with Boltran's, but the 54 mobs were immune to charm.
<br />

<br />
I understand the need for limits, Qilue, and if they want to go back on a zone by zone basis and flag named and 'overpowered' mobs immune, fine, but when my charm spell works on a level 64 Blue Slime, but not on a level 65 blue slime, even though the spell is advertised as working on mobs up to level 67, THEN something is wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Hell every class I know has become more powerful in older zone then I ve become.

<br />
No, sorry for the confusion...
<br />

<br />
I am saying that mobs that are 65-67 are charmable only in OOW zones.  If a mob is 64 and is in a pre-OOW zone, then you would use CoD (focus effects, mana, common sense, etc.)  But if you really want to, you can Compel an_orc_pawn in Crushbone.   
<br />

<br />
Thus, Compel only works in OOW. 
<br />

<br />
I kind of agree that there is some flag they forgot about, this is why I asked people to /bug it.

<span class="postbody">Qilue, if you don't know why charming named mobs in BoT and 'owning the zone' is impossible, then I find it difficult to give your opinion on the subject much weight.
<br />

<br />
For my part, I would find the <i>horrific nerf</i> of our solo abilities took in OoW more tolerarble if Sony hadn't been slowly eroding our group desirability for years now.  At it stands now, unless you are in <i>one of two zones in the game</i> (Vxed or Tipt), enchanters are purely and <i>massively</i> inferior to bards, and frequently significantly inferior to shamans and beastlords.  The growing irrelevance of mez compared to the Sony's apparent facination with increasingly more powerful pulling tools (bards got too good at pulling, so the solution was to... give monks unresistable lull?), combined with the active intention of designing zones that are easily and quickly pulled (from BoT all the way to MPG, it's a far cry from SolB or Sebilis.  A brain damaged chimp can pull singles in MPG all day long), has turned enchanters into the buff bots we always feared we'd someday be.
<br />

<br />
I can live, unhappily, with going from a class that can get credible solo XP (though not as much as druids, wizards, necros) to a class that bascially has to group if they want to advance.  However, I am very unhappy, and considering simply canceling my account, if I am to be a class that cannot solo effectively <i>and</i> who's core class abilities are being steadily devalued.  Unmei is simply and totally correct.  Any other class in the game gets significant upgrades from OoW; enchanters get, in many ways, <span style="font-style: italic">less</span> powerful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
1st, sony "fixed" lull type spells.
<br />

<br />
2nd, people start using them everywhere to help with pulls
<br />

<br />
3rd, enchanters are less needed due to fewer "adds", and monks are less desireable as their way of "FD splitting" isn't as fast as lull pulling. 
<br />

<br />
4th, LDoN is released where there are a plethora of "2 & 3" pulls, and it is now faster, safer, and more mana efficient to pull with pacify then to handle adds even <span style="font-weight: bold">with</span> an enchanter.
<br />

<br />
5th, since Monks now have 0 desirability in an entire expansion (mediocre dps relatively, no one wants to wait for FD splitting), sony throws them a bone with an unresistable lull, so they are now accepted as pullers again. It being unresistable was actually a bug, but they decided to let it stay that way officially.
<br />

<br />
The closest thing sony has released that would suggest the need for "crowd control" was trivialized by their fixing the lull spells over a year before it was even released. 
<br />

<br />
The 2 most popular classes right now are... bard and ranger! Can you imagine that? With 100+ people in Wall of Slaughter, and similar frenzies in other oowar zones, their ability to track mobs that sell 70k+ bazaar loot and single pull makes them more sought after than any other class on my server. Seriously, if you're in a group with a ranger or bard, you're going to make thousands of plat more per day. it's that simple. forget the ability to handle adds, or buffing your group with superior dps. EQ today is track + single pulling.
<br />

<br />
I'm quite honesly curious if sony wants us to enjoy providing medim slows and underpowered nukes for enjoyment. eh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

He's giving odds, it's the ratio of values and I believe the tacit assumtion is that dollars are worth more then donuts, implying he'd pay you in dollars if you took the bet and won, and you'd pay him donuts if you lose.

<span class="postbody">The irony of this situation is i personally don't think there is any "old" code that makes anything level 65+ uncharmable.
<br />

<br />
If you want to flag a mob uncharmable then you get the message "this mob cannot be charmed". Currently its just an automatic resist.
<br />

<br />
As for testing old content - none was done. None could be done as they closed off all the non-OoW zones during beta. Although this was partially due to folk going exploring with /betabuff when their mains couldn't access the zones.
<br />

<br />
The major reason charm has been nerfed (cough *changed*) again and again is because folk see it as an easy way to get exp. They complain about it and eventually someone get out the sledge hammer and wacks the problem. All they needed was piece of wire wool.
<br />
Of course the real solo'ists have never been affected by this and still aren't.
<br />

<br />
So my best guess to this serverwide flag is that it is yet another *change* to stop us soloing places like PoFire, as it would be to unbalancing for raid content and exp.
<br />

<br />
But the real solo'ists can still solo everywhere, the difference - the only major difference - is that they couldn't use their kite tactics against existing content.
<br />

<br />
(yeah charming can be risky as heck but the only time folk really see it is at the hands of someone that is well practiced - we make it look to easy)
<br />

<br />
Can't really call it a "knee-jerk" reaction when the sledge just obliterated half the leg, can we?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Apparently, few people realize that we actually do NOT want to just randomly wipe the group and wait until we do get good and confident in our charming abilities before we bring it to a group setting. 
<br />
 
<br />
Just to make sure I was up to speed again at the, now old, high end of the grouping zones, I spent 2 months straight just solo charming in HoH, BoT, and the non-instanced zones of GoD. 
<br />
 
<br />
Now I do feel good about what I could bring to a group with a high-end pet.   
<br />
 
<br />
Of course they take it from me. 
<br />
 
<br />
Oh, in continuation of a post I had earlier that just trailed off into obscurity... 
<br />
 
<br />
I've never had anyone personally complain to me about the DPS any pet of mine dished out.  And I've grouped with many mages, rogues, etc.   I suppose it could be that while I'm there, they're just happy with the xp moving and after I leave they start to complain. /shrug</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">This one time at a group that I was with gathered around to watch a light show. The stars were out and we were in a remote location. Some meteors were streaming down and the moon was slowly rising on the horizon. We looked with binoculars and telescopes at the amazing ritual of time unfolding before us in the timeless wonder of the starfilled sky. Soon we all began to gather in the toolshed and huddled closely together in a spectator fashion. The children all were in the front and the adults stood with nodded approval behind them. As the single light bulb was shut off we all were witness to the second light show of the evening. The CD burned and sparkled as the Teslacoil zapped its mettallic content right off the acrylic disc. The children were all in agast as the plasma rays changed colors and the smell of burned oxide was in the air. Soon the Teslacoil had finished its merciful act of ridding us of yet another SOE product. The Expansion CD was now powerless, now rid of any semblance of digital coding. It had given it's last light show in our little house on the prairie. Merry Christmas to us and to SOE goodnight.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

GD spell should never have made it out of beta anyway. All it does is cause grief. Grief from the classes who don't have this powerful tool. Grief from us when SOE agrees with them and 'nerfs' charm.

My response is to just loose the f'ing spell altogether.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
