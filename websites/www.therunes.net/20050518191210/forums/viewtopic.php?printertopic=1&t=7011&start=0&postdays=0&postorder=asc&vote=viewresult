<span class="postbody">(... in regards to <a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6990" target="_blank" class="postlink">this thread</a> , put here as I didnt want to interrupt that discussion and I have no clue where else to put it.)
<br />

<br />
First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a VERY long time lurker of the Runes, having considered this site the only viable resource for Enchanter information since stumbling upon it ages ago. The Runes has been a part of my life on a daily basis and I thank you, Jewel, for the vision had for this community. 
<br />

<br />
I am finally compelled to have an active voice here. As of late, I feel that it is impossible for me to come to the Runes for any EQlive information without being inundated with negativity. Indeed, the EQ boards have drowned beneath the venom of those who are jaded by their opinions regarding SoE and the injustices they feel have been perpetuated against them, valid or invalid. I'm not here to argue the validity of your opinions. 
<br />

<br />
So, in response to the following: 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">The small number of views on this topic indicates something. I'm afraid most chanters have given up.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
and
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Go if you must but the message I see you conveying is that <span style="font-weight: bold">we still care and are playing the game</span> regardless of how badly they've treated us.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
No, most enchanters havent given up. Contrary to popular belief, many of us are still playing and do indeed still care about our class.  I, however, HAVE given up on thinking that those of us who still play can be heard here above those deafening individuals who are constantly mocking those for playing Everquest. At this point, I feel like the EQlive boards here on the Runes should be "read only", as individuals searching for anything pertinent to EQ and the Enchanter community now have to wade through "We hate SoE!" propaganda every single post to find anything valid. I suppose there is nothing else pertinent to say about EQ that is informative or positive? "We hate SoE! &lt; insert WoW accolades here! &gt;" is certainly not news, certain individuals refuse to let us forget it for one instant! If I've given up on anything, I've given up on the Runes in this regard.
<br />

<br />
For those of you who have left the EQ community and moved on to bigger and better things, I ask you to think twice about the negativity you are contributing to the environment here on the EQlive boards. I know that I, for one, am forced to choke on your attitude (and you know who you are) every time I search the Runes for new information regarding EQlive Enchanter community. 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Here's a real suggestion for the upcoming summit. Don't go. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />

<br />
It doesnt suprise me that you, of all people, would suggest Jewel abandon those that would appreciate a voice at this Summit. Considering the abuse that you're allowed to get away with upon people who are trying to find sanctuary within the EQlive forums, I'm not sure if anyone from this board would be sufficient representation for playing enchanters anyway. If there was an appreciation for the playing enchanter within this community, people like you would have been chastised for the constant disrespect long ago. 
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">I have zero sympathy for the folks playing SoE games.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Wait... let's try that again:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">I have zero <span style="font-weight: bold">respect</span> for the folks playing SoE games.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Fixed. And dont we know it!
<br />

<br />
In closing, I appreciate the playing enchanters who have stood their ground here and continued to be a voice amongst the castigation. I pray that carefully thought insights and concerns that are valid to playing enchanters are presented to Jewel on our behalf, so that she has more to present at the player summit than obnoxious vitriol spewed by a boisterous few that dont even play the game.

No, most enchanters havent given up. Contrary to popular belief, many of us are still playing and do indeed still care about our class. I, however, HAVE given up on thinking that those of us who still play can be heard here above those deafening individuals who are constantly mocking those for playing Everquest. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Couple things I want to point out right away. First off is, happy people don't make threads about how happy they are. It sort of makes things <a href="http://img86.exs.cx/img86/7842/ss0jb.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">uninteresting</a>. Since many enchanters have taken issue with developments to their class, they post about it; those that are satisfied do not. From time to time one of them will pop in and remind everyone that not all is frowns and gray--you're certainly not alone in that regard. They just don't need to talk about it. 
<br />

<br />
Your post really has two main points, one of which I agree with and the other of which I find misguided. The people who no longer play everquest who just hang around in the generic EQ sections of the board and yell at people who do play EQ are, almost to a man, off-topic and trolling. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">However</span>, someone with a cancelled chanter account is more than entitled to post in a thread about cancelled chanter accounts. People who used to play enchanters can post in threads about enchanters, and as long as they don't fill their posts with banal "wow roxxors j00r boxxors" stuff, they're awesome for sticking around to lend a hand. Those of us who don't play eq anymore can still stick around for the people here and post just like the people who *do* play eq can live on a board with section devoted to WoW and EQ2. 
<br />

<br />
So in summation: the negativity is here as a result of the problems enchanters face; since neither the people nor the alignment of the planets has appreciably changed, and the game did, that's the logical conclusion. Wishing it away and demanding that frowns be turned upside-down isn't productive. It's a reasonable request that people who left EQ stop shitting up threads, but no fanciful thinking in the world will change that there are a whole lot of enchanters pissed off about the state of the game. Some, like myself, left because we think that EQ's current state and forecasted path are completely unsustainable and that they really should stop trying to frankenstein the shit out of a really old game. Others think things can be fixed, so they complain and try to bring about the fixing, because that's really all they can do. 
<br />

<br />
As an example of the problems of frankenoldgame: Run eq, look at graphics, notice how fast it plays. Run Doom III, look at graphics, notice how fast it plays. Ouch.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">My careful analysis tells me one thing - that Cul isn't rude or insulting (a couple of very rare exceptions, but we all have our off days).  There are far more offensive and insulting posts made as responses to him, so, as far as I am concerned, he has positive karma with me.
<br />

<br />
I am sufficiently secure in my opinions and aware of both their foundations, and also the gaps in my knowledge (this last is the important one) that a few dissenting voices won't dissuade me.  However, an offensive one would make me leave the board, if allowed to persist.
<br />

<br />
The facts that Cul promotes are correct.  So are the facts put out by all the "negative voices".  I still play the game (as enchanter, even) to get fun out of it, and don't play CoH, EQ2, WoW, AC2, AO, DAoC, etc - and have tried out some of those (CoH, WoW and AC2), so it isn't from lack of exposure.
<br />

<br />
Bottom line is that I am prepared to allow people to have different opinions than me, and I am not willing to suppress or censor them, so long as they play by the rules.

Positive posts about EQ are met with resentment, people are belittled for their opinions.  Its not really a place to come to express an open opinion, only one that is negative about enchanters.

sorry if I do that though.
<br />

<br />
there are negative threads where its obvious there is gonna be some.. those are usually in rants .. and well rants is just that haha.
<br />

<br />
all the informative posts are still there.. you can still ask questions and get good answers.  but in the discussion threads and especially rants.. I don't think you're gonna get just the happy posts <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
now some.. like culb <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" /> /snicker.. they seem pretty bitter.. but other really love/loved playing their enchanters and speak up about the current state.. good or bad.  
<br />

<br />
the only people belittled.. are trolls. and flaming here is so mild.. you should read the sony boards.. or better yet the blizzard boards haha (I admit to having some flaming fun over there)  people that come here (especially from other classes) and tell us how we should play.. well im not gonna say.. thank you oh great wise person of all knowledge.. im gonna argue with them!  and if its obvious they have come here for no other purpose than to 'stir up the hornets nest'.. then im gonna treat them like the forum troll trash they are.  people that come here saying.. im 'having fun and you should be too if you were any good' are not expressing an opinion.. they are calling people idiots haha. 
<br />

<br />
im glad you're having fun.. ive never wanted anyone to quit.. but I have my point of view.  I can't remember the number of times I didn't hit submit after typing a long post.. or removing lines haha.  I don't want to cause fellow enchanters grief.. but I am a big mouth and as long as juwel doesn't kick me out.. ill speak up from time to time.. it seems like playing for almost 3 years.. I would have a little say.  and I would challenge anyone who said I didn't have fun.. you can't play an enchanter for 3 years without having fun haha.. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

I kind of agree with this, too. I saw the Shaman Crucible go the same way and had to eventually stop going there because it was 95% negativity.
