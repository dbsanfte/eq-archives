<span class="postbody">Zhiyi Zhang looks great in this movie. Andy Lau (one of my favorite actors/singers) as usual does a great job. Not sure who the heck the 3rd main character is as my Mandarin sucks. Watching this on DVD with English subs. Bought it for 20 bucks plus shipping. Better than paying 9 bucks at a movie theater which doesn't include the hassle of driving, parking, and the WAY overpriced food. 
<br />

<br />
Initial impression after 30 min. Very nice cinematography. Nicely scripted fights without being too overdone like they were in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Btw, the term "crouching tiger, hidden dragon" refers to the dangers that's hidden all over when one enters the world. Sorta like a tiger in the dense canopy crouching and waiting to snare you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Just finished watching this. The only bad part is that I don't understand Mandarin too well so I had to rely on the subtitles. The DVD had a choice of traditional or simplified Chinese and English. The English subs were actually pretty good but there were some lines that I would have definitely changed to be more true to the original dialogue. It's directed by the same guy who did Hero with Jet Li. 
<br />

<br />
The conclusive fight was AMAZING. Very well done final fight. Again cinematography was great. There were a lot of good looking scenery with lots of nice contrasting colors. 
<br />

<br />
Oh, and I found out who the male co-star was, he's actually Japanese which would explain why I don't recognize him. Heh, I didn't look at the dvd cover, I just popped the dvd in. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://us.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/pid-1003540259/did-0/code-c/section-videos/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Yes Asia sells it for $13.99 + $2.00 shipping.</a> I paid a tad more for it but only by $2.00 cause it wasn't on sale at the time. Excellent movie. If you liked Hero, Crouching Tiger, and Iron Monkey then this movie would please you. 
<br />

<br />
I should also mention the DVD is region 3 (east asia) but most computer DVD software should play it just fine. If not there are a few tools you can find online to use and disable the region checking. Or at the least to reset the region of your dvd player at will.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I saw the show in a theatre in Malaysia, with an all chinese speaking crowd.
<br />

<br />
I didn't like it and I think neither did the majority of the audience that spoke the language (and I would think would be the main demographic the film-maker is making the movie for).
<br />

<br />
I think the movie's rep (in the West) is horribly overblown and I personally feel that it pretentious and illogical. It also commits the worst cinematic sin in my eyes - its gets pretty boring in the middle part IMHO. Really, I think this movie was banged out to take advantage of the good buzz generated by the previous film the director did - "Hero" (whom i thought was just kinda okay - not great, just ok).
<br />

<br />
The movie really needed a strong editor to prune out the meandering stuff in the middle. 
<br />

<br />
MINOR SPOILER:
<br />
The ending sequence of the movie...
<br />
Sheesh, I think it really killed the "impression" of the film for me. The word SILLY comes to mind. Another word is ENDLESS. The audience i was with giggled throughout the ending sequence and i feel for them too. The audience (and I) was giggling not because the movie was intentionally funny but at ..... I would put it charitably .... artistic flair taken a wee bit too far (and for too long). Somebody, anybody .... actor, producer, editor, cameraman... should have said to the director, "You know, thats really gonna look stupid on screen."*
<br />

<br />
Weak movie, some nice fight sequences, lax editing and overly indulgent  "pretentious" directing (thats evident in the last quarter of the movie). Nowhere near as good IMO as CTHD or even Hero (which itself was just a personal "ok").
<br />

<br />
* I may ROT13 post what it was in the ending that bothered me, the audience and the majority of the people i polled; if anyone asks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Well, I'd have to agree with the weak story department. I liked it mainly for the cinematography and the fight scenes which I thought were well done. As for the ending fight scenes. That looked totally real instead of the overstaged fights that happens a lot of times in action flicks. That fight just looked chaotic which is about what would be right considering the ending.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
