Take a look at my post under the State Of Azeroth in the WoW forum on this site.  I'm not giving Blizzard a break.
<br />

<br />
Like others, I feel they've made an incredibly fun game.  It has bugs, which are frustrating.  They don't communicate about a lot of them.  Blizzard is struggling in some regard.
<br />

<br />
In other areas, they are doing amazingly well.  The warrior feedback is just one example.  Far as server problems - last weekend I rolled an alliance char on Kel Thuzad.  Lag was worse than bad, and the server started crashing to boot.  I went to another server and had some fun there instead.
<br />

<br />
Only thing I can add, Bad - is if you want to really know why people feel the way they do about WoW, you need to play it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<tr><td class="printline">
<span class="postbody">Blizzard has a reputation for making quality games, and releasing quality. Im very happy with my gametime in WoW atm, but Im not saying the product doesnt have flaws. The server stability is still an issue that should be solved. Its partly players fault, its partly Blizzards fault. The content for level 60s is another issue, but if you actually do the content 1-60, youll be hardpressed to say there is a lack thereof. Right now, the major issue with content is "we only have X amt of high level dungeons to raid." Well, Im reaching that stage of the game for high level dungeons, but its not like Im going to be available to do these dungeons 24/7 so my interest will be peaked for quite some time in doing those expeditions.
<br />

<br />
WoW isnt getting any break. People are complaining. And Im not talking about the Official Forums. Even here at TheRunes people comment about WoW and its flaws. However, we keep our discussion in WoW Discussion, or to ourselves on other boards, partly because the moment ANYTHING negative is said about WoW here the community would have no problem saying, "see see see WoW sucks just as much as EQ, ya dang hypocrite." WoW has its problems, but Im forgiving towards WoW because Blizzard IS new to the MMORPG market and still have a chance to really make a difference with their product. I mean REALLY make a difference.
<br />

<br />
SoE had a chance to redeem my interest in Omens of War. I actually enjoyed that expansion, until WoW & EQ2 released. I could no longer enjoy that expansion afterwards because the people available to survive the zones I hunted and the Trials I partook in were gone to play these new venues (most of whom, never returned). Server population dropped, and there I was sitting with thumbs up my ass waiting for everyone to recouperate guild numbers, regear, and reflag to enjoy OoWs content. I dont have time to invest in sitting in PoK for nine hours LFG (yes I used the LFG tool quite a bit), or buffwhoring KEI. I just cant.
<br />

<br />
If you look at the performance of SoE since The Summit, youll see the playerbase has indeed plummeted on various servers, enough so that SoE decided to start merging them. SoE only makes attempts to talk with the playerbase when all other modes of desperation have failed. "Uh oh people are unhappy with GoD, we need a solution, THE SUMMIT!" "Uh oh, people have seen through our scheme, I know, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDANTS!" "Uh oh, people are realizing we have no intent of really doing anything on the Top 10 List, I know, TELLM AFTER THE NEXT EXPANSION." "Uh oh, people are actually leaving the game. I know, lets MERGE THE SERVERS." 
<br />

<br />
Blizzard IS more open, in the fact they actually started communication from Day One. SoE hasnt communicated squat until they realized their not the only game in town anymore. SoE made attempts, half-assed or otherwise, because they had NO CHOICE. Blizzard came onto the scene, and did it without question. SoE had to be backed into a corner before they would communicate with us, and even so, here we are with worthless Top 10 Lists and Class Correspondants whose job is pointless. Im forgiving of WoW because theyve shown since Day One they care. Their track record of games show they care. Their Devs care. 
<br />

<br />
Those of us who cared about EQ1, I mean TRULY cared about EQ1, are almost gone. That is why we say, and I say, that EQ1 is dead. Because the people SoE truly captivated with their game, they drove away. All thats left now is a pathetic attempt to compete with newcomers who did 95% of it right the moment their game was released, and just need to fix that extra 5% to put them over the top. Why would I support a company that after six years managed to taint the entire enjoyment of a game like Everquest that I truly loved playing and play EQ2, when its just more of the same with flashier graphics? Just because SoE may have "got it right" with EQ2 so to speak, doesnt mean its a whole new company policy in my eyes.
<br />

<br />
Ive played EQ1, EQ2, and WoW. Of all those, Im only subscribed to EQ1 and WoW. Of those choices, the only one Im playing IS WoW. What do I do with my EQ subscription for the last six and a half months? Chat. The game has evolved to "push out expansion after expansion, ignore class issues, more timesinks, less quality and more quantity," than actually making a fun, enjoyable environment. In the coming months, if Blizzard doesnt get off their duffs and get their ducks in a row, youll see the same complaints coming outta my mouth about them as I do about SoE. The big difference is Sony had six years to get off their ass and do something. Waiting until the last minute isnt a sign they care. Its a sign of desperation. Thats why Im overly critical of SoE, and why Im forgiving of Blizzard.

Ive played EQ almost since release  (April 1999)
<br />

<br />
SONY had open boards with Dev commentary, <span style="font-weight: bold">just like Blizzard</span>, for the first 15 months of EQ.  
<br />
--- you didnt even need an EQ acct to post in the early days of EQ 
<br />

<br />

<br />
if you played EQ post Kunark, you may have never seen the old SONY EQ boards.
<br />

<br />
SONY was *very responsive*  during the first year of EQ
<br />
(altho the game is almost 6 years old now)
<br />

<br />
a year later, SONY made their boards heavily moderated and requiring an EQ acct to post 
<br />

<br />

with blizzard, you have always needed an acct to post

</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Preface: I had to think about whether to respond again to this thread, because trying to communicate one of the points I'm trying to make (I touched on it in my second post on this thread) may be futile. I say this because when I was burned out after playing a MUD I used to play a lot (over 2 years, 50+ days invested) I don't know if I would have acknowledged the problem, at least not initially (I did figure it out over time, after thinking about the phenomenon a lot, and wondering and planning how EQ would deal with it). 
<br />
But, what the heck, I'll go for it. You guys can agree or disagree, but this is my analysis of the MMORPG burnout phenomenon: 
<br />

<br />
First, a few assertions: 
<br />

<br />
1. Game lifespan. Games like EQ, UO, the better MUDs out there, etc. generally hold people's attention MUCH longer than conventional games. I'm talking about the players who enjoy the game initially, of course, not the ones who decide they don't like it in the first week or so and then return it/shelf it. Generally, the longer a person is associated with something and the more time invested, the more attached he or she gets. So it's pretty safe to say that players who really get into MMORPGs become VERY attached to them, and the longer they play, the more attached. 
<br />

<br />
2. Patching. MMORPGs can and are patched. They evolve and change. When you buy a conventional game you know that what you bought is pretty much what you have. There may be a few maintenance patches that fix bugs, and there may be an expansion in the game's future if the game is successful, but still, overall, the game is the game. Not so, of course, with MMORPGs. Features are added, content is added, game balance is adjusted (be it via enhancements or 'nerfs'), etc. The player KNOWS that the game COULD be, over time, made into something EXACTLY what he or she is looking for. At least in theory an MMORPG could evolve over time into the 'perfect' game, at least for one player (obviously not for everyone, because one player has different needs and wants than another player -- the old 'you can't please everyone all the time' adage applies here). 
<br />

<br />
3. 'Familiarity breeds contempt'. People get burnt out of just about anything in life. Some things take longer to grow weary of, but eventually just about everything grows old. As another poster wrote, and I paraphrase, 'no game has infinite playability.' I'm sure different people have different expectations, some realistic and perhaps others not so realistic, as to how long a game like EQ 'should' hold their attention, but, regardless, nobody expects EQ or any other MMORPG to hold their interest forever. It's also pretty safe to say that a flaw in something or someone can remain hidden, overlooked, or flat out ignored if the overall package is generally a good one. For example, if I buy a new car and it has a few problems, but overall it's what I wanted, then I'll probably ignore the problem (at least initially). But, over time, as the newness of the car wears off, as I get accustomed to the 'good' the car offers me, the problem(s) tends to get more and more annoying, until eventually, sometimes, it's all that's on my mind. After a while, every time you hop in your car that damn lump in the seat becomes more and more uncomfortable. Well, perhaps that's not the best analogy of all time, but you get the picture. 
<br />

<br />
4. Ease of communication with the dev team. Well, here we are. Gordon posts here, I read and sometimes post, and quite a few of the other dev team members are lurkers. You can complain and say we don't post enough, or that we don't listen to your needs, or that our customer service isn't robust enough, etc., but <span style="font-weight: bold">the fact is, here I am at 10:54 pm, at home, posting to a public message board frequented by EQ players, attempting to communicate and address an issue. Criticize, flame, yell and scream, but we're here, trying. </span>This isn't always possible with games (or many other consumer products, for that matter) and while it isn't necessarily unique to MMORPGs, I think it's fair to say that this genre as a whole makes more of an overall effort to set up communication channels with its player base (it really makes sense, because being an online only genre we can assume that our player base would tend to by internet savvy, familiar with message boards, usenet, etc.). (Disclaimer: I know there are other developers out there making non-MMORPGs who post, do chats, write .plan files, etc., so please don't take offense at this assertion - none is meant - I'm definitely generalizing). 
<br />

<br />
Conclusion: Many players will, after a significant period of time, become 'burnt out', disenchanted, etc. with an MMORPG. Although the player started playing the MMORPG and really liked it, over time those little nagging problems became significant issues for him. He communicated his wishes and comments to the dev team and they didn't respond and/or implement his suggestions, even though they could have. This is upsetting to the player. He really cares deeply about the game, he KNOWS the problems he has could be addressed via patching, and he KNOWS the dev team is listening. So the game he wholeheartedly supported, loved, and recommended early on slowly evolves into more of a love/hate relationship. He's still addicted, he's invested a LOT of time into his character and the items his character possesses, but at the same time he's becoming more and more frustrated with the developers and maintainers of this game, because, after all, they COULD address his issues. And, of course, every time he experiences one of the problems he has with the game, whether it's a bug or something intentional he deems a design flaw, it bothers him more and more. He probably didn't notice the problem at first, or if he did, he ignored it in that it was dwarfed by the overall newness of the game. But now… now it's really on his nerves. 
<br />

<br />
I submit this phenomenon I've described rarely if EVER happens with conventional, single player games because at least three if not four of the assertions I made above are not applicable to most games. This phenomenon is therefore relatively new (although it's common with MUDs and has been happening for years, MUDs have never been mainstream and I'd say probably 95% of EQ players, for example, have never played a MUD, much less been addicted to one). It's new, but it's not going away. As I mentioned in my previous post, this genre is still in its infancy. EQ, UO, AC, etc., I still consider FIRST generation MMORPGs. And while they're all great games I think it's safe to say that the second and third generation MMORPGs will blow away the earlier ones. We will learn from our mistakes, we will have better technology, we will have more support and bigger budgets, etc. And because of all this, I think we can somewhat reduce this burnout phenomenon, or at least make it such that it takes LONGER for the average player to become burnt out or disenchanted. 
<br />

<br />
See, I get it. I've been there. I've experienced it. At one point I'd play maybe three or four hours a night, have a blast 90+% of the time, but spend the other percentage *****ing with my guildmates as to how poor decisions were being made by the MUD's admins, how we were running out of high level content and needed more zones, how one class wasn't balanced relative to the others, etc. I LOVED the game, but after a while I didn't care much for the admins. When they changed something I didn't agree with it affected me PERSONALLY because I had a huge personal attachment both to the game and to my character (level 50 ranger, 50+ days played, tons of very hard to get, rare items, etc). How DARE they make a change that affected ME adversely, regardless of the fact that it was to maintain their overall vision of the game, or their long term plans, or to preserve a semblance of overall game balance. 
<br />

<br />
Ok, so if this is an inescapable phenomenon, if it's only a matter of time before many or most players experience it, then what can we do? What can the players do? What can the developers do? Well, that's why I wrote the preface to this post: I'm not sure if an explanation will help. I'm not sure how many players can step away and analyze the situation and at least understand it. Like I said, at the time this was happening to me I don't think I could have. It took time, it took looking at it from a third person perspective (which I was trying to do because we were designing EQ at the time and I wanted to avoid the mistakes of the past), and most of all, it took experience in the genre (i.e. playing these kinds of games for a long time, looking at other MUDs, reading what others were saying about other MUDs, etc.) So my hope is that as the genre matures so also will the player base (I really don't mean that in a condescending way, so please don't take it as such). I hope that players will recognize what is happening and remember it when communicating to the developers. I hope the developers will recognize it and double their efforts to communicate to their players and to address players' needs and issues. I hope that some players will know when to quit (or at least take a break), preferably BEFORE they get so upset that they flame, insult personally, and swear never to buy a game from developer X ever again. I also hope that the players will still recommend the game they had so much fun with to others, but at the same time warning their newbie associates about this phenomenon, about the intense personal attachment and passion that often accompanies these games, and the signs of burn out and disenchantment of which to be wary. Lastly, I hope that players will over time realize that while the game can indeed be patched and changed, that the developers must consider the overall health of the game and make changes accordingly. 
<br />

<br />
As I finish this up, let me leave generalizations and references to the genre as a whole and switch to EverQuest specifically. In other words, how does all of this relate to EQ today? Well, I think EQ has a very bright future ahead of it. I think there is a lot we have yet to accomplish, a huge world we can expand, tons of new features, quests, items, and NPCs we can add, and more. I look at UO and I see a game with 150,000 subscribers over two years after it's release. Regardless of how I feel about that game's design, issues, and problems, that is VERY respectable. EQ has been out almost a year now and it's still growing like crazy. It is by far the most successful online only game of all time (we are closing in rapidly on the 200,000 subscriber mark). A huge Expansion to the game is about to be released, increasing the size of the world by over 30%, upping the quality of the graphics and other details, and adding a new playable race. The vast majority of players who've ever played EverQuest are STILL playing! (Contrary to another post and some incorrect data, significantly less than 30% total have quit over the 11 months EQ has been out). And again, one of the origins of our problems (overcrowding) is because, despite no formal marketing in MONTHS, the game continues to sell (primarily because of word of mouth). All in all, people LOVE EQ, they can't stop playing it, and they tell their friends to buy it. 
<br />

<br />
But yes, there are problems. The game is hardly perfect. There are game mechanics that could and will be improved over time. There are overcrowding issues that will, over time, be addressed. There are the changes we'll have to make in the future to maintain balance and the overall health of the game that will upset some players, affecting them directly and adversely. And there are people both leaving the game as well as those who haven't left but who are becoming burnt out and disenchanted, either with the game or with us, or both. And many of this latter category post on this message board. 
<br />

<br />
So what are we going to do about it? Well, let me assure you that while I think this phenomenon is in many ways inevitable and unavoidable, we're still going to do everything in our power to minimize it. As I mentioned in my earlier post it is absolutely in our interest that as many players keep subscribing as possible. You can interpret that as base greed, self-preservation, the desire to be able to keep making games like this and fulfill our dreams, or all three (which is probably closest to the truth), but it's true nonetheless. We want to make as many of you happy as often as possible and for as long as possible. 
<br />

<br />
So here's the plan: we will continue to listen, we will continue to post, we will continue to try to explain our positions and to gather great ideas from our player base. We will launch servers as fast as we are able in order to keep overcrowding down (and no, regardless of how hard we try, that probably won't be fast enough for many of you). We will launch our first Expansion in late April, increasing the size of the world and hopefully breathing a breath of fresh air into the world of Norrath. We will continue to adjust, maintain, balance, and add features to the client and server. We will continue to add new quests, items and NPCs. We will re-tune and revamp existing areas and zones in an attempt to spread people out and entice them to enjoy ALL of Norrath's adventure areas. And, longer term than that, we have some other pretty nifty EQ related projects in the works, whether they be expansion, sequels, or what have ya. Verant is definitely in this for the long term. I hope you all hang with us and keep the faith. I hope that you keep playing EQ and enjoy the upcoming Expansion. But if you need to take a break, please do. And if you want to try our competition, please do. By all means play the game you have the most fun with - as I posted some weeks ago, life is too short to play a game you're not really enjoying. No game is right for everyone, and no matter how hard we try there will always be people who disagree with the direction we are taking the game or the decisions we are making. With 195,000+ players I'm sure statistically there are hundreds, if not thousands, who are burnt out and disenchanted. And that number will probably grow over time. And I think that's at least somewhat inescapable, even though we're going to try our damndest to make that statistic as low as possible. 
<br />

<br />
Ah well, that's pretty much it - we're doing our best, and we'll get better. If you still enjoy EQ, stick around, 'cause you ain't seen nothin' yet. But if you're starting to get that sour taste in your mouth, letting the game affect you personally, or getting steaming mad at us, well then, step back, think about what I've said please, see if it's applicable to you, and make your decision. Maybe understanding why you're feeling what you are will help, maybe not. Heck, maybe you think I'm just full of it :)In any case, keep the feedback and the constructive criticism coming, 'cause we're both listening and not going away <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

I don't care about apples and oranges. One is red one is orange. I find the orange to have a bit more juice which is something I enjoy. I don't care if the apples mother grew it the same way the oranges mother did 10 zillion years ago. All I care about is if I enjoy my damn orange because in the end, the apple has nothing to do with the flavor of my orange! <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" />

People have been complaining even before it had gotten to be such a trend. People will always complain. It is your job to pull out what you think is a valid issue and put effort into making them tell you what is going on. Granted, they don't have to, but given enough pressure anything is possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

There's a post like <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-hunter&t=169071&p=1&tmp=1#post169071" target="_blank" class="postlink">this</a> in the WoW hunter forums, and a post like <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=enchanterbalance&message.id=797" target="_blank" class="postlink">this</a> in the EQ enchanter forums.
<br />

<br />
I think my personal reason (and yes, I totally admit that I'm biased in Blizzard's favor) is that Sony just doesn't seem to care about enchanters much anymore. At least when there were guild summits and posts from Rytan explaining to us why none of the things we wanted would be implemented I got the impression that they cared about their game. Looking at Nadia's post, I think what helped hook me, way back when, was the impression that Brad McQuaid LOVED his game. I mean, look at that post. It's friggin' 'uge. Jeebus.
<br />

<br />
I get that same feeling from the Blizzard CR reps. Their posts bring across their frustration with themselves and their coworkers when they don't have answers for the players, their dedication to the game, and their desire to keep improving an already good product.
<br />

<br />
For some reason, <span style="color: red">(no change planned at this time)</span> vs. <span style="color: red">(currently being evaluated)</span> for the 4th month in a row doesn't really convey that to me.
<br />

<br />
And yeah, I certainly recognize that in the end, Blizzard is in the business to take my money. That in itself doesn't bother me; that's the way entertainment works. However, it becomes a problem (for me) if that's their ONLY motivation for producing the game. I don't feel like that's the case with Blizzard. Perhaps it's naive, but I genuinely feel like they care about the quality of their product.
<br />

<br />
Now, to some extent, what other people have said is true. To quote teh McQuaid:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">People get burnt out of just about anything in life. Some things take longer to grow weary of, but eventually just about everything grows old. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
And that's certainly part of it - EQ held my attention for a long time, but eventually I moved on. It was bound to happen, and both Sony and Verant certainly deserve some mad props for creating and maintaining the only computer game to hold my attention for such a long time. No doubt some of the lackluster PR from Sony is simply due to their own burnout. I can't even imagine the dedication required to stay motivated (as a programmer, designer, or PR guy) about one single project for 4+ years. I'm sure that's a factor.
<br />

<br />
But I think what it comes down to is that I was a happy EQ'er when I felt like the people at Verant/Sony cared about the game, wanted to make a balanced, enjoyable playing environment, wanted to be constantly improving things. The most excited I've been for EQ in the last 2 years is right after the Summit. I figured, hey, they're making a genuine effort. They really care about this stuff. Nowadays, though, that's not the message I get from the top ten list (essentially the only regular mode of Enchanter communication that *I've* seen for the last 3+ months; perhaps I haven't been looking hard enough). The only thing I see there is "NO! PLEASE DON'T GO! WE NEED YOUR $12.99/MO TO HELP FUND EQIII!"
<br />

<br />
It's hard to cut Sony any slack when I feel like they don't give a shit about their game beyond its ability to take my money. Similarly, it's hard NOT to give Blizzard slack when I feel like they're doing their damndest to produce a game that both their developers and their players will genuinely love.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps I'm an embittered EQ player who's been hoodwinked by Blizzard's PR guys. I don't know. My 2cp.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
