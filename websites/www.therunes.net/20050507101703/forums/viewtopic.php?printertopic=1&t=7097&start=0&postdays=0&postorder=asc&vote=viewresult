<span class="postbody">I've been thinking about what kind of loot rules to have in groups.  This is fuled by a night I had with an acquaintaince of mine from EQ1.  He plays four different characters with four different professions.  Pretty normal, I imagine.  However, our groups so far have been a general "need over greed" issue, with people passing on items that are spell upgrades for others.  The main thing is usually with spell/ability upgrades, and I've only rolled on items nobody else could use.  Since the winner of an upgrade has almost always been a person who can use it, it seems like this is the case with most people I group with.  La-la-la, we're all happy.
<br />

<br />
Back to this guy, who rolled on every single ability that was an upgrade for any of this characters that nobody else could use.  Perfectly acceptable I think, as long as he wasn't rolling on a drop some other character in the group would be using for that grouped toon's skills.  However, when I won (since we're friends, blah blah blah) he would then say in group "I need that for so-and-so-alt.  It will cost a lot to buy," with this expectation that I would then hand it over.  And many of these weren't just spell upgrades.  He was begging for tradeskill volumes his other toons were working on also.  As an aside, he was declining all small cash loot like canine saliva as too small to bother with.  Gee, it must be nice to live in a world where you can pass up on all loot that would enable you to buy things you want, instead relying on groups to allow you to farm for four characters at once.
<br />

<br />
I play pretty much two toons, with a couple perma-newbies I dabble in for diversion, and if I want to upgrade for toons that are offline, I roll for items nobody else needs and hope I win, I buy stuff with the money I make selling loot and from quest rewards, or I PLAY THAT TOON INSTEAD.  The third in our group, when I won a scholar volume, gee, he offered to buy it from me, and I sold it to him for a good deal below what it would cost to buy from another player.
<br />

<br />
Um, to sum it up, I think he was really mooching and taking for granted our friendship and my refusal to play more characters than I have the resources to invest in.  I think he was also being a dope by turning his nose up on small loot he could have won that would have given him cash (He also doesn't quest at all, as it's never worth the "thirty copper reward."  I guess that's why my druid wears better armor than his warrior, and why his only decent items are ones that higher level friends have gifted to him).  In fact, I sometimes get really honked off at his general refusal to do anything for himself and always expect somebody else to give it to him.
<br />

<br />
My original point in this post (besides to vent) was to a) see whether folks ever take alts into consideration in group loot policies b) whether folks ever take tradeskills into consideration in group loot policies c) how folks deal with people who say "my alt could really use that item" if they lose a roll.
<br />

<br />
My own take would be a) NO b) NO, but if the group wants to change it to "yes" up front, then I have no strong objections, and c) "So could mine" or "Then you should play your alt."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Otherwise anyone could make up oh my alt needs this and that, and just go sell the crap.  I have grouped with some very good people and of course they earned a break, but every once in a while you get thoes cheaty dishonest people you really have to watch out for.  So I say if he wants it for his alt, let him play his alt and loot it for himself.

<span class="postbody">I've only been in a couple groups so far but we just went on lotto as it seems much faster/easier.  I 2-box and when I do I usually decline the lotto on 1 of the chars.  There was a situation where I was playing my chanter and an adept 1 dropped that my summoner could have used and since there were no summoners in the group they let me have that one as they were all about the NBG and were obviously very trusting too (it was the adept 1 pet which ROCKS).
<br />

<br />
While it would be nice to have alts be considered, I am in a similar position where I have 4 now above lvl10 all of which do their own tradeskills too - so that's getting to be a bit much for your groups to consider.  If there is an item/book whatever I could use on an alt I would defer if someone in the group could use it and just go for stuff the 2 chars I'm playing at the time could use, and when 2-box I would decline/pass on lotto loot on one of the chars to make it a fair and equal chance of loot distribution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">This has been discussed to death during EQ1 but NBG only works when everyone is honest. However, there are enough people who try to cheat the system that it doesn't work. I've taken to going in on all loot because every pickup group I've been in has been this way. Even when someone has won something they still go in on other loot. I've seen groups where one guy has made out with 3 or 4 pieces of loot while there are still people who hasn't even won one. So I've taken to going in on all loot, giving it to friends if I don't need it and selling whatever else is there. I wish I didn't have to do this but it's either that or watch everyone else do it and then have to buy my stuff off of those everyone else. It's why I prefer a guild group or with friends.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">This weekend I was in a group as my druid and a druid adept spell dropped.  The tank won it, and then asked the group "Who needs ____?"
<br />

<br />
I said "It's a druid spell."
<br />

<br />
Nothing.
<br />

<br />
"I need it."
<br />

<br />
Nothing.

<br />
"Can I trade you something for it?"

<br />
Nothing.

A couple minutes later, I asked again, and he said "Sorry it's for a friend."
<br />

<br />
Ugh.  Now we're farming for all his friends, too?  And we're not talking tradeskills stuff either.  This was for a certain class - mine!  No way he could use it.
<br />

<br />
I then realized that his group tell asking who needed it was probably meant for his guild.
<br />

<br />
I quietly excused myself a minute later.  I wanted to say "then your friend can heal you too," but I decided to just get out and call it a night.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
