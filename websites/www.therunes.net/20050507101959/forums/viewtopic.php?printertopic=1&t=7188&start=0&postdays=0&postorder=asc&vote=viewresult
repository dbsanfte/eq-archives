<span class="postbody">Well, a lot of people are beginning to buid their own computers. It's not really that hard and it's mostly plug and play when you get all the parts in. The really hard and time consuming part is deciding what you want. Just like when you're buying a car you want something visually pleasing to you. Don't worry about what Joe Friend thinks so long as you find it pleasing. That is the most important thing. Some people like windows on the side of their computers, others think it looks tacky. It's all a matter of preference. 
<br />

<br />
One thing that I always look for is an integrated dvd/cd cover that matches the face of the case. <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/Showimage.asp?style=album" target="_blank" class="postlink">Look in this example.</a> In picture #1 you see the integrated face cover so you don't see the original face of the drive. Everything matches up. I've seen numorous cases that are white and have off white or grey drives or even black ones. I've sesen the same with a dark or black case and the drives are white or grey. It just looks mis-matched. Look at picture #1 in this example and you will also see another important feature. Large openings for the exhaust fan. The <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/Showimage.asp?image=11-129-144-12.jpg/11-129-144-08.jpg/11-129-144-09.jpg/11-129-144-05.JPG/11-129-144-04.JPG/11-129-144-03.JPG/11-129-144-02.JPG/11-129-144-06.JPG/11-129-144-10.jpg/11-129-144-11.jpg&CurImage=11-129-144-06.JPG" target="_blank" class="postlink">case that I ordered</a> also has an integrated face and large openings for the exhaust fan in the back. Computer components create heat and they run better and last longer when cool. So it is a good idea to have good circulation of air and to properly blow out hot air and suck in cool air. Examples of bad exhaust fan openings <a href="http://images10.newegg.com/productimage/11-164-044-03.JPG" target="_blank" class="postlink">1</a> and <a href="http://images10.newegg.com/productimage/11-124-087-09.JPG" target="_blank" class="postlink">2</a>. The sole purpose of the exhaust and intake grill is to keep fingers out of the fan blades. So the holes should be small enough for fingers not to get in but as large as possible to allow the maximum amount of air through.
<br />

<br />
The next most important thing is useability. If the case you choose is cramped and hard to install your gear in then it'll be a pain in the rear to set up or if you have to do maintenance on. Some of the cheaper cases also do not fold, cover or polish sharp edges so when you're installing components you can scrape or cut your hands. Quality cases should not have this problem, just be aware that it exhists. Thumbscrews. Everyone should love thumbscrews because the more thumbscrews that a computer uses, the less there is a need for fishing around for a screw drive when installing or doing maintenance. No computer case is completely tool free but the less you need your screw driver the better. Drive rails are also a great feature if done right. Drive rails lock onto dvd/cd or hard drive and you slide it into the cage that holds the drives. Usually you'd have to screw these drives on but this snaps into place using the drive rails. No screwdrive needed. The useability is purely subjective as some implementations are better than others.
<br />

<br />
Fan support. The intake and exhaust fan areas should if possible support 120mm fans as opposed to 80mm or 90mm fans. That's because 120mm fans can push the same amount of air that the smaller fans can at a lower speed. The higher the speed of the fan the larger the hum or whine that you hear from your computer. Thus while cooling may remain the same, your computer maybe be much quieter with 120mm fans as opposed to 80 or 90mm fans. I know some of you might have very loud and annoying computers due to the case fans. See if you can get it changed. Unfortunately it's almost impossible if you buy a branded computer such as Dell, HP, IBM, etc. You can also look into buying a quieter fan. I'm not sure on pricing for them but they have some higher end fans that are built for low noise. 
<br />

<br />
Other features such as having USB, Firewire and headphone plugs in the front of the case are great features as well. USB and Firewire are obvious when you have an mp3 device, external hard drive, digital camera, USB key drive, etc that you want to connect to your computer but it is something that is not a permanent connection. You're constantly plugging it in and out. Having the USB and Firewiere ports in the front means you don't have to reach all the way into the back to plug it in. It's the same deal with headphones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">The things I look for in a case:
<br />

<br />
- Quiet Fans.
<br />
- Space for at least 2 more drives than you are actually planning on using.
<br />
- Easy access.  (thumbscrews, etc..)
<br />
- Front and rear fans.
<br />
- Powerful power supply.  (I sometimes have up to 4 IDE/SCSI drives.)
<br />

<br />
The features that I don't really care much for:
<br />

<br />
- Jacks on the front of the case.  (I rarely need them and I use my laptop for things like my digital camera anyhow.)
<br />
- Window on the side.
<br />
- LEDs or temperature sensors.
<br />
- More than two 5.25" disk drives.
<br />
- Non-Removable mobo tray.  (those things annoy me)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
