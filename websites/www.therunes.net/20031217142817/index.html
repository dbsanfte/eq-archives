            Each dealer has prizes suitable for each of the class types. He then
            deals you a hand, and depending on your hand, you can win items,
            including a Gold Ticket. They say each hand has an equal chance of

          <p class="spellltext">If you win a Gold Ticket, you take that to the
            Casino Manager who then spins the prize wheel. The number you spin
            determines the prize you have won. According to SOE the big prizes
            are items such as the beads mentioned above, Guise of the Deceiver,
            Fungus Covered Great Staff. If this becomes popular, then more prizes
            will be introduced. </p>

 Community Relations Manager position and Brenlo steps up to plate.</p>
          <table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="2" bordercolor="#999999" background="texture2a.gif" class="smallpoint">
            <tr>
              <td width="428"><h1 class="boldtitle">Time for a Change </h1>
                <p>I&nbsp;was hired as Community Relations Manager for EverQuest
                  just over three years ago, in October of 2000.&nbsp; I have
                  to admit that the last three years have been the most entertaining
                  three years of work I've ever had.&nbsp; I've had a great time
                  getting to know the EverQuest community.&nbsp; It's been a
                  great pleasure of meet many of you at Fan Faire, through email,
                  and on message boards.&nbsp; Your enthusiasm for EverQuest
                  is outstanding, and I appreciate everything that enthusiasm
                  means.
                <p>Some folks have claimed that being Community Relations Manager
                  for a huge product like EverQuest is a thankless job, and one
                  that they wouldn't wish on their worst enemy.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; I
                  still have some great emails and letters that customers have
                  sent to us, thanking us for the fun they've had in EverQuest.&nbsp; I've
                  had one on display in my office for over a year, and I'm very
                  proud of each of them.
                <p>I've enjoyed every minute that I've had this job.&nbsp; I
                  want to thank you all for playing the game and for engaging
                  me every day.&nbsp; I appreciate that you take us to task when
                  we're wrong and that you appreciate the things we do well.&nbsp; Thanks.
                <p>I also wanted to thank the EverQuest Live team, past and present.&nbsp; I've
                  had the honor of working with some of the best in the business.&nbsp; Thanks.
                <p>But I'm only praising the EQLive team because I have to.&nbsp; It's
                  just practical to butter them up, since I'm to be one of them
                  now.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The folks here at SOE have offered me a
                  chance to be a game designer, and I'm going to give it a try.&nbsp; It's
                  one of those undeniably exciting things, to tell people that
                  you make games for a living.&nbsp; I'm incredibly pleased to
                  be given this opportunity.
                <p>So my official title is now Game Designer, and you'll probably
                  be hearing a lot less from me in the future.&nbsp; With my
                  well-honed Community Management skills, I can guess your next
                  question:&nbsp; "Who will be taking your place?"
                <p>We've been lucky in that regard.&nbsp; We managed to snag
                  one of the hardest-working, most experienced and silliest people
                  in the company.&nbsp; Alan Crosby, also known as Brenlo Bixiebopper,
                  is the new Community Relations Manager for EverQuest.&nbsp; Not
                  only is he a great guy, but he has a great name (the Alan part,
                  not the Bixiebopper part).&nbsp; Also, in the odd tradition
                  of EQ Community Relations Managers, he also has a nice alpha-loot
                  handle.
                <p>Enough from me.&nbsp; I now yield the floor to Alan so he
                  can introduce himself.
                <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                <p>Well thanks for the kind words Alan; you never say anything
                  that nice to me in person!&nbsp;
                <p>I know that Alan (the other Alan) will be greatly missed and
                  I can never hope to fill his shoes.&nbsp; He has a wry sense
                  of humor and a comfortable writing style that many of you have
                  enjoyed for some time now.&nbsp; Thanks for all you have done
                  Alan, and I know you will be successful adding new content
                  to the game you have been so deeply involved with for the last
                  3 years.
                <p>So a little about me.&nbsp; My title for nearly the last 2
                  years has been Customer Service Manager for our EQ games. Prior
                  to that I was a Lead Game Master, a Game Master and at one
                  point long ago, a Guide and Senior Guide. I have been playing
                  EQ since it released, and involved with its community since
                  shortly thereafter. I have met many of you at Fan Faires and
                  through correspondence, and I look forward to getting to know
                  many more of you in the weeks and months ahead.
                <p>So change has brought me here to share time with you, the
                  EverQuest Community. I feel that the greatest reason EQ has
                  been so successful for so long is because of you and your passion
                  for this game. I encourage you to continue to share your passion
                  with me, in constructive ways, and I will bring your thoughts,
                  feelings and concerns to the EQLive team. I guarantee that
                  you will be heard. Please remember that we all have our own
                  ideas of how the game should be and they may not all be implemented
                  or even considered (I for one feel that Halflings should rule
                  Norrath, for some reason the Dev team is not with me on this).
                <p>Thanks for your time and thanks for being a part of Norrath! <br>

          <p class="spellltext">On a personal note, I wish Absor the best in
            his new position and I'm very excited about Brenlo taking on the
            position. Yesterday Brenlo took the time to stop by various boards,
            including The Runes to say Hello and let us know he was here.</p>
          <p class="spellltext">Enchanters were virtually ignored by Absor, at
            least publically, which made some decisions regarding changes to
            our class hard to swallow. A little communication goes a long way,
            and I have a feeling that Benlor knows this. After not having my
            class acknowledged for so long by the person who was supposed to
            be the middle man, it's an excellent start seeing Benlor make a point
            of coming by. Kudos Brenlo and I hope this is the first step in
            ongoing, open communication between all of us. </p>
          <p class="spellltext">I sincerely hope that you open the avenues closed
            to the players for feedback when Absor took over. I wish both of
            you the best in your new positions! Let's hope this is the begining
            of a new era.<br>
