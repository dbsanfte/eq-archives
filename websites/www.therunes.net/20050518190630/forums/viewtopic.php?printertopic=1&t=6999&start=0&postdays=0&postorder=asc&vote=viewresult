<span class="postbody">Hi all, I'm writing this from the perspective of a 70 shaman who plays in a high end guild in response to this thread; <a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5773" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5773</a>.
<br />

<br />
I'm not here to bash you as I can see that the list of nerfs that encs have been on the recieving end is quite long.  BUT I can also see the reasoning behind those nerfs and I welcome the increased opportunities I as a shaman now have to get groups.  When GoD was released, shaman got the shaft royally, we were already considered the red headed step child when groups were considering who to go with for their debuffing needs.  Lets face it slow is an essential consideration for any group that is forming, tank, healer (read cleric, don't get me started on the clericcentricity of EQ) and a slower.  Enchanters and beastlords added mana regen( nobody likes downtime ), enchanters added excellent CC ability (nobody likes dying) and respectable DPS with their nukes, add to this charmed pets and there really was no contest.  I was left to perfect my soloing skills which was all I really ever got the chance to do.  Just how many shaman do you think closed their spell books never to be opened again during those times.
<br />

<br />
I'm thankful I had the tenacity to hang on to my sanity those long painful months and now I'm finally being rewarded by doing so, I'm sorry that all my good fortune has come at (generally speaking) the enchanters expense when it comes to getting the debuffer spot in groups, but things could not have continued as they were and have it so that you other classes could have those few extra hps from shaman buffs on your raids, there'd have been no shaman left.  So before you get cue the violins and break open a new box of tissues as you post your farewells, consider the plight of the many shaman who suffered these past few expansions due to the clear and utter superiority Encs revelled in as clear winners in the race to get those spots in groups over shaman in almost every way.  Factor in situations where crowd control is ESSENTIAL, pretty much every GoD zone (that was used for general XPing, or single group flagging for progression), timed events such as GoD trials where charmed DPS was almost required to win...need I go on?
<br />

<br />
That said, you guys still have great utility in groups, you still have crowd control, you still have mana regen and you still slow almost as well as a shaman, I just have noticed that some of your reasons you guys have listed when detailing your "grievances" about the nerfs. shaman were often used as a reference, we can't slow as well, we can't heal, we can't tank (shaman are pretty fragile too, its just we tend to concentrate on hp/ac gear over mana and other considerations as we get beat on so damn much).  Consider what you can do better than us and you'll see that those areas are definately worthwhile, just that now, theres actually some reasons to adopt a shammy into a group where before there were none.  And hey, if I'm putting a group together, I'll try to add an enc to the mix, having an enc and a shm in a group might be a sacrifice to DPS, but thats one rock solid safe group to be a part of, CR's are long and boring affairs and usually the time when one or more of the group  suddenly pipes up with "oh, something just came up, need to log, sorry guys" or mysteriously goes LD.
<br />

<br />
In my opinion, enchanters still probably have more desirability when that group is looking for a debuffer, by virtue of your ability to crowd control and mana regen.  Sure you may argue that you can obtain KEI in pok for a few plat and do away with the need for an enc, but I guarantee you, a group with a shaman in it will CR substantially more often than one with an enchanter in it, crappy heals, root thats broken in under 5 seconds by every rog with weapon affinity 5 and an itchy autoattack key (I'm with you guys on this /assist = GOOD, F8 = BAD) and every pally/ranger/beastlord/etc who fancies himself as a uber off-tank and people who never seem to understand the meaning of "%T rooted back the F*CK up!".  <img src="images/smiles/eusa_doh.gif" alt="eusa_doh.gif" border="0" />  <img src="images/smiles/eusa_wall.gif" alt="eusa_wall.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
To sum up (sorry for the extremely long post), before you were godly, almost as indispensable to a group as a cleric is, now, now you are in the same boat as rogues/wizards/magicians/beastlords/berserkers/necros are in when a group is considering what dps classes to go for, you are just one of the viable alternatives a group will consider for the debuffer class a group will go for.

<span class="postbody">Oh I'm sorry, yeah, lets just continue to have encs keep their 2k DPS /bow /scrap /bow.  BTW it wasn't me that took down enchanters a notch or two, Sony did that.  It wasn't for the benefit of shaman, thats merely a pleasant side-effect. All I did was post my agreement to it, I'm just really happy to have the chance at actually being in slight contention with enchanters for that solitary debuffer group spot.  One more thing, do you have any idea what it was like playing a shaman during the time of shite that was GoD? No of course you don't, you were too busy fielding your 20 tells inviting you into groups, getting your progression done and feeling useful, hell, godly with your pet that quadded for 1200.  You know what was the most common gripe I heard from Encs during that time? "Jesus, I wish these people would stop sending me tells for groups, I'm not even LFG!".  Poor diddums.

<span class="postbody">Of course its not as much fun for you anymore. I'm sure if I had the ability to charm a mob (with AA's, extremely reliably) and outdps the rest of the group threefold and found that I no longer had that ability, I'd find things a little less fun.  But I'm pretty sure if an enchanter levelled up his/her toon now, without having experienced the thrill of charming that 1k quadding monster would find the game as fun as you found it when you first started.  CC isn't necessary? uh huh, head off to riftseekers, do any number of the MPG trials, group or raid where mez is essential.  There are just area now where groups can get by without CC, and I think thats a great initiative, no longer is it required to have a bard or enc in groups in those area, but there are still many areas out there where its still a large part of the game.  With only 6 spots in a group and 2 of those already spoken for in 90% of situations by your warrior and your cleric, why tie up a 3rd spot at the detriment of the other dozen or so classes, don't they find it hard enough as it is to find groups?  Having at least some camps not require such an inflexible group structure is just healthy for the game, not a personal insult to encs, you're all taking it as "How dare they break the holy trinity you bastards!!@!!".
<br />

<br />
As for why I continued with the game during the hell that was GoD?  Because I rememberd what it was to be a shaman, pre-GoD it was exhilerating, flexible and fun to play class with a role to fill and a service to provide, I did what I think you all should, keep on keeping on and stop wallowing in your own self pitty. I did the same myself for a time, moaned and bitched, had hissy fits to all that would listen, but then I had enough of feeling sorry about a game that I was supposed to be enjoying, and tried to enjoy it as such, I formed my own groups and tried to impress upon others that shaman while not as ideal as having an enc in the group can still hold their own.  After all EQ is ever changing, I held on to the hope that those changes would swing back in my favor, and they did.  Did you really think that your fairytale would last forever?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Lol. You and the other people who have come on to our boards to 
<br />
complain about enchanters leaving the game really make me laugh.  I was
<br />
NOT playing everquest so that I could make your lives easier. I was 
<br />
PAYING and playing Everquest because the game was fun to play.  Sure,
<br />
I had some friends and lots of those friends have moved on to other 
<br />
games. The ones that are still playing EQ are playing because their still
<br />
having fun.
<br />

<br />
However, you have NO right whatsoever to be saying that we should stop
<br />
our "whining" and still play this game. Sorry, my money is better 
<br />
spent elsewhere.

P.S. If you look at the LONnnnnnnggg List of nerfs that Enchanters have
<br />
had to take over the last 3 years then it's not surprising that we finally
<br />
had a last straw.  Hell..We were totally minimized for an entire 
<br />
expansion (Scars of Velious) and we still managed to have fun because
<br />
of Kunark.  So yes, We are very well aware of the nerf bat.  What you
<br />
and other classes fail to realize though, Is that the Enchanter is 
<br />
(more than other classes) extremely content driven.  All SOE has to do
<br />
to minimize the Enchanter class (and has done so most effectively) is
<br />
to make content that Enchanters cannot manipulate.  manipulation, is
<br />
after all, the driving mechanism for Enchanters.
<br />

<br />
Sorry. Go to playerauctions.com and buy yourself some buff bitches.
<br />
most Enchanters are fed up.</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Balisidar on Wed Dec 15, 2004 11:14 am; edited 2 times in total</span></td>

No people pretty much coverd everything I was going to say.
<br />

<br />
I put in 4+ years into my Enchanter, no Charm was not my breaking point (ha-ha I quit before charm was nerfed the final time!).  The day I fell asleep on a raid for a hour and nobody noticed was.  
<br />

<br />
My guild like many, stopped mezzing, it was so much easier to have a paladin or shadow knight grab a monster then to have a Enchanter get resisted and it one rounded.  Without mez Enchanters have 2 things, a shitty Nuke, and... BUffs~... did I mention buffs yes, thats right something that only has to be casted once every hour unless someone fucks up and dies.
<br />

<br />
I didnt bother reading your post past the first few sentences because your ignorance shielded me reading it.  Yup, im happy another class got nerfed into uselessness so I can take their place in groups.  
<br />

<br />
I dont care about groups, I care about raids.  If im useless on raids other then for buffs, **** that, WoW fucking owns, you can stay swimming around in the Fecal matter of EQ.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I play both a Shaman and an Enchanter so I can pretty much see both sides of this.
<br />

<br />
I felt almost useless on my Shaman in GoD. SoE slowly let Shaman bleed to death by giving no improvements at all from Kunark because Turgur's is so overpowered. With Slow mitigation, Shaman healing became a joke at best unless you were in trivial content. That being said, Enchanters were really no better off.
<br />

<br />
Enchanters have had almost every skill that we used at level 50 stripped from us either by discontinuing spell lines or immunity to spell lines. I feel at least as downgraded on my Enchanter as I ever did on my Shaman right now.
<br />

<br />
You people who have never played an Enchanter but come here and spout things like "cry me a river, you no longer have quadding 1k hitting pets" don't have a clue about what our problems are. The majority of Enchanters were in agreement that Charm should be retuned, we just don't at ALL agree with the way SoE went about it.
<br />

<br />
You sound just like that druid who comes to the shaman boards and whines about how Shaman tank "IN TEH FACE" because Slow is so over-powered when you spout the stuff you do about Charm.
<br />

<br />
I still enjoy both characters because I play them with friends. But both have lost the "glory" of old and at this point I would have to say that my Enchanter has lost more than my Shaman.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Very simply put.  If you played OoW you would have learned that CC is far more challenging that anywhere in pop.

<br />
Face it guys. We were overpowered.   Was it fun to solo minies in bot? yeah.  Was it fun to be the only required class in GoD. Yea it was.  It is still fun, they just scaled back our abilities in one expansion.  Its not like they retro nerfed charm.
<br />
I grew up playing my enchanter.  I never used charm really till pop. Instead I grew up playing in groups in zones like MM or Lguk where trains were common and it tested my CC skills more than my charm skills.
<br />
I dont get one rounded in MPG like I do in vxed.  I can reliably derail a pull of 4. 
<br />
So maybe we all should focus on the core of our class (mezzing) and less on a spell that put the dps output that it did.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">before this gets to long.. id like to point out.. with more clarification...
<br />

<br />
a percieved fault in your class that you choose to play should have been worked on within your class... bringing another class down does not make your class better.. it makes another class suck.  how is your class any more or less for having something done to another?
<br />

<br />
thats argument just does make sense.  if I am an ant.. and I take away the stingers from a bee and maybe its wings... I am in fact... still an ant.
<br />

<br />
I said nothing about your class... I don't need to know your class.  I have heard the woes.. but thats what they are.. your woes are yours.
<br />

<br />
you thinking you are better now that enchanters are worse or in fact leaving.. then that I would say is your own flaw in perception.  if you sucked before and enchanters got nerfed... well you in fact still suck.. its just that maybe enchanters suck more?  thats what you truely wish?  
<br />

<br />
if that is you line of reasoning.. then I can see why you would be seen as a troll.  im sorry <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
if you want to discuss enchanter issues fine.. come here and discuss.. but don't expect to crowd surf through the enchanters when you praise their nerfing and say you stand better because of it. 
<br />

<br />
people that spend all their time compairing classes stand on extremely shakey ground.. maybe you should spend your time asking more relavent questions.. like... why are classes so comparable?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

No thanks. I was'nt going to put more money in SOE's pocket for another
<br />
shitty, half finished expansion.  Another expansion full of lies and deceit.
<br />
My money means a little more to me than to keep shoveling it in SOE's
<br />
direction because they "might" have content in it that would keep me 
<br />
happy. Only to find that they pulled the rug out from under me before the
<br />
damn expansion even went gold.
<br />

<br />
And once more....IT'S NOT ABOUT CHARM!! Why do people keep spouting
<br />
that line?  Enchanters break SOE's goddamn game. They can't figure out
<br />
how to deal with us properly and also give us challenging content.

hmm I would say that goes class by class.
<br />

<br />
and I wouldn't say its the best.. but im anti 'expansion' to begin with.  I hate the whole idea of expansions... I think im going to like how wow does stuff.. even if they give it in a new package :/ well see
<br />

<br />
but all they really did in oow is make good loots accecable to everyone with minimal effort.. they didn't lock off all the zones and they didn't do another linear increase on the mobs dps.

haha.. they didn't really come up with anything new other than mobs and styles... they just left out their horrible ideas from before.  thats just not my idea of best expansion haha.  
<br />

<br />
oow was fine with me.. it didn't make me want to crush someones throat like GoD did. but looking at spells we got and AA.. /shrug.  I got more excited when I was level 6 and found out I could sell a plauged rat tail for 1 plat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
