<span class="postbody">Our guild did a Kael raid recently to work on faction (yeah, I heard some classes can't cast their way to indifferent or amiable with almost any group they meet, but I got to group with some people I hadn't grouped with in a while, since they play and level more than I, so I thought it would be fun).
<br />

<br />
We split the debuffing between the other chanter, a shaman, and myself.  The other chanter tashed, the shaman slowed, and I incapacitated.  In retrospect, perhaps it would have been better for me to tash, since the other chanter was higher level and would have had fewer resists on his debuffs.  Once we got to the arena, the giants were quite red to me.
<br />

<br />
Usually my debuff would land, but on some of the mobs it got resisted.  I cast it again on a couple of them, after waiting a few seconds for other people to deal more damage, and didn't get aggro.
<br />

<br />
So I got a bit stubborn and bold on one mob, and when it got resisted on the first and second cast, thought "oh, I can give it one more go."  It got resisted again.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly a giant spawned in front of me!  Aaaagh!  How did that happen?
<br />

<br />
And where are the other casters?
<br />

<br />
It was only after I got away from it (still full health, oh I am so fleet of foot and my brave pet is so tauntacious) that I saw the text in the chat of "You shall not escape me, debuffing chanter!"
<br />

<br />
I'd never been summoned before, quite an invigorating experience.  Certainly more invigorating for me than for the cleric who got flattened after he aggroed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Being summoned isn't too cool at all is it.
<br />

<br />
But later on you get used to it, generally in a EXP group I get summoned regularly (I know how to keep from getting aggro if I want too, tho).
<br />

<br />
This is my most memorable memory of a summoning mob.  One day I was playing my Ranger and saw a named goblin up in Frontieer Mountains, so I go over to kill it out of curiousity.  (I've never seen this golbin before from my FM rampages of the past)
<br />

<br />
Damn, thing hits pretty hard.  Might actually have to back off and heal a bit.  Start to back up, and you've been summoned!  Oh shit.  This is NOT cool.  I've died in this zone and it took me an entire evening to find my corpse once.
<br />

<br />
I got summoned around 20 times before I finally made it to the DL zone line.  The worst part was - I snared the goblin.  So he wasn't really moving that fast and slowed my progress a whole lot.  It really pisses you off when you get summoned feet away from the zone line.  But I lived.  Somehow.  =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I know what goblin you are talking about, the one for the Shaman Cudgel quest.  I remember feeling uber when I got my Necro to 51 (you know the 1k DoT spells and whatnot) and my druid friend (55 atm) seen him on track, so we go to him me my 51 mage friend who I leveled up with from 44+ duoing and this Druid friend of ours.
<br />

<br />
He is immune to runspeed changes IIRC, because I tried to Darkness him and the Druid tried to Ensnare him.  That wasn't the worse.  I then tried to fear it (Immune to Fear type spells also <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" />) and after Mage nuked it it all went downhill.  Summon, turned into a goblin and kill... All of us.  Worse experience IMO.  Took forever to find the corpses and had to beg a level 60 Cleric from the Uberguild of the server (PoP wasn't released yet) to go there to rez us.  So hard to see Goblin corpses on the rocks when they sink in due to geometry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I always find it especially amusing when the mob does all that work (I know, it's just a proc) to summon you and then totally ignores you, because someone else bumped up its hate list just as you came in.  So you get that horrible start when the mob suddenly looms in front of you, brace yourself...and nothing.  So you kind of slink back out of range with rather a feeling of anticlimax.

<br />
This ties in to My First Tashicide story (well, my first deliberate one).  My guild was taking on MB (Magnaetic Behemoth?  I don't know what the M is except it *isn't* Magnetic as one might expect) in the Plane of Innovation.  The enchanters are mainly put to work chain mezzing the small spidery robots that wander around.  I'm still only 62, so they said, "OK, you get to tash MB!"  Well, yay!  So they start fighting and I cast tash...and nothing happens?  Why wasn't I summoned?  Dear God, what if it fizzled and I didn't see??  Did I even click the right gem????  So I panic and cast it twice more in rapid succession, until I finally pissed him off enough to summon and kill me.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif" border="0" />   It was the only way I felt confident I had really cast the spell!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

You have been summoned.

<span class="postbody">Actually, my first experience with summoning mobs wasn't with me getting summoned, but rather with a friend.  I was about level 30 or so and was doing something odd like camping a named owlbear for a drop of some sort.  This high-level druid friend (she was probably 59 or so, but at the time she might as well have been 80, as the higher levels were impossible for me to even imagine) decided to help me out.  Well, I'd never seen a summoning mob before.  My friend aggroed the named mob, then she kept running up to me and disappearing, running up to me and disappearing, running up to me and disappearing...all the while her hit points are dropping, and I'm completely confused.  Eventually it killed her.  I feel really bad now because if we had known what was happening, my husband could have invited her into a group and ported her somewhere before she died.
<br />

<br />
My friend was really chagrined at being killed by (I think) a light blue con.  She quit EQ maybe a month later.  I hope it wasn't because of that, but I always have felt that the experience kind of broke her EQ spirit.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
