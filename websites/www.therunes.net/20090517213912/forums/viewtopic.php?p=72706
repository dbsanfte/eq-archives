			<div class="content">Please post only epic 2.0 stuff here.
<br />Confirmed when you turn in your Latched chest to Jeb he says:
<br />
<br />a sarnak imitator says 'The purification is not something that I alone have the power to complete. There was once a crystal that held the power to purify something of this magnitude, however it was shattered long ago. You will need to speak to the masters that remain of dwindling races.
<br />
<br />You say, 'purifying' 
<br />a sarnak imitator says 'The purification is not something that I alone have the power to complete. There was once a crystal that held the power to purify something of this magnitude, however it was shattered long ago. You will need to speak to the masters that remain of dwindling races.' 
<br />
<br />You say, 'dwindling' 
<br />a sarnak imitator says 'The masters are of races that walked Norrath before you or I. I do not know their current whereabouts. Alaurin and Vohnkare were the eldest of the four. There was a noble . . Ah, yes and Feyana. I do hope you find them.' 
<br />
<br />Find Feyana Lightwing roaming crushbone to butcherblock. Untrackable, pink dress, looks like fairy.
<br />
<br />You say, 'Hail, Feyana Lightwing' 
<br />Feyana Lightwing says 'Greetings. It is not often that your kind has reason to speak to us. You must be seeking something.' 
<br />
<br />You say, 'I seek a crystal' 
<br />Feyana Lightwing says 'To even be aware of the crystal's existence you must be of some power. I can only assume that if you are repairing it that you have good reason. It is yours if you can do me one small favor.' 
<br />
<br />You say, 'what small favor?' 
<br />Feyana Lightwing says 'There is a Dryad that has something that belongs to me. There is no rift between our kind, however you could say this is more of a personal conflict. You see, I was once given a necklace from their people in return for a service provided long ago. It was the most beautiful Dryad necklace I have ever seen, and it was stolen. I believe the culprit's name is Firwyn. Travel to the Jaggedpine Forest and seek out Chef Brargus, he should know where to find her. If you can bring me back the necklace the fragment is yours.
<br />
<br />Find Chef Brargus in the south west part of the zone, living among gnolls.  He is next to the banker.
<br />
<br />You say, 'Hail, Chef Brargus' 
<br />Chef Brargus says 'Whatchoo want?' 
<br />
<br />You say, 'where is Firwyn' 
<br />Chef Brargus says 'Ah, talked to Feyana did you? I'm surprised she trusted the likes of you with something like this. I suppose it's no loss to her if you just wind up dead now is it? If you want to know where to find Firwyn you're going to have to bring me some mountain pooka meat. I'm working on a new recipe and I simply must have it. Off with you.' 
<br />
<br />Give Mountain Pooka Meat from Vxed or Tipt.
<br />
<br />Chef Brargus says 'That should do nicely. Now, about Firwyn. You should be able to find her in the forest nearby but I would be careful if I were you. She can be a bit fiesty, and you don't exactly look like a warrior if you know what I mean.' 
<br />
<br />Firwyn hits for 1700, untrackable, has Shackleroot and Decaying Foliage spells.  Found in the center of the zone a bit south of the dirt path, around (130, -360)
<br />
<br />Feyana Lightwing says, "Even lovelier than I remembered. Thank you ever so much. 
<br />
<br />A dieing race. The brownies. New mob near the brownie camp next to cut trees just north. a brownie noble.  Good luck in your quest for the crystal."
<br />
<br />Hail, a brownie noble. 
<br />a brownie noble says, 'Long time have your kind needed us, but never have we been close. Wouldn't you agree. I'm afraid i cannot help you without some token of faith' 
<br />
<br />What token of faith. 
<br />a brownie noble says, 'So long have we retained our distance, we have nearly been forgotten. Despite the fact that this allows us our peace, there are times i wish i could provide my people with the niceities of society. If you could obtain a few items for me i could help you with the knowledge you seek' 
<br />
<br />What items 
<br />a brownie noble says ' I would very much like some Gnomish Candy, Koada'Dal Silk, Feir'Dal Champagne, and Dwarven Steel' 
<br />
<br />Tips: use control + F to find these guys.  Everything costs 131 pp 2 gold 4 silver and 9 copper with max charisma.  If you killed mobs in growth that's ok, I just invsed and got there fine.
<br />
<br />Clockwork Merchant in Ak'Anon has the Gnomish Candy, it is left from the casters guild. (1121, -1035)
<br />Gretta Mottle in Kaladim has the Dwarven Steel, she's a general supplies merchant. Use the find npc key or (187. 300)
<br />Merchant Tyslin in Felwithe, Jewel Crafting supplies in Felwithe has Koada'Dal Silk. (-250, -426)
<br />Innkeeper Anislya General Supplies in Kelethin has the Fier'dal Champagne. (106,-436)
<br />
<br />a brownie noble says 'Perhaps your intentions are true, after all. I have one shard of a purifying crystal that you will need for the task ahead of you. It is quite powerful, and I hate to part with it. I will give it to you, but only in trade. There is a harnessing stone possessed by a seeker in Kael. It is less powerful than the crystal, but should prove sufficient for my needs. Bring me this crystal and it shall be yours.'
<br />
<br />Kill Miriku the Chaotic behind Vindicator, he is across the bridge behind this glass wall and sits next to the right door.  He looks like a blue armor giant.  Hits 440 max, can not land magic spells on him or slow.
<br />
<br />a brownie noble says, "Very well, here is the fragment.  I can only imagine at the power of the unified crystal."
<br />
<br />Find Vohnkare in Western Wastes by (777, -2468) purple and black dragon sitting next to crystals. 
<br />
<br />Hail, Vohnkare. 
<br />Vohnkare says, "What do you seek mortal?" 
<br />
<br />what crystal? 
<br />Vohnkare says, "Such great power for such a small being. I see that you are strong despite your size, however I fear for our world as I see such potent tools coming together.  I fear a great battle is upon us.  Enough of my rambling, I do have such a crystal.  Bring me some volatile vampyre blood from the Tenebrous Mountains and I will part with it.  It has been too long since I have had servants to fetch me such things.
<br />
<br />Find a coterie insatiate in Tenebrous Mountains on the top floor. He sits on the balcony with another mob.  Easily soloed with rune and nuking.
<br />
<br />Vohnkare says, " This will do quite nicely. Are you aware of the properties of vampyre blood? It can make such lovely protective concoctions. Why, I once fended off... there I go again.  Here is your crystal, make haste!"
<br />
<br />Find Alaurin, a white unicorn wandering the area north of plane of growth to the northern wall.
<br />
<br />Hail, Alaurin.
<br />
<br />Alaurin says 'Hello, coercer. Why have you disturbed me?' 
<br />
<br />You say, 'I seek a crystal' 
<br />
<br />Alaurin says 'My crystal, you say? Now that is something I hold very dear. It is my most beautiful trinket. I must say, I've never had occasion to use it however . . . Actually, I believe I can make you a deal.' 
<br />
<br />You say, 'what deal?' 
<br />
<br />Alaurin says 'I know of a stone that I could use in its stead, but before we go into that I must ask something of you. If you truly desire this piece of crystal, you must bring me the heart of a twisted stoneservant. I have heard stories of invaders that have infested this newly found continent of Taelosia, where they have managed to turn their very servants against them. This sort of utter control is very interesting to me, and I would like to study it. Once I have the heart, I know where you can find a gem to replace my crystal.' 
<br />
<br />Go to Riwwi, Coliseum of Games and enter the arena, which is the north part of the zone.  There should be 2 golems guardian each entrance on each side.  A twisted stoneservant will commonly drop the heart.
<br />
<br />Upon turning in to Alaurin: who really reminds me of Gollum....
<br />
<br />Alaurin says, "My crystal you say?  Now that is something I hold very dear.  It is my most beautiful trinket.  I must say, I've never had occassion to use it however... Actually I believe I can make you a deal.
<br />
<br />At this point an emote says that a luminescent geonid is untrackble and is found at (-2500, 0) in the geonid caves.  Either clear the tar goos or pacify them.  He can be single pulled.  He hits 2.3k, flurries, and rampages, easily killed with one group of elemental gear and is not resistant.
<br />
<br />Alaurin says, "It is even more beautiful up close.  Look at the way it sparkles!  Take your fragment then, and leave me in peace."
<br />
<br />Upon gathering all four crystal parts.  Combine them in a jewelry kit to make a single crystal.  REMOVE any fancy augments you put on your epic 1.5, like procs or what not.  Then combine your epic 1.5 with the crystal in a jewelry kit.  Congratz, you now have an emote saying:
<br />
<br />Your Oculus of Persuasion gleams with a blinding light for a moment, dimming to its previous understated beauty. the light has left an image burning in your mind, a strangely tattooed woman chanting by a waterfall.
<br />
<br />In Nedaria's Landing go north east across the river to the first waterfall (1410, 1055) on an island in front of a waterfall.
<br />
<br />Priestess Rakhu says "I have been expecting you. There are still a few things more for you to do before the staff is properly prepared. For the next step you will need to travel into Discord and gather two items that I need to perform the next step in the purification process. A great beast by the name of Cipheron has hoarded an incantation for many years. I believe he killed one of our students who was unfortunate enough to get in his way... Reguardless, I will need it. You will also need to gather a noxious secretion from a withering murkglider. It is a strange fluid they begin to secrete as they are dying, and it is very powerful. Bring me this incantation and the secretion and we shall get started. "
<br />
<br />Killing Cipheron in Wall of Slaughter, make sure you have been flagged (by combining crystal with epic 1.5) and being on raid loot list.
<br />
<br />Kill a withering murkglider for the noxious secretion.  Location of Withering Murkglider is (-1370, 1016, 255) in the southwest corner of the map, on the east side of the southmost curve there, next to a rock. If you watch the bazu roamer there, he stops right on top of it before heading back west. It's a dead looking murkglider that is not flying; he's just lying flat on the ground. So if you aren't looking closely, he'd be easy to miss. Red to 70, KOS and sees invis. Hits for around 2k and casts Withering Heat. 
<br />
<br />Very resistant and kept spawning level 65 parasitic murkglider babies. They are mezzable with ae bliss and when they die they AE Energy Burst (unresistable 4k nuke). 
<br />Death AE is 70 range so could probably do better next time if we keep most people out of range. 
<br />
<br />Once you have those two things: 
<br />
<br />Priestess Rakhu murmurs in a strange tongue as she scans the incantation. She draws an intricate design along different portions of the staff, using the strange secretion, from which rises a pale green smoke. At last she stops and opens her eyes. "Perfect. This tool has been consecrated and protected in the best way I know. There is but one thing left to do, for the staff is ready but not yet tested. Take this channeling crystal and venture into the land riddled with discord. When you encounter great evil there, you will recognize the energy of discord. Channel this energy into your staff, and it will become something more powerful than this world has seen. I wish you luck." 
<br />
<br />Anguish access: Beat 6 Muramite Prayer Grounds trials.  Collect 7 signets from across OoW and bring a raid of friends to Anguish!
<br />
<br />Once you get into Anguish, kill Warden Hanvar, An Orb of Discordant Energy pops, just like a chest from epic mobs.  Inside the chest is Globe of Discordant Energy, the part that combines in the Channeling Crystal.  Combine epic (REMOVE Augs) and globe and voila! You have epic 2.0 and 10 aa. (Make sure you put 100% into aa just to be safe).
<br />
<br />The discordant energy shoots through the staff, sending a shower of sparks through the air. The crystal shatters before you, and as the sparks fade away you notice the changes in your staff.
<br />
<br />As I no longer play this game anymore, the last part about getting the actual orb is only one of many possible ways of getting the orb.  If someone wants to post a guide or something about how to finish the last part, I would be glad to update this last portion of the quest for completeness.</div>

			<div class="content">We need to consider what other dwindling races are there that 'walked Norrath before us'.    
<br />
<br />One race is Dragons - and Vohnkare in WW is their representative.
<br />One race is Faerie - and Feyana in GFay is their representative.
<br />
<br />What other sentient races are there that might qualify as 'dwindling'?
<br />
<br />Potentials include:
<br />Dryads in Jaggedpine (Look for Alaurin there, maybe?)
<br />Shissar (BIG potential for the noble there)
<br />Efreeti.  Noble Dojorn in PoSky is a possibility.
<br />Aviaks have potential.   One of chanter GMs in Freeport is an aviak.
<br />
<br />I doubt it would be orcs, gnolls, goblins, kerrans, minotaurs, or centaurs.</div>

<br />Hail, a brownie noble.
<br />
<br />a brownie noble says, 'Long time have your kind needed us, but never have we been close. Wouldn't you agree. I'm afraid i cannot help you without some token of faith'
<br />
<br />What token of faith.
<br />
<br />a brownie noble says, 'So long have we retained our distance, we have nearly been forgotten. Despite the fact that this allows us our peace, there are times i wish i could provide my people with the niceities of society. If you could obtain a few items for me i could help you with the knowledge you seek'
<br />
<br />What items
<br />
<br />a brownie noble says ' I would very much like some Gnomish Candy, Koada'Dal Silk, Feir'Dal Champagne, and Dwarven Steel'
<br />
<br />I didnt have any of these items, and she wouldn't compromise, so I killed her. Dropped nothing.</div>
