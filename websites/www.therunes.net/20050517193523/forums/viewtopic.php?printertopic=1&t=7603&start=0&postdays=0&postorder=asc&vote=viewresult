<span class="postbody">Ok, my dog and my boyfriends dog never shut up. They bark at any and everything. It pisses me off to no end and I have one of two options. The first one involves duct tape.
<br />

<br />
The second I am open to. Have any of you tried those anti-bark collars? If yes, do they work? If yes, what kind did you use?
<br />

<br />
Also, I wanted the one that vibrates or makes that high pitch sound I won't hear. I can't handle the one that shocks them or sprays stuff up their nose. I'm not that mean. However, I do not enjoy the sound of non-stop yapping.l

<span class="postbody">I had the same issue with my dog... and the choice(s) aren't very appealing. 
<br />

<br />
We tried the Citronella Spray collar first and had poor results, partially I believe because Basset Hounds have so much loose skin around their necks that it inteferred with the spray. 
<br />

<br />
We ended up using the shock collar because my dog could sit there and continuously bark for hour after hour especially when we were away from home. The collar worked well and after a couple weeks we were able to replace the shock electrodes with plastic dummies and my dog  still did not bark. 
<br />

<br />
I didn't see any collar that just emitted a high pitched sound when the dog barked.. we might have tried that instead of the shock collar but I would be concerned about other dogs hearing the noise causing them to start barking and a chain reaction going back to my dog. 
<br />

<br />
We weren't left with many other options. Our neighbors had called animal control so it was eliminate the barking or have my dogs vocal cords surgically severed... or give up the dog. My dog is very smart and will bark if we do not put on the "fake" shock collar when we put her outside. With the fake collar on she won't bark at all unless somebody is attempting to enter our property. 
<br />

<br />
Another alternative you might try is the training shock collar. You can administer a much lesser shock (more like a "gee that's annoying" rather than a "OMFG don't want that to happen again" ). The downside is you will need a couple solid weeks of consistant application, which is fine if you are at home all the time but can really send mixed messages if your away at work for 8+ hours a day.
<br />

<br />
We also talked to an animal behaviourist. He said dogs usually bark for one of several reasons:
<br />

<br />
1. They are lonely
<br />
2. They are receiving unknown stimulous external to their environment (another dog is barking in the neighborhood)
<br />
3. They are hungry/thirsty or have to go to the bathroom
<br />
4. They have very little or no external interreaction.
<br />
5. Seperation Anxiety...
<br />

<br />
We figured our dog was #1 so we got a second dog for the family in hopes of solving the problem. That didn't solve the problem and we knew that #3 wasn't the issue either because they had indoor and outdoor access to their food/water and bathroom area. Next we worked on socializing our dog in the neighborhood, meeting the neighbors and their dogs as well as interracting with other dogs a the doggy training park etc... that provided some measure of relief but not enough. Since we could not control external stimulous (other dogs/people/etc...), nor could we abandon our jobs to stay at home,  we had to go with the obedience/training collar solution. 
<br />

<br />
I was not happy about doing it at all, but in the end it worked for all parties. 
<br />

<br />
Hope that atleast helps you make your decision.

The only time we've had a major problem with our 4 dogs barking is when there is another dog walking around outside, they will carry on weather inside or outside but will calm down as soon as the other dog is out of sight
<br />
and
<br />
when the beagle gets lonely he'll howl for abpout 5 10 mins, its cute, but annoying but as soon as he finds out someone else is hoime he'll shut up and be content sleeping on his sofa.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">We got bark collars for our dogs because as a breed, they were incredibly bark-y.  Gotta love those working dogs.  The dogs were very territorial - bark at the squirrels, the birds and yes, even airplanes.  Like my dogs had hold over airspace.  sheesh.
<br />

<br />
The bark collars worked for a whole day.  The dogs barked through the pain and eventually wore the batteries out by the end of the week.  The craftier of the 2 dogs discovered that if he scratched the bark collar it would move and wouldn't hurt him anymore if he barked.
<br />

<br />
In the end, the dogs barked so much we kept them indoors because we did not want to upset the neighbors.
<br />

<br />
As for the neighbor's dog barking, try and talk to the neighbor first.  I was horrified that my dogs barking upset my neighbors.  I kept the dogs inside and let them out to do their duty, let them run around for an hour and then come back in - but for some neighbors that wasn't good enough.  They wanted constant 24 hour silence.  It can't happen.  If they wanted that, then they would have to report all dogs in the neighborhood.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

To its credit however, that one shock stopped her from barking for about a week, and for a couple weeks after that she was timid about barking. The shock collar works, I have no doubts, but I think its unfair to the dog.

<span style="font-weight: bold">PLEASE note Citronella collars ARE NO DIFFERENT than shock collar in terms of cruelty</span>. The pain of the shock collars is nothing really, its the terror that trains, not the pain. Dogs have an amazingly high tolerance for pain imho. Ive seen my dog run down a hill at top speed and smack her head into a fence post dead on. I thought she was seriously hurt, but the hit didnt even phase her. She just went right back to happily chasing my little dog after she got up and turned herself around (after I caught my breath i had to laugh). Thats why I believe its the fear of the unknown that makes them stop barking. 
<br />

<br />
Many dogs, Shepherds especially, are bred to gaurd your territory. Its in their genes, I think dog owners should thouroughly research the traits of the dog they intend to own. Its not right to get a breed that has hundreds of years of inbred traits and try and undo all of that by placing shock collar on the dog because you dont like barking.
<br />

<br />
Im lucky i suppose, my Aussie only barks when ppl come and go. When no one is home she sleeps 90% of the time. I didnt research the breed when I rescued her from the pound, but I damn well should have.
<br />

<br />
I realize that I didnt answer Raaven question as to whether or not there are humane techniques to stop incessant barking, because I honestly dont know. I just wanted to strongly suggest for ppl to avoid bark collars. They are cruel, no matter how effective they are.
<br />

<br />
PS- Amris the spray bottle may work on some types of dogs but not all of them (or many I suspect). I tried that on my dogs and all they do is squint and  lick their chops to remove the excess water while continuing to bark. Intense spraying made them think it was some sort of game and they play-attacked the bottle and me.
<br />

<br />
The spray bottle worked great on my wifes cat. But this is a dog thread, and what dog lover would want to read about those feeble minded wastes of space?</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Vizier on Mon Mar 07, 2005 9:02 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>
