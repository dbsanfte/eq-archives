<span class="postbody">This was originally a response to the Bard thread in the General/OT forum, but eh, it's more of a rant.
<br />

<br />
Bards can do almost everything far better than we can. Their haste spell in a single group scenario is simply better (since it increases nuke damage as well as taking you past the haste cap), their mana regen is at least comparable, and they've got equal mezzing abilities unless you're pulling 3 or more mobs. On top of that, if the shit hits the fan, they've got plate armor (okay, we've got Arcane/Eldritch to mitigate this difference somewhat), a deftdance discipline (er....guess we don't get the equivalent of that...maybe Doppelganger?), Fading Memories (um...mem blurs are sort of like a shitty version of this...), and Divine Aura (I ran dry on enchanter defensive abilities).
<br />

<br />
The "but they can only sing four songs at once" is not really a disadvantage in the single group situation, since you usually have one or two other support classes capable of picking up the bard's slack. If you have a shaman, the bard doesn't have to slow, and he can rotate out the haste song without losing too much when he needs to mez; if you've got a ranger, he doesn't have to snare; add a monk and he doesn't have to pull; toss in an enchanter and he won't ever have to mez and his mana song won't be missed as much, etc. Notice that none of the classes you added to the group actually REPLACED the bard, or DUPLICATED his abilities in any way, but simply made him switch to doing something else (something else that's equally good).
<br />

<br />
In fact, when you think about the sheer volume of a bard's ability, it's sort of sick:
<br />

<br />
Need a snarer? get a bard.
<br />
Need more DPS? get a bard.
<br />
Need a puller? get a bard.
<br />
Need some crowd control? get a bard.
<br />
Need less downtime? get a bard.
<br />
Need a slower? get a bard.
<br />
Need help travelling? get a bard.
<br />
Need some resist buffs? get a bard.
<br />
Need resist debuffs? get a bard.
<br />

<br />
The only thing they can't do atm is tank, heal, and charm. And, hey, I can't tank and heal either. Or snare. Or pull (as well as they can). Or travel (as well as they can). And so on...Seems like an awful lot to trade for charm spells I can't even use in most of the new expansion.
<br />

<br />
I love my enchanter a lot. But the number of group roles bards can fill and their raid stackability is, frankly, FAR more than any other class in the game. It'd be fine if they were a lot worse than me at crowd control, but they're not. The fact of the matter is, on that 4 pull you use AE bliss to lock down, a bard could have pulled 3, or 2, or 1, using lull, fading, highsun, snare, or any of their host of pulling tools. Or he could have pulled 4, gotten enough agro to kite 3 using one of their nice AE songs with high agro, let the puller tank one, and supplied the group with better haste than you add, nuke damage, and mana regen while he kited.
<br />

<br />
I don't hate bards. Spare me the "well if their so gud u play 1 than". I'm not a power hungry tool looking for the 'm0st ub4r' class - I enjoy my enchanter and the challenge he presents. I just think the bard class is a mockery of balance. Charmed uber-pookas are NOTHING compared to the single pulls I have seen my bard friends make in KT (which zone did you want this mob at?), or the fact that they're the best pullers for our raids as well, and even if their ability to pull were in some way nerfed, they'd still have no shortage of things to do.
<br />

<br />
I think the only reason they've gotten away with it so far is there are so few of them that they are generally shunted around rather then directly replacing anyone. Got a monk who can pull decently? Great! The bard could do it better, but, eh, our dps is kind of lacking today and it'd be awesome to have him in our rogue group. What's that? Plenty of Enchanters to mez? Awesome, we'll put the bards on resist songs then, a bunch of our new members are undergeared. We don't need that bard increasing our nuking DPS in the wizard group? Sweet, shift him over to the cleric group where he can make their mana regen better, we're short on healing tonight.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">You can use your same argument for Druids over chanters. Only advantage the cleric has is rez. Druids can buff, they can heal, they can DS, they can increase run seppd, and they can TP people. Why for god's sake would anyone want a Cleric in their group?
<br />

<br />
I can buff my group with haste, MR, charisma, and mana regen plus one very nice combat buff with NDT. THen I can go off and do ANYTHING the group requires. If there is a shaman or beastlord, i can let them slow and go get a HIGH DPS pet. If not, I can STILL get  a high DPS pet and slow as well. I can provide Crowd Control AND I can be puller. And I can do it ALL without spamming the group with song spam.

Erm. I hate to make you feel worse or something, but bards can charm too. and snare. and "cast" on the run. Hot dang, I'm gonna make me a bard !
<br />

<br />
On the other hand.. We mez better. We haste better. Their charm costs mana too. Believe you me, the persistent nature of our abilities ( okay, except maybe for charm, which isn't persistant at all sometimes) makes thing a hell of a lot easier and allows us to shift focus to other things too.

<span class="postbody">The difference between cleric healing ability and druid healing ability is friggin' huge. Supernal Remedy owns any fast heal druids have. Complete Heal owns every heal the druid has. And clerics can buff HP much better own their own than druids can. PLUS, they've gotten lots of utility added in ways that doesn't overlap with druids. Rez, as you mentioned, plus decent melee (their Time+ procs are really nice), plus the Blessing of Reverence buff line on top of that. Plus, they can take a beating a hell of a lot better than druids. Plus, they have Divine Arbitration, Divine Intervention, the group heal over time, Innate Death Pact...Jeebus Christ, I can go on and on. Clerics have a LOT going for them.

I don't count bard charm. It's one of their abilities that is actually correctly balanced - maybe a little too weak, even. It costs mana, it doesn't last long, and it's got a weak, weak level cap. I already mentioned the snare. Didn't bring casting on the run into the equation - I guess you can add that to their list of defensive abilities they have that we don't. Oh, yeah, and I thought I made it pretty clear that I don't want to make me a bard. As I said, I like my enchanter.
<br />

<br />
We don't haste better. The bard haste is just as fast (it caps anyone with a good haste item), they can stack an overhaste on top of it, AND it adds a damage shield (one of those druid advantages Arcady was touting that bards have stolen and can do better).
<br />

<br />
We don't mez better, either. If I get a resist, the cleric expends a LOT of mana keeping me alive through something beating the shit out of me in KT, and I spend some mana to refresh my Arcane Rune. If a bard gets a resist, he takes either zero damage (because the mez wasn't enough to get agro), or his damage is significantly mitigated due to the fact that he's in a tin can. We USED to mez better, no doubt about that. I could do things in Seb with AE mez and color shift/slant/skew that Bards would drool over. But the further you get in the endgame, the more and more there are single pulls, and the worse and worse enchanters look as mezzers relative to bards.
<br />

<br />
All the buffs you can provide, a bard can do better. You can do NDT? That's cute, but the bard can DS, haste, overhaste, outmanaregen, increase nuking, and do several other things to boot. You think you can pull? The bards in our guild pull nameds in KodTaz to anywhere in the zone, from anywhere in the zone. They pull Ikkinz trials better than any monk or SK - classes that are DESIGNED for pulling. The only time they stop is when they're very unlucky with Fading Memories and eat a death, and for some reason none of our clerics have Divine Rez up.
<br />

<br />
Sure, in an LDoN normal or hard, I can pull. I can even do it pretty well. But a bard can do it better, faster, and with less deaths.
<br />

<br />
I like the high DPS pet, duh. But that's not applicable everywhere, and the more I play the less I go to places where I can charm. Last I checked, bards don't lose any of their core abilities in endgame zones...ah, wait, that's because they don't have any core abilities, just stuff they've pirated from others. =P
<br />

<br />
And there's something to be said for persistent spells. But not as much as there is to be said for having nearly every ability that classes are balanced around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Besides, have you ever played a bard past 40??   4 song twists is hellish to keep up for more than an hour or two.

3 song twists is alright, but still it wears on you after a while, if you get sleepy you miss twists, dropping your overall efficiency.

Its like comparing apples and oranges really.  Bards may be the closest class to us but they arent anything like us.  They pay a huge price for what they do, just like we pay a huge price to do what we do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">A well played bard with good gear and blah blah blah will usually twist 5, not four.  More, depending on which songs they're using (some are longer duration).

That being said, bards can't:
<br />

<br />
Charm anything of higher level.
<br />
Haste, MR, and manabuff more than their group at a single time.
<br />
Go LD with said effects still working.
<br />

<br />
Though by comparison, enchanters can't:
<br />

<br />
Buff mana/hp regen together. (Nevermind the stacking.)
<br />
Tank like a plate class... bards can tank not *well* per se, but beat us easily.
<br />
Melee for reasonable dps on highly resistant mobs.
<br />
Mez forever in the area of an AE mana drain/tap effect.  (Think Shei in AR.)
<br />
Run while casting.  This IMO is what gives bards the advanatage in so many things that they do; none of their songs are terribly powerful, but infinite channelling skill makes them amazingly useful.
<br />
Heal faster than base regen without worn effects/potions.  I'd lose an awful lot of abilities for this....
<br />
Do any non-magical damage (ice, fire, etc) directly.  
<br />

<br />

Different hammers for different nails, really.  A really well played bard is unbelievably overpowered, but they're so rare that it doesn't come into play often... and there's still things that they just cannot do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Bingo on that one.  My newbie rogue has run into a lot of bards approaching their 20s who haven't yet learned to twist even two songs.  They just turn a song on, leave it on, and change when they want a different effect.  At level 20 one doesn't expect mastery of a class, but combining a couple of songs shouldn't be too far out there.  I think I even figured it out on my own with my bard early on (like the "oh wow, I can sing while running!" bit), then later read up on it for better twisting techniques.

<span class="postbody">I'm not disputing that bards are the most physically demanding class to play, and that by playing a bard you put yourself at risk of carpal tunnel.
<br />

<br />
I'm not disputing that they require a great deal of attentiveness and concentration.
<br />

<br />
I'm not disputing that there are very few bards out there, and even fewer bards with those sort of qualities as players.
<br />

<br />
The thing is, those are shitty ways of balancing a class. If you took a very attentive player and put an enchanter in his hands and a bard in his hands, they should be approximately equal in the level of power they wield (obviously not in the *type* of power they wield, though). But they're not even close.
<br />

<br />
I've already conceded that the simultaneous effect limit and the duration limit (ie, that bards can't do more than a certain number of things at one time, and what they're doing doesn't last all that long). However, I don't think it's as big a deal as people like Thandor make it out to be.
<br />

<br />
On raids, for instance, bard design HELPS their class be more desireable. Five bards on a raid stack a lot better than five enchanters on a raid, because of the sheer variety of their songs and the fact that most of them are group-only. Five enchanters have two buff spells and one debuff to split between them, and then they get to nuke. I can't recall a time when we've turned down bards. If we had 12 bards on a raid, each one would be improving efficiency amazingly; group mana regen, haste, the superior single-group resist buffs, and so on. If we had 12 enchanters...Well, that's a lot of overkill even for the enchanter-intensive events like TRC.
<br />

<br />
Also, the bard 4 song limit isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be. True, the bard can't hold 3 adds mezzed and buff the group too much, but frankly 3 add pulls are a freak occurrence with a bard in the group, who should be pulling anyway. If he DID pull 3, he could mez them all, and the group would live...it would just deal with these 3 mobs more slowly than if an enchanter was in the group. The fact that they're killing every other mob in the zone faster due to the overhaste + DS + better mana regen + bard melee DPS (and no, I'm not saying it's spectacular...but neither is enchanter nuke DPS) will more than make up for that. The only thing that makes enchanters pull ahead is a charm pet...which doesn't work in a lot of areas.
<br />

<br />
Once again, I don't want to play a bard. I do like to see games with balanced playing environments, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I like bards in my groups. They pull singles pretty fast, bring them in pre-slowed, pre-mez adds etc. Their abilities stack nicely with ours and I don't see the competition (not like sk/pal/war for tanks f.ex. .. you want 1 tank from the 3 classes and the others get left out, but never seen a group that has a bard refuse to invite a chanter). 
<br />
If there's a chanter in the group for Haste and Manaregen, good bards usually switch to other songs (dots or DS or damage absorb .. they have quite a good selection, that's true).
