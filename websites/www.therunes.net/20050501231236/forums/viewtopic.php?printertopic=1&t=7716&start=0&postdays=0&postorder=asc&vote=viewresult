<span class="postbody">I'm sure that most of the enchanter that have been playing for a long time already know of this trick, but I  recently learned of it, and wanted to share it with the noob enchanters.
<br />

<br />
This was taught to me by Fading Illusion of Tunare server.
<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
When charming a mob before you have Dire Charm, charm breaks can make for a really bad day.  There are ways to defuse charm breaks and make life easier on you.
<br />

<br />
Remember those "Color" spells you got and have never used?...well now you're going to use them.
<br />

<br />
Here's what you do.
<br />

<br />
Load up in the spells slots, the three lowest color stuns, lowest to highest going down the spell gems.  Just three will be fine.
<br />

<br />
And yes, even if you're 65, the level 4 stun will work just fine.
<br />

<br />
For me, its Color Flux, Stun, and Skew I believe.  Now that you have them loaded, move the spell slots into the hotkey bank by holding the mouse pointer down until the appear on your pointer, then place them in hotkey 1, 2, and 3, of the empty hotkey bank (i use bank 3).
<br />

<br />
Now, mem your highest charm, and place that spell in the 4th slot of the same bank where you placed your stuns.
<br />

<br />
Your hotkey bank should look like this:
<br />
------ ------
<br />
STUN|STUN
<br />
------|------
<br />
STUN|CHARM
<br />

<br />

<br />
That should be 1, 2, 3, and 4
<br />

<br />
now when charm breaks, when the pet comes up to you, start hitting the stuns in order, 1, 2, 3.  After the third stun, you should have enough time to recharm the your former pet.
<br />

<br />
Another tip is that after you send your pet after something, press F1 twice to retarget your pet.  Durring charm breaks, it can somtimes be very difficult to target your pet again to recharm, the solution is to just keep him targetted.
<br />

<br />
After all three stuns hit your pet (and anything around him) they all will be still for about 3-4 seconds, giving you enough time to recharm.
<br />

<br />
Back up, sick the pet back on one of the mobs, and there you go.  Quick clean and simple.
<br />

<br />
Also if possible, Rune yourself everytime it breaks.  Rune will save your life here.
<br />

<br />
The stuns will also work to stun anything your pet is killing to make him kill faster.  If you are really brave, you can hand him a Proccing mage weapon and throw him a haste.
<br />

<br />
Good luck out there</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Depending on the charm and how much spell haste you have, there's no reason to both cycling through all three. The level 20 Color Shift will serve you quite adequately for recharming if you are using Cajoling Whispers or Boltran's Agacerie, and casts in 1.5 seconds.
<br />

<br />
Color Slant is also a good, solid stun in this regard, though a little more mana hungry than the virtually free Color Shift.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">i really cant beleive how underappreciated the color line is pre-55.
<br />

<br />
1st off, there's no reason to use 3 stuns to recharm a pet, you should either use the lvl 44 stun, or possibly the lvl 4 then 44 for a quicker inital cast.  Once the mob is stunned, take a step back, turn as you stop, and recharm.
<br />
But that's just the tip of the iceberg of what these spells can do.
<br />

<br />
Most of course know of the chain stun, (any combo of 3 of the lvl 4, 20, 44, and 52 will work, the 52's a bit more mana intensive, and the 4's a tad shakier in the rotation.  I personally like 20-44-52 with 4 as a backup for interrupts as a fast cast).  A little variation off this is the partial chain stun, most effective with knights, generally i used 20-44 stuns, it keeps the mob stunned for a larger portion of the time acting like another stacking slow for groups a bit light on healing, and of course, 20-44 are fairly low mana and have decent durations.
<br />

<br />
Everyone knows stuns have agro, what people forget is that if a mob is stunned, agro doesnt matter for a moment.  If i get agro or the cler gets agro, lvl 55 and under, most of the time unless the tank cant keep up with my stun agro, i find the best solution is to stun the mob to buy tank time to get control of it.  The also keeps the mob in 1 spot which is also needed in particular for wars to get agro easily.
<br />

<br />
Speaking of the benefit of keeping it in one spot, stuns can fill in as a makeshift snare, when a mob is running, jump infront of it and hit it with your stuns.  At 20% and less mobs generally dont last that long, so u dont need the mob motionless much longer than stun buys you.
<br />

<br />
And finally for what's prolly the most important and originally indended use of stuns, a stun in most situations will buy a few sec of calm to pre-target your mezes in a multi-pull(dont forget to target 2 mobs, once the 1st is locked down, toggle last target to your 2nd) and of course actually get off @ least 1 mez, and if you stun, run/turnstop*, mez, run/turnstop, mez, you can get 2 depending on terrain, mob reach, lag etc.  These are also, like targeted AE mezes very useful when so much dps comes into camp the tank wont last while you cast more than 1-2 spells to get all the damage off untill you start to solidify the situation. 
<br />

<br />
In gigantic pulls, i find the best technique is approx the following pattern, adjusted a bit for the size of the pull and the area.  Targeted AE mez on inc, stun agro that comes to you, run/turnstop, targeted AE stunned mobs,  etcetc untill only 1 mob is moving, Single mez 1 group of the mobs, and use targeted AE to hold groups untill the previous group of mobs has been killed, as with max mobs hit by targeted AEs, they actually become mana efficient(tho mana efficiency is not at all what they're about, another common misconception, its just a fringe benefit when youre holding a full targeted AE)
<br />

<br />
color stuns pre-55 are the glue that holds together all of the rest of the peices of our croud control.  If you havent figured out how to use them like that, i think you're missing a -lot- of what enc can do. And the same theories as used in the lower level stuff applies once you get your lvl 69 spells, tho due to how hard stuff hits, you have to slightly modify how to manage it(run/turnstops become -very- necissary, WoM on lvl 65 and unders can double the size of the train u can take with MM, im sure there are other high lvl pointers im forgetting)
<br />

<br />
*run/turnstop is running away from the mob while your spellgems are greyed.  once they've ungreyed, turn as you stop to halt your movenment instantly to be able to cast without interruption, and cast asap.  This buys you back the 2 sec while your spellgems are refreshing as the mob has to run 2 sec more to hit you again.  This trick is one of the harder one to get right consistantly, practice, practice, practice at it tho, it's crucial to doing broken things with an enc.  In fact, i might suggest doing it between every spell, wheather u need to or not, for a while to get the hang of how it feels and when you can start casting.  (ps, ive also found turning continuously for a sec while channeling the 1st round of hits can also help keep you from moving far enuf to interrupt your spell)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I remember levelling an enc the regular way (omg, anyone remember grouping to lvl 50+? The concept...!) back when not everything got PL'd to 60 and keeping my group busy while the cleric ran to PoK because omg he might go oom without kei! (Clarity wasn't good enough for him)
<br />
At first the tanks sat down and waited. 
<br />
So I was baiting them, taunting them, ridiculing them until they went and pulled despite the only healer being 3 zones away.

Well imagine their surprise when they never got hit, I never had to med, and by the time the cleric returned two of us had dinged.

Sadly, this would have the effect of making the good, old fashioned Stun->Mez trick on which a large part of CC used to hinge, well...impossible.
<br />

<br />
A mob must be stunned for AT LEAST 4.75 seconds (2.25 recast + 2.5 mez) and preferably 5 or more in order to have a chance of mezzing after a stun.  Using stuns to mitigate DPS is secondary in my book.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

No, those are aoe spells with a small radius around us and not single target stuns with a larger cast distance to them. I use color cloud a lot, but its not a replacement for the previous stun line we had before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Uh. We get exactly -one- Single Target stun anywhere in our lineup. Largarn's Lamentation at level 55.  I'd hardly call that our "stun line".  (And if you want to bring up Whirl 'Til you Hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught you can, but those are spinstuns, and work totally differently.)
<br />

<br />
As far as I know, the stun line everyone has been talking about in this thread is the Color <Blah> line, that we first get at level 4, and continues all the way up to 69.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Our spin-stun spells aren't usuable in pretty much any of the traditional uses for stun though, since they have a pretty good chance of breaking everytime the mob takes damage.  That said, there's some debate about whether our spin-stuns are level capped at all.  Some people here swear up and down that they're not, but I've been too lazy to test. =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I stopped using them in the mid 50s, when they seemed to not have any more effect on teh mobs. Until then, I could use the spin-stuns in the same way we use WoM or Color Cloud to give us a few seconds to back away from the mob and recast mez. It worked well for a while, the biggest advantages being that its wasn't AoE (so no worry about agroing something on the floor above), and it worked from a longer distance.
<br />

<br />
Since they broke as soon as they were hit, its really more of a spin-mez than a spin stun. Sort of a combination.

Still, it would be an interesting idea to get back in to the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I to miss stuns. I resent that they were nerfed to stop AOE groups effectively, hence WOM which has an AA to make it of real use.
<br />

<br />
I've done AOE once or twice and could give a shit if it was the flavour of the month. I prefer traditional chanting. The joy in droga (and the others), pre upgrade, of stunlocking 8+ and saving the groups arse is what made me keep coming back.
<br />

<br />
I don't like charm, other than DC, other than for special events, ie Tipt , but I yearn to return to the days pre POP where ability at CC was the defining reason why chanters were invited to group. 
<br />

<br />
This post has reminded me again what I desire of class balancing but what we really need is SOE to listen to the class and then cater for the three basic chanter subsets, like they are for druids;
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Charm major</span>. Basically the chanter equivalent of the battle cleric. DPS +
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">CC major, </span>the old school lock em down school
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nuke / buff bot major</span> Basically what we are at the moment
<br />

<br />
How would it get done. Many thoughts but the major requirement is for SOE to engage with the chanter community and not look at the dissenters as evidence there is no consensus but realise that the chanter class is not homogenous. Of course not listening to the chattering classes biatching and moaning would assist.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
