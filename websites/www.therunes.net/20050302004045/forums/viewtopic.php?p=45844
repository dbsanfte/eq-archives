When Gandalf learns of the threat to the city of Minas Tirith, he rides for Gondor and the white city. Jump ahead a bit in the movie… it’s nighttime Gandalf is smoking a pipe, pippin looking at his newly acquired armor and they have a conversation.
<br />

<br />
Pippin: We've got the white wizard. That's got to count for something.
<br />

<br />
Gandalf speaks of the Witch King with a tone of terror in his voice. As if he were scared or knew he would have to battle him. He says he is Sauron's Deadliest Servant the one they say no LIVING man can kill.
<br />

<br />
This is where my problem begins; from this point forward tension builds to what I think should have been a great battle between gandalf and the Witch King.
<br />

<br />
Evidence below.
<br />

<br />
Witch King: Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all. 
<br />
Gothmog: What of the wizard? 
<br />
Witch King: I will break him.
<br />

<br />
Sounds like building pressure to me…
<br />

<br />
Witch King: You fool. No man can kill me. Die now.  ( he doesn’t say living like gandalf just “ No man “ but remember I’m a gandalf fan  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" />  he he he )
<br />
Eowyn: I am no man.
<br />

<br />
My problem is NOT that a woman killed the Witch King. I would feel the same if any other character had done the deed. Man, Woman, hobbit or dwarf it would not matter.
<br />

<br />
What happened to Gandalf in the Two Towers? He transitioned from Gandalf the Grey to Gandalf the white. What caused this transition? DEATH
<br />

<br />
Gandalf: Gandalf? Yes... that was what they used to call me. Gandalf the Gray. That was my name. 
<br />
Gimli: Gandalf... 
<br />
Gandalf: *I* am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now - at the turn of the tide.
<br />

<br />
A Gandalf fan could argue ( and I will  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" />  ) that he had died so there for he was not technically “ Living “ or at least that he had died, so he could kill the Witch King.
<br />

<br />
I just think it would have flowed better with the story and why build the pressure between Gandalf and The Witch King if there was to be no fight ? I understand the Witch King kills her father and all, but two of the movie's most powerful characters going head to head would have been awesome… maybe it will be on the extended version…

                                <td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Interesting point, and I think Tolkien would agree with you in terms of Gandalf dying. Tolkien was a very devoted Roman Catholic and his faith deeply influenced his writings as well as those of his close friend, C.S. Lewis. Also Tolkien said he didn't intend the Lord of the Rings to be allagorical to the Revelations story, he certainly drew heavily on the tapistry of the story. 
<br />

<br />
Gandalf in this light comes to focus as the Christ figure in the story, going to death the Grey, wearing a sullied cloth, only to rise White. I think it's a strong agrument, and I'll leave it to you to figure out how angels, Mary, and other compelling features of Roman Catholic beliefs are woven into the story. I think of course his clear stance that it wasn't to be taken as literal, leave the idea for anyone slaying Witch King (his counterpart is in the book of Revelation) really open, as I'm sure Revelation isn't scripted with a woman kill him in the end. 
<br />

<br />
That being said, I see why you are hesitent to accept that part of the tale, I found it equally - off. Wizard battles are really pretty awsome, so I'm up for more of that naturally as well, sort of the icing.</span><span class="postbody"><br />_________________<br />1010011010 - Binary of the Beast!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

                                <td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Well, the reason your summations hold no water is : Gandalf was not a man.  He did not have to die to not be a man.  He NEVER was a man.  At this particular time in the history of middle earth, he had been around as "Gandalf" for thousands of years.  
<br />

<br />
If you had read the books, along with Tolkien's other writings, you would know that Gandalf was a Maeri (sp?), of the same ilk as Morgoth, who was Sauron's master and the bane of middle-earth in the First Age I believe it was.  I could be wrong on this, I have not read the Silmarillion in 20 years, but I think I got my facts straight.
<br />

<br />
I can see how seeing the movies without reading the books would have led you to your conclusions though.  I think the biggest problem with this series of movies was that Peter Jackson made it particularly for the people that had been fans of the book.  I think he assumes the viewers of the movie already know the story.  Maybe this was done on a subconsious level.  Maybe since he and his fellow screenplay writers knew the story, it was easy for them to not worry about things like this, since they already knew what the prophecy of the witch-king meant.  
<br />

<br />
It might have been a good idea for them to let someone who had never read the books read the script to see if it made sense to them.  I don't know if this was done or not, but that is what I would have done.
<br />

<br />
Who can argue with his ways though, the freakin series made like 2.5 billion dollars!!!
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I had always had the impression that the prophecy of "no man" killing the witch-kinig meant no MALE, not human.  After all, Eowyn is a human, she just happens to be female.  Arwen is a woman, she just happens to be an Elf woman.  See what I mean? 
<br />

<br />
My problem with the whole witch-king death was how easily she killed the beast he was riding.  She hacked through his 3 foot wide neck in like 2 strokes.  That was a bit too quick for my tastes.  
<br />

<br />
My favorite of the movies is still the first one.</span><span class="postbody"><br />_________________<br />Dalavon &lt;Dead of Winter&gt;

In The Two Towers Gandalf does speak about his existence.
<br />

<br />
Gandalf: Three hundred lives of men I have walked this earth and now I have no time. 
<br />

<br />
So was it the witch king who did not know his own prophecy? Was it Gandalf who was in the wrong? Or maybe a simple script error, I'm not sure...

Witch King: No man can kill me.

<br />
Gandalf: the one they say no <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">LIVING</span></span> man can kill.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps I am looking into it too much as "Living man" could mean no different than "Man", because to be a man you must be living right ?

Building the tension for a showdown between Gandolf and the witch king was correct based on the books.  In the book, Gandolf goes to the gates of Minas Tirith and prepares to face the Witch King as they break through.  The witch king enters and Gandolf faces him.  However, before they can battle the Riders of Rohan attack and Pippin comes to Gandolf to tell him of the madness of the Steward of Gondor.  The witch king leaves to take care of the Riders and Gandolf tells the soldiers at the gate to fall back to the next one and he goes with Pippin to save the life of Faramir.  IMO Peter Jackson just didnt get the editing sequence right to show why Gandolf didn't fight the witch king.  Eowyn faces the witch king exactly in the movie as she does in the book with aid of Merridoc.
<br />

<br />
    BTW Gandolf at several points is shown as having equal strength to the wraiths.  As a holder of one of the three hidden rings of the elves he is powerful but always constrained by the need to preserve the powers he has against discovery.</span><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

The movies didn't have time to go into the detail that books did, nor did they touch on much from the other books and tales that Tolkien wrote.  Even reading the trilogy isn't enough to get the full story, as other sources, mainly The Silmarillion, provide more details.  So, for someone who has only seen the movies, the full story will never really be understood, only guesses based upon the information provided.  
<br />

<br />
This is fine.  As a trilogy of movies, the LoTR series stands on its own.  It was made to be a faithful adaptation, so that the legions of Tolkien fans would still appreciate it, but it was altered to be a movie that the uninitiated could enjoy, as well.  In doing so, things were left out or never fully explained, and if you really want to know, you will need to read the source material for yourself.  Even today, decades later, some of it is still debated over what certain things truly mean.  I'll put down some info here, to at least give you what I know of some of the things you refer to.
<br />

<br />
Here's a very bried rundown of Middle-Earth's (hereafter just ME) history.
<br />

<br />
There is God, also called Eru or Iluvatar who dwelt in the Timeless Halls.  He created the Ainur, or Holy Ones of which there were two divisions, the Valar and the Maiar.  The Valar are like lesser gods, and the Maiar are their servants.  The Ainur sang before Eru and received a vision of the world, Arda.  He was pleased and sent those that would go into the world to create in real what had been just vision and song.  Thus, the world was made.
<br />

<br />
During that song, Melkor, greatest of the Valar, felt that he could wave his own imaginings into the song, thus creating things of himself and not in accord with Iluvatar.  Note, however, that each time he sang in discord, Iluvatar revealed a new part of the song that made the harmony whole again.  After doing this a couple of times, he ended the song and said something like, "Know that there is nothing that does not have its source in me, nor can alter the music of his own despite, but in doing so prove but mine instrument in the devising of things even more wonderful than he imagined."  So, despite Melkor's attempts, all things are of Iluvatar and will, in the end, serve him.
<br />

<br />
Okay, so some of the Ainur, including Melkor, went into Arda and created the world that they had sung about.  The Valar, and the Maiar with them, dwelt in the West of Arda in a place called Valinor.  Melkor proved to be their enemy and eventually chose ME as his stomping grounds from which to wreak havoc on the world. The Valar made two lamps (great big huge towers with light to light the world) and Melkor knocked 'em down.  The light was then captured in two trees in Valinor.  Eventually, he along with Shelob's mom, destroyed the trees, too, and the remaining light was turned into the Sun and the Moon.  At some point during this, the first children of Iluvatar arose in the world, the Elves.  Unfortunately, the awoke in ME and Melkor decided to hate them.  So, the Valar eventually made contact with the elves and invited them to come live in Valinor.  Some did, some didn't, and some tried to make the trip, but stopped along the way and thus, you have the different branches of the Elves.    
<br />

<br />
A whole lot of stuff happened and to try to go into detail would take a long time.  Just know that there's a buch of history here that I'm glossing over.  An elf, Feanor, living in Valinor, made the Silmarils, which contained some of the light of the glorious Trees before they were destroyed.  A lot of bad stuff happened because of this, and Feanor's arrogance, and Melkor's influence, and eventually some of the High Elves (those that lived in Valinor) went back into ME.  There, a whole lot more stuff happened, including the appearance of Man, eventually leading to Melkor's downfall, from whence he was thrust into the Timeless void and his only influence upon ME after that was in the darkness he had implanted in the minds and hearts of Elves and Man, or in the activities of this servants that remained.
<br />

<br />
Morgoth had many of the Maiar that followed him when he "rebelled" and became an evil jerk.  Of them were Sauron, the Balrogs, the Dragons, and a whole host of other nasties.  Whatever their original form or purpose, they became nasty evil things in his service.  After his death, Sauron pleaded forgiveness of the Valar and then, of course, became a bad guy in his own right.  
<br />

<br />
Eventually, the greatest of Men came to dwell on the island of Numenor.  The Numenoreans were blessed with long life and dwelt within sight of the West, but weren't allowed to go there.  You see, Man's gift from Eru, is death.  Now, it's not so bad a thing as you might think.  The Elves are tied to the world, even when they die, their spirits go to Valinor and dwell in some sort of spirit place.  Only Man is given the gift of true death and, thus, leaves Arda for places even the Valar haven't been told of.  Melkor had used this uncertainty, though, to place a fear of death in Man's heart.  Sauron battled with the Numenoreans, but sensing their army would defeat his and he'd have to start building all over again, he instead surrendered and was taken prisoner to Numenor.  Where he, of course, whispered and connived and playing upon Man's fear of death, eventually caused the Numenoreans to seek to sail to Valinor and take it by force if necessary so they could be immortal, too.  Iluvatar acted and sunk Numenor into the ocean, and then removed Valinor from the world, making the world round so that any who sailed to the west would only find they'd circled the world and ended up back where they started.  Only the Elves were allowed to sail the "Straight Path" and go into the west ... well, and some chosen few that went with them.
<br />

<br />
Alright, so during his time in ME, Sauron created rings of power.  He was gonna use them to corrupt and control everything, because he'd secretly made the one ring to control them all.  The elves sensed this and thus were not taken in by it, their rings remained mostly pure.  The dwarves were not easily corruptible and it only really made them kind of greedy and distrustful.  Man, on the other hand, was all sorts of easy to corrupt and thus the nine kings with the nine rings became the Nazgul (or Ulairi, aka the Ring-wraiths.)  Then the great battle happened, when Elves and Men worked together and they managed to defeat Sauron and you know what followed from the movies.  Then, time passed.
<br />

<br />
However, as you know, Sauron was not destroyed, so eventually he came back.  First as just a shadow of his former power, hinted at in the Hobbit.  He was the Necromancer who lived in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood.  Then, the nine went to Mordor and prepared his place there and he went back to his kingdom, restored as much of his power as he could, and then started looking to get the ring.
<br />

<br />
As the first hint of Sauron appeared during this time, the Istari came into Middle-Earth from the west.  Gandalf is one of the Istari, or wizards.  Wizards in Middle-Earth were not just a class like in DnD or EQ.  ME is filled with people, places and things that have multiple names, due to the different races and languages.  Wizard is simply the name Men used to refer to the Istari.  There were five, but only three were named.  The elves called them Mithrandir, Curunir and Radagast.  Men called them Gandalf, Saruman, and ... uh, well Radagast, cause he didn't play much of a role.  Anyway, here's a quote from the appendix.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">When maybe a thousand years had passed, and the first shadow had fallen on Greenwood the Great, the Istari or Wizards appeared in Middle-earth. It was afterwards said that they came out of the far West and were messengers sent to contest the power of Sauron, and to unite all those who had the will to resist him; but they were forbidden to match his power with power, or to seek to dominate Elves or Men by force and fear. 
<br />
They came therefore in the shape of Men, though they were never young and aged only slowly, and they had many powers of mind and hand. They revealed their true names to few,' but used such names as were given to them. The two highest of this order (of whom it is said there were five) were called by the Eldar Curunír, 'the Man of Skill', and Mithrandir, 'the Grey Pilgrim', but by Men in the North Saruman and Gandalf. Curunír journeyed often into the East, but dwelt at last in Isengard. Mithrandir was closest in friendship with the Eldar, and wandered mostly in the West and never made for himself any lasting abode.

<br />
Only Cirdan, who kept the Havens where Elves sailed to the West, knew what they actually were.  He only told Galadriel and Elrond.  Gandalf also at one point says, when discussing his names, "Olorin I was in my youth that was forgotten."  In the Silmarillion, when the Maiar are being spoken of, it is stated, "Wisest of the Maiar was Olorin.  He too dwelt in Lorien, but his ways took him often to the house of Nienna, and of her he learned pity and paitence."  Thus, Gandalf (and the rest of the Istari) are revealed to be of the Maiar, but have taken on mortal form in ME.
<br />

<br />
Saruman was the most skilled of the Istari, but he, in studying the rings of power, eventually was seduced by Sauron and you know the results of that, for the most part.  Gandalf stayed true and did what he was meant to do, which was simply help, with wisdom and advice, lead others to stand against Sauron.  He only really entered battle himself when no other options were available, and that is why he fought the Balrog.  Otherwise, it would have killed the entire Fellowship.
<br />

<br />
Now, the Istari were given (or took) mortal bodies while in ME, so in the battle with the Balrog, Gandalf was killed also.  However, Iluvatar sent him back to continue with his task until it was done.  So, when he was sent back, he was more powerful.  The title of "the White" was originally Saruman's as he was the most powerful of the Istari, but Gandalf took that title as he came back the most powerful and Saruman had already fallen to Sauron.
<br />

<br />
The Balrog, or Valaraukar, were spirits of fire of the Maiar, fallen into Melkor's service.  Gandalf was rightfully afraid to face the Balrog, for while he was given a mortal body, the Balrog was in it's true form.  (Well, all the Ainur that came to Arda took on bodies of some sort, so even those aren't their "true" form, but that's being nitpicky.)  However, Gandalf did win, even in dying, and thus defeated one of the last ancient scourges of Melkor.  Then, Eru sent him back to help deal with Sauron.
<br />

<br />
One should note here, that while there are power levels amonst the Ainur, the Valar and Maiar, and that Elves seem to be more powerful than Man, in the tales these differences aren't always so great that lesser beings can't rise against the greater ones.  In the Silmarillion, both elf and man contest with Melkor and his servants directly and some even win.  So, the idea of Gandalf even in mortal form, besting the Balrog is not a stretch.  So, it should also be known that a mortal (a Black Numenorean lord, so greater than a regular man), turned ring-wraith, and especially the greatest of the Nazgul bearing a ring of power and linked directly to Sauron (the most powerful of the Maiar), would have the power to battle with Gandalf, even as Gandalf the White.  The outcome was never certain, and when Gandalf learned of Denethor's insanity which would lead to Faramir's doom, he had to choose.  In the end, I think it was his nature as an advisor that led him to choose to save the life of Faramir rather than contest the might of the Witch-king.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, here's some info on the Witch-King from the Wikipedia website:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">The Witch-king was originally a Black Númenórean lord. In the Second Age, he was given one of nine Rings of Power to help rule over his realm. He and eight others were ensnared by Sauron, who made them the Nazgûl. He became the lord of the Wraiths, and Sauron's chief servant. He later founded the realm of Angmar, destroyed the kingdoms of Arnor, and then besieged and took Minas Ithil, renaming it Minas Morgul, and became its lord. Eärnur, King of Gondor, who had previously routed the Witch-king from Arnor at the Battle of Fornost but was unable to slay him (at which point the Noldorin Elf-lord Glorfindel prophesied to Eärnur that no man would slay the Witch-king), accepted the Witch-king's challenge (against the advice of the prophecy of Glorfindel) to meet him in single combat in Minas Morgul, and never returned. From that day until the coronation of Elessar hundreds of years later, Gondor was ruled by a Steward, as there was none to claim the kingship. 
<br />

<br />
He led the search for the One Ring, and later Mordor's assault on Minas Tirith. Here he was slain by Théoden's niece Éowyn with the aid of the hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck, thereby fulfilling the prophecy that no man should slay him. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
In the end, and I need to end this as I've gone on for some time, it really boils down to the differences that always happen between book and movie.  The movies didn't, and couldn't really even in the 9 hour time frame, explain all of this.  If they had, they probably would have lost or annoyed a good portion of the audience.  So, the story was "Hollywood-ized" and parts were changed or just left unmentioned.  Yes, movie did play up the confrontation, and then never really got across the reasons why it didn't happen.  I've also heard from many fans, and I agree, that the scene between Eowyn and the Witch-king just didn't play out well, but we've had years to imagine it in our heads.
<br />

<br />
I'll end this by saying that anyone who really enjoyed the movies, but always felt there was more and they really wanted to know about, should read the books.  All of them.  The Hobbit, the trilogy, the Silmarillion and the other myriad shorter tales that comprise Tolkien's work.  The man created a world and even then, he never got to finish it.  There is so much rich material here that today's writers, and even those who create game worlds for RPG's, pale by comparison.  And it all started because a little kid named John Ronald Reuel Tolkien like to make up play languages.
<br />

<br />
ps.  I'll also add something I read once and found rather interesting and amusing.  The entire story of the Hobbit is a special forces first-strike attack instigated by Gandalf.  Knowing that Sauron was returning, Gandalf puts together a team of dwarves and one hobbit and sets them on the trail of Smaug.  Smaug, as one of the fallen Maiar, would have been a powerful "unit" of Sauron once the dark lord returned to power.  So, Gandalf used his team to take out that unit before it ever had a chance to come into play.  Wily old bastard.</span><span class="postbody"><br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: violet">Sage Loriwen Tathrenlin</span></span>

He became Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari when Saraman fell from grace and became a follower Sauron.  At that time, Gandalf took over the leadership of the Istari, and was promoted to "the White".  
<br />

<br />
On a side note; in the book, Saraman gives himself a new title, "Saraman of Many Colors" trying to stay one step ahead of Gandalf.
<br />

<br />
As far as Gandalf being able to die, sure, he could die.  But since the existance of an after-life was made clear, death for him was more like changing planes of existance.  Maybe its like that for everyone, who knows.</span><span class="postbody"><br />_________________<br />Dalavon &lt;Dead of Winter&gt;

He didn't.  But it -is- his official retroactive justification. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Similarly, he didn't think about the ring being The Ring in The Hobbit either, and in fact had to go back and edit the Riddles in the Dark chapter in an effort to make it more consistant with LotR.
<br />

<br />
With regard to the unraised question that Isevan sortof seems to have, namely "Could Gandalf defeat the Witch King?" the answer is "No one knows."  Certainly Gandalf falls into the category of "no man", as he is a Maiar spirit (An 'angel of sorts) given flesh, but just because you're not a man doesn't give you immediate license to kill the Witch King, who was, after all, the mightiest of the Ring Wraiths, and a sorceror (not be confused with Wizard) of no small ability. 
<br />

<br />
In the extended cut of Fellowship, Gandalf says "There are many powers in this world, Frodo Baggins, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am."  That's pretty close to verbatim from the book, but it's incomplete - the full quote continues to add, "And against some I have not yet been tested." - conclusion: Gandalf himself doesn't know if he can defeat the Witch King.  He certainly INTENDS to challenge him, since he can't think of anyone else who can do it, since there is something of a shortage of battleworthy non-"men" in Minas Tirith at that point.  However, when he would have been out challenging the Witch King on the battlefield, Gandalf is "distracted" by the need to rescue Faramir (in the book, he says something to the effect of "I will come, because there is no other help that can reach him, but great evil will come of this.") and as such, Eowyn and Merry face the Witch King instead.

For those of you who are perhaps not interested in reading the books (for whatever unfathomable reasons you might have <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" /> ) but are still curious about a lot of this stuff, I can recommend a couple of good resources.  Firstly, there is <a href="http://www.theonering.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">The One Ring.Net</a> which was/is a site for all things related to the movies (Originally it was sortof a 'spy report' site, but it's grown a lot since then) and more particularly the <a href="http://greenbooks.theonering.net/index.shtml" target="_blank" class="postlink">Green Books</a> section, which contains, amoung other things, an excellent Q&A archive on all manner of things - including several about the whole Witch-King prophecy.
<br />

<br />
Another site worth checking out, probably for the more advanced Middle-Earth junkie, is <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Encyclopedia of Arda</a> a monumental cross linked encyclopedia of just about everything in Middle Earth.   Worth a stroll for both the veteran who wants to know what the deal was with <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/e/elrond.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Elrond's Parentage</a> complete with family tree, or the ravening Fangirl hungry for any scrap of information about <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/l/legolas.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Legolas</a> - it's a fine way to answer your questions.</span><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Q: Could Gandalf have slain the Witch-king? The reason I ask is because when Gandalf is discussing the Witch-king with Denethor, Denethor asks Gandalf if he met a foe he could not match. To which Gandalf replied, Well if the old prophecy be true then he will not fall by the hand of Man. Now Gandalf was a Maiar and not a man. He may have been in the form of a man but he could use spells and he had a hidden power it says. Or maybe Gandalf just meant male. But if that were the case how did Merry help slay the Witch-king and Merry was a hobbit? I know he didn't deal the deathblow, but his strike is said to have unknit the Witch-king's flesh. So was this a blunder? Thanks for your time.

ALSO: related to the above question: 
<br />

<br />
Here's one that's bothered me for a while: How is it, if only specially-wrought Elvish and Westernesse blades are any use against the Nazgul, t hat Eowyn was able to kill one (the Witch-King, no less) with her plain old Rohan sword? And with a blow to a "spiritual" area no less, the unseen head. Thanks for your time. 
<br />

<br />
- Todd M. Aglialoro 
<br />
A: I don't think there was any blundering involved here. The quotations go like this: "Or can it be that you have withdrawn because you are overmatched?" "It might be," Gandalf answered softly. "But our trial of strength is not yet come. And if words spoken of old be true, not by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from the Wise is the doom that awaits him." (RotK.) First of all, this means that Gandalf himself did not know whether or not he could have slain the Witch-king in a one-on-one. "Hidden from the Wise" includes "hidden from Gandalf," and Gandalf did not know. He did not know if he was overmatched, because it was not his time to face the Witch-king. That comes later, in the gate of Minas Tirith, and although they do not fight, Gandalf is able to drive him away because the wraith cannot claim victory yet; Rohan shows up to contest the field. As we see later, of course, "not by the hand of man" simply means "by the hand of woman and hobbit." For myself, I believe that a one-on-one contest between Gandalf and the Witch-king would have been almost as iffy as the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog. Gandalf and the Balrog are both Maiar, and the Witch-king began as a normal human, but the ring he wore, one of the Nine, gave him power approaching the spiritual realm. So there is really no telling. I believe Gandalf was aware that the fate of the Witch-king did not rest with him, and that's why he responded to Denethor as he did. But also he didn't know with whom the fate actually *did* rest. As we see later, the Witch-king was so off his guard that there was no actual fight. He believed he was invincible to anything currently on the field, and probably did not realize there were those on the other side who were not men, but hobbits and women. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">"‘Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.’ 
<br />

<br />
‘Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!’
<br />

<br />
Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. ‘But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Eowyn I am, Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.’ 
<br />

<br />
… but the Ringwraith made no answer, and was silent, as if in sudden doubt."</span> 
<br />

<br />
We all know what happened next. After Eowyn manages to dispatch the beast, Merry gets in one for the Shire at the wraith's knee, and the very unexpectedness of the stroke breaks the wraith's concentration to the point where his will no longer holds as steady, and Eowyn is able to drive her sword into what's left of his power, shattering it. So, I believe that A) Gandalf did not know at whose door the death of the Witch-king would be laid, and he didn't know if he would be the winner in a fight with him. B) Eowyn's sword, so far as we know, was a "plain old Rohan sword," but don't forget that Merry's blade was "forged many long years ago by the Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the Dark Lord" (FotR.) It is clear to me that Merry's stroke shattered the spells that allowed the Black Rider his cohesiveness of form and his concentration of will, and allowed Eowyn's sword to demolish the center of his power, the spiritual head.

Uh. Anyway. Update for the movie fans out there.  Word on the street (aka: <a href="http://www.theonering.net/scrapbook/view/13350" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>) is that they did -film- a confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch King, but that it didn't make it into the theatrical cut of the film (like so many good things, really.).  However. Odds are looking good for it being in the extended edition. Rawr.
<br />

<br />
Oh. And in OTHER other news, it looks like there may be some sort of theatrical release of the extended edition of RotK sometime around October. Stay tuned.</span><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Why after building him up to be this badass is he just an old guy that caries a staff that is his capable of beating people with? I fully expected when Gandalf left the city to protect the fleeing people from that thing(dragon? err something like that) that he would disintegrate it or whip up a wind to drive it off. The light that erupted from his staff was underwhelming to say the least. Nice maglite you got there Gandalf =D</span><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
First, Morgoth did not bring the dragons. He had corrupted great eagles into forms now known as dragons. He also corrupted each of the races into soemthing else, ie elves -> orcs ; ents -> trolls, etc. He could corrupt life but could never create life, only Eru could do that.(Although there IS an exception to that  <img src="images/smiles/icon_suspicious.gif" alt="icon_suspicious.gif" border="0" />  )
<br />
Second, Gandalf wasn't one of the leaders of the Istari wizards. Actually he was a late addition to them and was initially the weakest. The other 4 had lost their focus and had begun to accumulate power of their own, thus wandering from their initial focus.
<br />
Third, the reason why Gandalf and the others also didn't go in blasting was that Sauron could locate large uses of magic, and usually hunted down rogue mages of power.
<br />
Also they were sent to advise the races, not spearhead offensives. So it was frowned upon if they used anything besides their knowledge to help the races.
<br />

<br />
There is a TON of stuff out there nowadays about Middle Earth. I would highly recommend reading a few of the books, although the Silmarillion is bit.. ummm.. thick at times while reading.</span><span class="postbody"><br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=247107" target="_blank" class="postlink">Goloth</a>

While I think Peter Jackson did a wonderful job of realizing Tolkien's work, there are some problems with his translation that leave questions like this in the air.  I can't really answer based on what Jackson was thinking or trying to envision, because it does seem as if he were building up toward a cinematic confrontation which let down a lot of people who don't know the real story.
<br />

<br />
I can give you a very basic run-down, though.  There was a battle once in Middle-Earth where the Maiar did match their power against the might of Morgoth (Sauron's Master) and in doing so, the entire area of Beleriand (a huge area of several nations) was broken and destroyed, with small parts remaining that eventually became Lindon.  
<br />

(Quenta Silmarillion 24).</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
A lot of time passed and many other things happened.
<br />

<br />
Eventually, the Istari (wizards, Gandalf, Saruman, et al) were sent into Middle-Earth to contest Sauron and his bid to dominate all.  However, they were forbidden to match "power with power" against the Dark Lord.  It was feared that if such a battle happened again, the same fate would befall this area as it did on Beleriand.  Their only job was to guide and counsel others.
<br />

<br />
As for magic, that is an entire other topic that would take way too long to discuss.  Suffice to say, Gandalf was not a D&D wizard and shouldn't be expected to act like one.  In simplest terms, the closest description I could give is that he was an angel cloaked in a slow-aging mortal body and given strict rules as to what he could and could not do.  Yes, Gandalf is a badass, and if the gloves were off, a match for just about any of the dark forces except Sauron himself.
<br />

<br />
A few questions, Goloth ...

He had corrupted great eagles into forms now known as dragons.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Not sure where you're getting that info, please let me know because that's the first I've heard of it.  I find nothing in the Silmarillion on it, nor on Tolkien web sites.  <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Encyclopedia of Arda</a> states simply:
<br />

After Glaurung came many others to strike fear into Elves and Men for the next three ages; among them were Ancalagon the first winged dragon, Scatha who dwelt in the cold northern wastes, and Smaug, last of the great dragons.
<br />

<br />
Dragons have powers of intelligence and speech, and many are also able to cast the dragon-spell, a bewildering confusion that affects any who gaze into the eye of the creature.
<br />

<br />
The dragons were not destroyed at the end of the Third Age; some are said to have survived to our own time, but the great worms and drakes of the Elder Days are no more.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Is it in one of the letters or other tales?
<br />

<br />
Also, I can't find where trolls were implicitly stated to have been made from Ents.  The only Tolkien reference I've found just says, they were made 'in mockery of the Ents'.
<br />

<br />
As for Gandalf and the other Istari .. again, I'd be interested in knowing where you get your information from.  Gandalf acknowledged that Saruman was the Chief of the order, and the eldest of them, as well.  Other than that, no real ranking was given that I could find.  Also, Saruman is the only one that we're told grew to lust for power.  Radagast became interested in living things, animals mostly, and neglected his mission.  He only ever aided Saruman out of ignorance, though.  As for the other two, Alantar and Pallando, not much is known aside that they were dressed in blue and went further east and left all knowledge of the tales.
<br />

<br />

(The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, No. 211).</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Anyway, what it boils down to for me is this ... if anyone wants to really know answers, they should read Tolkien's work for themselves.  At the very least, the LotR books, but also The Hobbit and the Silmarillion.  If really interested, there are a dozen or more other books, mostly collections of Tolkien's other writings of ME and letters to friends, family, and peers, but those are mostly for the hard-core fan.
<br />

<br />
However, if reading this much isn't for you, most of your answers can be found at the Enclyclopedia of Arda linked above or <a href="http://greenbooks.theonering.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Green Books</a>.  Both of these are wonderful sites.</span><span class="postbody"><br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: violet">Sage Loriwen Tathrenlin</span></span>

They took a lot of the gaps and filled them. So while not technically Tolkein lore, he did approve it. 
<br />
They added a lot of background info for the Istari, the Valar, and the First Age elves, as well as more info on the Numenoreans. As well as more info on the origins of a lot of the races and monsters.
<br />
Unfortunately, they filed for bankruptcy and lost the rights to the ME information when they reformed the company and Christopher opened up rights to gaming in ME to the highest bidder. But you can still find a lot of their source books out there.
<br />

While I guess for a purist, the information is not written by JRR himself, it was approved by him and fit his vision of Middle Earth.
