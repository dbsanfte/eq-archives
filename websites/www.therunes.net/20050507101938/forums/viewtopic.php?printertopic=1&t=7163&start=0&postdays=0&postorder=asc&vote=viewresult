<span class="postbody">Here it is gang! The big patch filled with fixes for your gaming pleasure. 
<br />

<br />
Update Notes: January 06, 2005 1/6/2005 8:00 AM 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** Headlines ***</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- Tons of new quests, mostly for solo players!
<br />
- Two new dungeons available for groups at levels 25 to 30!
<br />
- Character Differentiation choices have been reset for all characters. See details below.
<br />
- New Character Differentiation option: Training!
<br />
- Lots of artisan recipe and ability fixes!
<br />
- Eat healthy! New examine information added to explain the benefits of food and drink!
<br />
- Brawlers get built-in shields!
<br />
- Guild followers can spend the status they earn at city merchants!
<br />
- Now easier to equip rings, wrist items, and weapons!
<br />
- Slash that dot! Maps now show your current heading!
<br />
- Lots of UI tweaks and enhancements!
<br />
- More bug fixes than you can shake a moss snake at!
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** Character Differentiation ***</span>
<br />

<br />
- All characters logging in after this update will have their previous character differentiation choices reset. This includes any selections that were pending.
<br />
- Character differentiation selections will be offered again. You may receive your selections in a different order this time. Class-dependent choices (like Tactics: Enemy Mastery) will be presented after the others. Characters who gain these abilities as they level up normally will get them in the normal order.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">** IMPORTANT! **</span>- You will not be able to receive quest rewards until you make all pending character differentiation choices available to you.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** Training ***</span>
<br />

<br />
- Characters now receive a new character differentiation option every ten adventure levels: Training!
<br />
- Training allows you to choose one of four new abilities. Each of these spells or arts builds off abilities you've been using but substantially increases their effectiveness and benefit.
<br />
- The choice is yours whether you prefer a stronger attack, a more potent buff, a heartier heal, or a handier utility function. Training allows you to enhance specific aspects of your character and be a bit unique.
<br />
- These Training abilities have a longer span of effectiveness than most common spells and arts, so they'll prove very useful to you.
<br />
- Note: Characters who reach levels 10 and 20 will not be prompted to make their Training selections until they leave their current zone and enter another. This is a known issue that will be corrected in a future update.
<br />
- Remember, you MUST make all Training choices presented to you before you can receive any quest rewards.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** Gameplay ***</span>
<br />
- Group members can now join other group members in a specific instance of a zone even if that zone has reached its capacity.
<br />
- If a character dies and is given the option to be revived in a different zone, the revive window will allow the player to choose from multiple instances if they are available.
<br />
- Harvesting quests can no longer be completed by purchasing the items from a broker.
<br />
- Spells that debuff the target's maximum health or power now work appropriately.
<br />
- Fixed a bug that could cause you to fall under the world while swimming.
<br />
- Removed the restriction that only guild patrons can spend status points.
<br />
- You are no longer able to swap bags into your shared bank if one of the bags contains a lore or no-trade item.
<br />
- You are no longer able to drag lore items from your overflow slot into the shared bank.
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused rare mastery quest items not to drop from solo encounters.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** New Dungeons ***</span>
<br />

<br />
- Rumor has it that a vile creature named Gobblerock has taken up residence in a newly discovered section of the Freeport Sewers. Those brave enough to end this threat to the Overlord's domain should consult knowledgeable individuals south of the Freeport gates.
<br />
- Sources in Qeynos tell us that a previously condemned section of the Catacombs has been reopened. This new area contains some rather formidable adversaries that threaten the city. Faithful servants of the Queen should seek out more information at the lookout point east of the Oracle Tower in Antonica.
<br />
- These new dungeons are intended for groups of adventurers around levels 25 to 30.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** Controls, Commands, and UI ***</span>
<br />
- Character Select: If you choose to delete a character, you will now be asked to type in the character name.
<br />
- Inventory: The overflow slot now features a context menu that allows you to examine the item, move it to your inventory, or destroy it.
<br />
- Inventory: The default behavior when dragging a stack of items or coins has changed to drag the entire stack. To choose a quantity, hold down the Shift key while dragging. Holding down the Control key while dragging still picks up a single item from the stack.
<br />
- Inventory: You can now drag bag windows if your mouse pointer is over an empty slot.
<br />
- Inventory: If you attempt to equip a weapon that is not compatible with what you're wielding, your current weapons will be unequipped for you. For example, if you are currently holding a sword and shield and attempt to equip a two-handed weapon, both the sword and shield will be unequipped.
<br />
- Inventory: Equipping items in the wrist and finger slots is much easier.
<br />
- Inventory: Double-clicking a second dual-wield weapon in your inventory should now allow it to be equipped properly.
<br />
- Inventory: Added information on the value of various kinds of food and drink in the examine window and tooltip.
<br />
- Guild UI: Class and Name columns are now sized according to their content.
<br />
- Guild UI: Guild UI now displays the guild status earned by each patron in the "Standing" column.
<br />
- Guild UI: Fixed the confirmation screen for guild demotions.
<br />
- Main UI: The society window's members list will now sort correctly on rank, level, current status, and total status when you click on the column headers.
<br />
- Main UI: Fixed a bug causing only the first embedded item link to get the link color.
<br />
- Main UI: Custom chat channels now use their assigned channel colors.
<br />
- Main UI: Maps now have a heading indicator instead of a dot.
<br />
- Main UI: Coins in your bank and in a trade window now have a tooltip.
<br />
- Main UI: Clicking on a map icon now creates a temporary waypoint and a wisp to that location. For real this time.
<br />
- Main UI: Various points of interest have been added to the city maps.
<br />
- Main UI: UI window settings should now save more consistently.
<br />
- Main UI: You will receive notification when players on your friends list log in and out.
<br />
- Main UI: The tooltip on the experience bar now reports experience debt more accurately.
<br />
- Main UI: The con color of quests is now visible on the quest acceptance window.
<br />
- Main UI: Hotkey macros can now have up to three command lines, which are executed in order.
<br />
- Main UI: Hotkeys should no longer flash when a heroic opportunity starter chain fails.
<br />
- Main UI: Only relevant hotkeys should flash during a heroic opportunity.
<br />
- Main UI: Items that cannot be equipped no longer show their condition in the examine window.
<br />
- Main UI: Items can now be dropped anywhere in the trade window. If you drop an item somewhere that doesn't make sense, it will be placed into the leftmost available spot.
<br />
- Tradeskill UI: When repeating a recipe, the components window will now remember which particular items you previously selected.
<br />

<br />

<br />
There are several issues with today's update that are negatively affecting gameplay. Here are some of the key issues that our team is focused on right now, with the status of their resolution:
<br />
Tradeskill zones crashing. We are investigating the cause. If you have information on how to consistently make a crash happen, please feel free to pass it directly to me via PM. 
<br />
Certain zones being down when players attempt to enter them. We are briefly bouncing all servers to take care of this issue. The zones in question should be accessible very soon. 
<br />
Missing character art at certain LOD settings. We have found the problem and are in the process of correcting it. 
<br />
Some quests being reset to the beginning, even if completed. The cause has been found and fixed. See specifics below.
<br />
Our plan is that as soon as all these issues are confirmed to be fixed, we will do another update. Since the amount of data needed to be pushed is relatively small, we don't anticipate longer than a 45 to 60 minute downtime.
<br />

<br />
We'll update you again when we have a better idea of the timeframe of the update. Thanks for your patience.
<br />

<br />
The quests that have been reset by today's bug are listed below. If your character has any of these quests in any stage in the quest journal, they will be reset to the beginning if you log in before the fix is applied. After the fix, characters logging in will be unaffected, but unfortunately we will NOT be able to retroactively fix characters that have been affected. We sincerely apologize to those for whom this will be the case.
<br />

<br />
If you have advanced in any of the quests below and do not want to lose progress on them, we STRONGLY encourage you not to log in until our next update is complete. Again, if you log in before the fix is applied we will not be able to reset your progress to where it was before.
<br />

<br />
If you have previously completed any of these quests, you will find that they have been moved to your active page and reset to the beginning. When we apply the fix for this bug, quests you have already completed will be moved back to the Completed tab of your journal. There is no need to delete them at this time.

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Posted later</span>
<br />

<br />
In addition to the issues I posted a little while ago, many players are reporting that spells and arts that were usable independently of one another before today are now using the same recast timer. I wanted to take a moment to clarify this situation.
<br />
 
<br />
The Training options are intended to act as a higher-powered replacement for abilities you are already using. Training is not meant to give you an additional ability; rather, it is meant to act as a significant upgrade to an existing spell or combat art. Since these are free upgrades that are much more potent than the Apprentice I spells you ordinarily receive, they need to share a recast timer in order to maintain game balance.
<br />
 
<br />
However, a number of other spells and arts that had been separate are now tied together as well. For instance, certain heal or damage-over-time spells that were independent of one another now prevent similar spells from being used. We are working at this very moment to reverse this change so that the affected spells and arts will work the same way they did before this update.
<br />
 
<br />
To sum up: Training options are intended to replace existing abilities and thus will share the same timer. The recast timers of standard spells and arts that were affected by today's update will be reverted to function the way they have since launch.
<br />
 
<br />
Unfortunately, this change will require some additional testing, so we will probably not be able to apply it along with the fixes for the four key issues mentioned in my first post. We will push the spell linking change to the live servers just as soon as we can, but it will not happen until Friday or Saturday.
<br />
 
<br />
We're sorry for the confusion this has caused, and I hope this post clarifies how the Training and recast timers are meant to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
