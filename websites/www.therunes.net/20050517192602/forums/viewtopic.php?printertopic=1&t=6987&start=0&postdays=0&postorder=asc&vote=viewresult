In addition he had initially started writing A Dance With Dragons, not AFFC, and that is what caused AFFC to be written in the first place. He'll get to it, and then it will not be that long a delay before ADWD comes out as a large part of that is already written. I'm looking forward to it, I just wish that he'd get to the last books so we can find out all the stuff he's been foreshadowing... like who Jon Snow's parents really are...  <img src="images/smiles/eusa_think.gif" alt="eusa_think.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I think Jon Snows mother was in the Taragryn (sp?) family. The has to be a good reason that Ned never wanted to talk about it, I think it was to protect Jon from Robert. Remember how insane Robert got after his fiancee was murdered by Aegon? Ned knew that if Robert found out about Jon, he would have him killed. 
<br />

<br />
So IF Jon actually did have a Taragryn mother...wouldnt that technically make him an heir to the Iron throne?
<br />

<br />
Also what about Gendry. Hes the apprentice blacksmith that Arya runs around with. Its obvious that he is Robert's oldest living bastard...and since Roberts brothers are out of the picture, doesnt that give Gendry a claim to the throne as well?

<br />
I havent completely finished Storm of Swords yet (eq2 taking up all my reading time) so maybe some of this info is outdated. This really is the best series I have ever read.

Well near the end of Storm of Swords a Dornish woman recalls that Ned Stark may have fell in love with a Dornish woman named Ella (sp?). According to her it was common kowledge around the court in Dorne that she was Jon Snows mother....but it could all have been a rumor she adds.

I dont see this happening, though she has been through complete hell for the entire series. She spared the Hound's life, and he was on her list of people that must die. Sandor Cleagane is an interesting plot line, hes clearly evil, but will his time with Arya change him? I wouldnt be surprised to see those two meet up in the future.

My heart tells me Winterfell. Stanis wants him to be in charge of Winterfell. The readers want him to be in charge of Winterfell. The Crows have already named him the new Lord Commander, could he possibly do both? I am positive that at some point Stannis WILL sit on the Iron Throne. Melissandra predicted it, and so far everything she predicted has come true. He may not stay there long but he will be the king for some period of time.

<br />
I think that Sansa was his plan all along. Littlefinger is the reason Ned Stark is dead lest we forget. I dont trust him. He was obsessed with Cat, and he just couldnt accept Ned having her. Cat is gone now, so he goes for little Sansa who looks so much like her mother. Littlefinger severed his alliance with the Lanisters and with Sansa as his bride and the Vale at his back he could claim Winterfell as his own.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now heres some more questions:
<br />

<br />
What about Catelyn, was she resurrected by the Red Priest?
<br />

<br />
When will Danie sail on the Seven Kingdoms? Will she be the one to usurp Stanis? Why wouldnt we want her as Queen? Married to Jon Snow perhaps?
<br />

<br />
WTF is Tyrion going to do now? Maybe flee across the sea and team up with Danie?
<br />

<br />
WTF is Arya going to do now? She has no home, no real family left, no money...just that strange coin given to her by the assassin. I remember way back in a Game of Thrones that there was a group of killers called the Faceless or something like that who would kill anyone with 100% satisfaction garuntee as long as you had enough money to buy their services. Maybe that assassin who gave Arya the coin was a member of this group, could Arya be on her way to a new profession? WHERE IS NYMIERA??
<br />

<br />
Bran's storyline is my least favorite, but it got interesting at the end of Storm of Swords. He meets up with someone/something that has answers to his questions. Does Bran ever make a claim to Winterfell? Technically speaking he is the King in the North now, unless Jon steps up.
<br />

<br />
After Tyrions coup de grace, the Lanisters are now a rudderless ship. Tywin was the only thing keeping Cersei in check. Jamie seems to be a little disillusioned with his sister as well. Whos going to run the Iron Throne now? Tommen is a good kid, but hes barely more than an toddler.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I'm only most of the way through book 1, but I believe I already have Jon's parentage figured out.
<br />

<br />
Jon is -not- Eddard Stark's son.
<br />

<br />
Jon -is- Lyanna Stark's son.  By Rhaegar Taegaryen.
<br />

<br />
Think about it. Things we know:
<br />

<br />
Lyanna was abducted and raped by Rhaegar, and subsequently dies on a "bed of blood" (A term later used to describe the bed of childbirth) asking Ned to promise her...something. (To take care of Jon, obviously.)
<br />

<br />
It explains why Ned would have a bastard (he doesn't) and why he won't talk about the mother.  
<br />

<br />
And yes, it makes Jon half dragon, as someone speculated above.

<br />
- Ned never calls Jon his "son" only "of my blood". This would be true if he was form anyone in Ned's family.
<br />
- Rhaegar and Lyanna were madly in love, this is pretty much outright shown in various side stories (tourney stories, etc.) She wasn't so much kidnapped as she went with him. This was not allowed as she was promised to Robert (who did love her dearly), so being a man of honor Ned had to go retrieve her, thus the battle at the Tower of Joy.
<br />
- The dream that (I think Dany had?) of Rhaeger standing with child in arms, speaking of his second child, that "his is a song of ice and fire" - yet we already know there are always three heads to the dragon, not two. It's Jon's song, not the baby's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
