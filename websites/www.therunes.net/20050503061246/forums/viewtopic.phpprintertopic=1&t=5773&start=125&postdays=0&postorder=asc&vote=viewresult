<span class="postbody">&lt;&lt;NOTE: This post is all in good fun, I do not mean to offend anyone in it, SOE or otherwise, I simply mean to aid the argument, in my own <span style="font-style: italic">special</span> way. &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
After reading and identifying with all of you, I have decided to aid this movement by not only stating that after today my chanter is my brother's buff bot, but I'd like to lighten the mood a bit as well~
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
First, by letting the kind people at SOE know how we feel in a picture format, which I am sure they will easily understand:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2004-7/778759/BigBird.jpg" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Naturally, I am sure that SOE will be feeling this movement economically and substantially, and the common expression shared at the office will undoubtedly be:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2004-7/778759/HeadupButt.jpg" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
But, as we know, as demonstrated with other classes at other dates, when there are problems, Sony quickly takes the most logical means of correcting the problem, writes it down on a small 3x5 card and proceeds to encase it in a smoldering ball of flame, rendering it to cinders. Afterwards, we all have the pleasure of reading a small, pitiless quote by a spokesman who does not get to the point at hand. This is most easily symbolized by one single picture:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2004-7/778759/SOETechSupport.JPG" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
We do not ask that you make enchanters the best class. We do not ask that you make enchanters any more than that which we once were. All that we ask is that you <span style="font-style: italic">listen</span> and do something! As of right now, we are not having fun playing your game, and we are ceasing to play. Eventually, how many of us will there be left? 
<br />

<br />
I had fun playing back when playing was more than failing to mezz an add, blowing eldritch rune and doppelganger, trying to get the add which is now on the cleric, missing mezz again because of high magic resists, the mob hits me 4 times, and seeing the LOADING... PLEASE WAIT screen. Back before I was used on raids for only my mind and haste buffs. I had fun back when the tells I got were 'we need a CC/slower, want to join us at XXX?' Nowadays, all I get is 'Do you mind running all the frig over to some stupid zone I've never heard of let alone been to, and casting haste and KEI on us for 100pp?'
<br />

<br />
Bring back the <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> for enchanters and we will slowly start returning, that is, if we haven't already been dealt a fatal blow against our views on SOE or MMORPGs in general. That is what I feel.
<br />

<br />
I took a step outside my chambers and a clear, unwaivering voice promptly addressed me, saying, 'You're in <span style="font-style: italic">our</span> world now.' It was at that moment that I realized that I was liberated.
<br />

The game and my class was no longer fun.  I tried not playing last weekend and discovered real life is much more fun and rewarding.  I'm a lot happier now.
<br />

<br />
I would like to actually thank Sony.  Making the game such a boring, grind where skills don't count and nerfing my class's core abilities is what made the game annoying and unenjoyable.  Thank you for making it easier to leave.  Life is so much better than EQ.

<br />
Funny, I always thought I would go out of EQ with a horde of mobs mezzed, charmed pet breaking, AE mezzing, adds respawning, tank dying and my computer power supply exploding.
<br />

<br />
This was my life as an enchanter.  From my young age in Luclin, up until PoP, I thrived and filled myself with these situations.  You see, I originally played first person shooters (FPS), like Unreal Tournament and Counterstrike.  Everquest was a side project, one that I would play when I wanted a slow change of pace, nuking stuff with my wizard and druid, quad kiting and what not.
<br />

<br />
I created Jaknobin as a tradeskill bot to figure out what were all these things my druid foraged up.  Level 39 was a good level for my tradeskill bot for imbues for tradeskilling.  I had no reason to level up…. Until I saw the new Planes of Power required level 61 and higher for new imbues.  I needed to learn how to level my tradeskill bot up fast, during lunch hour, short spans of availability where I couldn’t afford lengthy commitments.  I found charm soloing, duoing and grouping.
<br />

<br />
Forget FPS, I had found something in Everquest that brought the action back.  Where other classes lived by the minutes, enchanters with charmed pets lived by the second or half second.  Risks and rewards were great but you had to be attentive and forget taking breaks when you had a hasted dual wielding pet.
<br />

<br />
In all my years of experience, I became an expert, rarely dying while charming.  And rightly so.  Hadn’t I charmed for more than two years?  Hadn’t I obtained the gear and AA necessary to become a master of the art?  I have probably lost enough experience, taking full experience deaths in out of the way areas to level up another to level 65.
<br />

<br />
Raiding was a necessary evil.  Yeah we were bored on raids, just tashing, nuking and buffing.  Thank our great pullers that would bring extra so we could mezz a little, but honestly in low end content, it is safer to offtank, saving healer buff mana for pasted enchanters.  But at least, after raiding I could go back to the fast paced lifestyle that I was all to familiar with.
<br />

<br />
Now welcome to Omens of War and the multitude of nerfs to charm and crowd control.
<br />

<br />
I was NOT upset with mobs running faster than runspeed 5.
<br />
I was NOT upset with mobs having more hitpoints and hitting less.
<br />
I was NOT upset with no PBAE mezz spell upgrade.
<br />
I was NOT upset with new pacification no allowing you to approach a mob.
<br />
I was NOT upset with new charm spells NOT WORKING AT ALL IN ANY OTHER ZONE BESIDES OOW.
<br />
I was NOT upset with all OOW charm mobs hitting for 25 to 40 percent what they normally do (max hit 300) and then turn around and hit you for full 1k plus when charm breaks.
<br />

<br />
What I am upset about is that……….NONE OF THIS WAS MENTIONED ANYWHERE!  NOWHERE.  Not in a patch message, no responses on enchanter boards, not in any developer discussion forum.  The attitude was, oh charm is unbalanced so you should have expected it.  In beta, the charm nerf wasn’t implemented until 2 days before public release.
<br />

<br />
Charm is not unbalanced.  Think about it.  When you want a mob to cast a level 65 to 70 4k damage spell instead of hitting you, THAT is the imbalance.  The mob to player disparity is so ridiculous; this is what has changed.  It is the same reason why out of camp crowd control is favorable (bring one, don’t need to mezz), since the risk is too high for a mezz bounce.
<br />

<br />
So now I am stuck with a coercer that can’t use OoW level charm spells in any other expansion (imagine your most effective spells only useable in OoW, or your pets), 4th rate slower (without slowstick, and since most mobs mitigate, we use slowest 6 sec, Kunark slow), poor DPS, oh but I can buff.
<br />

<br />
I didn’t roll this character to buff.  I made this character because it was one of the few where your skill could truly show and save the group or raid.  Now, I have my FPS reaction speeds to…… quickly respond to buff tells.
<br />

<br />
I don’t understand the justification for SOE to change 2 spell lines this late in the game.  Charm and pacification have been changed for the worse.  We are at end game.  Why not let everyone be the gods they desire already?  Instead, the enchanter class has become weaker, not stronger at level 70 in OoW.  No other class is like that.
<br />

<br />
Well, FU SOE.  I will truly miss you all.  It has been an enjoyable ride, but now I’m putting the FU from SOE back in my FUN.
