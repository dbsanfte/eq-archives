<span class="postbody">Heres some info ive found on the ent and shamelessly stolen for your viewing pleasure.
<br />

<br />
Serrated Bone Dagger 
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is a heritage quest. We believe it to be for the Serrated Bone Dirk (need stats), but have not been able to confirm it yet. It is given by Leelav Yekl on the beach near the docks (to left if facing out from docks) in the Enchanted Lands. 
<br />

<br />
Leelav Yekl needs you to track down an assassin for him. He first sends you to Freeport to scour the inns looking for clues on how to track him down. He gives no further instructions but we can tell you that you must speak to Kreglebop Yekl in West Freeport. He is found outside on the patio of the tavern at +289, +9, +91. 
<br />

<br />
Kreglebop Yekl will give you clues that lead to Qeynos. You are once again told to scour the taverns of Qeynos to find an unspecified NPC. We can tell you that this NPC is found past a curtain (hidden) in a downstairs area of the tavern in North Qeynos. The curtain is at +325, -21, +148. The NPC is named Lodo Bightn and can be found at +337, -27, +155. 
<br />

<br />
You will then be sent to the Crypt of Betrayal to search for signs of the Assassin. Bring a group for this step. When you walk past the hallway near +75, +7, +18 two hired assassins (level 38 ^^ and ^ mobs) will spawn and attack you. Kill them and you will receive a Worn Note. Examine the note to receive a hint for the next step. 
<br />

<br />
You must now head to the inn at Windstalker Village. As you enter the inn you go to the corner just inside on your left (-1923, -36, -608) to get an advance. You will receive a Crudely Scrawled Parchment a that point which can be examined to give information on the next step. 
<br />

<br />
It's now time to head to the docks in the Thundering Steppes. Make sure your party stays together at this point as when you go near the docks Verishu and som enthralled warriors will ambush you. Kill them and you will receive Nightblood Orders. Read this for a hint to the next step. 
<br />

<br />
Now it's time to head to Rivervale and visit a lodge at -545, -1, -190. When someone enters this lodge Ethruia Aidora and several other Lamias will spawn and attack you. Kill them. Ethruia will drop a Quickly Written Letter which can be examined for more hints. 
<br />

<br />
You must now run out to Leelav Yekl in the Enchanted Lands and warn him that they are coming for him. When you speak to him Lodo Bightn and two Shadowed Halflings will spawn. You must kill them for the Serrated Bone Dirk. 
<br />

<br />
You must then speak to Leelav Yekl to close the quest, receive status points and experience and receive a hint for another Heritage quest. 
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />

<br />
Loc of the house in Rivervale is (-521.76, -0.31, -214.52). The mobs you need for quest inside are non-aggro, but there are other aggro mobs in there, also. 
<br />

<br />
Once you kill them you get another note telling you to go back to the beach and speak to the gnome on the beach (Leelav Yekl). Three mobs will spawn next to him, kill them and you'll get your SBD. After you get your dagger, go talk to Leelav again. I got 7% exp at level 40 and almost 6 gold from talking to him after I got my dagger, so don't forget to talk to him again. This will also complete the quest. 
<br />

<br />
After you kill the two mobs in CoB you receive a note which tells you to go to Windstalker Village in Antonica. Go inside the tavern and walk over behind one of the tables close to the entrance on your left-hand side (exact loc is: -1,918.62, -36.05, -608.16). There's no item to rub, just walk around the table and you'll get another note. This note tells you to go to the docks in Thundering Steppes. Once you get there 3 mobs will spawn, kill them and then you get another note. This new note tells you to search the houses in Rivervale for the assassin's lodge. This is the step our group is currently on. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Fishbone Earring 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Kerath McMarrin at the Thundering Steppes docks asks you to find Hrath's Journal. This is the quest for the Fishbone Earring. This can be foud at the Tower of Vhalen in Antonica (-1300, +38, +45). 
<br />

<br />
Obtain it and return to Kerath. He will then send you to the Nektulos Forest to take a dip in the Torrent River. This near hte bridge near N'Marr's Ascent. 
<br />

<br />
The next step is to visit the northern ocean in Commonlands (need loc, it's near a dragon skeleton ribcage). 
<br />

<br />
After this you must swim into the oceans of the Thundering Steppes. This is off the coast to the far west, you must swim way off the map pas the Siren Pyramid and up north to the shipwrecks. When you get to the spawn a Krake will spawn. You do not have to kill it, however. 
<br />

<br />
The next step is to kill Lord Everliving in the Nektropos Castle. This requires you to complete the Calling in the Forest quest to gain access. 
<br />

<br />
After this you must head to the Ruins of Varsoon to kill Hrath V'Tol. 
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Hrath for over 2 hours last night and took over for a group that had been there for 1.5 hours. Anyone have any info on this guys spawn time? 
<br />

<br />
place to look in the CL is in the NE part of the lake.. in the middle of the ripcage of a dragon skelet. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
After that you have to head to the Thundersteppes hit the coast to the far west, swim all the way west OUT of the map past the siren pyramid and up north to the shipwrecks... its the second one you meet. 
<br />

<br />
BEWARE: Once you trigger the quest update, a krake will spawn, at 32 it was blue with ^^ And it nailed the two of us. So be prepared. 
<br />

<br />
After that you have to kill the Everling lord in the Nektropos castle, we're heading there tomorrow and wipe him out so stay tuned. 
<br />

<br />
Tower in Antonica -> River in Nek -> Ocean in CL -> Kill Lord Everling in Nektropolis Castle (Yes you must be keyed, yes he is very hard, hes at the bottom, its very time consuming, and hes level 36) -> Kill Hrath V'tol in Ruins of Varsoon (I have not completed this step) 
<br />

<br />
nek part is bridge kinda near nmars the iron bridge not near CL. the reward is the fishbone earring. 
<br />

<br />
Journal tells you to look for a Dragon skeleton. This can be found at -850, -196, -992. 
<br />
Next part is to look for Shipwrecks in Thundering Steppes. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Legendary Journeymans Boots 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
This is a Heritage quest, and is one of a series. We do not have complete information at this time. We do know that it starts from Cru Naseto in Antonica though. He will give you 14 minutes to visit the following locations and return to him:

<br />
7. Return to Sian D'ior 
<br />

<br />
The third leg of this quest starts with Lessa Gentare in the Thundering Steppes. She is located at the docks. This step may be impossible without evac. You must visit: 
<br />

<br />
1. Thundermist Village (+550, -10, -27) 
<br />
2. Deadview Pass 
<br />
3. Shrine of the Sirens - About 50m out from beach as far west as you can go on the map (the little bump on beach) 
<br />
4. Shrine of Decay 
<br />
5. Coldwind Cove 
<br />
6. Grave Poll 
<br />
7. Return to Lessa 
<br />

<br />
The fourth leg is given by an NPC at the Commonlands gate in the Nektulos Forest (S'to something I believe, need actual name). He will give you fifteen minutes to visit: 
<br />

<br />
1. Behemoth Pond - Near -735, +141, -1990 
<br />
2. Gargoyle Gorge 
<br />
3. Nektropos Castle - Far northeast corner (need loc) 
<br />
4. N'Marr's Ascent - Near -398, 1, -1235 
<br />
5. D'Abbth Bridge 
<br />
6. Port Naythex - Near +661, -1, -271 
<br />
7. Return to NPC 
<br />

<br />
The next leg is in Zek (need NPC name). This time you will need to run from: 
<br />

<br />
Grove Stones - Druid Ring (+228, +14, +93) 
<br />
Charred Vale - Scorched area at the Zek bridge (need loc) 
<br />
Deathfist Lookout - Top of the large winding rock at 
<br />
Access Bridge of Zek - The bridge before Citadel (need loc) 
<br />
Deathfist Citadel - Near -162.16, -25.11, -615.68 
<br />
Spirit Lake - Don't touch the water (-58.5, -3.65, -71.6) 
<br />
Deathfist Quarry - You must take the elevator down at the mines at +343, -114, -118.5 
<br />

<br />
From there you must go to the Enchanted Lands and speak to Hobs Fleetfoot. (need location information) 
<br />

<br />
The next leg after this is in the Feerrott. (need NPC and location information) 
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Enchanted Lands quest is very easy as well; if you are either a run-speed enhancer or evaccer, you can solo it; if not, get 1 of those classes (have evaccer wait at the camp, labeled nightblood tower on map), and evac you once you get there and update quest. Once you evac to docks or are running with pathfind or sow, run between the 2 mountains north of the lookout tower, south to the lookout tower, and then to banoo. Another easy one, luckily. I will try feerrott now and report back once i finish. 
<br />

<br />
For the zek quest, part #2 Charred Vale, that confused me; it is not at the zek bridge, but the bunch of burnt trees to the southeast. This quest is very very easy; i did it with 2 evaccers though. Once you hit the citadel, evac to the docks; from there go to the lake, then down the elevator in the quarry, then you dont even need to evac the second time but do it if you want, the finish line is that barrior wall just on the dock side of the doors that open in the outpost walls. Once again, Zek part is very very easy. 
<br />

Posted By: GorefangDate: 12/24/04 at 1:01pmPSTServer: ButcherblockBetween crosroads and zarvons tower you have to goto lucans mount ... its not listed above 
<br />

<br />
Posted By: GorefangDate: 12/19/04 at 11:46amPSTServer: ButcherblockThe keep of the ardent needle is near 
<br />
Knight Grel Stoneshearer - -403, +15, -304 
<br />
(it says on the lord grimrots sythe quest he overlooks the keep from a hilltop) 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Greater Lightstone 
<br />

<br />

<br />
This ques tis initiated by examining a "Burned Out Lightstone". This item drops from the Lightbringer Wisp in Commonlands. He spawns at the Ring of Nature near +595, -45, -340. 
<br />

<br />
The quest is actually many parts, each with their own reward. Each step upgrades you to a new version of the Lightstone, but the quest name never changed. It is a continuance of the quest at all points. 
<br />

<br />
The first thing you need to do is find someone who needs this lightstone. The person who needs it (though the quest gives you no indication) is Cannix Silverflame in the Commonlands (-310, -362). He is found on the road just outside of the Crossroads. This is a tricky step because the dialogue to advance the quest is found on his second page of text, with the first page of text being the same as he tells anyone if you have the lightstone or not. 
<br />

<br />
The first thing Cannix will ask of you is to touch the Mourned and the Forgotten with the lightstone. These are both interactive objects in the Commonlands. You right click on them and you will receive an option to touch the statue with the lightstone. 
<br />

<br />
The Forgotten - +172, -45, +260 
<br />
The Mourned - -590, -49, -632 
<br />

<br />
After completing this step return to Cannix for your first reward (Faintly Lit Lightstone). He will then ask you to kill Rama'nai in the Commonlands. Rama'nai is a named lion at the Ring of Nature, near where the Lightbringer Wisp spawned. He has a pride of lionesses but is relatively easy. 
<br />

<br />
After killing Rama'nai return to Cannix for your second reward (Dimly Lit Lightstone). Your next task is to kill two Orc Captains in the Commonlands: 
<br />

<br />
Captain Gaer 
<br />
Captain Ogof 
<br />

<br />
After killing them return to Cannix for your third reward. 
<br />

<br />
The next step is to kill the High Priest of Val'Marr in the Commonlands. He is found at the Ruins of Val'Marr. 
<br />

<br />
After doing this return to Cannix. He will then send you to kill General Drull. He can be found in Bloodskull Valley, which is a keyed raid zone (see related quests). 
<br />

<br />
After completing this task return to Cannix and he will attack you, not wanting to give up the reward. Kill him and congratulations on a Greater Lightstone. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Shiny Brass Halberd 
<br />

<br />
This is the quest for the Shiny Brass Halberd. It is initiated by Dragoon K'Naae in the northeast section of Nektulos Forest (-1373, +30, -1336). 
<br />

<br />
The first order of business is to acquire 60 Owlbear Meats in Nektulos. These drop on the Ash Owlbears in the zone. After doing this return to K'Naae. 
<br />

<br />
He will then ask you to collect 60 Undead Skin Scraps. You can obtain these from the undead in the zone. After acquiring all 60 return to Dragoon K'Naae. 
<br />

<br />
He will then give you a flask of water which you must fill at Behemoth Pond in Nektulos Forest and return to him. The return is timed, you have 9 minutes to run it. The submitter made it back with three minutes to spare with journeyman's boots and spirit of wolf. 
<br />

<br />
You will then be asked to kill Captain T'Sanne at the Citadel and recover a weapon from him. After doing this return to Dragoon K'Naee. 
<br />

<br />
When you get near Dragoon K'Naae you will be ambushed by three monsters. Kill them and speak to Dragoon K'Naee to complete the quest. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Dwarven Work Boots 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
This is a heritage quest that results in Dwarven Work Boots. It is given by Hwal Rucksif in Antonica (-559, -12, -316). 
<br />

<br />
Step 1 is to harvest 100 Ore and 100 Wood from Antonica. It must be in Antonica and the get around of passing items back and forth will not work. 
<br />

<br />
After completing the harvest you must return to Hwal with at least 50 Ore and Wood in your inventory. However he doesn't take them from inventory. You are rewarded with some coin (approx 11s) and the next step. 
<br />

<br />
Next requires you to collect three more pieces for Hwal: 
<br />

<br />
The first is from the Blackburrow. It drops from miners and excavaters. 
<br />

<br />
The second is from a named Sapling in Stormold, near library entrance. Clear the fungus and mist to spawn him. 
<br />

<br />
The third piece from drop Bloodtalon, a named Griffon in the Thundering Steppes. 
<br />

<br />
Hwal then tells you that all this forging is making him thursty. He sends you to Blackburrow to get some stout. It's in the Brewery, the top barrel on a a stack of barrels just as you get in (need loc). 
<br />

<br />
After you go back to Hwal he tells you about a family curse. Get a group and go out to Vhalen Tower (-1300, +38, +45) in Antonica. Hwal's grandfather is in a instanced dungeon that you get into by clicking the a piece of rubble on the floor. 
<br />

<br />
Kill his grandfather and reutrn to Hwal. He then sends you to get pieces for his new boots. You need to collect the following items from the Thundering Steppes: 
<br />

<br />
- Leather from a Mature Antelope 
<br />
- Ore from a Firerock Scout 
<br />

<br />
Give these items to Minty Frostbeard at Thundermist Vilalge in the Thundering Steppes. She will tell you she needs time and to come back in 72 minutes. So go do something else for that time and then come back. She will give you the boots for Hwal. 
<br />

The Stein of Mogguk 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
This quest is given by Rumdum in the pub at the East Freeport docks (-234, -55, +. It is the quest for the Stein of Moggok. Keep buying him drinks and he'll keep telling the tale (we need confirmation on the exact level at which this quest is given, but we believe it is level 3. 
<br />

<br />
You must collect the four pieces of the Stein of Moggok. These can be found on the Bouncers in the Feerrott. These are all four rare spawns: 
<br />

<br />
Left Half - 
<br />
Right Half - 
<br />
Handle - 
<br />
Lid - 
<br />
