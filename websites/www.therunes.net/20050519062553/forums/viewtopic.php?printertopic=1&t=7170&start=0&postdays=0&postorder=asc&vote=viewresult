<span class="postbody">Greetings Enchanters et al,
<br />

<br />
         With so much negativity coming from all over about the downfall of EQ, Sony's shortcomings, WoW, EQ2 etc, I just wanted to express my feelings about EQ within the last 2 months. My hope is that the WOWers etc can keep their negativity and flames away. This is a POSITIVE post about why lately, EQ has been FUN!
<br />

<br />
        My guild suffered horribly from the player exodus. At first I was very dissappointed and saddened by this. All but a few of my guildies were gone, and many of my friends as well. I wondered if EQ would survive. GOD had left a horrible taste in my mouth and because of it I was skeptical about OoW.
<br />

<br />
        But I've found something ... different. Because my guild groups aren't here any more, I've been doing tons of pickup groups. You find the good players, and you find the BAD players. When you find the good players, you rememebr them, add the to friends and group with them again. And even when you find the bad, it's kinda amusing and a challenge. To hope that idiot doesn't wipe the group. My friends list has grown by leaps and bounds recently, and I've made more friends within the past few months than ever before, when mainly my guildies were my groupmates. For the first time in a long time, I've gotten that old feeling back. Meeting new people, exploring new places, and even the old world zones are fun, as I've been taking my new-found friends into some older fun places. If I need help with a mob, or they need help, we ask each other. There are so many people I've talked to that also are having more fun than ever. It seems that the player exodus left those of us who love the game. And it is showing. There is still plenty RIGHT with EQ. I am not bitter. I see the need for some changes, but the game is still very enjoyable. And yes, I am actually enjoying OoW. Even GoD is growing on me. (like a fungus me thinks).
<br />

<br />
     Possibly completely unrelated, but I've also noticed GM events are at an all time high. Within the last couple of months I've seen about a half dozen to a dozen GM events on my server alone. Some are small (GM's turning people into faeries, handing out cookies, Trivia etc) and some are quite interesting (a Gnome celebration in Steamfont, the Faydark Protector, class battles in the arena).
<br />

<br />
     I will say as a disclaimer that I am not a high end gamer. I do not raid, and I charm alot, but not in OoW. The OoW charm nerf I agree is extreme, but it is not a deal breaker. I agree something had to be done, they just could have smarter about it.
<br />

<br />
    So, those are my feelings. I do not *hate* on WoW or EQ2. So please don't hate on my love for EQ. I actually played EQ2 for a while when it first came out. It was fun, but I quickly lost interest. There is something missing, just not sure what it is. As for WoW, I haven't played but it must be a good game to draw so many players. Whether or not they stay in WoW or EQ2 remains to be seen. WoW just isn't for me (story/lore wise). EQ fits me perfectly and I'll continue to play because I am having fun. Thank you all for listening. I'd love to hear from others who are feeling the same way I am.
<br />

<span class="postbody">Yeah, pickup groups were awesome =P
<br />

<br />
I had a wack ass schedule for the longest time, so I always ended up grouping with a bunch of Koreans from one of hte uberguilds on my server.  They spoke english (barely) so I'd ask them stupid questions, like how to say "%t is mezzed" in Korean.  Sure enough, I make my hotkey - used it and they all started cracking up.  Seems they told me "%t I just shit in jello" rather than "%t is mezzed" =P
<br />

<br />
Anyway, probably one of my fondest pickup group experiences - were always with some foreigners =P  I'm not above being the butt of their jokes hehe.
<br />

<br />
In the end, I can safely say that I had more friends out of my guild - than in the guild.  I enjoyed high end raiding, but the people I met on those late nights where we'd just goof off, or challenge ourselves with single group Fear/Hate pre PoP - were the most fun times I ever had =P
<br />

<br />
So yeah, no hate.  Chances are (I might be wrong) you never played during the "golden age" of an enchanter.  If I didn't play back in the old school days, I wouldn't miss it so much to where I think the current state sucks so bad.
<br />

<br />
But it does, so I'm out =)
<br />

<br />
Anyway, glad you're having fun!

   And I've played since Kunark came out, just before velious. I didn't start an enchanter until Luclin though. So it's *sorta* in the Golden Age.

Like Culb, I'm sincerely happy that you still enjoy EQ.  It really is still a great game, and even us naysayers can't refute that.  What happened in the high end though, was just too much for a lot of us to deal with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

glad to hear GM events are on the rise and they seem to be paying a little more attention to you all.

but after playing EQ for 3+ years and switchinh to WOW i can see why the mass desertion = WOW is an over all great game (short of a little lack of info)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I am happy for you.  You need to have fun when playing a game.  Those of us who created our enchanters pre Kunark and grew up with a different skill set (reverse kiting with fear, chain stunning, AE mezzes and charm), the game is no longer the same.  EQ has basically changed toward more of a one super mob rather than lots of mobs at the same time.  As many people like pvp (personally I dont), many like the new format.  The game has lost its fun factor for me unfortunately.
<br />

<br />
Just as the people who are no longer having fun and therefor have quit, shouldnt try to talk the people who still enjoy the game to quit, the people who are having fun shouldnt criticize the people that have left...it just isnt fun anymore for some of us.  The game has changed.

<span class="postbody">Having started my enchanter as an alt during Velious, and having really enjoyed her throughout Kunark and the "Old World", I can say that I really never enjoyed the "Golden Age of Enchanters".  During that time, I was trudging through playing my shaman (who still bores me).  But I do remember playing a chanter while going down Chardok, and I do remember Sebilis, and being in Kael, utilizing charm as crowd control.
<br />

<br />
I still play EQ, and I still really enjoy it.  As recently as 6 months ago, I joined a raiding guild, and I am getting to know how much fun it is to raid places like Time.  Of course, being an enchanter on raids like these is more like being a buff bitch, and the only parts of Time I can mez in are tiers 1 and 2.  I guess I still play for the camaraderie.  My friends are still on the game.  It would be very nice to see enchanters be needed again for more than "C6/haste plz".  I do have hope for DoN, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I'm on the Stromm server and our guild is allied with 3 others with a common chat channel. We can get a pick-up raid going on very short notice and there's almost always a group looking for more, and since it's allies, you're always with the devils you know <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

Recently I have spoken with 2 people who are now bored with Wow and are coming back to EQ for raiding and exploring, and I've seen several messages posted saying the same thing: bored with EQ2 and WoW and coming back "home".
<br />

<br />
Stromm population is increasing from the hit it took late last year and not just from transfers or people returning, there are genuine newbies incoming still, not boatloads of 'em granted, but new players all the same.
<br />

<br />
Not having tried either WoW or EQ2 I'm in no position to give an opinion on them, but I'm not bored with EQ and am not looking for another game to pique my interest so any talk of the relative merits of WoW or EQ2 is irrelevant.
<br />

<br />
P.S. and why the bleep can I post here and not on some other message boards? grrr blasted work security settings grrrr.
<br />

<br />
P.P.S.  It's mildly amusing to see the WoW boosters take time out from their playing to hit EQ message boards, for me their squirming is an added bonus to an enjoyable game <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

I loved playing.. I spent alot of time doing so.  you don't do that unless you are having fun.  I don't regret any of the time I played.

in the end I saw that I was logging on because the raid organizations needed me and for my friends in my guild.  I wasn't logging on because the class was great.  I saw what sony was doing and decided it wasn't for me.  its not that I never 'truely loved the game,' its that what I played when I started was turned into something I didn't want.  (and I wasn't even around as long as alot of the others)

so next time you want to act pretentious toward those who quit.. you might want to remember who you are talking about, and that just maybe we have been through a little more than you with our class?  Maybe you didn't mean to be so negative in what you said and im just reading to much into it, but I don't like being trivialized.  
<br />

if you are having fun.. great! have fun.  im certainly not going to try and talk you out of it.. why would I?  but I don't wanna be told why I quit.  I don't need to be held up to whatever justification you think is necessary.  I know why I do what I do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
