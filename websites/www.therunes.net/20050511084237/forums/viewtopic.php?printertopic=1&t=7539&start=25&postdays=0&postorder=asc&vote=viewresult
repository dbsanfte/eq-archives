<tr><td class="printline">
<span class="postbody">The point isn't that Enraged/Ireblind can or cannot be handled.  We all know it can.  I'm even touched by enough arrogance to believe my guild can take them down.  The point is that it's a zone with a level limit of 46 which is largely comprised of mobs designed in the original game.  It has drops that most of us wouldn't even consider good enough to carry back for tribute, the stuff isn't even as good as drops in zones of similar level that were designed AFTER the original game.  BUT it has drops that are necessary for some quests that have a high incentive rate to attempt: epics.  Further, the drops for some of those epics are so rare as to require many trips back to the zone.
<br />

<br />
Now, we have a zone that certain classes are highly incented to go to, with one single mob designed such that I'm certain no raid of 12 groups of 46th level characters can take down... not AND in that zone.  Give me the mob, or give me the zone, and the raid of 46s can do it, but, put both of them together, and I don't think it's possible.
<br />

<br />
Thus, we end up with a zone that requires a much higher level, much better prepared to boot, raid force to go and get.... sub par gear.  I know I'm exaggerating but it's a bit like forcing a time geared guild to go raid Fear... the ONLY thing in that zone that causes this problem is the Ireblind Imp.
<br />

<br />
The problem is:
<br />

<br />
1) Assume they make the Ireblind Imp non-Aggro.  Now he's trivial to kill.
<br />
2) Assume they make the Enraged/Ireblind mezzable.  Now he's trivial.
<br />
3) Assume they move him away from all the other critters in zone.  Now he's trivial.
<br />

<br />
On the one hand, he really breaks the zone and makes the risk vs reward just not worth it, on the other hand, I don't see an easy way to fix the problem.  The enraged, oddly, it a step in the right direction, but, they need to make the spawn rate of the Enraged more rare.  I've heard of groups facing three Enraged/Ireblinds in a night... and as pointed out, given that some of the drops are on mobs that only wpawn once a week, and are rare drops on top of that, this is going a bit far.  Personally, I think the Ireblind needs to be about as rare as the Golemns random 7 day timer or sume such.
<br />

<br />
I LIKE a challenge, I don't like beating my head against a brick wall just to see if I can draw blood.  I KNOW the blood is in there and don't really care for the headache.  The combination of Fear with the Ireblind IS a brick wall unless you go in espressly loking to take down the Ireblind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Three perfect examples:
<br />

<br />
Plane of Innovation - Controlling Niltram Anizok during the walk for the to Xanamech Nezmirthafen
<br />

<br />
Plane of Nightmare - Controlling Thelin Poxbourne during the hedge walk to A Construct of Nightmares
<br />

<br />
Iceclad Ocean - Controlling General Bragmur during the 8th Coldain Shawl Walk
<br />

<br />
All three events are greatly eased by having an enchanter control the movements of the quest mob before and during any engagement using Mezz and Blur.
<br />

<br />
Normal practice to check whether a blur has taken is to con the controlled mob - if it is still kos it's still pissed at you - if it's back at indifferent then the blur took.
<br />

<br />
Nadia is quite correct in that it's not really KOS at all just still angry with you for mezzing it but the effect on the con status is the same - any mob that is indifferent will change con if agro'd and then will change back to indif if blurred.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Fine. Do it with ALL the epic mobs in Fear then. At least then you could gather the guild, and have a decent chance on doing a run on epics parts, instead of the guessing game that it is now.
<br />
When I left EQ, this was one of the factors, as all I needed to finish my epic was the shissar, yet couldnt get my guild to go in as we were a casual guild that wasnt sure we could handle the imp. So, I am sitting with a bag full of parts for epic ONE at lvl 61. 
<br />
Now had we been sure that yeah, we can get several epic pieces, then I am sure we would have called in other friends and such to take down the zone. With the crap shoot it is now, ppffttt... why bother??
<br />
As for the imp being trivial, guess what?? Many of the other epic mobs for epic one are trivial, so why make this one so much different?
<br />
And I loved Fear.. loved it.. It was my favorite zone ever. I mean you are talking about a zone that had the uber guilds in awe for a while. It was a zone that you sweated getting into back in the day. It was a zone that forced cooperation, because if things went bad, you were ALL screwed.

<span class="postbody">Me and about 20 friends went to fear pre OoW for the shissar; and we wiped (I was only lvl 47 and eager for my epic). We wiped fairly due to my level and poor planning; my first raid so no problem.
<br />
Since then I have been in several raids and am now 52 when I next went in, we were prepared, the plan was good, and I was much better at grps (being a nearly solo 1-50 chanter). We all moved to the succor point withing the zone nvis grp by grp and ended with 2 mobs (which i charmed onto one another while the raid organised). 
<br />
Then the puller brought back 2 fetid fiends and the ireblind; instantly i threw out my aoe which was resisted by the ireblind. A direct mez had the same effect as did charm for a blue con mob; I called the tank to switch target and mezzed the half dead fiend while they destroyed the imp then that dammed enraged spawned. 
<br />
For a 46-55 zone the enraged wasn't touchable by anything. It's aoe brought nmore adds than i can count and i died in seconds. Thankfully i have DoN. 
<br />
Which Dev decided lets put an uber mob in fear and make it nearly impossible for anyone to get there epic drop without a team of 65s plus to kill it needs therapy. put it in an instanced fear or something.

My epic is on hold now and i can't see me doing it pre 65...Grrrrr</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Maybe you should try not killing the enraged, since it's not aggro?  Clear junk around it, but leave it alone.  you may need to do some strategic blurring or pacifying, but come on.  It's one mob in the whole freaking zone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

There is no reason I can't collect most of the components to a quest before starting it is there? (I solo'd the arch magus at 44; just because I can't hand the robe in doesn't mean I can't put it in my bank for when I do need it.)

And is the enraged non-aggro? That will help alot if it's the case; I do remember trying to mez/blur it and failing though; I'll have to go back soon to take down the shissar then.

Seems like the spawned enraged must of been hit unintentially (or I instinctively did the new mob must mez thing and got aggro).

Can the Enraged be Pacified to avoid him joining in the fun? (Though I do note that he is level 60, so you'd need to use Pacification or uh... Wake of Tranquility to pacify him.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Basically, since we figured out he was glued to his spawn point and assist agro we have very loudly told our raid members that when he spawns I will spam the raid with a move message and they are to all move south/east along the wall to me immediately.  If pet engages the enraged and they don't have pet hold, they kill their pets.  No exceptions.
<br />

<br />
That worked for us with Gnarl blurring him after if he already had assisted.  Think he popped twice on one raid, and once on another.
<br />

<br />
But as Gnarl said, having Cazic-Thule, Dread, Fear and the Dracholich litterly within 5 feet of each other from pathing just sucks.  With no monks to help, we had to set up tiered suicide DT pulls to split.  Rez, rinse, repeat until we've done it.  Icky nasty for a small family guild...

The paci/blur "mez" trick is fabulous actually.  It works really nicely on all sorts of unmezzable content.  I first used it for splitting two named in ToV when we didn't have a feign class and had no way to get Line of Sight for straight up pacify, but it can be used in just about any situation where you have a mob that can be pacified (not placated though. Placate doesn't do the job.) but not mezzed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
