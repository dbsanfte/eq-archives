<span class="postbody">Cool.  I remember when that game was out.  First real job I ever had was at a game distribution warehouse and they had tons of the MERP stuff from ICE.  Of course, back then, the only Tolkien I knew of was the cartoon version of The Hobbit.  I came into his work later and have grown to love it immensely.
<br />

<br />
I'll have to check some Half-Price stores and gaming cons and pick up some of those books cheap.  Even if approved by Tolkien, I'd never really consider them factual lore, but I'd love to read others ideas.  There's probably a lot of interesting stories and theories in those gaming books.

<span class="postbody">You can also contact them via email. They are a damn cool group of people. It is basically a group of gamers that started a company selling games. 
<br />
The downside is that.. well.. it is a bunch of gamers that are running a company, so some of their business decisions, while ultimately cool for a gamer, were a big hard on the bottomline (Thus, their earlier dissolution).
<br />
But it is cool to read some of the "background" they fleshed out in ME. And they put some serious thought into a lot of the creatures, as well as more background info on some of the areas, IE Mount Gundabad, Mirkwood/Greenwood, Lake-town, etc.
<br />

<br />
But ultimately, back to the point, if you have the time, read the books. They are the basis of most of the fantasy worlds you see out nowadays, and then take into account everything he did (He invented elven, orcish, etc as full fledged languages, both written & spoken) at a time when there wasn't the background info out there to pick up and use as a basis.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

This is not strictly true;  There was and is an enormous amount of source material for the good Professor to draw on, and anyone as well read in the appropriate material as he was (probably an absurdly rare thing <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" /> ) can pick up on a lot of it.  Even a comparative tyro like myself can pick up a few bits and bobs here and there.
<br />

<br />
First and foremost, Tolkien leaned pretty heavily on "old english" mythology - beowulf and the like - and various scandinavian 'lore' as well. Icelandic sagas and all manner of things.  Dwarves and Rings of power are highly Norse, and there are some fairly obvious paralells there (and some fairly obvious differences).  The Rohirrim are basically a slightly stylized scandinavian culture with horses instead of boats.    They even speak Old English.  The name "Gandalf" is fairly shamelessly pilfered from some norse Edda or other, as are the names of many of the dwarves in The Hobbit.   Barrow wights are also somewhat borrowed from somewhere, if I recall correctly.    One of the elvish languages (Qenya, I think) is modelled heavily on Finnish because Tolkien really liked the way that language sounded.  Oh, and the dwarven runes he uses are historical in some fashion as well.  And we mustn't forget all the various Christian underpinnings either.
<br />

<br />
Now this isn't to say that there isn't a great deal of originality in Tolkien's works - because there is.  The Elves are a far cry from the 'gnomes' from which they originally sprang, and the dwarves aren't really much of a match for the Norse ones either, in anything but perhaps stature and skill in craftsmanship (Whatever any Dark Age of Camelot players might think. The dwarves in Midgard in that game are basically Tolkien dwarves transplanted into a vaguely Nordic environment.)  being stout and steadfast rather than cowardly and prone to trouble.   Hobbits and Ringwraiths and Numenor and Gondor, and the machinations of Saruman and so many other things are all just sortof spun from a sort of mythological "primordial soup" inside Tolkien's brain and so, while you can point to bits and pieces of them in all manner of sources,  the fact of the matter is that no other author I've encountered has worked such a complete world from the 'collective unconscious' as it were.  Possibly they -can't- because Tolkien irreversably solidified so much of it that so many of us just instantly 'know' what a dwarf or an elf is.  Even if it's not Tolkie's original vision (Everquest Elves are a pale shadow of Tolkien's, both in stature and realization.)  
<br />

<br />
There are hints of nearly everything from Northern and Western European myth woven into LotR, because it was all in brain of the man who wrote it, but even so, there's far less 'derivative' material there than even in most of today's more 'original' fantasy novels.   He started building a level "down" in our knowledge - many, many people have been exposed to some tiny scraps of the background material he used, whether from relatives, or fairy tales, or other stories, or just having been forced to read Beowulf in high school... and so LotR "rings true" if you'll pardon the pun.  It fits in with things we "know" even if (and perhaps more strongly for the fact that) we've mostly forgotten them.
<br />

<br />
That, and there's just so bloody much of it.  I can state with reasonable confidence that -no- other author I've ever encountered or even heard tell of has developed the -lore- that underlies Lord of the Rings.   They can't.   They're career authors.   If they spend more than a few years on a book, the fans drift off and the publisher gets all antsy.   Tolkien just kindof...wrote what he did.  And it took him DECADES.  And he never considered it finished.   That's a mindset you just don't find today.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
The following is a email conversation between my cousin and I about the let down that was LOTR ROTK EXT ED.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">Red is my cousin </span><span style="color: blue">Blue is me</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">Watch anymore Return of the Kizzle?</span>
<br />

<br />
 <span style="color: blue">nah, lost my motivation LOL j/k... I was hyped for that Gandalf scene but oh well... maybe sometime this weekend.... </span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">C’mon it can’t be that bad. </span>
<br />

<br />
 <span style="color: blue">In the book does Gandalf cry like a little girl?</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">No in the book he bowes up like he’s gonna open a can.  Gandalf’s powers should surpass the Witch Kings because Gandalf was a Maiar (sp?) a being created to help the Valar and not of the race of men.  He was also equipped with the third ring of power given to the Elves.  The Witch King also had a ring of power but he was just a fallen man. </span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: blue">RETARDED... How does Gandalf get owned so bad by the witch king but a hobbit and a woman can kill him? Gandalf's powers were in the ring correct? but he had to keep it hidden? I would think the potential end of mankind would be a good enough reason to reveal it... Unless he wasn't allowed to use his powers to help man kind??? Only the Valar?
<br />

<br />
 
<br />

<br />
P.S. what is the Valar</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">No Gandalf had extensive power on his own, and was further empowered by the ring.  I don’t know why it was kept a secret, in fact it was only revealed that he had the third ring in the Appendices.  The Valar are all like spirit beings, I think of them as angels almost. Their story is told in the Silmarillion.  They used to be best buds with the Elves, in fact the Elves were sort of like their children.  And now all of the elves are leaving middle earth (think Arwen leaving for the boats, and the boats at the end of the movie) and sailing across the sea to Valinor, the city of the Valar, to live forever. </span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: blue">extensive powers? Ohhhhh look at me big scary flying dragon things I'll ride out to meet you and scare you away with my big white glow stick....</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">Lol yea some things in the movie just don’t add up regarding him. Like you said how did he defeat them so easy and then struggle later? In the first book he used his magic to lock the door behind them in Moria when they were fleeing to the bridge.</span>
<br />

<span class="postbody">I was kindof disappointed in the net effect of that scene, but pleased by the use of the Witch King's Genuine Tolkien Lines.
<br />

<br />
In fact, overall, I was a little disappointed in the overall value of the new scenes in the extended edition overall.  Here's my blow by blow of the scenes I remember as being new (Since I don't have my DVD in front of me =P )
<br />

<br />
#1: The Demise of Sauruman - this scene actually worked really well.  A high density of GTLs on the part of both Saruman and Theoden provides some of the best dialogue in the film.  The unfolding of the events, while different from the book, captures the spirit pretty well.  Two thumbs up.
<br />

<br />
#2: Drinking contest between Legolas and Gimli.  Uh. Humorous, but doesn't really add anything.  Could've stayed gone, IMHO.  Gimli gets little enough respect as it is.  One Thumb down.
<br />

<br />
#3: Merry swears fealty to king Theoden - pretty good scene, though somehow didn't have the impact I expected. Seemed like a bit of a footnote. One thumb up.
<br />

<br />
#4: Pippin meets Faramir in Minas Tirith.  Heartwarming good character building moment.  Maybe a little slow, but I was glad to see it.  One thumb up.
<br />

<br />
#5: Eomer questions Merry's resolve to Eowyn.  Eh.  Not super compelling, but I liked that Eomer got to have a little more face time.  He and Theoden are the two characters from TTT/RotK that I felt were severely underutilized.   No thumbs either way.
<br />

<br />
#6: Gate of Minas Tirith resists sissy orcish battering ram.  Good scene.   Builds up the strength of the Minas Tirith a bit in the eyes on the audience so it doesn't seem so easy.  Makes Grond's later appearance more impressive.  One thumb up.
<br />

<br />
#7: Extended Paths of the Dead w/ghosty hands and skull-a-lanche.  What is this CRAP?  I'm glad to see someone reigned in Peter Jackson's bad horror movie instincts and got this stuff cut from the theatrical, but I wish they'd held out and kept it out of the extended too. (Exception: Legolas quoting the prophecy of the dead on the way to the door really worked nicely.  The sequence only goes down the toilet after they go inside.)  Two Thumbs down.
<br />

<br />
#8: Army of the Dead vs the Corsairs of Umbar - not bad. Explains WTF Aragorn and company were doing on the boats, though diminishes the already weak surprise of the Army of the Dead saving the day at Minas Tirith.  Probably could have stayed gone.  One Thumb down.
<br />

<br />
#9: Eowyn vs Gothmog (aka "Puffy Bloated Orc").  Unnecessary at best.   Especially since it's Aragorn, who, of everyone in the film, is the one who -least- needs to prove his badassness, who eventually gets the kill shot. (Though Kudos to Gimli for getting a good lick in.);  Would much rather Gothy had be axed by Eomer or Theoden, neither of who get to do much of anything really heroic. (Okay, Eomer dispatches the first Mumakil with his giant elephant collision trick, but still.)  I was annoyed by this scene.  One Thumb down.
<br />

<br />
#10: Gandalf vs The Witch King.  Makes Gandalf look kinda lame, really.  Good Tolkien lines on the part of the Witch King, but would much rather this scene had gone closer to the book.  Being generous her and giving this scene no thumbs. =P
<br />

<br />
#11: Houses of Healing.  Good scene. Nicely done.  Two thumbs up.
<br />

<br />
#12: Aragorn challenges Sauron in the Palantir.  Good idea, very questionable implementation (Rather like the Witch King vs Gandalf scene).  I remain totally confused about WTF happens with the Evenstar pendant, since it seems like Aragorn drops it, but he wasn't actually -holding- it as far as I can tell, having the Palantir in one hand and Anduril in the other.   Would have worked better closer to the book.  One thumb down.
<br />

<br />
#13: The Mouth of Sauron. Kinda freaky looking, but doesn't really -work- as a scene.  Having Aragorn decapitate him at the end was a bad decision too. One thumb down.
<br />

<br />
Total thumbs: 7 up, 7 down.  That's not a good wash for an extended cut.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
