So drop your best/worst "I killed everyone in the damn raid cause of... " story down in here.. If we get enough going we'll see if Juwel can set up some sort of vote/winnowing process and I'll buy something for the winner from the Runes shop.

<span class="postbody">roflol, good topic...
<br />

<br />
I remember my first trip to Plane of Air, back before it was Plane of Sky...
<br />

<br />
We went up to do whatever, no idea.  I was around 54th level, this was before C3 and 60th was the top level still.
<br />

<br />
We get up there, set up, buy keys and all that.  I was entranced!  I had never been to this before and it was amazing to me.
<br />

<br />
We went to another island (NO idea which island) and there were mobs we had to kill for keys here.  We got a lot of mobs (Flying things I think?), I was having resists and there were only 2 of us enchanters here.  Well I got one on me and what would I do?  That's right, noob that I was, I cast one of my AE stuns...
<br />

<br />
Well the amount of fecal matter hitting the fan SO fast just caused my jaw to drop.  I had never heard that AEing in PoAir was a HUGE no no...
<br />

<br />
Things and nameds I'd never heard of suddenly were there.  There was a few people afk, I remember that.  Just one group of us were killing some key mobs while others were getting ready to continue onward.
<br />

<br />
About 10 people were VERY confused when they came back from AFK to find themselves naked and at their bind point.  And I didn't even know it was me that had caused it til the guildleader came back and asked what happened...  
<br />

<br />
No one escaped that massacre.  One monk or SK or something had been FD while afk but apparently something that showed up AE'd and stood him up.  It was the craziest carnage I ever heard of.  I say heard of because I died after seen the sky turn black from all the mobs that came after lil' ol' me.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
They laughed but I was SO upset.  I swore never to go back to Plane of Air (Sky now of course) but later I amended that to be 'with a raid' cause I went and got my epic part once since, but except for that I didn't go back again until last week, and then I dememmed all my AE effect spells before going up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Setting: Chardock
<br />
Time: late days of Velious
<br />
Raid force: 4 full groups from my family guild
<br />
Level range of the raid: 45-49
<br />

<br />
How did I kill the raid?  I did nothing, literally!
<br />

<br />
Now that the background of the story is set and people have an idea where it happened, the type of gear, etc. I can proceed.  It was our first time coming to Chardok.  We had already been to places like Droga and Kaesora and wanted to try one of the big zones.  
<br />

<br />
The guild gathered at the entrance and zoned in.  We buffed up and started to pull the mobs in the hallway, working our way down to the fort where we planned to set up camp and experience one of the high end zones.  We crawled down the hall and pulled the front of the fort.  We moved to the wall at the fort and settled in.
<br />

<br />
Everything was going well and we were pulling from inside the fort.  I would mezz any adds and our MT did a great job holding agro.  Let me go into the raid make up just a little more here.  I was the only chanter and we had only 1 cleric.  There were 2 druids and I think a shaman for healers in the other groups.  Our MT was an iksar SK and the SA was another iksar SK.  Everyone else was there for damage of some kind (wizzy, necro, rogue, ranger, monk... each represented).  My group had the cleric, MT, monk (puller) and 2 others in it.  We didn't have any way of being the xp group and we knew it.  We were there to learn about the zone.  This is when some people started to complain that they weren't getting any experience.  
<br />

<br />
The SA was the guildleader and he said fine, we'll break into 2 pull teams and have 2 mini-raids going at the same time in the same spot.  Cleric called he would have trouble healing this.  I called I would have trouble controling this.  People were chiming in they liked the idea and were in favor of it and so they were going to do it.  I piped up that if they pull like this I wouldn't be casting anything except maybe gate.  (Remember the setting... inexperienced raiders, kinda low level for the zone, not the best gear.)
<br />

<br />
Against my protest they decided to go ahead.  Maybe they didn't believe me, maybe they were trying to test us, maybe they were just stupid.  I sat down at the wall in the center of the area and memmed gate.  The first pull for my group and our partner group was a single.  The other group also managed a single.
<br />

<br />
RESPAWN to the right (the tunnel up to the zone in).  It agros and people begin called "add," "mezz," etc.  I stayed sitting where I was.  RESPAWN at the front of the fort.  It also agros and people start dying.  The SK in my group says in group, "well if you are going to gate do it now."
<br />

<br />
I'm still sitting there.
<br />

<br />
People in my group start dying.  I stand up and look around.  I see 5 mobs in the camp and 3 people standing... me, the SK MT, and the cleric.  The cleric gets agroed and killed.  The MT starts going down really fast.  I begin casting gate.  MT dies, my gate goes off.
<br />

<br />
LOADING PLEASE WAIT....
<br />
Welcome to Firona Vie!
<br />

<br />
Everyone is bitching and asking wtf happened in /gu
<br />
I responded in /gu.  "See what happens when you don't listen to the chanter."  In group the MT asked if I purposely waited to gate till everyone was dead.  "Yes, a point had to be made and people don't seem to want to listen and learn the easy way."  He responded that that was cruel, but the point was made, at least to him.
<br />

<br />
I headed back and helped with the CR, dragging the bodies up to the zone in.  There were alot of hurt feelings in the guild that night.  There were also a lot of looks when I zoned in to Chardok fully dressed.  Funny thing was, throughout the entire fight while everyone was getting killed I didn't take a single hit.  The next night, the guild leader offered me a spot as an officer which I took.  I don't think I ever had a problem with any of the people that were there that night ever not listening to me again.  A few followed me to the other guilds that I joined (until I decided to join AV, since it is a raiding guild).
<br />

<br />
Was it cruel to do this?  Maybe a bit.  Did it get the point across?  Definately.  Would I do it again?  I don't know.  I hope at this point that the people I play with know the game and our abilities well enough that I wouldn't have to.  Ok, so it wasn't the ENTIRE raid since I made it out without a scratch.  But I think that should count for extra credit since it is even harder to do <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I was in CT (the new one, mind you) with some guildmates of mine getting ready to do some ring events.

Well, seeing as how fish can't come on to the land, I took a step back.  Woohoo, I was safe!  Boy, was I ever wrong.

I had everything planned out, I had 4 full groups (max). Had the Stone marker groups set, and a roamer group to help. I was SET.

<br />
We zone in, and I send everyone to their designated spots (my group took the closest marker to the port in spot)
<br />

<br />
I am there waiting for the first spawn, when the 2nd marker group starts hollaring for help. (I shoulda clued in at this point..but...) So I dispatch the roamer group to assist. Roamer group starts yelling for help, yet, still, no spawns at my marker. I am really confused at this point, but send a pair from my group to help. When they died...I finally went to investigate...and found the problem.
<br />

<br />
I TOTALLY forgot about the 2 horse spawns that need to be killed before maning the grave markers. They surprised the 2nd group, and had them dead before the roamer group could arrive. They were suprised as well...and, well...things went downhill from there.

When I died (one of the last 3 to go), the grave markers were just starting to spawn.

<br />

<br />
About 2 weeks ago my guild had 2 groups in fear to kill the shissar and some other stuff.  We were bored and I was pulling.  It was easy and fast.  We killed shissar and trash mobs and golems were still up.  There were 2 enchanters me and the one bout to finish her epic.  I asked her in raid if she could handle a big pull, mind you i was pulling 8 or so mobs at a time before.  She says yea I proceed to load up 3 color stuns and follow the wall around the whole zone stopping and casting.  Turns out I trained about 40 mobs onto the raid, with no golems aggroed but all the mobs around them chasing me.  I get to the party laugh and them and say have a good day and I go down in a flurry of horses, imps, amys, pumpkins and everything else you can think of.  I killed every good, thats what they get for making fun of my pulling.
<br />

<br />
On the other side though, how many time have you been the only survivor of a wipe.  This happens to me almost anytime we wipe on raid mobs, if I see a wipe inc and all the tanks are down and so and so is beating the hell out of everyone else, I sit mem memblur and back up and cast away.  I like to sit there while they rest of the guild fights back fun to berate them, and told them they need to invest in some rezz sticks for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I have my Memblur stick hotkeyed so I don't have to sit and mem.  I often outlive raid wipes and wait around for the rest of the raid to get back.  Makes being an enchanter fun to outlive everyone, specially those who talk about how 'wimpy' we are.

Last night on a raid a rogue says 'Sorry about using escape and getting your druid bot killed. /snicker'

<span class="postbody">I actually have two short stories but some background first to set up how stupid and silly this was.  I have been the main (and only somtimes) raid leader for my guild since it's creation over 2 years ago.  I am a level 63 chanter and have been playing since mid-Kunark days (started off as a paladin).  Funny part is I hardly ever go on other folks raids but both raid wipes caused by me were other folks' raids LOL.
<br />

<br />
Story One:
<br />
A freind of mine sends me a tell.  Wants me to come to Kithicor to do a rogue's general fight.  They have no enchanter.  I am realy tired and want to log so I try to beg out of it.  He lays the guild on real think, they have several rogues lined up for the raid and all the elements to get it done they just need a chanter.  Fine, I say, I'll come and buff the entire raid, all 5 groups, but I won't stay for the raid. Woot great come on down!
<br />

<br />
I forget where I was coming from, but I don remember I zoned in from HHK side.  I have been onmany general raids but never actually saw the cabin where the DE are.  SO I am running around with ITU up and asking him WTH to go.  He gives me loc, so I am running around in circles, as usual, lost and I see someone's leaves (druid epic) way off in the distance running by.  So I head towards that and I see the raid shortly thereafter.  What I saw was an invised druid, level 65 that was going to be helping with the pull and was running the path.  What I didn;t see was I ran right by the cabin.......with ITU on, not invis itself.  So I see:
<br />
Me happily, Hi guys! Want some buffs?
<br />
Person1 says, Holy mother of....
<br />
Soon-to-be-dead-guy, OMFG what did you do?!?!?!
<br />
Turn around and see the whole cabin plus assorted undead swarming the raid party, who is yet unbuffed with at least half AFK waiting for me to arrive.  
<br />
You have been slain by your own stupidity!!!!
<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT........
<br />
You tell soon-to-be-ex-freind, "um please tell me I did NOT just wipe the entire raid plarty?"
<br />
Now-ex-friend tells you, "I can but then I would lying."
<br />

<br />
Story Two:
<br />
Sitting byt the dock of the bay wasting time......Someone says in guild chat their freind's guild wiped in Fear.  I and others express sympathy.  Person sends me a tell telling me they can really use some help.  I get more details, they aprently wiped and have determined they cannot recover.  I look at who is online in my guild....great 15 people, only one of which has ever seen Fear and only about 9 I can trust to do a  Fear break in.  So I send a tell to the raid leader asking if they need assistance, she is almost crying at this point I can tell.  We had a Fear wipe once that was unrecoverable I know how tough it can be.  So I get all agressive and start rounding up good folks.  Get two good strong groups.  RL cannot even begin to tell me how many mobs they killed so I have some idea of what to expect.
<br />

<br />
I'll try to make the next part short.  aprently it was a very disorganized raid.  Several people took it upon themselves to ask freinds to help. I got really short and start shouting becuase everyone was running back in, dying, people were getting buffs all slip shot and nothing was being organized.  I took charge, got two very strong groups together, got them buffed, told them what to do.  We zone in, clear safe spot, drag and rezz corpses.  Corpses were all over the zone.
<br />

<br />
After being pressed by my guild and seeing some were so depressed on thier guild over all the deaths (I counted 6 corpses for one person alone) I asked if she would like to make it a joint raid at which point she tells me she has no idea bout the zone and they are after nothing in particular except the shammy epic.  I ask her to help us with BG (he was up) and we would help them do whatever they wanted in the zone.  Agreed.
<br />
-1- She did not know how useful track is in there
<br />
-2- Most of their people did not know you ahve to kill one of the named golems to spawn shammy epic.
<br />
-3- Even with several trackers they had no idea only named that were up were BG and Shissar
<br />

<br />
So I take charge of the entire raid and desigante myself the puller (you can see where this is leading)  I often pull in Fear, I LOVE pulling in Fear and know how to clear what pretty quickly.  Anway, to make a long story short (I know, too late) we do BG for our wizzy and then move to do Shissar for their chanters.  (I already had my drop).  I explain I have never pulled the temple before.  The other two chanters from their guild seemed capable enough.  A 64 and a 58 chanter. I said, if I pull train are you guys going to be able to handle it? SURE!!! Okay lets see what I can do!
<br />

<br />
I don;t know how big it was but I heard it was pretty big.  Like the whole temple and according to some accounts, mobs even from others zones.  I doubt that but I was dead before I saw really any mobs.  Funny part was it was agro.  I didn't cast on aything.  I INTENDED to pacify what I could see and pull Shissar and hope for just a few adds.  I saw ONE guy running at me and in turn took him back to the raid.  Aprently he shouted FREE BEER to his freinds so they came as well.  Needless the say I heard the two chanters went down almost immedietly.  One pally camped out (from my guild he is smart pally) everyone else wiped, even the monks.  (this was the first I heard there was even a monk in the zone.  I asked why I was pulling the temple instead of him, he replied because he did not know the zone and therefore did not want to pull)
<br />

<br />
I bite my tongue and head back down.  I tell my RL hubby to log in and tell them to buff myself and druid to full.  Demand 6 times that everyone else stay out but one clicky stick cleric to be ready to run in at my command.  See, the Shissar was camping our corpses where I ahd parked them which was the NW corner, normally a safe spot.  She wouldn't move.  The necro even /q out to see if that would help.  it didn't he died. I explain I am going to attempt to mezz the Shissar and hold her until everyone is rezzed.  I needed druid (my hubby who is well sued to this short of thing) to heal me till I can get mezz to land.  I put up several mezzes going to rapture her then after tash do dazzle.
<br />

<br />
Demand for the 7th time no one do anything until I say to move.
<br />

<br />
I zone in.  Run up and see Shissar also see lost of live people running up with me.  Flip out in raid channel for the to stay the hell back, theya re not even invised.  Watch them agro wandering spiders and die.  Wait for spider to wander more head up see cleric just out of agro range, see the younger chanter just out of agro range.  See two monks FD at camp.  WTF were they not seding me reports and maybe THIS is why she is camping the corpses HELLO???????  And when did we get a  second monk???
<br />

<br />
&lt;finish banging head on keyboard&gt;
<br />

<br />

<br />
Oh look invis dropped on the chanter she is dying look cleric is dying now too and now a monk is trying to solo the Shissar how nice...oh YAY look at all the people zoning it I get so frustrated I BANG my mezz hotkey............
<br />
The blah blah Shissar has resisted your gimp DAZZLE spell.
<br />
&lt;to husband&gt;Oh s***t
<br />
&lt;from husband&gt; resisted?
<br />
&lt;to husband&gt; wrong spell
<br />
&lt;from hisband&gt; oh s***t
<br />
&lt;to husband&gt; HEAL!!!
<br />
&lt;from husband&gt; Honey, I am
<br />
&lt;to husband&gt; HEAL FASTER!!!
<br />
&lt;from husband&gt; honey, your dead
<br />
&lt;from husband&gt; and so am I
<br />

<br />
Now because of my stupidity and becuase no one lisented to me, raid was wiped second time.  (Not counting the wipes before I got there)
<br />

<br />
Out of the hundreds of raid only time my true mistakes cost deaths, but was ig time both times.  THought itmight be funny.  Sorry so long but I tend to babble.  Be well folks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Have a pally, cleric or necro DA and then pull shissar and the temple someplace and then stop and die. Shissar will stay at their corpse while the rest of the temple will wander back.

CC errors, charm errors, general I'm going to die! errors, missed runes (or, worse, casting an important rune only to realize you don't have any peridots), etc..

Fear

The guild was raiding Fear to drop one of the golems for the warrior epic and I was just getting into charming  - The other chanter had DC'd something and it was looking fun, so I look around and Charmed the next mob that was charging the camp, which just happened to be a Scarling --- I didn't know that they procced shadowstep until the golem went  <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">*POOF*</span></span> and the summons began. <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif" border="0" />

<span class="postbody">It was right after they changed the pet window so that it went away when you didn't have a pet up. I didn't know how to make it come back, and since the UI I was using at the time took over the pet window for my mez timer, I was summoning an animation to make the window come back so I could have a timer, anywhere that Mez was critical, I would put up a pet and forget about it.
<br />

<br />
So we're doing the Rallos Zek event, and we trigger the event. Now our start for this invloved tight positioning and alot of free time for the tank to get agro so that the mob didn't turn and get the healers with the AE. Everything is going smoothy till I hear the tank call " WTF is this PET DOING ON THE MOB"
<br />

<br />
I do get a "Taunting attacker master" and I start to go "oh shit".
<br />

<br />
Well the hall I had parked my pet down was of course, far from the raid but within the first AE cast and it hit the tank, and it hit my pet. Pet agroed, of course this put me on the hate list, mob turned 20 second later everyone was at their bind point and looking for blood. Needless to say I fessed up, opps, and we went at it again.
<br />

<br />
I think the embaressing part was when a mage said "just hit F1, the pet window comes back".

72 people all dead before we even get started, Grats to me on killing them all!!

A personal favorite of mine was when a rogue in the guilds all girl channel caught a "a bit of honey on the clit and nipples" flash over her screen, have her go "huh??" and the distraction led her directly through a number of mobs, which then agroed the raid and nearly wiped us in VT.

<span class="postbody">Ok tonight was the first time I ever wiped a raid....
<br />

<br />
     I was in PoV at the eastern wall in a group and we wipe because of a bad pull.  So everyone comes back into zone and the necro goes and tries to pull his corpse back.  Along the way he aggroes some undead who he promptly trains back to the graveyard and then dies.  So I'm running back with my corpse and all of a sudden I'm dead a second time.
<br />
So I zone back in take a look around, invis to undead, and go to the gy end... just before I get to south end the invis drops and undead aggro again.. only instead of the zone being empty a 12 man pickup raid for the SW just zoned in and is buffing... I veer to the right trying to zone or put some distance away from everyone but no luck and I go down for the 3rd time... Only this time the mobs turn and destroy the raid force.  So I zone back in too "/ooc NICE, /ooc YOURE THE GREATEST! " and a number of less nice remarks...So the cleric in my group rezzes everyone ... and the group pretty much disbands on mutual agreement that its just not our night.  The pickup raid however has 3 slots open up (not sure if dying ruined someones enthusiasm or what) so they invite the cleric from my PoV group and ME!  Turns out they have no slower.  So I wiped a raid that I wasn't in and then got invited into it and ended up killing the SW.  I didn't get any loot but it was a random roll and no one complained about the earlier train.  Sometimes you have to train to get a group !!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I was in PoNB running around underworld before they removed the false floor. Was messing around with Terris thules aggro and didn't relize I had a undead knight on me... Any ways, started running back to the raid, and unknowingly had that one mob on me... well the thing is underworld I can't see if mobs are following me and what not, also they can't hit me, so I didnt notice that one mob that was following had social aggro from every single mob in zone. got back to my guild popped up above world in time to get owned, and wipe the raid. 
<br />

<br />
Took me 5 seconds to figure out what happened, been doing that kind of thing for a while and have seen it before... So I sent a /tell to my GL and apologized.... Was mild verbal abuse but I was cracking up behind the monitor and I'm pretty sure he was too.
<br />

<br />
Also SoE finally fixed the collision system so running around underworld, through walls and all that good stuff is near to impossible now... what needs to be done now is so incredibly hard it's not worth the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Fake rallos down, AE TL done, everyone runs into pit and is prepping pets.
<br />

<br />
Rallos decides to join the party, total wipe. Many unhappy bunnies.
<br />

<br />
It seems that an enc pulled a pet, then went to mezz it for debuff, mistargeted...and tried to mezz RZ.
<br />

We can officially confirm that Bliss doesn't work on RZ.
