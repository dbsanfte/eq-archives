<tr><td class="printline">
<span class="postbody">I am currently level 35 and I haven't done many LDoNs and I have never done a high risk one.  I have never been on an adventure that we failed - until last night.
<br />

<br />
I get a tell asking if I want to do an LDoN in Everfrost.  I've never been there and I'm up for anything new so I say yes.
<br />

<br />
We have a puller (Monk - grouped with him before - he's good)
<br />
We have a tank (Pally)
<br />
We have a healer (Cleric)
<br />
We have CC (Enchanter)
<br />
We also have some extra DPS (BL - grouped with her before - she's ok)
<br />

<br />
We had one extra person tagged for going but they went linkdead before we started the adventure.
<br />

<br />
I was level 34, the monk was level 38 and the others were 40 and 41.  The way I figure it I'm effectivley doing a hard LDoN because of the average level being so much higher than my level.  Should be fun.
<br />

<br />
The tank gets the adventure and we get a mass kill - we have to kill 54 mobs in 90 minutes.
<br />

<br />
We buff up and zone in and the monk pulls one.  I wait till 95% and cast slow.  It resists and comes over to say hi and starts putting forward a good argument for me to not do that again (please).  I root him and run away and then get healed by the cleric.  I wait a bit (probably at least another 20-30% whilst I lick my wounds and get healed) and then cast tash.  Mob says "Oh!" (punch) "Hi" (thump) "Are you still here!" (kick) "I thought I'd told you already!" (bash)  I get away and get healed again.  The others finish the mob off.  
<br />

<br />
Now I'm not a pessimist but I don't think that this is a good sign.  I've just been healed twice before the first mob is down.   <img src="images/smiles/eusa_shifty.gif" alt="eusa_shifty.gif" border="0" />  It turns out that this is pretty much the way the whole adventure goes.  The Pally just simply cannot keep agro at all.  I haven't played any tanking class so I don't know anything about the tools that they have to keep agro but this guy mustn't have found them yet.  The monk kept having to feign death during the fight to lose agro.  I even tried giving the Pally my best haste and putting my lower haste on the Monk - that didn't work either.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I get into a routine of sitting out every fight until the mob gets below 85%.  I then slow and wait 15% and then I'll either tash (on slow resist) or nuke.  If I nuke then I have to wait out the rest of the fight until I can get a finishing nuke off.  Even with this method I keep gettign agro.  The monk asks me to be more careful because I keep getting agro.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif" border="0" />   I'm casting 3 spells a fight as it is!  The first spell that I cast can get me agro even if I wait until the mob is at 80%.  Should I just not bother with slow and send a nuke out at 20%?  (which will probably be resited if I don't tash)
<br />

<br />
The going is very slow.  So slow that the monk asks if we are doing a hard.  It turns out we are.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif" border="0" />  This means that I am now, effectively, on an adventure that is two difficulty levels higher than a normal.  No one asked what level adventure that we wanted.  We have an Enchanter that is the full 6 or 7 levels below most of the group and we don't have a full group.  I think that would indicate that a normal adventure would be appropriate.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, never mind - let's get on with the adventure.  Its all going as well as can be expected - slow but steady.
<br />

<br />
The monk goes to pull a mob and the BL follows.  She often went forward of the casters when the puller went out so this wasn't too odd.  
<br />

<br />
BL followed by 2 or 3 big thingies and a whirly thingy come flying down the stairs.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_yikes.gif" alt="icon_yikes.gif" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
I cast AE Mez and mez the whirly thing and 1 or 2 of the big thingies.  
<br />

<br />
The other big thingies don't like this and splatter me across the floor and walls.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
It was a quick and fairly painless death.  By the time I zone in to Everfrost (I am bound in the BB adventure camp so this is probably just under 2 minutes) the BL and the Pally are in the zone (I can see this because of the group window).  I assumed that they both died.  It turns out that they were quick with the legs and had zoned.  The cleric died and the monk was ok having FD after I died.
<br />

<br />
I asked what happened and it turns out that "taging" is some kind of technique to split mobs on a pull.  We have a monk with FD.  The monk pulled and then FD to split.  Just after he feigned the BL "tagged" one of the mobs.  With no way to instantly lose agro the whole room turned to her and she kindly showed them the way to us.
<br />

<br />
We zone back in and the monk had pulled my corpse and I loot it.  I was then told that I could have had a 65% rez.  Ah well.
<br />

<br />
We start again and pick the pace up a little.  We miss the 90 minute time limit and try for the 120 minute one.  One thing to note is that the bloody flying monkeys are not pleasant.  We struggled with 2 and then I loaded 2 stuns and I chain stunned the next one to stop it casting so bloody much.
<br />

<br />
We make our way to boss room and we have 2 more mobs to kill for the lower prize.  Monk pulls 2 and I mez one.  We kill the first and turn on the second.  I start casting my nuke at about 15%.  About half way through the cast, when the final mob is at 12% we get thrown out!!!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
After this we head back to camp and split the loot.
<br />

<br />
It looks like this is a bit of a rant about the Pally and the BL.  It isn't - I'm not even pissed at the death or the failed LDoN.  The important thing is that it was fairly good fun.  Even when I had to run away from an angry mob  <img src="images/smiles/icon_axe.gif" alt="icon_axe.gif" border="0" />  I ended up with more xps than I started and I even dinged 35 so it wasn't a complete loss.
<br />

<br />
Having said that, I can only cope with so much fun of that sort so I will certainly be thinking twice if that Pally invites me to an adventure again.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">AT 35, I always had one or two color stuns up <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  I didn't realize their power until I used them back in the old Cazic! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  If the mob turns to beat on you, STUN it.  Especially with a pally tank.  (or one that can keep aggro anyway).  One I leared their power, I always had 1 or 2 up at all times (becuase the times I didn't have htem up,  I died!  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" /> )   This is very very true with a tank that can't hold aggro.  Understand that the color stun won't lower you on the aggro list but it will stop the mob from hitting you for a few seconds.  If the tank taunts during that stun period they might pull it off of you...if not,  stun again! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />   It's an incredible power trip to be able to keep a mob stunlocked and NO ONE in the party is taking damage.  It's very mana intensive though.
<br />

<br />
Another option, one color stun and one mem blur <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Of oourse, you are in for a rude awakening (as I was) when the mobs exceed 55th level and you can't stun anymore!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif" border="0" />  Oh and be careful using them in dungeons like LDON because you can set off traps with them or aggro mobs through walls <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
The pally should be STUN'ing to keep aggro.  Taunt key helps but traditional taunt sucks.   CEASE and DESIST are great for keeping aggro and I think a level 40 or so pally should have 1 or both of those.  They are also great spell interrupters for casters.  Once a pally learns how to keep aggro, its hard for an enchanter to pull aggro off of them.     The problem always is, should you say something to the pally and potentially tick him off or just keep quiet and cast at 15% health on the mob <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I don't have a matching LDON story, but your entire tale sounds familiar.  Throughout the last five years, enchanters have tended to group with lower-level groups and clerics have tended to group with higher-level groups.  It might not seem fair, but that's the way it has to be.  We just do much better in terms of resists and aggro when we're fighting low-blues.  Clerics don't have to worry about resists at all (heals and buffs always work) and the amount of aggro they get is strictly limited to the amount of healing needed, so a higher-level group actually makes their job a little easier.
<br />

<br />
Paladin aggro is all about low-mana stuns, no doubt about it.  They need to keep stunning, even if it reduces their dps.
<br />

<br />
As for the spellcasters... yeah, they've gotten meaner in recent weeks.  It used to be that spellcasters (in all zones) didn't cast quite so much.  Now they sometimes chain-nuke.  Sometimes that's ok -- most mobs do less damage with spells than they would with melee, plus it gives you time to cast a spell without being interrupted.  But a slowed wizard mob does a lot more damage by spell, and can dispel buffs, root, and stun as well... it becomes a real pain.  There's also the surprise factor -- the cleric may be casting a slow heal on you because you're only at 60% health, then that ice comet hits and you go from 60% to dead instantly.

<span class="postbody">I don't have a story like that either, but it does sound familiar. Over my last 6 years playing though, I've learned a lot of tricks. Pallies make assume tanks now. I'd say in the last year, me and some friends have pretty much created a wonderful group. We always group with my level 66 enchanter, a 66 warrior, 66 Pally, 66 mage, my 66 cleric and fill the last spot with another guildy, anywhere from our 62 shammy to the 61 ranger or 66 monk. We did BoT last night with the shammy. We've gotten it down rather perfect though, if we end up with more than one mob, my enchanter will mez it, then before breaking the mez, the Pally will cast a few stuns on it to get agro. It works 99% of the time. Also, when the pally is tanking, I can tash when the mob is still at 100% and slow right after because he'll stun for agro. Very seldom will my enchanter get agro from a mob this way. Now if we don't have the pally, and the warrior is the main tank, I'll wait to 90% to tash, and about 85% to slow.

I can tell you that with 2 boxing a cleric, the faster you can get the slow off, the better. Of course, another thing that might help not get agro is that my enchanter has had a horse since that expansion came out, so she doesn't have to actually sit after casting anything. The other thing is at the higher end, you can't wait until 50% to slow a lot of mobs or they'll eat your tank and your cleric might not be able to heal them fast enough. 
<br />

<br />
I think the last thing I'll add about this is that I also learned to check to see if I need tash. If I get resisted on a few mobs the first time in a zone, I'll tash before trying to slow. If you keep casting slow on a mob and it resists then you will gain agro. If you tash first then slow, you have a smaller chance of not getting agro if you have a good tank. 
<br />

<br />
I've played almost every class in the game now, and each has it's advantage, just pay attention to what works for what class, and if someone isn't doing something, politely point out how they could possibly make it better. A lot of people will take advice and at least try it once. Lol I taught the pally how to use my chanter for pulls with Pacification so he only gets one mob at a time, when the pally was around lvl 64. He'd never knew to do that before, now he won't pull without Pacification unless he has to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Lull and pull is easy for low level paladins. Your group was using the wrong strategy to pull. The paladins don't pacify after 60 though, since their spells cap at 55 for that line. You can paci after 55 for them, just have them target and you /assist and cast. It's best to assist so you don't get accidental aggro. I won't get into chanter tanking <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
The monk was having aggro lingering problems, that's common since they nerfed FD splitting. The problems monks have is they can't help fight the mobs much anymore. Once they get up they bring everything with them. Those monks and rangers always stealing aggro from their procs, it's a group,, monk should use non-proc(hands) to help the paladin(tank) if need be (I would be crying about then).
<br />

<br />
Pally lull and pull, mmm easy. Ykesha weapons have a stun proc, your pally must have had issues with gear. Cease and Desist is aggro dominance coupled with great pulling spells too. Flash of what??, not in LDON unless you have a deathwish. Pally lull, pally cease, pally aggro magnet, monk DPS, bst DPS, chanter DPS, cleric DPS, happy group. Clerics get lots of aggro if they cast nukes. Casters love chanter groups(wizards/magicians=major ownage). Tash is great for magic based nukes, YeaH!!
<br />

<br />
I get the part of you being lowest level but clerics can paci /assist also if its a hard one and you want the great exp. It helps if the cleric or chanter is one of the highest in the group for paci pulling hard ldon. Oh and be sure to Charisma buff the cleric/pally if they are doing the paci spells. Charisma is a major boost at 100, 200, 300 stats. That helps if paci fails and a check for charisma is made for aggro on failure. Heck even monks can cast paci anymore, though it's only good for one target.
<br />

<br />
Monks pull best in EC and NRO ldon. The flying monkies make good charm pets, MAJOR DPS and really are great for those wandering mind type spells <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" />). Monkies meaning the mobs in Everfrost ldon, hehe. If you desire a master aggro tank then grab a shadow knight. They aggro from the other side of the zone. 
<br />

<br />
Sometimes it helps to just slow and nothing else but buff the group. Beastlords are my favorites when they slow for me <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />)!! Chanters are the best pullers in Sro LDON and normal is like hard in comparison to the others. Stun, I never used it, chain cast MEZ works for me or just aoe mesmerization and let my group bail me out. Stun has its uses sometimes. Low level mezz just as good to level 55 anyway. Umm,, you should Tash, Slow, and then contemplate anything else, ALWAYS!!
<br />

<br />
One word "mesmerization" is a chanter research spell level 16 targeted aoe that is the funnest thing when you are so young and full of energy <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" />. Just target the puller and everything nearby is "mez". Just don't do it nearby any ldon "chest/trap/box ".

You should make your *cycle target next npc and *cycle last target keys. Those are assignable in the options keyboard menu but don't have a default value. It helps for single target tash and slow or mez. I get sick when I see time equipped players that use mouse targetting *blah*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Ehhm, did I miss something?

Since when do Pallies have DPS?

I agree they get DPS against undead with cleanse but other than that, their DPS is rock bottom anyhow.

So a bit more or a bit less doesn't matter.

Better to keep agro so that the BL and the Monk can go full out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

As a chanter you pretty much have to be in the middle to high end of the group lvl wise or resists make it too difficult.
<br />
I have grouped with many tanks who were terrible at keeping aggro.
<br />
Warriors...enough said...
<br />
gotta wait till 90% or so to tash slow.
<br />
Pally's and SK's should be able to get insta-aggro though with stun and that snare/darkness thingie respectively.

The pally needs to STUN and stun ALOT. (period)

I mezzed myelf numerous times in ldon's with mesmerize when my resists weren't so great hehe.  Usually I would wake up a couple seconds before the other mobs though.
<br />
I too had great fun using charm in LDoN's.  Used it mainly as CC on a multi-pull but I usually kept the pet until he started acting up (breaking charm every few seconds) then we'd kill him.
<br />
The monkey's in EF are fun too....
<br />
I never could get it so he charmed something while he was my pet.....I read somewhere here were someone had like 3 or 4 pets because the monkey's would charm.
<br />
I got so burnt out on ldon's though I pretty much haven't done one since then (40's).  Same with my Mage after he got his DPOC - haven't done an ldon since.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
