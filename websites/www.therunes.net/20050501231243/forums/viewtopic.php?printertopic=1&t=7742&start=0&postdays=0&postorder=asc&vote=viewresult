<span class="postbody">In EQ1 I have played a Necro and an Enchanter.  Both classes because of their amazing solo ability.  In online gaming I really do not enjoy pickup groups/single grouping.  My enjoyment in EQ comes from 3 main activities; solo play, raiding, and focused grouping like LDONs.  My question, trying to gleam from the community is this: which MMORPG is best suited for avid solo players.  I know its basically the same question as which game is  more then happy to let you be the most powerful, but it can be a deeper topic then that.  EQ1 solo classes can kill most of the same mobs groups can; their penalties being they do it slower and they often need to be higher level then the average group level Thanks to all in advnace.</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Nocturn on Thu Mar 31, 2005 12:23 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

<span class="postbody">I don't really see any MMORPG fully satifying this area.
<br />

<br />
Any encounter a soloist can take and earn decent gear from will be farmed to high heaven by groups. There is just too much of an advantage for those working in groups to be able to get the balance right in the same encounter.
<br />

<br />
The solution to this would be for a game to offer instanced encounters for soloists. Then there would also be the question of class balance in such solo instances as it would be ridiculous to expect an encounter designed for a melee class to be suitable for a caster class soloist etc.
<br />

<br />
Even if such a system could be devised and properly balanced then the designers would hit the server resourcing issue incurred by so many instanced zones running for just single players. Can you imagine the load if even just a small proportion of the server was using such soloist instances?
<br />

<br />
I am for the most part a solist too but I don't expect to be able to gain the same level of gear and XP gain as can be gleaned from a group in the same time span and I don't think it is fair for us to expect this. MMORPG's are designed for groups and dedicated soloists are, and always will be on the fringes of the MMORPG community. I don't have a problem with that because if I wanted to get great loot and experience as a soloist I would go play an offline game like Morrowind rather than a MMORPG.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I've been playing WOW lately. It seems much more suited towards solo than grouping, IMO.  In fact, it's difficult, at least at low levels, to find people to group with, with whom you can actually take on higher level stuff than you can do alone.  While a single competent partner can help you take on MUCH higher than solo, groups, for some reason, seem to only complicate things.
<br />

<br />
But I have not played long, or much, so perhaps at higher levels, when people know their classes, it gets better.  For now, however, it seems to be fairly even between soloers and groups.  
<br />

<br />
However, word of caution, don't play a hunter if you want to be "competitive," because in all honesty, leveling up your pet appears to be a time sink on the level of the old ragefire camp for clerics.  The results are quite powerful, but they're a very long time coming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">One thing I've noticed with groups in WOW is that someone in teh group will tend to get cocky and think "Well, we have five people, and with 2 I can kill something 3 levels higher, so I should be able to now take on something 8 levels higher!" when in fact your ability (and the ability of everyone in your group) to hurt an NPC starts dropping rapidly past 3 levels over. At 5 levels over you're barely doing any damage for the most part, so while your group can do it, it will take longer and use more resrouces than massacring large numbers of stuff that are still only 3 levels over you. Every large group I get into seems to get this idea and we usually end up either on multiple CRs or killing stuff so slowly that the idea of "group" was a waste of a night.The only groups that seem to do well are groups that are not interested in the xp and kill rate, or groups that are out for pvp (which doesn't have the same damage restrictions based on level that pve has, making for more fun with level gaps). A duo or trio is probably ideal for WOW unless you know the people well and you all work well together and know the game's limits. Then, a group of 5 is devastating.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">CoH (City of Heroes) was fun, you can solo very effectively, and it's also really easy to pick up a group and dump them again quickly which I think is important. It doesn't seem to have much depth though, and I couldn't play for more than an hour at a time ever. 
<br />

<br />
AO (Anarchy Online) is now free for the basic package, and amused me for a little while, although it makes EQ look simple. You can solo quite effectively with certain classes.
<br />

<br />
Guild wars, released here in the UK in a month or so, actually gives you NPC group mates and actively encourages soloing as well as grouping. However, as the name implies, to get the most out of it you'll want a guild. I've played the weekend previews and it's rather delicious so far. 
<br />

<br />
SWG (Star Wars Galaxies) could be entirely soloed, but the total lack of content means you'll have finished it in a couple of months. That mini review is based on my experiences over a year ago, so they may have added content besides the space expansion (as Woody said "They added more empty space?"). There were some hugely innovative features in that game, it's a real shame they decided leave content to the player base, and only allowed a single character per server. Oh it's sony again, and the last time I looked they were up to sony like tricks, but I still enjoyed my brief time playing. It's worth it just to kill some ewoks. 
<br />

<br />
If you want longevity you'll have to get involved in the multi player aspect, but if you just want to log on, let off some steam and relax a little, pretty much all of them have something to offer. I personally believe every mmorpg should allow you to solo all the mundane aspects, ie leveling, but require groups for exciting and desirable things, like ornate horses, guild faction for guild toys, etc. MMORPGs are about having fun in an environment populated with real people. I'll choose when I actually interact with them thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

That said, the best equipment in the game comes from Instances (basically requires a full group of 5 players) and instance-related quests.  If you can't bear the thought of grouping for 3 hours every 5 levels, you can always save your gold and buy at the Auction House.  At level 60, some player-crafted armor and weapons are nearly as good as what drops - but it costs a lot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">The WoW xp model doesn't excactly work like EQ. Xp per mob is linear with their level, and you get a penalty when the mob turns "green" (3 levels or more below you). The result is that the best xp comes from killing mobs 2 levels below you or as close to that as possible. Since there is usually a level spread in a given area, the goal should be to hunt in areas where mobs are 0 to -2 levels compared to you. That's true for both solo and group play, since as was mentioned above your ability to hit the mob goes downhill fast once it's 3+ levels above you, and there's no significant experience bonus for taking higher level mobs.
<br />

<br />
Since all classes can solo reasonably well, there is *no* incentive to create a group of 3+ for xp purpose for outdoor hunting, except to complete the odd quest here and there. Past 2 people, your uptime (time spent killing mobs) will start plummeting since mobs die so fast. Not to mention that you'll probably run out of mobs pretty fast.
<br />

<br />
Instances are a different beast. The best loot comes from there, there's no shortage of mobs, there's a significant ZEM (at least 30%), and the mobs are elite which means a lot more hps and xp per mob which will increase your uptime and your group's effectiveness compared to outdoor hunting.
<br />

<br />
You can solo with ease up to level 60 with any class in WoW. But if by rewards you mean the ability to gear up on your own on level appropriate content, you won't find it. Most solo quests (non elite) rewards are negligible with an exception here and there. The best loot will invariably come from instances, and as far as I know it's impossible to solo in any instance if you're of the appropriate level (i.e. stuff isn't grey to you and you can actually use the drops).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
