<tr><td class="printline">
<span class="postbody">My name is Dhegorn and I am a 68 Enchanter on the 7th Hammer server.  Having found the Spire Control Shard, Dranik Blood Standard, Kuuan Traitor Stones, and Duskfall Chronicles, I decided to set out to find the Silk version of quest.  After a tireless few days of searching, see invis mob beatings, and mob conning...  I have found him.
<br />

<br />
In the Wall of Slaughter..  to the far West of the zone.
<br />
Your Location is -1036.90, 841.32, 79.18
<br />

<br />
You say, 'Hail, Korshawn'
<br />

<br />
The old dragorn studies you for a moment before he begins speaking in a low gravely voice, 'So, Dhegorn, is it true what my kin whisper?  That you have come to fight the Muramites?  Hmm, you're ten years too late.  Half of Kuua's warriors who would have fought by your side are now nothing more then [bones].'  The other half have already sworn allegiance to Mata Muram. I'm not so sure which half is better off.?'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what bones?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'Many dragorn have fallen to the armies of the Muramites. As a chaplain of Dranik's forces, it was my responsibility to guide the passing of the dying warriors and bury their bodies so that they will be honored even in death.  I buried each member of my unit, one by one, until only I remained.  Consumed with despair, I abandoned the war effort to seek a life of solitude and anonymity.'  The dragorn gazes off into the distance before continuing, 'Your arrival has been the first hope many of us have had in a long time.  I wish I could join you as you make your stand against the Muramites, but I've long ago hung up my battle [heirlooms], swearing never to fight again.'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what heirlooms?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'I still have my battle dressings.  They are part of an ancient set handed down from Dranik's chaplains before me.  Perhaps you'd be interested in cloth armor for your [hands], [wrists], [arms], [head], [chest], [legs], or [feet]?  The pieces are light and supple and served me well in the field.  I can give you one piece for each service you perform in the interest of the children of Dranik.'    '
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what hands?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'Harbinger's Spire was once a dragorn lookout tower which the Muramites have since bent to their own purposes.  I studied there as a young chaplain, and I shudder to look upon what has those discordlings have done to it in these past years.  Mata Muram uses the spire as a beacon to receive the tidings of his domain.  Some of his captains possess crystal shards which can be used to control the beacon rising from Harbinger's Spire.  If you are able to steal one of these crystals, it would mean a break in the Muramite chain of communication.  Return with one of these spire control shards as well as two discordling finger bones.  If enough shards are taken from the Muramites, they will be forced to abandon the tower.'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what wrists?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'We were created by a single great dragon, the great father known as Dranik.  The first dragorn created many things in his honor.  Among these creations was a fearsome battle standard painted with a drop of blood from each of Dranik's firstborn sons.  This banner was carried by my kin through many battles and it has seen us through much strife.  The last dragorn armies to carry the banner fell to the Muramites over a decade ago.  No one can say where the Blood Standard of Dranik's Sons has gone, but the recovery of such an artifact will leave me in your debt.  Return with this banner along with two hooked chimera claws to use as nails.  I will ensure that the standard hangs over the mass graves of those who died fighting the Muramites.  It's the least I can do to honor their deaths.'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what arms?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'I respect your willingness to help, but this will not be an easy task.  As you may know, the armies of Mata Muram are but one aspect of Discord's deep shadow.  The Darkening ravaged not only the denizens of Kuua, but also the landscape as well.  Many of our old landmarks no longer stand, and the sky -- once blue and vast -- now seethes with ash and storms.  If you can find a map of Old Kuua, one drawn before the coming of Discord, it may help me to infer the location of the ancient barrows of my kin.  I need to find them before the Muramites manage to pillage the graves of my ancestors.  Return with one of the old maps as well as two jagged noc tusks so I can hollow them out and create a safe place to keep the map.  Do this for me and I can reward your efforts with my cloth arm wraps.'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what head?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'When Discord first impinged upon our world, sentiments of treachery and paranoia crept into our lives.  Dragorn turned on dragorn and soon longstanding friendships ended in bitter squabbling.  One dragorn, Noble Yemall the Arcane, kept his wits long enough to realize what was happening.  Before the Muramites came, Yemall toiled tirelessly to counter the effects of Discord.  Although his efforts were ultimately in vain, it is said that he was able to author a treatise before the Muramites seized him.  This treatise, entitled The Duskfall Chronicles, contains his reflections on the nature of Discord.  No one knows what has happened to this text, but if you are able to recover it, I may be able to understand why so many dragorn met their end.  Bring me this treatise along with two rugged murkglider skins to make a book cover.  I will reward you with my former battle hood.'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what chest?
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says 'Before the Muramites came, the High Council of Eight ruled over Dranik.  The eight nobles, lead by Jelvan the Eldest, each carried scepters that were said to be carved from the bones of the first dragorn sons and etched in ancient runes.  It is said that these scepters will glow as long as their owner is alive.  I have not seen the council since the Muramites overran our city, but I have heard that their scepters were handed out by Mata Muram as war trophies.  If you can recover one of these scepters along with three Kuuan oil candles so I can study the runes, I will reward you with my former battle tunic!'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what legs?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says ''As you may know, Kuua was not the first world touched by Discord. There have been many others, for I have heard the Muramites tell stories of past conquests. One of the stories they tell is that the last ember of a Discord-ravaged city will burn for many years long after the ruins of the city itself have been buried by time.  Some say it's the city's spirit slowly dying.  Others claim it to be a side effect of the Discord's lingering magic.  Regardless, these embers are highly valued by the legions of Discord, for Mata Muram rewards them to his fiercest captains as war trophies.  If you can bring me one of these embers along with three Dragorn Muramite insignia necklaces, I can reward you with my former battle leggings.  I have no need of them any longer, and I can use that ember to light the pyres of my kin who have fallen to the Muramites.  It would be an honorable tribute to both my kin and the unknown city that have both fallen to Discord.'
<br />

<br />
You say, 'what feet?'
<br />

<br />
Korshawn says ''When Discord first descended upon Kuua, many of my own kin turned traitor.  There is talk of a traitors' stone, etched with the names of all dragorn who conspired with the enemy in those dire days.  The Muramite captains carried these stones and used them to determine which dragorn to slay outright and which to spare with a life of slavery.  If you can bring me one of these Kuuan traitor stones, along with two ikaav braids so I can hang the stones for all to see, it may enrage the remaining dragorn who are unhappy with Mata Muram's rule.  In time they may gather the spirit of will to once again rise up against the Muramites.  Your reward shall be the cloth slippers I wore back when I, too, fought against the enemies of Dranik.'
<br />

<br />
I just need to go collect a few odds and end piece from the baz and killing but as soon as I'm done I'll have up 4 items for what the hand ins are for Enchanter.

<span class="postbody">Actually thats the Tier 2 version.  Read closer the dialog is differnt.  The drops for Tier One are dropping in easier zones like Causeway, WoS, and RCoD.  All the other drops in the other post require killing in the harder zones like MPG and Riftseekers.

<br />
Plus to get the First Tier quest you only need Warmly with Dranik Loyalist to do.   To get Nerask to respond to you must be Allied.

The Tier One armor quest are requiring 7 Drops from several named mobs in WoS and RCoD that are all related to the Silk, Leather, Chain, and Plate.

I know we saw Spire Control Shard rot last night off of Kyv Bowhunter (or was it Bowhound? - not the stone of p. warding guy, but the named right out of the castle to the left in valley).  Also, I wonder if this can be MQ'd.  I was all excited about gearing up an alt with this stuff, but with faction....guess I could just tag mobs from some other group or something amusing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">First off, nothing in OoW can be MQ'd.. you have to hand in all items at the same time.  Secondly, no faction hits for hands.  Exp wasn't anything notable, about 1% AA.  You have to be atleast Warmly to do the quest to Dranik Loyalist.
<br />

<br />
As for drops, certain names drop certain items, not random off of all named.  If you search for the items on Alla you can see which named mobs drop them.  I killed the Kyv Bowgaurd in RCoD 10 times now and found the Duskfall Chronicles 6 of those times on him.

The mob you found the spire on in RCoD was the Kyv Bowhound, thats where I got mine too <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Are you able to tell us from which zones/mobs the No Drop items can be found?  I'll likely not use the armor myself but I have friends for whom this would be significant upgrades.

<span class="postbody">Alrighty so I just returned to Korshawn ready to hand in what was possibly the quest items for the Feet.  Here is the log
<br />

<br />
Korshawn regards you as an ally -- it appears to be quite formidable.
<br />

<br />
(I try to hand him the Kuuan Traitor Stones and 2 Tattered Ikaav Braids)
<br />

<br />
You must turn in all quest items at once in order to complete this quest.
<br />

<br />
Ok so the Tattered Ikaav Braids are not the right item, I didn't think they would be honestly because of their shop value vs the other quest items..  I do believe this to be the correct item.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=51471" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=51471</a>
<br />

<br />
been watching the Bazaar and checking venders for this but notta yet... so the question is where does it drop?  For 1st Tier OoW zones their are known Ikaav in RCoD, Bloodfields, and Causeway.  Their are also some in the Catacombs of Dranik.  And Finally they are also in Riftseekers and MPG, however these ones would be pushing a bit hard difficulty for a Tier 1 Armor Quest..  So can anyone possibly confirm where the Ikaav Braids are dropping?
<br />

<br />
On a side...  I went to go see Nerask for details on the 2nd Tier Armor quest..
<br />

<br />
Nerask regards you as an ally -- looks like it would wipe the floor with you!
<br />

<br />
You say, 'Hail, Nerask'
<br />

<br />
Nerask says 'Ah, friend.  Good to see you.  Though I have heard about the many good things you have accomplished for my people, I fear you are not quite ready to face the dangers I might set you out against.  Seek me out when you have mastered more of the battle arts.'
<br />

<br />
So it looks like more then just being Allied is involved...  Judging by the text I'm thinking level.  I'm 68, I'll check agian at 69.. however I'm betting its going to be 70 + Allied required to do the quest.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, GL and Happy Hunting</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Dhegorn on Wed Oct 20, 2004 11:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>
