<span class="postbody">Hello and thank you for reading my post.
<br />

<br />
My background in EQ:  i started way back in 2000 on my druid, i played on and off for a few years and i just took my last break 8 months ago, my druid was level 65 with about 200+ aa almost time flagged,  i came back about a month ago and decided i didn't want to be a 2end rate class (druid).  i have always wanted to play an enchanter because i love to crowd control and playing in GoD groups with charmed enchanter pets and the challenge of dealing with a pet that could drop the group in seconds seems like a lot of fun to me.
<br />

<br />
Now i have a level 34 enchanter, full twinked out in about 100k of gear, i have been reading these forums almost every day and always keep on top of the general forum for EQ.
<br />

<br />
It seems like the enchanter class isn't what i thought it was.  crowd control isn't what it used to be (OS, KC, Guk ect) and charming has recently been nerfed it seems.
<br />

<br />
Is the enchanter class gone down hill that bad or does everyone magnify the small problems in their class because they want to be all powerful again? im not sure if i want to continue with my enchanter if all i have to look forward to is tash/slow/crap nuke and rare crowd control and nonexistent charming.
<br />

<br />
Basically in a nutshell, all i read on this forum is negative posts about enchanters and enchanter quitting and the class dieing, is this true? should i just start another class while i can still turn back without to much time spent on my enchanter? or is it just magnified small problems and the class is still useful and fun?
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your time and opinions.

This is something you will have to decide for yourself. There will be folks here who will tell you "most definately yes" - some of those still play, some don't. Then you have some eternal optimist (such as myself) who still enjoy the game and don't see the issues that enchanters face as life or death, and will tell you that it is all in how you look at it.
<br />

<br />
KT+ in GoD and most of OoW sucks for chanters. DoN seems to be a boon for enchanters. Prior to GoD, only high level raiding was pretty boring for enchanters (although there are a few exceptions).
<br />

<br />
My only advice is to form your own opinion. If you rely on folks here to make up your mind, then you have a 50/50 chance of making the right decision for you where you save yourself heartache or miss out on something great.
<br />

<span class="postbody">The problem is that you can't reasonably 'determine for yourself'.  By the time you invest the amount of time it takes to build up a decent character, the investment is already too large to simply go back and start over if you decide you don't like the class.
<br />

<br />
If you plan to play at a high level, my advice would be to pick any class except for enchanter.  While it may seem hard to believe, i think druids are actually in better shape right now so i'd even say stick to that before starting an enchanter.  Thats saying a lot since druids are pretty awful right now and show no signs of getting any better.
<br />

<br />
There is nothing to cc outside of raids at high level and charm is useless at least in oow.  I can't see it being useful in the future either.  The devs are intransigent about improving enc slowing and you can't even pretend to compete without getting a serpent (which requires you to somehow go back and farm an expansion which is now quite old).  Caster dps and non-healing casters in general are pretty useless with the exception of their ability to buff melee dps (like shamans) or improve healer mana regeneration (like necros).
<br />

<br />
The raid situation was actually quite decent in the mpg raids and tacvi.  There are adequate roles for cc and even when there isn't a role for cc, there is at least some blurring of class disparities.  If you look at mpg tactics raid, a smart enchanter can outdamage e.g. a stupid wiz or rog, which is not the case in most other raids.  In what i've seen of anguish and don raids, however, there is little of importance but the standard tank/heal/dps junk so again raiding becomes pretty dull.
<br />

<br />
Soloing is pretty much dead for just about anyone.  You can solo/twobox trivial content as an enchanter better than most, but there's not a lot of value to doing so.  Reverse charming is your only means of doing so now, and if there is ever anything enchanters are able to solo, it will just get nerfed by making it summon anyway.

<span class="postbody">Yes, there are some things that have been nerfed about the chanter class. However, chanters are still very desireable for many reason. 
<br />

<br />
Crowd control is not really as nerfed as is said I don't think. You will always find yourself in a group with a puller who can't pull or a tank with less hp then you lvl 13 ranger alt with no gear. So it is still very needed. Mez will always be needed.
<br />

<br />
Charm is something that you should learn, and learn to do well. Don't let people tell you you shouldn't charm because -insert random bullshit reason-. It can add major dps to a grp that lacks it, or just add extra dps to a group that doesn't need it for shits and giggles. A charmed pet will usually do more damage then chain nuking if you add in down time to med.
<br />

<br />
Slow and tash are a given. There are no ways around that unless you have a shammy in your grp to take care of slows.
<br />

<br />
There are a lot of tricks you will learn if you so decide to carry on your chanter. Don't get discouraged because of what you read here. Lots of the comments on these forums are exagerated a tad in my opinion. Some aren't so much as others. It is a tad boring at lower levels. Just hang in there and see what higher levels have to offer you. Best advice I can give is to wait and see. Nothing can replace a good chanter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

It is as Londo says. 
<br />

<br />
For exp grinding purposes, at high end (KT, MPG, RSS) you are lucky if you get to use mez once every 2 hours. Casters are sucky DPSers compared to melee DPS, except maybe a necro (or a shaman with the new DoN proc spell). You can charm, but the average DPS of the charmed pet is not all that much better than your animation DPS (considering redebuffing and recharming downtime, along with wipe potential), and just a tad better than a DC pet, if so (if charmed pet is not hasted, a DC pet would prolly be more DPS). Not worth wiping the group when it breaks and starts hitting you or everyone around for over 1K DMG IMO.
<br />

<br />
So expect to tash, slow, crap nuke and rare mez.

<br />

<br />
Crowd control is not nerfed, just non-existant in the high end. With mobs hitting for 1300ish peeps will just not allow mez and will CC on pull. Mainly because zones are designed for single pulling as a consequence of mob DPS.
<br />

<br />
At high end, 1 add can wipe group if you get unlucky on resists, but shouldn´t if you are PoTime equiped or similar and have your rune AAs done (ER and Mind over Matter). 2 adds on the other hand will already require a tank with a lot of HPs, and unless you get lucky enough to mez both adds without any resists (or at least the 1st add you cast mez on), 90% of the times tank will die, and prolly ends up in a wipe.

<br />

<br />
If what you are saying is that the only hope for chanter fun is to group with peeps that suck, your grouping experience will suck accordingly. 
<br />

<br />
The thrills of locking down a multipull and saving the day are too few and far in between.
<br />

<br />
If you don´t mind pulling, but still feel like mezzing here and there when needed, I suggest you make a bard instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Charm in OOW and beyond cannot add major DPS to a group.  The maximium DPS you can get by charm in OOW and beyond is not 'major'.

Learn? Yes for pre-pop. Get use to having? NO.
<br />

<br />
Major DPS? ONLY in pre-PoP zones. In OoW it is crap DPS compared to the risk.
<br />

<br />
In GoD and OoW forget about charming in a group situation. My Animation fully buffed does around half the damage of a charmed pet in those zones and I can buff it and not worry about wiping the group when charm breaks during a pull.

The RvR is completely unbalanced for in group charming and the down time spent by groups due to the time wasted having to rez dead Enchanters, mana loss from healers keeping chanters alive, time spent recharming on breaks, and down time due group wipes on bad breaks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Of the worthwhile grouping zones in god, it works in sewers, vxed, and tipt.  It doesn't work in KT, ikkinz, or qvic.  The transition from tipt to KT is the dividing point for charm being useful and is about the halfway point of god.  After you get to the halfway point of god, charm will no longer be a useful skill for groups.  You can use it on trivial content like rcod/hollows/parts of wos to reverse charm solo, but its never again useful as a means of dps in group settings.
<br />

<br />
There IS raid charming after KT.  It can be a valuabe part of uqua if you lack dps (although with insane melee dps nowadays after the level increase it would be hard to see this being the case for anyone).  You can charm in inktuta although i've never seen a point in doing so.  Charm is an integral part of one event in txevu as well.  After that point, it seems that charm as anything but a parlour trick is completely out both for raiding and for grouping.  Maybe some people in the uberguilds have seen it farther along, but with the reduced damage tables i can't see how charming could be integrated as a real role in a raid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

That may be. Honestly, I don't recall being able to charm in KT, but I can't remember. My point is that the charm 'fix' did not affect charming in GoD. He mentioned that his animation does half the damage of a charmed pet in GoD. This is incorrect. It only applies to OoW+ and the zone revamps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

He did not say his animation was 'better' then a charmed mob, he said fully buffed it did 'about half the damage'. The point at which the animation becomes half the damage of a charmed pet is OoW. Therefore, OoW+ and zone revamps is 100% correct.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I duo with a cleric a lot and I can farm Harbringers, DS, BF, and NC with just my Animation. I hold aggro and Cleric keeps me healed while I nuke and pet does the spanking from behind. Only mana breaks cleric needs are when I need smoke =:~P

I may be wrong about the nerfage in GoD but I could have swore they had a nerf patch where more MOBs were made uncharmable and some, as it appeared to me, were hitting for less. It's been 6 months since I was in GoD xping so my memory could be faulty and if it is I apologize for the mistatement.

Also note I personally consider any zone that doesn't have a DC mob for me, that doesn't have charmable MOBs, or where Charmed MOBs are hitting for less then when not charmed a nerfed zone.

Now my pre OoW Animation didn't do as much in GoD as my current one does but in OoW zones, especially WoS and MPG I won't charm I'll only use my Animation although I do keep a Charm memmed but only for emergency CC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

The max level of CoD is 64, so before OoW (and the new higher max level charm), mobs over 64 were not charmable because CoD took care of that. When OoW came out, they went back and made 65+ mobs immune so that everything remained status quo.

Excluding the "or charmed mobs are hitting for less than when not charmed part" (which I still have issue with), I am not sure 'nerf' is the proper term to be using. It is kinda hard to nerf something if it didn't exist in the first place. A 'crappy zone' would be good, but 'nerf' in this case, I think is used incorrectly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">There were 2 KT+ 'nerfs' from the chanter perspective.  When KT/Ikkinz were first released you could charm there and many of the mobs were of the appropriate level to charm.  There was a nerf that flagged all of the mobs in KT and ikkinz uncharmable.  Shortly after, there was another 'nerf' that increased the mob levels in KT in response to complaints that xp in KT was poor compared to pofire and poearth.  Prior to this, the level range was 62-66 i think and it seems like all mobs were just increased by 2 levels.  Nobody but paladins and enchanters much cared about the difference, but of course the intelligent thing to do that doesn't mess up stuns and wom/colour cloud would have been to just up the zem.  After the release of oow, all mobs in pre-oow zones level 65 and up were blanket flagged immune to charm.  This made sure there was no charm damage available in qvic or txevu outside of raid events.

If you mean exactly half, i don't know if that ever occurred.  The point at which charm damage dropped to where it was no more than approximately double that of animation damage was KT.  Charm was not rendered useless only with the release of OOW.  It happened with the charm nerf to KT and since that point it has not provided substantially greater xp than the animation.  To those far behind in content, it might seem like charm was only recently removed from the enc skillset, but its been over a year.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
