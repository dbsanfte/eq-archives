<span class="postbody">Well, we shall see how my computer replacement saga goes...
<br />

<br />
I got my new Cyberpower Systems comptuer.  I've been very excited about its arrival.  Unfortunately, the Windows XP product key on the side of the machine is apparently invalid.  More fun, at both the cyberpower customer support and microsoft piracy hotline numbers, nobody answers at times when I am not at work.  I've already sent an email to Cyberpower threatening to avail myself of all available remedies if they don't solve the problem and compensate me for the problem they created, stat, but I'm still mpissed.  I paid for the damn os, they should give me a good product key.
<br />

<br />
If anyone has any informative information or advice, I would appreciate it.  Also, if anyone knows of any similiar circumstances at cyberpower or other manufactuers, I'd love to hear about it!
<br />

<br />
Also, when I turn on my computer and have Microsoft tell me my key is invalid and shut it down, I've noticed that it is INSANELY LOUD.  Near as I can tell, it is coming from the power supply.  Have I got any recourse, or do I need to get a desk with a contained cpu compartment?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">If you're still within 90 days of purchase, you can charge-back the system price (explaining the reason to the credit card company - they should back you up).  That is of course, if the PC manufacturer is ignoring you and won't take back the system as a whole (and refund all costs including shipping).
<br />

<br />
If you're beyond 90 days from purchase, your only legal recourse is to sue in small claims court (in my home state, that is done at the level of the District Justice but it isn't called "small claims" specifically).  Been a long time since I charged anything back - so the 90 day period may have changed.  Ask your credit card company.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">If you sell a lot of systems (like Dell, HP, Gateway, etc) it's cheaper getting an OEM license. They at least they should give you is a recovery CD or an OEM CD containing Windows, as well as a copy of the license key. The product keys are usually stickers on the side of CPU cases and are produced by Microsoft. 
<br />

<br />
Now, it could be just a simple mistake so see where that takes you but if they refuse to send you a working product key and a recovery CD or OEM CD (not a CDR copy but an original) then it would constitute fraud. If it is within 90 days of the purchase, contact your credit card company and reverse the charges explaining why you are doing so. If after 90 days as Nokei said, your only recourse is to file a claim in small claims court. I'd give them every chance to remedy this since what you want is a working computer, not a prolonged court battle. But always keep that option in mind. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.resellerratings.com" target="_blank">www.resellerratings.com</a> actually list Cyberpower Inc (Cyberpower Computer Sytems) is actually in good standings. This is why I'm surprised you are having problems with software you bought from them. 
<br />

<br />
I am assuming you got the computer you listed in your post a little while ago. The power supply unit should have a fan control. Usually that means that you can set it to be at high performance all the time (obnoxiously loud) or to spin at low RPM's until certian temperatures are reached when it will kick into high gear (higher RPM, louder sound). Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the PSU since it seems to be one that comes with the case. However, I did see that it has two 80mm fans. These are smallish fans that are loud at max speed. See if there is a product manual somewhere that can show you how to change the settings. 
<br />

<br />
Check the back of the case where the PSU is and see if there is a small knob. Got some info that says that's what controls the fans for this particular PSU. You can set it to a lower RPM and there's a temp sensor inside the PSU that wil increase the speed of the fans if it gets too hot. 
<br />

<br />
I don't like 80mm fans on my PSU's, they are too loud at full load. I look for 120mm in my PSU's and for the fans in my case when possible because they can push the same amount of air at lower speeds which helps decrease decible level of the sound it creates. 
<br />

<br />
It is also a bad idea to put modern computers in a desk compartment or other area with poor ventilation. This will actually make the situation worse by trapping heat into the area where the computer is. Modern computers run very hot as it is and while the excess heat may not cause any stability issues, it can also cause your computer to crash when running something intensive such as a game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Just asked me if I had a cd that said for distribution with cd only.  Did ask me about ANY details about the machine, my identification, or the manufacturer.  Weird.

<span class="postbody">Just a note. It could be some changes made by Microsoft itself. Recently they were changing some of the licensing restrictions on some of their OEM licenses. Maybe that's why they didn't give you any trouble. This mostly affected smaller OEM's and none of the larger ones. But the most important thing is to get your system up and running.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
