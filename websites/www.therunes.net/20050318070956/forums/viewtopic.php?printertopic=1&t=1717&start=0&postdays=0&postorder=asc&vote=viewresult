Log onto the Test server and try the new tradeskill UI.  You will need to log in using the testeverquest.exe file which you can find in your EverQuest directory.  Make sure you send in your thoughts on the new UI using the /feedback command in-game.

Yet again I am run over .......  I just finished getting all tradekills to 170+ (Besides JC, GM there) for the Coldain shawls.  Other examples of getting run over.  Was maxed on level when the books where put in.  Was over 35 when the "book-to-med" was abolished.  Hit 60 just before hell levels where abolished.  Maxed sense heading on all my chars just before that patch too!  The next thing institued will be /20 from DAoC and characters will spawn with full spellbooks, maxed skills and epics in a bag!
<br />

Now if we can only do something about loot balance we'd be set!

Don't get me wrong, the tedium and the incessant clicking is enough to drive most people crazy, but at least it was a way to keep the servers from being saturated with grandmaster tradeskillers.

I like being the guy everyone in my guild comes to for help with tradeskills. It is one of things that defines my characters personality. 
<br />

<br />
I understand that this is a change that most people will be excited about. Kind of like how people in non-raiding guilds were happy about the flags being lifted to certain zones and level restrictions put in their place. The people who went through the work for those flags were upset that all these people who did not have to work to get there, flooded their zone.
<br />

<br />
At least they were rewarded withh an AA per flag. How about some sort of reward for those who were already grandmaster tradeskillers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I can understand that viewpoint entirely.  Metal bits anyone?
<br />

<br />
Couple of things I see happening with this change:
<br />

<br />
More people will try Tradeskills, thus lowering the price/profit margin for those already there.
<br />

<br />
Due to ease of use, component prices will probably shoot through the roof, time to get farming! 
<br />

<br />
I can't see them giving existing GM tradeskillers anything in compensation for all their hard clicking though.

<br />
There once was a time where...
<br />

<br />
<ul><li>There was no EQTraders, you had to read books in-game to figure out recipies
<br />
<li>You could only have 1 backpack open at a time
<br />
<li>A large portion of tradeskill materials weren't stackable
<br />
<li>Combining items that didn't result in a recipie destroyed everything in the container
<br />
<li>There were multiple tradeskills with incredibly large gaps in skill-points that required extensive farming or large amounts of money to skill up (and I'm not referring to the 220-250 range)</ul>
<br />
So, basically, someone else ALWAYS had it harder than you, unless you got to 200 back in the original era.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  Level 65 made it easier for people to get their epics when I had to do mine at 60.  PoP zones made it easier for people to get 60 when I had to do it in Seb...

Yeah everyone goes through that reflection, but I tell ya what just because its a newer interface isnt going to change the ratio in how you fail or succeed in a combine.  Just makes it a little faster and easier for those with wrist issues, to me I dont like spending hours doing the same thing over and over again ( minus the thought of sex ) just for a lousy point if that.  So before you think about saying I dont like it, step back and realize that this is really what EQ needed in the first place to deal with tradeskills. 
<br />

<br />
To me its a welcome change even if all my skills are 200+.  Definitely encourage me to do tradeskills on my alts now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

If you'd like, they can make it so that the rate you swing your weapon is based on how often you click your mouse button. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  WHEE!!  It's just like Diablo!  Click Speed != Skill.

The important part to me is having fun.  The tradeskill system in EQ is pretty screwed up in general.  Until you reach the 250 range, there's not a lot out there to make that's useful except for sub-combines in the 250 range.  Granted, there's SOME useful things, but not a lot.  The only reason I did tradeskills was to get up in the 180 range with all of them to get my 8th Shawl.  I'm certainly not upset that someone else after me is going to have an easier time getting it due to not having their hand get sore from all the clicking.
<br />

<br />
Ideally, there'd be something useful to make at many skill ranges in all the skills, useful and applicable at all levels of play.  Unfortunely, it's not that way, nor do I think it can be given the way the game is itemized.  The only real reason to tradeskill is to get to 250 to make the good stuff, and even then, a lot of it is easily surpassed by dropped gear or bazaar fodder.

This is, quite simply, not true.  A common skill path in tailoring puts you at 76 with storebought material.  I know that some people like to exaggerate to make a point, but you weaken your arguments when you do.

They should at least compensate all those people who have GM'd a tradeskill with an AA point or something. Back in the day when you could only have one bag open, and you had to farm a TON of stuff to skill up will be belittled if they change this.

Well, only Elementals...   <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" /> Still, if you feel a sense of accomplishment from seeing your skill go up, go for it.  Nobody's stopping you.  Still, I think we can all agree that given enough time, most any monkey can reach 65.  It doesn't take that much in the way of skill.  Given that, pretty much anyone can get into BoT and join pickup groups for ornate dropping Mini's, which are better than the Blue Diamond cultural stuff, which seems to be the best around excluding stuff that takes higher than Teir2 drops.

My point in saying that is that there's nobody on that forum going on about how useful their FS Breastplate is that they smithed at 178 skill.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" />  Again, aside from sub-combines, consumable stat food/drink, and some other miscellaneous stuff, what is there that's useful in the 1-200 skill range that's worth making other than to skill up?  The tradeskill system is borked along with the equipment in EQ in general.  The fact that for the most part, a level 1 character can wear the same gear as a level 65 character (rec. levels are starting to become more and more common) borks the system pretty good.
<br />

<br />
Take, for example, a Fine Steel Brestplate.  178 Trivial, right?  That's fairly well up there, took me several K to get to the skill it'd take to make it.  Where's the market for it?  Why make it other than to see my skill go up?  Is a newbie going to buy that FS breastplate that I'd have to sell at about 100pp to make a profit/break even (remember, I'm not uber, I'm just Joe Tradeskiller here) instead of the Ry'Gorr chain that he can get cheaper, with better AC and some stats on it?
<br />

<br />
The system's borked.  1-200 is just a grind to get to the point that you can make anything useful (again, some exceptions, but in general).  
<br />
