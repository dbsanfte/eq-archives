				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Yes, I know, this is a topic liable to cause problems.  I'm not here to do that.  I just feel the need to make some observations that I've noted while in EQ, in Beta of EQ2 and playing WoW (as well as CoH).  Folks, though I will speak to direct experience, please understand that this should be taken first as opinion.  I'll try to remain as objective as I can, and am not out to insult anyone, but, in some cases my thoughts will not be very flattering about the course the industry seems to be taking (as evidenced by the new games).
<br />

<br />
I'll zero in on three aspects of these games that I consider to be very basic and key concepts: pulling, solo/grouping, and Critter (mb) difficulty.  I'll use all three of these as a way of intrudicing the problems I see with strategy and tactics.  I'll start with familiar ground to lay the framework that I want to compare and contrast, so, we'll start with observations about EQ:
<br />

<br />
Generally speaking, EQ is a very social game, we all know this.  However, it's also a game that requires a lot of strategy and tactics to do well.  An example of this is single pulling and figuring out how to manage this.  Monks were the first to really shine in this arena, Bards and finally Enchanters do this job very well.  Most classes have some tools for doing this but by no means all.  Save, of course, that if working with a team, you can always 'train' a group of mobs and have a buddy pick one or two off with a bow from the clot that is chasing you, all classes can manage this in one form or another.  The key, though, is that we have to consider how we are going to pull mobs from a given camp.  We can't afford to just wade in swinging as that is certain death, assuming, of course, that the mobs are blue or better cons.
<br />

<br />
Oddly, the Devs seemed to think that this was a problem and have taken steps to either elliminate the need (in recent expansions) for quality pulling, or elliminate the ability to single pull (by stacking mobs to thickly, or making targetting impossible: SRo LDoN anyone).  I find this odd since having to think about what I'm doing is part of what makes a game enjoyable.  Worse yet, is the reaction to orphaning classes or relegating them to one primary role, as Enchanters and Monks in recent changes of EQ.  No, I agree, we still have a role in certain places, but, even as far back as the Revamp of CT, we should've seen this coming.  Sony took what was THE proving ground for CC and made it a zone where you'd better know CC very well before you get into the zone.  Oddly, that zone is now severely underpopulated where I rarely saw a camp open with the old CT.
<br />

<br />
Suffice it to say, that EQ, up through PoP, was a game not only of hack and slash, and of socialization but one of intellect.  A player had to think through his classes mechanics and how that class interacted, or meshed, with other classes to excel.  You could PL your way up, but, if you did, in my experience, you were always missing some aspect of the class and thus not playing it up to full speed.  Same goes with Soloing, I have the utmost respect for soloists, but, you could not work out your group mechanics through this methocology.  In all cases, to do well, the game required knowledge and skill.
<br />

<br />
In EQ, all mobs are of the same difficulty level.  Ie: if a mob is level 50, it's level 50.  Ther eis no concept of a level 50 group mob, or a level 50 solo mob, or a level 50 raid mob.  yes, there are mobs that are underconned and overconned, but, fact is there is no reliable method of referring to a mob and knowing that it was designed for a group, or a raid, just by conning it.  If it's blue, you know it's a bit below your level (or more at higher levels) and thus something that you might be able to take out.  Depending on the mobs abilities, your class will have an easier, o rharder, time of taking down said Critter alone.  Typically, at least in the early days, if you saw a red con surrounded by blue cons, you knew that the red was designed for at least a group to tackle.  Typically, you would not engage a red con critter without a group anyway, and  in my experience, it's always been better to kill a thousand blues quickly, than a hundred reds slowly, so, we would avoid the reds, when hunting exp, and zero in on the blues.  I'll reiterate: there is no obvious mechanic for determining the power of one critter related to another, given that the two critters had the came con.  You were forced to experiment to find out that this critter was 'underconned' or that crittter was 'overconned.'
<br />

<br />
I'll add one more note: I originally came to EQ from UO.  In UO I found the society to be very backstabbing and 'me' oriented.  Ie: each character was out for themselves and was not only not going to help you, but, if they found you in need of help, they'd found an easy target.  I found that I was alwys very 'nervous' in UO and I very much appreciated the change when coming to EQ.  I like the challenge of PvP, but, I also like the relaxation of not having to worry about someone just off screen waiting for me to finish the critter so that they can stab me in the back while I'm low on HPs and they are fresh.  Better, in EQ I found a community that was automatically helping of everyone around them, new to the game or old jockie.  I'll skip this section in EQ2 because I found the crowd in EQ2 to be largely as helpful as hte one in EQ.  I should also ad that the tenor an dnature of the community in EQ has had it's ups and downs.  It seems that on occasion we get an influx of jerks and the rudeness follows, but, that doesn't seem to last very long.  I've always felt there was something in the very nature of EQ that fostered a helping hand attitude, but, I'll be darned if I've ever been able to put my finger on what it is that causes this.
<br />

<br />
EQ2:
<br />

<br />
Now we have a game where each class stands out on it's own.  Admittedly, I did not play through to high levels, but, the levels I did play through, I was perfectly capable of soloing anywhere I went.  Pulling was trivial.  Target a mob, and you know, straight off, if you were going to get a single or multiples.  Gone were the days of trying to figure out mob interaction, pacifying, mez puling or charm pulling.  I found no use for mez save in group situations.  Even then, since all classes can, virtually, stand alone, I found group discipline to be lacking and the argument for discipline to be lacking.  Simply stated: I found no use for mez, it was too easy just to let the group split tank and kill them all, while I nuked.  Yes, I had mez, yes it worked, but, when facing a pull of 4 or 5 mobs, mezzing one... or 2, was not going to make a differeence.  Better to move off and find a single pull mob: one that was not chained to other mobs.  Note that there is also no mechanic for peeling off one mob from a train, as if you aggro one of a group, you WILL aggro all of them.  The closest I was able to get was that if you pulled a group, killed one, and were able to run away far enough to lose them, when I returned, I'd see one fewer in the group I'd pulled (but, that one would usually respawn fairly quickly).
<br />

<br />
Group mechanics are more important here, though.  This is due to the fact hat Group heroic opportunities can have a great impact on battle.  Thus, you do need to know which HOs to hit when to coordinate with your fellow group mates.  However, this equates to knowing which actions correcpond to which icon and hitting the appropriate hitkey to fire that action at the right time.  It would take little or no time to figure out which HOs worked best together (there ARE cases where you can have more than one action fit the same icon).  Thus, you really only have to know your own class, and which icons fit with which of your classes actions.  Once that is known, it's a matter of wachint the HO Wheel for an opportunity to strike.  To me, this makes the group tactics and interaction a bit too easy.  That said, it is, in my opinion, a good mechanic.  The least I can say is that it does promote, and provide an advantage, to grouping, where it does not provide any great disadvantage to soloing.
<br />

<br />
In EQ2, you have an indicator of how tough a mob is above and beyond hte con colors.  A small icon in the name would show that a critter was designed to be a group critter, or a single critter or a raid critter.  This would tell you up front wether or not to even attempt said critter and you wither move on, or you make your attempt.  Given that you have level limits in EQ2 (effectively the TLC code from EQ), there really is no incentive to come back and take down a critter that is a group or raid level critter alone when you have reached high enough level to solo it, you wont' get any drops, and since the con will be green by then, or grey, you probably won't get any exp.  Let me nail that concept down: the critters con color is level dependent, it's raiting for group or raid (or solo) is independent of level.  Thus, you can find yourself looking at a mob that is a Raid level Grey mob because it's a sufficent number of levels below you.  By the way: I did not see any raid level critters, that I recall, swhile I was doing EQ2, I freely admit that I'm extrapolating from the group level critters i observed.  that said, i'd be very surprised if I'm very far off track with this.  The key point is that you have a secondary method of gauging the difficulty of a mob and thus you have the ability to avoid/tackle mobs that are 'more' appropriate for your situation.  This takes a lot of guesswork out.
<br />

<br />
WoW:
<br />

<br />
Having played Diablo, and WoW, I can say first off, that there is a lot of similarity.  Diablo introduced the concept of the ability tree and WoW adopted this.  This tree allows a decent amount of individualization of character.  However, other than Priest, no character is at a disadvantage so far as soloing is concerned.  Sure, some do it better than others, but, all classes can solo in this game (with the possible exception of the Priest at low levels).  In short, characters in WoW are heroic in their ability.  I was able to either tank, or control the situation to my advantage with all of the classes I played, and I played all classes save the healing classes.
<br />

<br />
Pulling in WoW is a matter of Aggro radius.  If you can catch a critter pathed away from it's friends, you have a solo pull.  If you can't, you will get a multipull.  However, even with multipulls there are mechanisms for taking care of the adds.  Stun, Fear, Sap (similar to mez), or judicious use of a pet, to name a few, are abilities that will allow you to pare off a mob long enough to kill another.  Thus, you can certainly handle a double pull, triples begin to be a problem.  Worst case, run.  Critters in WoW have a short leash, if you run far enough, they will lose aggro, evade any attack, and return home.  That's right, I said they are immune while running back.  Thus, there is no peeling off mobs with an attack as they are returning home, but, rather, you have to go back and try the pull again from scratch.
<br />

<br />
In WoW, there are no group mechanics.  There is only that which makes sense.  ie: you put a tank and a healer together, and (assuming the healer doesn't think he's a tank too) they will do better than putting together two tanks.  However, since any class can stand alone, you will find that groups are just a bunch of soloists come together.  Rarely did I find a Priest who played a Priest.  Rather, I usually found a tank in Priests clothing who never remembered to heal during combat, but was proud that they could rez after everyone had died.  I have to mention that I took a perverse pride in soloing that which I'd been told I could NOT solo in WoW... I also have to tell you that normally i don't like soloing, there is nothing I like more than being in a group that manages to mesh skills and that feeling of invincibility you get when IN a group that meshes well.
<br />

<br />
&lt;note: bear with me, my eyes have been giving me problems of late, so, though I can still type, I can barely read what I'm saying, so, it's making reareading this to gather my thoughts and stay on track difficult.&gt;
<br />

<br />
WoW too has the usual method of conning mobs.  However, unlike EQ, they did a better job of getting the Con on the money.  Ie: if you see an even con, odds are about 50/50 of beating that mob, blue con mobs were fairly easy, greens I can do in droves... fact is, I was able to do reds and oranges (beyond red) with fair ease too... so, maybe I shouldn't say right on but rather overconned.  However, the effect was about right.  If I saw an even con, I knew I could solo it, where as in EQ, if I see an even con, I'm pretty sure I can NOT solo it... in fact, blues in EQ are a test.  That said, there is such a think as an 'Elite" critter in WoW.  This is evidenced by a flare around the target window when targetting the elite critter.  It means that the mob is, essencially, underconned.  However, it's only underconned by a level or two.  I was always able to solo these mobs, I just had to wait one, maybe two, levels beyond the level the mob was intended for.
<br />

<br />
The society in WoW is oddly lacking... and oddly reversed.  I found more folks on the Horde side (evils) willing to give me a hand, and fewer folks begging for handouts, than I did on the Alliance (good) side.  That said, it may well be because i was mostly with the Christmas crowd, and thus with the children on break, but, the overal tenor of the conversations and community was very sniping and caustic.  There were a few calm and stable souls but they were very much crowded out by the rest.  Part of the evidence of this was names.  In WoW I fund a lot more 'caustic' names than I ever saw in EQ (or EQ2).  That said, I'm seeing more and more names in EQ that are... let's just say unsavory.  What irks me about that is that they are often with punctuation (which means a GM had to be involved in the name).  Suffice it to say that I found the siciety in WoW to be lacking, where I did not find it lacking in EQ (or EQ2).
<br />

<br />
In sum:
<br />

<br />
The upside to making classes soloable is that it minimizes down time.  Can't find a group?  Go off and tackle solo content until you can.  The downside is that with no class dependent on others, there is no incentive to group.  further, even when grouped, there is little incentive for the group to really work together to greater advantage.  The greatest example of this that I can think of is what a group does with adds.  In the newer games, an add is handled by someone peeling off and soloing it.  While this is a valid tactic, the fact is that if I can kill as fast solo as I can in group, why group?  If I'm going to be soloing critters in a group, I'm doing nothing that I would not do outside the group.  Further, with no real challenge, there is no need to innovate and come up with new ways to get the classes to work together to greater advantage.
<br />

<br />
This leads to the concept, and importance, of tactics.  If I never have to be innovative about how I take down mobs, it means that I can develop a strategy early in the game and use it through the whole game.  I never really have to change tactics so much as adjust them for new abilities I may gain.  There is no need for researching a method for taking down a specific mob, it will be the same as the last umpteen mobs you took down.  This leads to a stagnant feeling in a game.  Sure, you can play it through again with a second class, or a third, but, after you've tried a few, there it's the same thing over again.  I found this to be especially true of each of the new games.  Even though they are flooded with quests, few of the quests are individualized by race or class.  Thus, if you play a new character, you'll find yourself marching through the same quests... unless you go out of your way to research different ones.  Even this ability is eventualy limited, quicker in some cases (WoW) than others EQ2... CoH falls somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.
<br />

<br />
In the overall, I feel that the games have been dumbed down and much too far.  Pulling is too easy, where it's interesting and I'm forced to adapt to new situations in EQ, I'm not forced into that adaptaion with any of these new games.  While being able to wade through mobs without a care can be fun for a while, ultimately it becomes boring and trite and will not hold the player in the long run.
<br />

<br />
Having a standalone class is fun, while it lasts, but, it doesn't force me to be innovative and thus to grow with the class.  The only growing I do is the obvious growth: leveling.  Without new innovation, and new content really doesn't cut it unless it challenges you to innovate, a game grows stagnent.
<br />

<br />
Society is key.  Being in a society that doesn't reach out and help you can be fun but over time it wears on you and makes the environment caustic and unfun.  Yes, I know that there isn't much that a game design can do to infuence this, but, that effort should be made as a fun environmnent is, ultimately, a more attractive one.
<br />

<br />
I look at most of this and can't help but look back through the years of EQ and the whines that I've read and can't help but think that the dumbing down of hte games was essentially begged for by we the players.  This is especially true, and evidenced iin the new games, by the changing of classes to be standalone as seen in reflection over the years of the 'grass is greener' whines I've read.  Each class, somewhere along the line, has LOUDLY, argued that their class was no good because some other class can do something better.  Which can be translated to: my class doesn't stand alone.  In the short run, standing alone is fun, it makes you feel powerful, in the long run working with ohters to greater affect is better.  It makes for a lot more fun over a much longer time.
<br />

<br />
I'm hiping this came out fairly cogent and will spark debate not on the different games but on the mechanics being adopted by new designs in games.  I personally don't want to play a glorified FPS when I pick up a new MMRPG, I want to play in an environment where I can do well on my own but have great incentive, and reward, from playing with others.  I know that none of these games has really hit the mark: EQ is not very good for soloing, the others have made things too easy in some fashion.  Hopefully, we can come up with some ideas as to how to HIT that mark and make the next generation of games better.
<br />

Oh, if you read this far, kudos to you... Sorry about being long winded especially since I can't currently read, not well in any case, what I'm typing (odd as that sounds, my eyes are just not focusing well), but, it's a subjec that i've been building up to since experimenting with the other games and since I'm a test engineer (I can't help but compare and contrast what I feel is working, and what's not, because of that training).... and thanks for reading this far.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /><br />_________________<br />GnarliAnna

Interesting thoughts on the major games I have to say. I keep hope that sooner or later a game will hit that "mark" for me. I haven't tried WoW yet (hope to soon) and of course Vanguard is on the horizon. EQ2 has come pretty damn close to being an ideal game for my playstyle. 
<br />

<br />
Overall, I'd say that at least from the EQ &lt;-&gt; EQ2 comparison you were right on the money Gnarl. Will be interesting to see what others think about the direction game mechanics are taking.<br />_________________<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Quote of the Week:</span>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Yeah I seldom read anything in this area, but the title of this post (after edit?) popped up on the index that one could see from the Runes Forum Index, and made me curious enough to read.  It's interesting how calm the author is.  And as a result, I see a lot of arguments about games are really just because many of us have different play styles.  And the most important thing is try to find a game that offers our own play style.
<br />

<br />
For me, I disagree with several things Gnarl stated, but it only comes down to different tastes.  I will try to state them and hope you all see this is not meant to be a final say either.
<br />

<br />
EQ2's visible tags of "solo" and "group" above the mobs jar me out of a fantasy world.  So does its pop-up Heroic Opportunity.  I feel like I'm playing a video game instead of living in a fantasy world where the monsters wander and I as an adventurer need to observe the enemy's movements and figure things out for myself.
<br />

<br />
WoW's big yellow exclamation marks on quest NPCs have the same problem; but for some reason I can forgive it, probably because after a few weeks in EQ2, I grew tired of clicking on every NPC to try to find a quest that I would enjoy.  EQ2 tried to make all the towns real by populating them with a ton of NPCs, but that made getting a quest that suits the player's interest more difficult.  An EQ friend of mine went to try EQ2, and told me he hated it because "the NPCs hassle you."
<br />

<br />
I had played Diablo and did not like it.  Yet I like WoW.  Part of it is I think the combat in WoW is more realistic.  The mobs are congregated around a camp and some of them wander around, which seems very natural from a fantasy's perspective; and as an adventurer I watch them and try to pull the soloing mobs if I'm alone.   With a group we charge into the dense camps.  Only natural.
<br />

<br />
True EQ is a much more tactical game.  Many smart players in EQ have gotten group dynamics down to a science.  The abundant static mobs still seem unnatural to me though.  Plus, if someone in a group and does one thing wrong, everyone jumps on you.  If a tank is poorly equipped, people snicker behind his back and reject him from groups.  In the end I felt EQ became a very elitist world.  For me, that's jut not to my taste.  There was a MMORPG personality test link in the General section of the Runes, and I came out "Socializer, Explorer, Achiever, Killer."  Achievement means a lot less to me than socializing and exploring.  I think that's why camping at one spot bored me.  I love running around doing all sorts of quests in WoW completing each quest area in about 30 min to an hour's time and moving on to another part of the world to explore.   I like discovering a nook here, a stream there with its various mobs around.  I like watching some poor clerics giggle as they say, "I was busy trying to heal the mob."  It all makes the world more fun for me.
<br />

<br />
I like a world where people are not expected to be top-geared and top in tactics.  Socializing, to me, means meeting people of all kinds of personalities and abilities.
<br />

<br />
In EQ I was getting less and less of that because the game punished bad players.  I like casual fun; but many times hunting seemed to be a job more than fun as people all tried hard to perform to the top of their abilities in EQ.  Some players who broke mezz would apologize and say, "I hope you will group with me next time.  Sorry I made a mistake."  And I had to tell them not to worry at all.  And they seemed so relieved, it just didn't feel right to me.  Why should people be expected to be "working" when they are "playing"?
<br />

<br />
Very true.  Hehehe, my WoW pally was healing every priest I had ever grouped with.  I guess EQ did train us well enough.  Maybe that's why people add my pally to their friend lists a lot.  Thanks to EQ's training grounds.
<br />

<br />
EQ is still the game for the intelligent players.  I admire people who enjoy EQ.  But it's just not right for me.  If you enjoy tactical combat and performing to tough standards, and trying to obtain the top gears, EQ is a great game full of challenges.
<br />

<br />
If you enjoy a casual style of play, WoW is great and down to earth as far as socializing.  I have met many nice people in WoW.  Usually I'm very forgiving on players who make tactical mistakes.  I just feel I'm in an adventurous world where there will bound to be poor fighters, clerics, etc.  (Actually though I'm finding many ex-EQ people in WoW now, and there are some very good players around.)  I feel there is incentive to group since the kill tasks are always faster with a group, and there are many quests (once you pass level 20) that can be done more efficiently by a group.  There doesn't seem to be any trouble finding a group.  I'm in groups every night, and am on many people's friend lists.
<br />

<br />
If you like a fantasy world that is rich with Renaissance atmosphere where you can feel you live in a novel, EQ2 is probably the place.  I think the EQ2 team took a lot of time putting many stories into the world.  But one thing I did not like was the interface.   In many cases the interface was just cumbersome.  Wish it had EQ's interface.

If I never have to be innovative about how I take down mobs, it means that I can develop a strategy early in the game and use it through the whole game.  I never really have to change tactics so much as adjust them for new abilities I may gain.  There is no need for researching a method for taking down a specific mob, it will be the same as the last umpteen mobs you took down.  This leads to a stagnant feeling in a game.  Sure, you can play it through again with a second class, or a third, but, after you've tried a few, there it's the same thing over again.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
I don't find the lack of tactics stagnant because I'm a socializer.  For me, being able to solo while LFG is like having a nice bar stool to sit in a bar where I can glance around and meet people.  And people of all types of skills and personalities are what keeps a MMORPG game interesting for me.  EQ in the end was getting boring for me because no matter where we hunted, it was the same tactics of "pulling", "CC", "tank", "heal", "debuff", "dps".  That felt stagnant to me.  In fact, I grouped once in EQ2, and immediately saw hunting in EQ2 was built around the same formula.  That was when I decided to quit the game.  I wanted a game where I can socialize without elitism, adventure without having to "work".
<br />

<br />
And be surprised by the outcome when my group rushes a camp.
<br />

<br />
In WoW, I never know what the outcome of a rush for my group toward a camp would be.  Will the cleric next to me freeze and forget to heal? Will the mage over nuke and be killed?  Will we all focus right and get the mobs killed before we are?  It's fun to not know the answer.  It feels real, like I'm just one adventurer in a straggling group, combating madly in a mayhem, trying to keep an eye on all of my teammates to make up for any flaw that may happen any moment due to any number of things.  Because there is no pre-set formula for our tactics.  Everything is on the fly.  That makes it exciting for me.  If we die, I watch how each group member respond.  It's the display of human nature that makes it fun for me.
<br />

<br />
In EQ I can predict most of the fights.  My group always works perfectly 99% of the time.  That makes me fall asleep.
<br />

<br />
I think for others who love a team tactical challenge, EQ is the best game.   EQ2 might be a bit in between WoW and EQ.
<br />

<br />
Even in WoW though, every class needs to think a bit to do well in soloing.  The inept players die a lot while soloing.
<br />

<br />
The trouble I see for all of these MMORPG games is how they will fare in the long run.  EQ is now suffering from all old contents being obsolete.  One day both WoW and EQ2 will reach the same situation where 80% of the older zones are like wastelands.  How should the newer players be brought up to meet the older characters?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Hmm, I've never noticed this kind of attitude.  I've seen people compare gear, and different tanks compare stats to see who should be MA, but I've never seen people get laughed at or kicked out of a group because they didn't have the latest and greatest.  Assuming of course they weren't level 60 and still in bronze...
<br />

<br />
I played UO for a few years and really enjoyed it, for the most part.  I agree about the PvP though, and *hated* that aspect (that you could get killed at any time).  Too many people took advantage of that, and there weren't enough people to self-regulate the PKers.  But I was involved with a player city (Avalon, on the Baja shard), and it was pretty friendly.  We cooperated with other player cities and held events.
<br />

<br />
I remember reading about UO before it came out.  I had all these crazy ideas, before I really knew what was possible.  I read about the craft skills, and that you could be a lumberjack to collect wood, or a miner to collect ore.  I thought I'd be able to actually see trees cut down, and that I could strip a forest bare, then hold all the lumber for ransom.  It's probably a good thing you can't do that, seeing how mean some people can get in-game.
<br />

<br />
I also joked with friends about selling food, but poisoning it.  Then have a partner with a shack just down the road who sold cure potions.  You could poison food in UO, but it didn't really do much.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, yeah, there were good groups in UO that were friendly and some were very creative!  I really like the open-endedness of it.
<br />

<br />
Hmm.  I have a lot more to say, but I'm starting to ramble.  I agree with what you said about UO and EQ. I haven't played any others yet, but don't like the dumbing-down aspect.  I'd like to see an MMORPG that uses more tactics, strategy, and planning.

They don't get kicked out of a group.  They get rejected behind their backs druing the LFG process.  Many times when I suggested to invite a tank that was LFG, someone will say, "Not him.

I posted this to rants because I was afraid that I'd get too flamey myself and that the subject might still be SO hot as to cause problems.  This IS a comparison of EQ2 and WoW, as well as EQ and some other games.  I intended it to be more a commentary on the direction that games seem to be taking, and some thoughts as to why they are going that way.  Judging by the current comments, it seems I hit the mark... I was worried I'd missed because, as I said in the post, I literally was having problems reading it back so I just stuck to my guns and didn't edit and rewrite as I wrote (which I normally do).  Feel free to move it to the general boards, or even Dev corner, as it's truly not a rant... I was just worried it would turn into one (given my track record, not an idle concern).  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
All:
<br />

<br />
I see, and agree to an extent, with the point about being elitiest.  For my part, I've never turned down a person for subpar gear.  I am reticent about asking someone who absolutely refuses to use even minimally reasonable group tactics to join my group.  I'm ok with new tactics and learning, I'm NOT ok with folks doing stupid things when the chips are flying.  Gear, I find, is NOT as important as quality play.  I know that gear can be more telling with some of the mobs, but, I feel that knowing your class, your gear limitations and acting accordingly is key in ALL situations.
<br />

<br />
I too seek fun.  Often, EQ is not much fun anymore because my group(s) also are strack.  We may not be uber geared but we KNOW what we are doing and we can debate many classes points of views and often come up with multiple tactics for a given situation.  The thing is that that ability, that 'professionalism', came about because we had to develop it to survive and get ahead in the game.  If I'm not challenged by a game, I'll be bored more quickly than if I am challenged by it.
<br />

<br />
I'm not discounting socialising and I mean no slight to it.  I've lasted as long in EQ as I have because of the long standing friendships I've made in the game.  The thing that keeps me going in groups is exactly that socialising... but, I'm more awake and aware when in a new situation that I have to face, socialising with the same friends, than I am when I'm facing an old hat situation, with the same friends.
<br />

<br />
An example from EQ is LDoN adventures.  Doing a NRo LDoN for the 300th time is still doing that same map for the same objectives the 75th time (or there abouts).  I can almost do those maps blindfolded and pull them in my sleep.  Don't get me wrong, I like LDoNs, I think it was the single best expansion in the game (this reveals that I'm not into the 'end game' nor am I an uber raider but...)... but... it get's old.  It get's to a point where it's no longer a challenge.
<br />

<br />
Now, take a new game, with characters that can all solo.  That means that the reasons to group are two fold: social and efficiency.  You aren't really doing it for the challenge, save the case where you intentionally go for content out of your league (but you can do that solo), you are doing it to knock out content more quickly.  The point is that with the challenge gone, you are not... well, challenged.  My ideal world has both the challenge AND the society.  So, I can adventure, explore, socialize and feel like I've accomplished something while doing this.  That's missing, for me, in the new games.  The society is there in all cases, but, the challenge is not.  In a nutshell, it's like playing Chutes and Ladders in your teens.  When you were 6 it was a hoot, but in later years you realize there is no challenge to it, no bite, and it loses it's draw.
<br />

<br />
I think that challenge has to be an integral part of a game for it to have longevity.  What I'm saying here is that sure, new games can come out and make a splash and a profit, but, if they are lacking in either Challenge or Society (to name two facets) you will find they have no longevity.<br />_________________<br />GnarliAnna

They don't get kicked out of a group.  They get rejected behind their backs druing the LFG process.  Many times when I suggested to invite a tank that was LFG, someone will say, "Not him.

<br />

<br />
Those two issues are not the same thing however. Not even for warriors.  A warrior who knows his stuff can keep aggro with sub-par weaponry.
<br />

<br />
Rejecting a tank because he can't keep aggro is like rejecting an enchanter because he can't handle an add, or rejecting a cleric because he only ever casts Cheal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
When a game is about tactical challenge for a group, it is only natural for people to want to optimize a group in order to play at the top form of tactics.  This is why EQ tends to encourage elitism.  Toward the end of my EQ days, I was at the top end, and saw folks even rejecting the 2nd top rogue because the top rogue was also in the run for my group.  It just made me feel bad.
<br />

<br />
I agree though tactics does make a game fun.  The thrill of being among top players who all know their stuff is elating; and many of them are nice people.  They are not all snooty.  They just want to try for excellence.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I see their drives and admire them.  But at the same time, EQ was already winding down.  We were having difficulty finding good tanks.  One night my cleric friend moaned at the idea of healing a lesser tank so I watched the lone average-geared warrior LFG for 3 hours while we hunted with an uber beastlord to tank for us instead.  Well, It made me feel bad because, I thought to myself, "He's a nice person, and he's there all by himself LFG.  He may end up leaving EQ."  So I told my group, "We need to take him along, so we can help him develop into a stronger tank."  Well, unfortunately by the time I said this, he had logged.  I never saw him again.
<br />

<br />
EQ designers might have tried to make the game more thrilling in challenges, but it may also have driven away many players that way.  
<br />

<br />
There were other times though, that I had gone out of my way to help young tanks rise, only to see them acting snooty themselves once they did gain good AA and gears.  One turned me down for a group in a flash when he was able to tank in MPG and did not really need a chanter there.  Such is the way of life.  We've all been at both ends of optimal grouping.
<br />

<br />
I think the way to design an MMORPG game to offer tactical challenge lies in developing new styles of challenges that will involve all range of players, including their skill, gear, time available for play.
<br />

<br />
WoW will eventually have challenge on the Battlegrounds, and from what I hear, it will take tactical strategy.  Intelligent players who can lead huge armies with good strategy will become the generals.  Social types like me can go ferry supplies back and forth.  The less geared, less skilled players will some have something to do.  I hope that will work.
<br />

<br />
EQ's big raids is sort of like that too.  Less skilled players can ride along in those raids.  Maybe that's why raids are so popular.  Some classes such as enchanters were pretty boring to play in raids, but I think some classes will be more bored on the Battlegrounds too.  Warlocks, maybe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

It is why I like the idea of some sort of exp or loot bonus for groups that take on this challenge.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Great post Gnarl. I'd agree in general except on a few points.
<br />

<br />
There IS an incentive to group in WoW, but pretty much only in instances. The content there is imo every bit as  challenging and fun as old EQ1 if you tackle level-appropriate content. 
<br />

<br />
Regarding the community, I'd say that regarding the pick up crowd, you're right on the money, and skill level in groups is abysmally low, far far below EQ's level. Virtually everyone I've met did not communicate at all after joining the group, and looted every mob they could as soon as it fell if the loot was set at "free for all". Basically it was a bunch of soloers put together in a group and with a single exception every single group I was in worked this way. I think it's interesting that our experience is pretty much the same in that regard.
<br />

<br />
Regarding the game itself, I find that in the more interesting places (instances), WoW is by very far the better game of the three. Better game mechanics, faster paced, more interesting events for single groups. WoW works pretty much the same as EQ except it solved a couple of issues: Little discrepancy between the different classes soloing ability, and no way to single pull beyond picking off roamers. Pulling in EQ lead to all sort of problems, which eventually led to Mob inflation that went out of control and dumbed down the game in it's current tank/healer paradigm. You can still pull in WoW, without the EQ2 incredibly dumbed down system, but groups of mobs usually simply won't split, and this is very, very good, especially with no class really standing out in CC ability, putting the burden of actually having to think and react on every party member. The group content, while admittedly easier as a general rule (but not always), is also much more refined, with mobs along PC power but with special abilities and variety. that you'd usually only find on raid mobs in EQ (AE silence, teleport, charm, etc).
<br />

<br />
This in itself is a very solid base, but it doesn't mean that in the long run that WoW will be the "best" game. Right now it's pretty much only an empty shell, and they are faced with problems associated with the faster leveling. All these nice quests they designed and put hundreds and thousands of hours in are being completed in minutes - in other words, most of the (nice) content they designed is being used up rapidly and they are already faced with the problem of keeping their existing customers.
<br />

<br />
Another problem is that much of their development is devoted to pvping. No offense to the pvpers out there, but this is a dead end. Class balance is even more of an issue in pvp, and pvpers are a loud, high maintenance customer base. As Verant and then sony discovered, you won't get anywhere heading in that direction.
<br />

<br />
So while WoW pretty much stands out as being the best game out there if you go down to the basics, somehow I can't really say it's the best overall game out there. Blizzard is running into problems that quite a few people predicted: Battlenet crowd hurting the community, game too easy, leveling too fast burning up their carefully designed content, lack of content at level 60, and no significant solution to that last problem in sight. They'll have to react pretty fast - something that so far hasn't been part of the blizzard paradigm.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">There is no doubt that EQ is extremely elitist - most of the raid guilds won't group outside guild, or guilds at an equivalent tier; and that's on a very low pop server (Venril Sathir).  Most people in those guilds won't do pickups at all.
<br />

<br />
The reason for this is that, contrary to some posters, gear matters more than skill.  A well geared cleric at 65-70 (and, let's face it, there are no groups below 65) is going to be able to keep a group going in WoS and above; without max ft and tons of extra mana, WoS is their limit, even at 70.  Same goes for other classes.
<br />

<br />
Having no option outside of grouping, which didn't used to be the case pre PoP, means that without fresh blood, you quit.  The raid game is a distraction, one that has kept many people going for years.  EQ has two big problems at the moment, both of which SOE are in denial about - solo group and raid have to be equal in value, with equal rewards; and mobs mustn't scale above players.  WoW has the second one about right, I think.  In EQ, raid gear should never have inflated above tradeskill gear, that is the major cause of discrimination.
<br />

<br />
Without being an alt, a new starter in EQ today doesn't have a clear path through to max level, AAs and gear.  At some point, they have to be carried for a long distance by friends/guild to jump the tracks.  There should always be an opportunity to make a valuable contribution, either to a group, or to your own experience/gear by soloing.  SOE have designed for the max gear/AA player only.
<br />

<br />
About PvP: it really turns me off, but EQ has never given PvP a chance.  Personally, I'm pleased about that.  But it seems to me that making the top end game being mainly PvP would be viable; DAoC seems to have carried it off for years.  In EQ, PvP has never been a viable option, so it is unfair to use EQ as an anti-PvP example.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Great read.  I can't comment about EQ2, not having played it (or owning a computer capable since I have a nvidia MX420 video card, from what I've read).
<br />

<br />
I will comment on a few WoW observations.  There are tactics involved, but some are more subtle, possibly merely less developed since the game is quite newer than EQ.  Let me elaborate:  
<br />

<br />
FD pulling was created by EQ players.  Quad kiting, agro kiting, Green pet pulling, and rune tanking were all created by players.  These tactics developed over years, not weeks or months.  Verant (and SoE to a lesser extent) put power in player's hands to develop tactics.
<br />

<br />
In WoW, my main is a rogue.  I read a lot on the wow boards about the uselessness of a top end talent - Vigor (gives the rogue permanent +10 energy).  People posted "how often during a fight do you regen your energy to full?"  My answer - "while soloing higher lever mobs, several times."  In one encounter against several mobs, I encouraged another rogue in my group to attempt "multi sapping", basically sapping grouped targets at the same time.  It works, and works very well.  There are tactics in WoW.  For a good shaman, earthbound totem kiting is excellent - more so in PvP, but it works in PvE nonetheless.  Pet tanking (to handle adds or to replace a missing warrior  / paladin) also works.  Soloing on my druid, cat form shreds casters and bear form helps me take down higher AC and melee damage mobs.
<br />

<br />
The thing about WoW that minimizes the use of creative tactics is that most mobs are roughly equivalent to players in terms of AC and HP, but lacking the multitude of abilities and spells players have at their disposal.  While you can't simply hit autoattack and afk (except perhaps playing a hunter lol), mobs do die fast.  Everything dies fast - especially in a full group.  If something is dead in 10-15 seconds, who cares who's tanking/slowing/mezzing?  This is the downside of creating a game that allows players to solo even con mobs.
<br />

<br />
I've seen the good and bad in WoW groups.  I've wiped to greens in instances because nobody snared (hell - half the players are like "snare?  what's that?") or finished off a runner.  I've seen shaman show up to instance groups that didn't bring any self-rez reagent.
<br />

<br />
I also completed every quest in Western Plaguelands (except the boss in Anderhol) with one group in about 4-5 hours that was avereage level 52.  We had to kill elites +5 of our level, often 2 at a time.  As I reached 50+ in WoW, I noticed that the quality of groups generally improved.  Of course, since it's easy to grind to 60 in the game, level is by no means a guarantee of competency.
<br />

<br />
One somewhat disturbing thing about WoW and tactics is the developers have plainly let it be known that certain player actions are "exploits".  Example would be hunter FD pulling to split out mobs in a certain raid instance or two.  I'm sure there are others that Blizzard has labeled as exploits.  Right now, I'm not sure how I feel about that - but what is apparent is Blizz has placed some limits on player creativity.  Not saying that Verant or SoE haven't done the same thing, but Blizz has done it quickly.
<br />

<br />
One thing about the games you didn't mention were the economies.  To be honest, my initial impressions are that the fundamental game design of WoW in this respect is one that severely limits mudflation.  As the game exists, the best items in the game are Bind on Pickup (both dropped and player quested).  What this means is that the things you need in-game money for are:
<br />

<br />
Repair bills (minimal)
<br />
Consumables / Reagents (higher for some classes than others)
<br />
Level 40 mount (90g and worth every copper)
<br />
Level 60 mount (900g and meant to be a time/moneysink)
<br />

<br />
I recently ran across a post (on blizz boards) consisting of a familiar rant - high end player crafted Armor and Weapons are extremely difficult/expensive to farm/obtain the components to create, and it's generally easier to get dropped/quested items for the time invested.  In my opinion, this is as it should be.  Why?  Well, if player-crafted items (or Bind on Equip - tradeable drops) were the same/better than relatively common instance BoP drops, people could just farm IGE/Yantis for their items (read pay $ for gold) instead of playing the game.
<br />

<br />
WoW is certainly an easier game to play than EQ was for me.  Add in the virtually no-penalty death system, and you get a game that attracts many more people than EQ ever did (and makes most of us more experienced players a lot more forgiving of mistakes).  As you elegantly noted, this is working as intended.  The result is, of course, the community does suffer with the influx of FPS players and general asshats.  What will the community be in the long run?
<br />

<br />
One final note - I created my first Alliance player yesterday (on a different server since I'm PvP) and I pretty much immediately left general chat.  Horde chat on my server, even in Orgrimmar, is not so annoying that I leave it.  On another server, another faction, it was just painful.  Like WoW but hate your community?  Switch factions/servers - gg.<br />_________________<br /><span style="color: darkblue">

I'm hoping all the FPS gamers in WoW will quickly level to 60 and leave out of boredom.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Many strong ex-EQ players seem to have picked WoW to be their home for now; and these good players might just stay and develop strategies like you said; and they will eventually be the creative sources that help make WoW a great home for all players.  Somehow when I look at instanced WoW dungeons I keep seeing signs they were designed with inputs from top EQ guild leaders.

I made a new chat window and named it "Public", and put general and trade in it, leaving "General" to be for group chat, whispers, LFG, and defense only.  90% of the time I don't read the "Public" channel.  It's fun to only glance at it occasionally.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">For me: skill > gear.  I've had more problems with folks in uber gear who wipe the group in nothing flat because they can't think beyond their own gear.  Basically, they'd assume that since they had uber gear, everyone else must have, and charge into the fray with no thought of who was backing them up.  Conversely, the folks who don't have uber gear seemed to be forced to work well with their team to get the most out of the group opportunity.  Rather than relying on the gear, they relied on their abilities.  Now, the caveat: we can all pull out examples that sway this either way.  Suffice it to say that Gear and Skill are about equaly important... and imo, should be in future games.
<br />

<br />
In short: you should constantly be pressed to upgrade gear to improve but this need should never be so criitcal that it can create a skill vacuum.  Rather, the two should be complimentary.  Ie: if you get uber_gear_01 which makes you a stat god, you can consistantly stick your foot in it and get clobbered.  Someone with decent gear, and decent skill should, largely, be equivalent to someone with uber gear and no skill OR BAD gear and uber skill.  But, that's an ideal world (and admittedly, my opinion of that world).
<br />

<br />
As for WoW, as a soloist, I found a lot of tactics.  Pulling singles took a LOT of skill.  I could pull singles readily in all save a very few situations I found with all but one of the classes I played (which, again, was all classes save the healers).  Rogues: Sap and kill duels, range pull for others.  Hunter, pull at range, stun if you get a double to split the two, and pet on the incoming.  Mage, range pull for single, freeze any adds.  Warlok, range pulls or stuns, single the left overs.  Etc.  Paladin was the only class I had problems pulling singles with and that class could handle up to three at even or +2 levels, so, I was not very interested in working on single pulls so much (and yes, I know there are techniques for the Paladins to be the premiere pullers, they just didn't fit my role as Paladin AND weren't necessary).
<br />

<br />
I constantly worked mobs 2 and 3 levels my senior in WoW, there was no incentive not to.  The only incentive was the typical incentive: melee versus caster could be dicey.
<br />

<br />
In group, there was no need for tactics, so, all my care and skill as a soloiest... well most of it.. went out the window.  It was just bash away.  I missed needing to work together.  Wether elitist or not, I like being challenged and didn't feel that in WoW.  Ok, there were times when I managed to fubar and overpull, or pull just the wrong mob and I was dead before I knew what hit me, but, that rarely happened and as pointed out the near zero death effects made it meaningless to me.  I'd just go back and rework the scenario.
<br />

<br />
This was made abundantly clear to me when I was clearing the Glaive.  I soloed and Elite with my Hunter, that was at least a level my senior, without even realizing it... I found out it was elite when I looked up to check if the mob was dead yet and realized it had the flames around it's name!  This was just as it died and it went down barely any harder than any other mob.
<br />

<br />
One thing I have to make abundently clear here: I enjoy playing WoW, EQ, EQ2 and CoH, and even aspects of UO.  However, so far, only EQ has the staying power I want.  I want future games to learn from these games and get better.  Unfortunately, i see a lot of improvement in the new games but I don't see them as "better" in the overall.  The key element missing for me is that challenge, that <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> to group that should go hand in hand with the desire to group.
<br />

<br />
Edit: reread it and made a minor tweak for clarity.<br />_________________<br />GnarliAnna
