<br />After some thinking and catching up on some posts I put together an updated Enchanter Code as haewud originally asked someone to keep it going and well.. I was bored tonight. Feel free to add anything you want.
<br />
<br />My Enchanter Code:

<br />Manual:
<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></dt><dd><code>Enchanter Code v0.3 &#40;Originally Created by haewud&#41;<br /><br />-= Instructions =- <br /><br />The Enchanter Code consists of several categories. Each category is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers. Go through each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category. By stringing all of these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall enchanter code. It is this single line of code that will inform other enchanters the world over of what a great enchanter you actually are. <br /><br />Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. It is impossible to cover all possibilities in each category. Simply choose that qualifier that most closely matches you. <br /><br />After you have determined each of your qualifiers, you need to the construct your ENCHANTER CODE BLOCK. Instructions are provided on how to do this towards the end of this file. <br /><br />Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there can be a big difference between a 'w' and a 'W'. <br /><br />-= Variables =- <br /><br />Enchanters can seldom be strictly quantified. To facilitate the fact that within any one category the enchanter may not be able to determine a specific rating, variables have been designed to allow this range to be included. <br /><br />@ <br />for this variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with time or with individual interaction. <br /><br />&#40;&#41; <br />for indicating &quot;cross-overs&quot; or ranges. <br /><br />&gt; <br />for 'wannabe' ratings. Indicating that while the enchanter is currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another. <br /><br />$ <br />Indicates that this particular category is done for plat. <br /><br />? <br />Unless stated otherwise within the specific category, the ? is placed after the category identifier and indicates that the enchanter has no specific knowledge about that specific category. <br /><br />! <br />Placed BEFORE the category. Unless stated otherwise, indicates that the person does not participate in this category. This is unlike the ? variable as the ? indicates lack of knowledge, while the ! indicates lack of participation. <br /><br />LEVEL <br />E#Num./&lt;server&gt;&nbsp; I am an enchanter.

Take each category you determined and list them all together with one space between each one. If you run out space on one line, continue it on the next. When completed, it will look something like the following: <br /><br />E67.86/Pr h++ 2.1khp 4.7km ft6 G e++&#40;+&#41; o--- T++++++ L H! f+++ g !b c++++ !t D !X FP !FG !FO !E S- FE++ TR-- !GT<br /><br />If you are going to place your Enchanter Code into your .signature or .plan file &#40;highly recommended&#41;, it is also recommended that you include a link to the version of Enchanter Code you're using.

<br />I won't get those lvl 68 ones unless I happen to trip over a rune. Don't need the single Alendar etc and have the higher group version anyway, as well as high level charm, so... not bothered about the rest. Or rather in no particular hurry.
