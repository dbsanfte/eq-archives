I loved playing.. I spent alot of time doing so.  you don't do that unless you are having fun.  I don't regret any of the time I played.
<br />

<br />
in the end I saw that I was logging on because the raid organizations needed me and for my friends in my guild.  I wasn't logging on because the class was great.  I saw what sony was doing and decided it wasn't for me.  its not that I never 'truely loved the game,' its that what I played when I started was turned into something I didn't want.  (and I wasn't even around as long as alot of the others)
<br />

<br />
so next time you want to act pretentious toward those who quit.. you might want to remember who you are talking about, and that just maybe we have been through a little more than you with our class?  Maybe you didn't mean to be so negative in what you said and im just reading to much into it, but I don't like being trivialized.  
<br />

<br />
if you are having fun.. great! have fun.  im certainly not going to try and talk you out of it.. why would I?  but I don't wanna be told why I quit.  I don't need to be held up to whatever justification you think is necessary.  I know why I do what I do.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<span class="postbody">well thats how it generally works.. that has nothing to do with eq or sony.  thats the nature of not being satisfied, but that is quite different than saying that all those people hated the game and left because they didn't truely love it.  why would all those people get upset over something they never enjoyed?
<br />

<br />
just because someone left doesn't mean they were less of an enchanter than someone that stayed... thats all im saying.  I loved the idea of the enchanter class before I even started.. after reading the descriptions, I KNEW thats what I had to be.. and I stuck with it up until I cancelled.  my enchanter was the first toon I had and the last one I ever logged on.  my only other toon was a ranger that I got to 56 because I was trying not to level past my friends so fast.

oh and the people that bitch all the time for any reason no matter what.. yes.. they all went to wow.  you can see them on the boards haha.  at least they are consistant <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Thought I recognised that name - one of Trin's Nyaalings. Hello.
<br />

<br />
Yep, I'd agree that Stromm is still pretty healthy. It's nowhere near as populated as it used to be in prior to WoW and EQ2 which can easily be seen by the fact the bazaar traders have halfed in population. But it's still managing to produce the usual amount of OOC flame wars in the more favoured grinding areas.
<br />

<br />
Amongst the returnees on Stromm is myself. I left for two months of EQ2 but I've come back as there were too many things on EQ2 that I thought had gone backwards. My beloved tradeskills was one of the biggest backward steps taken in EQ2 and I consider it completely criminal that gnomes are not permitted to tinker any more. I may go back to EQ2 again later but at the moment there are just too many things which stick in my craw especially the extremely prefferential treatment given to guilds over unguilded players conferred by the city status system.
<br />

<br />
Yes, Stromm appears to have taken a big hit with a number of even the larger guilds taking mortal woundings but even amongst the tiny guild I belong to we are seeing what appears to be a trickle of players back to EQ.

No one in their right mind would stick with a class as far as you did on a server as liable to disruption and alteration as Test Server unless they really loved the class they played........ mind you I can't remember a time when anyone has ever accused you of being in your right mind. <img src="images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Yes, I'd have to agree with you that that statement was just a bit too general. Quite a lot of those who left did so precisly because they did love being an enchanter and couldn't bare to see what had happened to their class. They didn't stop loving the class just couldn't cope which what had become of it. That's a sentiment I understand and sympathise with even though for my part I've chosen to stay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

And exactly where did someone say that ONLY those that stayed loved the game, please quote?
<br />
No one said ONLY those that are left truly loved the game, that is an obtuse misinterpretation, at least I certainly DID NOT say that and I'm looking at mine and Fading's posts right now. There is no need to look so hard for an insult in a generally positive post, because that's what it is, a positive post saying we still like the game. This was not a personal attack saying that Aithur did not truly love EQ. How you could read that just boggles me. 
<br />
I'm sorry that you misinterpreted the post and I'm sure you loved playing EQ, as I still do.

therefore implying that those that left do not love the game.

I don't think you have to go far to get that out what was stated, but I already said that I may have infered more out of the post than what the poster intended.  I was just being clear on my point of view.
<br />

<br />
but I don't think my interpretation was 'obtuse' at all.  you can say that my interpretation was wrong, fine, but I don't think it was unreasonable.

You falsely assumed that the original poster understood the basic logic of inference and the contrapositive form of a statement. I think it's fair to say that when most people make a statement, they don't really think it through or have implications beyond the trivial form in mind, so it's probably unfair to suggest that he was insulting us, since he lacked intent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">"Those that remain truly love the game" says nothing about the love for the game others have.  It only says that those still playing do love the game... which might actually be a bit strong.  I for one am in the 'disgruntled' court, not the 'loving court'  However, fact remains that you don't need to search for insult by implied reflection from that statement.  It's merely the posters observation of the fact that the servers have gotten more civil since The Exodus.

<br />
As for what's missing from EQ2 and WoW?  I personally feel it's the mechanics that are missing.  I'll elaborate in detail in another post (my comments WILL raise flames, as much as I don't want that, it will and I want this post to remain positive).  Suffice it to say that both EQ2 and WoW went with a model of each class being, virtually soloable and they shifted the tactics needed for pulls.  The overall effect leaves me wanting... specifcally lt left me wanting the tactics that EQ required.
<br />

<br />
That said, I still have good feelings about EQ though I'm reaching burnout.  Granted, it's been 6 years this April.  Unfortunately, I've gotten to the point where I really enjoy the game but I log on and fall asleep because everything has become THAT familiar to me... which frustrates, even angers, me to no end but not enough to wake me up.  It's only when we adventure to new zones that I am fully alert (lor dealing with a pet or CC).  When we are doing the exp grind... I can't do it for more than an hour or two... <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" />  In the overall though, I do still like EQ and am not, yet, leaving it... I am infuriated by the recent changes to charm, especially since, even with the outcry from the enchanter community, they propagated the changes to revamped old world zones (MM and Paw).  I, for one, have not, and likely will not, set foot in those zones unless, and if, my guild or our allies requires it (and I understand that CC is pretty much required in MM so, if we all boycott that zone, things should be entertaining).  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

Back for more comments later...  I'm NOT looking to start a flame fest, really, I'm just making observations from my experiences in these games.

I can't do it for more than an hour or two... <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" />  In the overall though, I do still like EQ and am not, yet, leaving it... I am infuriated by the recent changes to charm, especially since, even with the outcry from the enchanter community, they propagated the changes to revamped old world zones (MM and Paw).  I, for one, have not, and likely will not, step foot in those zones unless, and if, my guild or our allies requires it (and I understand that CC is pretty much required in MM so, if we all boycott that zone, things should be entertaining).  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
