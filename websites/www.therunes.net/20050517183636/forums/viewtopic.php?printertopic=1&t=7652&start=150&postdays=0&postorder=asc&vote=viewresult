<br />
** SOE is pretty determined that the best pet we <span style="font-style: italic">they think we OUGHT</span> to have has to be a 250HP hitter (+ maybe the haste).
<br />
** Enchanters are equally determined that such a pet is totally worthless due to the inherent risks when it breaks (from 250hp hitting wuss to a 1K+ damage monster)
<br />

<br />
Split the difference. Make Enchanters the FOURTH PET CLASS of the game. Make all charm pets permanent (super dire charm?) with (when charmed) the modified damage table DPS on par with the best mage/beastlordsnecro pets. The charm pet will have the all the HPs and innate abilities of the mob before charm. The pet can be released with "reclaim pet" spell or dispell.
<br />

<br />
So enchanters become the 4th pet class of EQ, we get to keep our CC abilities, our DPS in exp/raids is increased x100 (to say the least <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" /> ). SOE gets to control the DPS of charmed pets. 
<br />

<br />
Details will take a bit of thinking out.... but "super dire charm" is kinda thinking out of the box and most importantly <span style="font-style: italic">the idea amuses me</span>. The other 3 pet classes would probably beg to differ.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif" border="0" />

This idea might be balanced, but I think it's boring and I would prefer not to pursue this line of thinking unless there is no other choice.  I still don't have Dire Charm.  I have no intention of ever buying Dire Charm.   I will not be pleased if all of my charms become Dire.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Exactly. 
<br />

<br />
Why the idea of super gimp mobs with super gimp resists of DoN, much like normal LDoNs, don´t appeal to me.
<br />

<br />
Same thing happened with WoS, when I was playing my chanter and the group had good DPS, I would ask the puller to just bring adds. Thus, there would be a buffer built up of 1 or 2 mezed mobs ready for tank to whack at as soon as mob got low HPs and stopped attacking. And you know, for a while there, it was fun. The after a couple hours I realized it was just an artificial situation to get me entertained that was not really needed.
<br />

<br />
Somewhere between the single pull uber mean mob and the multiple roamers normal LDoN difficulty ones, there is a happy middle. Or maybe we are just in denial, and with the current loot available for us, it is either super gimp mobs or single pull uber mobs. 
<br />

<br />
Unmei´s idea of progressive DPS on mobs as they take DMG if done right would rock, for initial add madness control. Maybe keeping pet on a dizzy state for a short while hitting for 50% of total DMG when charm breaks would also be neat. 
<br />

<br />
Charm pet doing 100% of DMG does trivialize content. Mobs hitting for 1300ish will keep the focus on single pulling, no matter how many tools we get for better mitigation to deal with adds, unless everyone else in group get similar improved tanking abilties. Else, peeps will die and single pull will not go away.
<br />

<br />
If SoE does find the the happy middle, they do need to expand CC to other classes, necros getting mez only will just not do. Just can´t have chanter "requiredness" as in Kunark. That´s what got us to where we are.
<br />

<br />
The tools are there, it is possible if SoE is willing to put some effort on it, and listen for suggestions. I just got tired of waiting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Actually, within certain sections of NC the murkgliders are all of a level and provide nice test subjects.  NC Dragorns are simply much more powerful, level for level, than murkgliders.
<br />

<br />
The smart exp move is to get a dual wielding dragorn with the Deep Gouge ability to slay your murkglider pets faster.  One dragorn per 10 murks in 12 minutes is a reasonably good rate of killing.

You're nearly pointing out a severely broken problem with charm.  The rule of 4 prevents us from being this effective in a full group.  I know what that leads me to say: Sorry, group is full.

<br />
Permanent charm with a long long recast time is a stupid idea.  Making different charms for different purposes is a good idea.  
<br />

<br />
There is a very large space in the game for a 50% damage reduction, 20 minute duration charm.  There is probably also room for a one minute, 125% dps charm and a one hour, 25% dps charm.  All with recast times of 2.5 seconds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">It seems to me that the "class revisioning" that SOE is doing is to make hybrid classes more powerful by giving them the abilities to substitue for the pure classes in group situations. This lessens the need for the pure classes so that the hybrids become the most versitile of classes being able to slow, mez, heal, and do dps. 
<br />

<br />
We don't have a pure role anymore, all our abilities have been given to hybrids in one form or another such that they are now more desireable in a group.  Who would take an ench over a bard, who can pull and do cc? Who would take an ench for just slowing over a shaman who can also do significant healing?  Who will take an ench over a beastlord or necro for group mana regen when the group can already get kei or voq cast on them from somplace else and these other two classes can provide extra mana in the group that the ench can not offer.
<br />

<br />
In EVERY case, we have nothing vital or usefull that requires us to be a part of a group over other hybrid classes.  Our one thing that used to be our sole ability was to area mez or stun when pulls had 5+ mobs and we could lock down such massive pulls in sebilis or KC when all the other classes had just single mezes. Now we no longer have that even.  The new zones make the hybrid classes as good as us for cc now, we are simply not required.  
<br />

<br />
But this is exactly what the "re-envisioning" of SOE is, that groups can be made from a variety of classes now, no one class is needed ie, pure classes are not needed, but the power is then shifted to the hybrids to become more versitile, and the pure casters..simply..not needed anymore.

<span class="postbody">I highly encourage anyone who has not done so yet to post on the official SOE forum. There are two threads, one which addresses chram specifically and one which is general discussion. The greater the output the greater the chance that we will be heard.
<br />

<br />
In general, I love the tash aggro reduction and spell immunity check. That addresses three items on our top 10 list. (i.e. it also reduces the need to have an Inny's Sarcasm item.)
<br />

<br />
Rashere has stated that the charm rules will be spread across the game, but that it will end up being a mob by mob adjustment in old world content, and that very few mobs will be affected. IMO charm soloing will still be effective at lower levels.
<br />

<br />
My main complaint is that the re-envisioning process is supposed to make us more advantageous in groups. <span style="font-style: italic">Tash aggro and charm issues are not the reson we cannot find groups! </span>
<br />
IMHO mezz problems which have not been addressed are our biggest concern. Mezz gaps, insane resist rates, inaccesability to our highest lvl spells and Bards which can cc faster and slower have crippled our ability to do our number one task. So we are not a reliable cc option. Oh yeah, and now upgraded mezzing for necros....well, its about time they got better at our job.
<br />

<br />
We are also arguably the worst DPS option in the game. What are the new charm rules supposed to do? Put our pet dps on par with a bst/necro/mage pet? Of course to get to a competitive dps level with a charmed pet we will still be the only class which threatens a group wipe at any minute. Do all the math you would like, if there is not going to be an upgrade to Dire Charm then this is worthless for getting us into groups.
<br />

<br />
We have mana regen spells, but so much has been farmed out to other classes that a necro/bard combo can out regen us. 
<br />

<br />
Our debuffing slot is now down to third. "Slower needed for group...but no enchanters please" will be common.
<br />

<br />
Frankly, I feel like the Godfather when it come to Charming in groups..."You are dead to me." 
<br />

<br />
I am positive about the tash/immunity check/WoM changes, and will wait to see how the ToT pans out. But the bottom line is that nothing proposed by SOE will make Enchanters get invited into groups. Actually, now that necros get better mezz and bsts get better slow/heal/pet heal we will be eliminated from groups even more.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully Im wrong, but I dont see what else could possibly happen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Well, all I can say after playing Ayeressa to 47, then restarting Ayer on Xev, PAYING to have Ayeressa moved to Xev to be with me due to my love of having enchanters available &lt;yeah, I even had both on seperate accounts&gt; Voicing my desire to have enchanters at the following levels just for the fun of playing them in various Zones :16 in Oasis, 29 in Guk, 49 &lt;which was another reason for Ayeressa's move too&gt; for Seb &lt;Dazzle was the best we ever had..&gt; etc...and then paying to have all moved to Povar back again...
<br />

<br />
I cannot say how much I am/was devoted to this class.  Ayer is still around, in Triton now, after hanging out in Harmonium until the very end, finishing up the guild YKZ, and the history of playing an enchanter since June 2000.
<br />

<br />
And now, to finish the first clause which was also the first paragraph above...
<br />
 IS: that I almost wish I had started on a Shaman back in 2000.
<br />

<br />
Sorry, our CC is almost toast in this end-game, Shamans can haste buff almost as well, I won't mention slows, buffs are all better, albeit in different areas <ask any tank which they prefer, our buffs or a shaman's> Shamans heal, have way way better mana regen, and even a better pet.  To further support this idea, which would you all rather 2-box with, a shammy or an ench...
<br />

<br />
Oh, yeah, and our uber JC tradeskill blows chunks compared to potions.
<br />

<br />
I can go on and on, but it is too depressing.  AC, HP, OMG.
<br />

<br />
I'll stick around a bit longer on Ayer, as there are things I'd still like to do, but if an equally equipped/AAd shaman was offered in trade........

In general, I love the tash aggro reduction and spell immunity check. That addresses three items on our top 10 list. (i.e. it also reduces the need to have an Inny's Sarcasm item.)

Actually, if they remove Poison counter agro/the counters themselves from Tash, Inny's sarc no longer has a use.

I may have paid 50k plat plus a rune to get my orb, but I would still love for Inny's to have no use <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

Hopefully, Inny's will have a different effect now, one equally important to chanters (and no, that is not mezz agro reduction...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

If the mobs hit below a certain level, CC isn't needed.  The healing/tanking power is more than enough for one tank to tank 3 mobs at once.  For example, LDoN normal with an elemental tank.
<br />

<br />
If the mobs hit above a certain level, enchanters cannot surive CC resists reliably.  So using an enchanter as in-camp crowd control doesn't make sense: there are reliable pull-control methods that work.  For example, Kod'Taz/Ikkiz with an elemental enchanter.
<br />

<br />
2 adds aggro on that enchanter, hitting for 1400 hasted, kill the enchanter ... fast.
<br />

<br />
On one hand, you have trivial content.  On the other, you have content where an enchanter is incompetent at CC.
<br />

<br />
These aren't a matter of attitude.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">edit:</span>
<br />
You can make objective measures to determine which sort of content you are in.  Enchanter mitigation, DPS, tank mitigation, aggro generation, healer healing rates.  Pick your threshold.
<br />

<br />
His arguement is that those two states either overlap or are extremely close together.  There is a metric tonne of content that can be done safely with a good puller + healer + tank (no enchanter), but doing it with an enchanter + healer + tank and willy-nilly pulling isn't.
<br />

<br />
Pull crowd control dominates over in-camp crowd control.  This wasn't always the case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Note that line is determined by two sets of gear/AA.
<br />

<br />
Your gear, and your tank's gear (and to a lesser extent, the healer's gear/AA).
<br />

<br />
Both tanks and enchanter gear comes from roughly the same kinds of sources.  So for any set of tank gear, there is a roughly equivilent level of enchanter gear, and vice versa.
<br />

<br />
Your tank's gear determines if content is trivial.  Your gear determines if enchanters are effective CC.
<br />

<br />
The slice of content that is non-trivial and in which enchanters are effective CC is slim to none.  Maybe you are lucky, and you play with a weaker geared tank, or you are in the sweet spot where content is both non-trivial and enchanters are effective CC.
<br />

<br />
I would argue the range of non-trivial content in which enchanters are effective CC should be made broader.

Yeah. That's why I cancelled my SK account after one round of GoD.

Ferget it.

And currently I'm thinking of parking myself in Neriak and logging out permanently.

Not only are they killing my server off and shove me where I don't want to go, I get to /movelog to whereever I like - but hey, who wants chanters anyway? Even a high end one. On top of it they are doing it on my birthday :/ and on top of that... I see that latest proposed nerf.

They nerf charm to hell so I can't even solo those idiotic tasks anymore, but no one seems to remember that you get up to a 75% exp penalty for having a charm pet.
<br />
That might have been fair when they did full damage and killed faster than our tank (who was, incidentally, not unhappy the mob was hitting the pet), it most definitly is not fair now.
<br />
Put THAT in the top ten.

Roamers and more roamers validate the need for in camp CC quite well...  making pulling largely irrelevant except to split larger groups. Even so, expect an add or two while fighting almost constantly.  Repops keep you moving- no safe places..
