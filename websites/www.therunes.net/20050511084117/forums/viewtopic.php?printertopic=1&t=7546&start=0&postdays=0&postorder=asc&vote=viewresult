<span class="postbody">Here's the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/" target="_blank" class="postlink">LINK</a>
<br />

<br />
Highlights:
<br />

<br />
New Dungeon: Dire Maul (56-60 level Dungeon in Feralas)
<br />

<br />
UI Improvements: 
<br />
4 new action bars totaling 48 action slots 
<br />
Chat bubbles (wtf?)
<br />
Quest tracker 
<br />
Group loot - rolling on a "bind on pick-up" item now brings up a confirmation dialog 
<br />

<br />
Class Improvements: 
<br />
Mage - New Spell: Mage Armor allows mana regeneration to function while casting and increases resistance to all magic schools 
<br />

<br />
Druid - Cat form damage per second increased 
<br />

<br />
Warrior - Rage will now generate when attacks are parried, dodged and blocked 
<br />

<br />
Priest - Power Word: Shield can now be cast on all raid members 
<br />

<br />
Meeting Stones: Meeting Stones are located outside of each dungeon to help players find a group to adventure into the dungeon. The meeting stone will try to find you a viable group by finding a tank, a healer, and so on. As time goes on and you are unable to find a group, the meeting stone will become less picky about who it chooses to group you with.

<br />
You want accurate information regarding what's coming. We want to give you that. However, sometimes certain issues crop up that change plans. 
<br />

<br />
I explained why the Coming Soon page has not yet been updated. The situation has not changed on that front. I can tell you that we haven't forgotten it, that Ordinn and myself were speaking with the developers today about the key features and when they can be expected to show. Some things are not clear cut, and we're pestering people to make them clearly outlined, but until that time we do not feel comfortable releasing the update. 
<br />

<br />
Your post illustrates the problem underlying all this. On the one hand, Ordinn was confident of a solid update by a certain date and so he gave an approximation of when to expect it. Things came up, the update slipped, and now calls of "lies" are appearing. On the other hand, we are continuing the work on the update page and have a better idea of when to expect it (though we're wary of being so confident again), but do not wish to do so in case the date slips again. Even though we've explained the situation, the impression is that we're "ignoring" the page and the customers, which is untrue. 
<br />

<br />
I would love to give more estimations as to when things can be expected, but in order for that to occur, folks need to understand that plans will change and dates will shift depending on the state of the project or certain elements. A patch may be withheld due to a certain aspect not passing QA. An update to the Under Development page may not appear when we say it will initially due to the development process on a feature hitting a snag and thus changing the state of the information. 
<br />

<br />
Again, I want you to consider the state of the community when I ask this. Would you prefer: 
<br />

<br />
1) The situation now, where information is only given if we're fairly confident about its state (and thus does not come very often); or 
<br />
2) More information with the understanding that it's nebulous and subject to change?

<span class="postbody">You know, what pisses me off is that there is not enough GOOD solid Druid feedback. The thing is, a majority of Druids and those who use that shithole site to post on, happen to be Feral Druids. My problem with this being, these people aren't much on raiding and a majority of them seem to hate being healers or being expected to use their heals.
<br />

<br />
The thing with this is that when a 'raiding' Druid happens to post about some other problems aside from fucking Cat Form DPS, it gets knocked back to page 18 and covered up with 'Druid Cat DPS SUXORZ!!' posts. 
<br />

<br />
Now, I will go into more detail now.
<br />

<br />
In Beta, my chance to crit casting Healing Touch was somewhere around 35% (guessing, here). It is now somewhere around 5%, if I am lucky. And honestly, I think saying 5% is pushing it. My problem with this is just like back in EQ, we would pray to the Gods that a quick heal would crit. The Druid quick heal is ass when you are taking the mobs into account. I'm talking about 2k-4k dmg fireballs busting ass on our tanks and casters. Getting a 1,500 crit heal isn't shit, to be honest. I'm needing higher crits on my BIG heals. If I have to stand there for so long and cast that shitty heal, by God, I want that sum bitch to crit once in a while, not once a week.
<br />

<br />
This was changed between last Beta Phase and Release and I am pissed. Not a single person will comment on it, either. I am fairly bitter about it since I am a full restoration HEALING Druid. I am not DPS, I am very aware of that and I don't mind. My buff owns and my heals do too, but they were once better. 
<br />

<br />
Additionally, I was promised Class Specific quests in Beta and the rewards would be 'new cool spells' - what they did was put in quests for the newbie bear form and seal form. And honestly, those quests are retarded. They sucked, the story sucked and carried maybe 1% druid lore in them. I'm hoping they let someone else handle those quests next time around. 
<br />

<br />
I'm pretty excited about some changes coming up that weren't listed there. I'm more happy to know the Rebirth bug is getting taken care of.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
I think it's sad that to be effective a druid has to be (a) restoration and (b) a healer.  That's what I do.  I'm generally happy with my position in groups and I think I do a damn fine job.  But the druid was intended to be more than a healing and buff bitch.  Maybe the original vision was _too_ powerful.  There's no way that a single class should be able to be a healer, a rogue, and a warrior all rolled up into one - even if we aren't as effective as the original in those rolls.  But, regardless, that is the way the druid was originally peddled and that is why people chose that class.  I'm not surprised that they feel a little cheated when they learn that in reality they are a healer who can shift into bear if they get aggro and who can shift into cat when they need to sneak or track humanoids (for me, those are the _only_ times I shift).  As a grouping druid, a solo druid, or a raiding druid, healer/caster should not be the single role we are pigeon-holed into.  But it is if we want to be effective.  
<br />

<br />
And, yeah, a few more crits on heals would be pleasant.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Was getting bored on the priest alt, and leveled a new Tauren Druid to 24 in a couple days.  At low levels (even in instances), my healing role has been minimal so far.  This is partially true as it seems the number of priest alts started on my server is relatively high - no shortage of priests now since there was a huge shortage at launch.
<br />

<br />
From my short experience so far, I agree 100 pct with the other posts about druids.  For me it seems Healing Touch is about equivalent to 2x Flash Heals in terms of casting time, HP healed, and mana efficiency.  Simply stated, I see my use of Healing Touch to be very limited due to the long cast time (it's already 3 sec for me, and goes up to 3.5 at my next rank iirc).
<br />

<br />
Looking over the talent tree, there doesn't seem to be anything to improve the crit chance of Healing Touch - only Regrowth.  
<br />

<br />
Perhaps the most bizarre talent, if I understand it correctly, is Nature's Grace (Balance side, requires 20).  If you crit with a nuke, it reduces the casting time of your next Healing Spell by 1 second.  Maybe you folks are playing the class all wrong.  To be an effective healer you need to nuke more!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Honestly, I think what they failed to do within the Talent Trees they can make up for in the form of items or 'augment' quests. There happens to be a "quest" where you can collect some shit and money then hand it in to add something to your armor (selected pieces) such as +8 to whatever stats, +whatever resist, + armor, etc. 
<br />

<br />
I'd like to see more of these, but I want them to take the good shit from EQ. Give me Extended Range, Mana Regen, etc. Additionally, I want this to be in the form of an 'augment' type for a reason. I think this should be available for those who are sure they like what they are wearing. 
<br />

<br />
Ok, I'll go more into detail on this...
<br />

<br />
I believe being able to keep 'buffing' your character once you are at level cap is very important. Just as farming AA's was in EQ. I'd like to see some "Enchantment" quests. You do a quest which will not be easy and in return you get a stone or whatever that you can use only once to enchant a certain piece of armor. Only one enchant per armor piece and each quest can be repeated, however, you can only have one enchantment type per character. For example, if I were to enchant my legs to add 10% chance to land a critical heal using my Natures Touch spells, I cannot enchant another piece of my armor with that same enchantment. I'd have to pick something else, like Extended Range. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
If I get some new pants, I will have to repeat the quest if I want to get that enchantment again. 
<br />

<br />
I think this would be pretty fair and an easy way to avoid having to rework the talent trees. It would give each player more options to better 'sculpt' their character to fit their type of playstyle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
