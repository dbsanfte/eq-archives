Deliberately abusing those mistakes though is.  Just because your car can do 100 MPH doesn't mean you can ignore a 55 MPH speed limit.  People were getting banned for using gravity flux to get where they weren't supposed to go long before RoK was even concieved.  The people involved knew they weren't supposed to do what they did.  They did it anyway.  And for that, they should be held accountable.  They weren't really though.
<br />

<br />
SOE's response was to strip them of the rewards.  And then to prevent it from happening in teh future, to nerf the spell.  It wasn't to punish us though.  SOE doesn't like the idea of having to change zone geometry.  Big download and all that.  Plus changing 3d maps requires lots of testing.  And having to always consider what gravity flux could do with any new map...serious hassle, imposes limitations on the designers.  And all for a spell that wasn't really important to the classes that had it.  So they did the simple thing.
<br />

<br />
A shame, I loved launching seafurbies high into orbit.  Especially when your group wasn't expecting it.  But ultimately, I don't really care that it is gone.  It was fun, but not important.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Cheal wheels where exploits, they just where accepted ones.  Cheal was intended as a downtime tool, the use of it as a combat heal is an unintended side effect.
<br />

<br />
FD pulling is an exploit, just an accepted one.
<br />

<br />
Crowd control is an exploit, just an accepted one.  Mez was intended as an escape tool.
<br />

<br />
Kiting is an exploit, just an accepted one.  Snare was intended as an escape tool.
<br />

<br />
Using the game in ways that the developers did not intend to defeat content is an exploit.  Some of the best EQ gameplay results from this, as does some of the worst.
<br />

<br />
The difference is, gravity-flux exploits where too effective and too uncommon to become part of accepted game-culture.  Plus, they don't add to the fun of the game much.  =)  It is good that they got fixed.

You can't get XP off quests because SOE didn't design a good quest system.  You can get some XP off some of the new quests (well, AA, not XP, but same thing), because they redesigned how the quest system worked for a few quests.
<br />

<br />
Either they have chosen not to spread this code over more of the game, or it iwas written in a poorly scaling way, because they haven't added many of these "xp giving" quests.

So, we should place speed bumps on all highways that force cars to slow down to 20 mph.  Those damn speeders, it's their fault!

=p~

<br />
Gravity flux was used to send players high into the air.  In many zones, you could use this to fly over walls and get to places that where difficult to get to otherwise.  Sometimes you could use this to locations where you could "never be hit" by the creatures you are attacking.
<br />

<br />
WTYH was nerfed into unusability because players could keep a creature stunned forever.  It was changed so damage broke the stun, then never upgraded.

Thats examples of 2 things you concider in each category. Not really a definition of where the line draws which I think is what he was looking for. The problem is that there are never really good definitions of what the game allows.
<br />

<br />
I think all will agree with your categorization of your 2 examples, but what about when things that are closer to the gray area. I dont think you will find total agreement on every situation of:
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Using geometry</span>
<br />
- to hide behind a wall to avoid AE. (Seems like an intended ingame feature, although some walls work and others dont depending on their 'outdoor' flag. So as a 'feature' it's rather 'unsupported')
<br />
- to kite a mob because he has to walk around a pond that you can levitate over. (I think we are getting into the gray area here)
<br />
- to use levitate for...well..anything. Since levitate is in the game, it must have a purpose, and being able to move over something that you couldnt before would have to be a supported feature, but how far? levitate across PoN because you dont want to follow the wall? levitate across the wall in PoFire? levitate past see-invis mobs? levitate to Seru?
<br />
- to edge yourself into the Hole by using duck as a small race.
<br />
- to corner tank.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Using pathing</span>
<br />
- to kite.
<br />
- to fear.
<br />
- to gain time because you know the mob will take 2 seconds more to reach you if you take one step to the left.
<br />
- to repeatedly step left and right making the mob backtrack, and take a 'U' to reach you.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Using prenerf G-flux</span>
<br />
- to get to a ledge you could get to by jumping
<br />
- to get to a ledge you could get to by trivial other means.
<br />
- to get to a ledge you could get to by non-trivial other means (having to clear mobs etc..).
<br />
- to get to a ledge you could not get to otherwise, but gives you no advantage.
<br />
- to get to a ledge you could not get to otherwise, and gives you some kind of advantage fighting mobs (pathing or reaching).
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Using charm</span>
<br />
- to do anything. (yes, I've head other classes say charm is an exploit. period.)
<br />
- to do recharm, keeping your pet indefinately. (Some will say that charm is only intended as a CC tool and keeping a pet is an exploit)
<br />
- to solo a tough named with high risk.
<br />
- to solo a named with little/no risk (maybe you are standing next to the zonein or something).
<br />
- to start a faction war.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Using</span>
<br />
- Holgresh elder beeds to pull.
<br />
- FD to split. (Yeah, it is now concidered a central role, but Verant has claimed several times that it was not an intended use when designed.)
<br />
- Memblur...Don't know where to start on this one....
<br />
- CoH bots.
<br />
- Warrior incite doesnt seem to wear off when mob leashes back. This is usefull in f.ex. Ikk3.
<br />
- Any tactic against rooted mobs that dont involve constantly tanking it. E.i. the whole Gimp-ArchLich-tactic.
<br />
- Insta-clicks to avoid dispells.
<br />
- Powerleveling...name you method.
<br />
- Twinking.

<span class="postbody">I dont think you got the point of the post. It is not a list of what I concider an exploit. Not even close. But its a list of what people can have different opinions about. You cant just list your 2 extreme examples (which are also unrelated) and say you have 'defined' what an exploit is. Defining means to show where the line is drawn.
<br />

<br />
Go ahead and try checking off which items you concider exploits and which ones you dont, and I'll guarantee you that I can find someone who has a different list. <span style="font-style: italic">That</span> is the point of the list.

I included many points that most people agree are on one side or the other (like corner tanking) for completeness (because there are people with seriously different oppions on things), but I can boil it down to just a few of them if you want:
<br />

<br />
1) Any tactic against rooted mobs that dont involve constantly tanking it. E.i. the whole Gimp-ArchLich-tactic. 
<br />
2) Warrior incite doesnt seem to wear off when mob leashes back. This is usefull in f.ex. Ikk3. but highly unlikely that this is intended.
<br />
3) Using geometry to kite a mob because he has to walk around a pond that you can levitate over.
<br />
4) Using charm and pacify to solo a named with little/no risk (maybe you are standing next to the zonein or something). E.i. BoT named at PoP release.</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Wybart on Tue Apr 05, 2005 10:41 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

Technically yes, if the mob has a targeted or AE knockback then the tank is using the wall to avoid the knockback, this changes the encounter to what the developers didn't intend by working around a problem that was designed into the mob. So it is an exploit on knockback creatures.
<br />

<br />
His point however was where do you draw the line between an exploit and a tactic. Is it based on the reward for the "tactic", if the reward is great enough then it becomes an exploit? There are exploits in the game that people use every day, the difference is that SoE has decided they aren't unbalancing or they know if they change it everyone will be up in arms over it.

Boy, that statement says it all.
<br />

<br />
I'm 100% wrong which means Llan2193 must be 100% correct. And in his mind, being 100% right in his opinion on these issues, he has the right to be insulting and belittling to others. 
<br />

<br />
I was going to respond to Llan but how can you change a person's opinion if they see themselves as being 100% right and everyone else as 100% wrong.
<br />

<br />
I have to agree with Yakk. Nothing is an exploit until SOE comes out and says it is. Before some of you jump on that statement I'm talking about the gray area ones, not the out right exploits like the Dupe Banker.
<br />

<br />
We aren't mind readers, we don't know how the Developers intend an encounter to be fought. Are those pillars in the room to be used tactically or is hiding behind them an exploit? Having the casters leave the room before an AoE hits, then calling them back in... is that an exploit or tactic?
<br />

<br />
Chanters charming pets to help take down mobs... exploit or tactic?
<br />

<br />
I bet Charm is one of those spell lines that SOE wishes never saw the light of day... along with the Mez and Stun spell lines.
<br />

<br />
Once they do manage to neuter those 3 spell lines what will Chanters have left? Crack, Haste, a second rate slow and nuke. 
<br />

<br />
I don't think SOE has lost their vision of the future game... their vision is a game without Chanters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I laughed.  I found your post funny, and made light of it.
<br />

<br />
WTYH in particular was nerfed because it could be used to chain-stun mobs indefinately, and was horribly overpowered.  This resulted in the nerf to WTYH.  It sure sounded as if you where claiming that chain-casting a stun on a mob is an exploit.  I found this funny.
<br />

<br />
Gravity Flux, which had the ability to throw players up into the air, was nerfed because you could use it to throw people into the air, and get past walls that the developers designed poorly as barriers to players. 
<br />

<br />
From Velks to City of Mist to The Hole to Seru to Time, people used this spell to jump over walls or up steps.  SOE decided it wasn't worth doing good design that had this use in mind, and destroyed the spell.
<br />

<br />
They also destroyed WTYH.  They destroyed mez.  They destroyed charm.  They did serious damage to FD, destroying it for a time.  They have been attacking cheal slowly, I have seen a post where they said this is their intention, and that it was being used in unintended ways.  They destroyed useful illusion faction (right after project illusion, that was hard to predict) as an exploit.
<br />

<br />
Exploits are simply unintended strategies and tactics that are too powerful that the developers choose to be banned.  They remain exploits so long as the developers can't find an easy way to prevent them from occuring, or until the developers accept them as legitimate.

Yes it has.  Mez's power was reliable in-camp crowd control.  Relying on in-camp crowd control in challenging content is the act of an idiot.
<br />

<br />
So my terms are clear, "challenging content" is content in which your cleric cannot keep your tank alive before when the mobs are not slowed, and your group is geared roughly uniformly.
<br />

<br />
Either the mobs are single pulled, or crowd control is done out of camp, or your group is fighting in easy content for your gear level.

Illusion faction works in the original cities.
<br />

<br />
It doesn't work in split paw, on the brownies, in velk's lab, on sarnaks of kunark, amoung other places.  It used to work in those places, before they took illusion faction and tore it to bits.
<br />

<br />
Nor does it work in any new content added since the illusion faction nerf in PoP.  (Possibly I'm wrong, and it works in DoN)

Not on highways, no, they are seriously important for transportation within the US.  But in residential neighborhoods, sure.  And if you want to talk in terms of transportation, that's all gravity flux is...a single residential neighborhood, unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  Except that this little neighborhood became a short cut for semis.

After it got mega-nerfed, it was improved once, at the same time they gave us the higher level version of WTYH.  The upgrade though did nothing to enhance the actual usuability of the spell.  I do sort of view Lagarn's Lamentation as a continuation of the line.

It can also be said that Verant upgraded our non-racial illusion, so that we could use them in areas we couldn't previously without getting attacked.  That change had both positive and negative aspects and, in terms of usuability, more of the former than the latter, if you ignore the abuse of NDT, something that'd have been fixed regardless.

And they still get attacked by mobs too...was always annoying when doing a rescue LDoN.  And we can buy those spells elsewhere, with no faction issues.[/img]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

So charm is getting nerfed in zones where nobody is hunting. BFD. It's gonna be a little harder to get thru tipt never mind the fact you dont have to do the 5 other trials or rondo not to mention 5 more levels + omens loots.
<br />

<br />
I'm willing to give up old charm in empty zones because I might get a better pet in zones where people are actually hunting. It's clear you've already given up on mezzing so I wont waste my time.
