The two mobs just inside the entrance appear to now be permantently see invis (tbc) and there are 3 new mobs in the bit that used to be empty straight in from the entrance. Pacification will get you in, just do the two outer guards, then the inner guards. Probably handy having some extra mobs in there, I always used to run out of them. Of the three new mobs. the side ones are same as everything else. the back one broke a dozen roots and was the only early charm break I had in there, It's a 20 minute sample though <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

OOo that could be interesting, probably can't solo it like we could the 68 named. might try and take a group down there.

The three new mobs are on live servers now? Heh, been that way for months on test server but I thought it had migrated to production long ago. Its nice - since you now have at least two more mobs to hunt in the shrine ... sometimes 3 (seems that the named mob only has a chance of spawning, though it is a good chance).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I hope the see-invis thing is a case of ex-pets.  As for the 3 extra mobs it could be good because I run out too, but that's why south shrine is good whereas hero shrine is a pita because it's too crowded.  I usually bring my druid so he can harmony the way in fast enough but it's a pita.
<br />

<br />
I'm not one for jumping on the SoE-bashing bandwagon but damn....for devs et.al. who supposedly don't play enchanters they seem to be really picking on us. 
<br />
Mind you I get this feeling as a Mage too...except with mages it's more a case of apathy in regards to improvements (pet scaling etc) rather than active changes that affect the class.  I'm sure in their world mages and enchanters are overpowered and need a good beating with the nerf bat.
<br />

<br />
Well...there's always my druid I guess...SoE seems to love them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">I zoned into HoH to check out the new mob.
<br />

<br />
Valorian Guardian Kreike was up, cons yellow to 70.
<br />

<br />
There were two mobs next to him, but they were just normal for the area, so I figured I'd give it a shot and see what he can do.
<br />

<br />
Charmed up a standard guardian from the right wing and parked him in the tunnel corner.  Went over and pacified the two next to the named.  Pulled with tash just to see what it would do and ran back to where my pet was.  Named came single and for kicks I tried to root it.  Same as the sentries... no go on the root.
<br />

<br />
Sent in the pet next and the pet got instant agro.  Which I find odd as he never would do that before when I pulled with a tash.
<br />

<br />
Wham Bam Splat
<br />

<br />
Pet goes from 100% to 75% in the 5ish seconds it takes for me to slow.  Which "mostly" landed the first try.
<br />

<br />
Pet was SoSalik and NDT'd only.  By the time the mob had pet to 10%, my pet had him to 93%.  This took less than 40 seconds.  Pet was hitting for usual 300-500 shots.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, I don't run with all damage showing (I hate the spam) so I don't know what he was crushing my pet for.
<br />

<br />
He was totally melee and didn't seem to proc or AoE anything detrimental.  Just massive HP and insane damage.
<br />

Well, just thought I'd share the info I found.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Yep I went back to see if he was up so I could drag a group down there, neither entrance mob saw invis. My suspicion was roused because both were seeing invis before, where as if an enc has been down there it's usually just one that does. Probably someone messing about <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" /> I've still not seen the named, but when the non named is up at the back you can pull the front two without annoying the back PH.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
