Forcing us into a role of having not only that much power and requiring that half your group sit back and watch while you single handedly take down mobs is simply ludicrous. For those that don't understand this, the 4 man rule is that when charming, if you have a 4th person on the aggro table the aggro goes haywire. Thus, a puller brings in a mob, a charmer attacks with the charmed pet, and a healer keeps the pet(s) alive. If anyone else joins in the fray, the critter being attacked will lose interest in killing the pet that is taking it down, and go after the charmer, then wipe the group. This means that everything works fine so long as group members 4, 5, and 6 sit and watch OR if the charmer kits. How anyone could think that this was a viable solution, I'm not sure. It really doesn't stop folks from using charm, it just modifies their behavior and causes half your group to feel useless. This 'rule' needs to be stricken, or modified so that the other members in the group can play an active role while the group is still more efficient. ANY case where ANY of the members of a group are most efficient while sitting on their thumbs is NOT acceptable. All members of a group should feel usefull and helpful. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

I usually did Tipt/Vxed using a tank and a charmed pet for pure DPS.  Pure-DPS charmed pets are so much safer than tanking charmed pets it isn't funny.
<br />

<br />
This also let the entire group participate and got rid of unstable aggro problems.
<br />

<br />
I have also done Tipt/Vxed's using the double-pet technique (2 charmed hasted geared pets, snarer, cleric) with all healing occurring between fights.  In this case, the entire group is along for the ride: on the other hand, the entire group tends to help with active crowd control.  My first Tipt was like this, 2 ENC and a 2-boxed cleric+ranger.
<br />

<br />
Not using a tactic like this means that a charm break on a summoning mob is pretty disasterous.  And given the length of Tipt/Vxed, it wasn't worth the risk.

I believe a percentage of your pet's aggro is moved to the controller, but I'm not certain.  In any case, it isn't shared aggro.

I don't like the idea of having the -MR modifier change: it matters far far too much.

<br />
Here are a bunch of mezzes that don't vary in their -MR, but are quite different:
<br />

<br />
( all of the following with a -10 MR modifier: )
<br />
1.0 casting time, 5.0 recast, 4 tick mez.
<br />
4.0 casting time, 5.0 recast, 15 to 20 tick mez.
<br />
1.5 casting time, 12.0 recast, 1 tick PBAOE mez.
<br />
4.0 casting time, 5.0 recast, 6 tick AoE mez.
<br />
2.5 casting time, 2.3 recast, 9 tick mez.
<br />
0.5 casting time. 10.0 recast, 9 tick mez with a 5000 point 100% spell/melee damage absorbtion effect on it.  And a 10,000 point spell+melee damage shield.  ;-)  (ok, ignoring the DS, this is what Stasis should have been -- a mez that takes work to break)
<br />

<br />
One idea for a mez with a different MR modifier would be one with a +10 MR modifier, but debuffs MR by 20 (or a touch more).  This mez would be a long-term lockdown mez, specifically crippled so it can't be used for lockdown safely.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Some good ideas there.  But I would still think that a -40 or so resist mod mez, with a sufficently high mana cost and recast would be a valuable tool.  What I'm looking at is something like a shorter, less effective rapture.  Rapture was a broken spell, but I think that a spell that can be fired off at the beginning of a big pull, at high mana cost, that gives a good chance of taking one mob out of the picture for 20 or 30 seconds would be a very valuable item.  You wouldn't want to hold anything down with it. Heck, if you want, make the recast long enough that you -can't- hold anything down with it (4 tic duration, 30 second recast works.)  but a little extra edge for a lot of extra mana is really something that I feel would be valuable.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
First of all, a long recast means that this lockdown mez gets resisted, enchanter gets aggro, and enchanter goes splat.
<br />

<br />
I fear any high-mod spell will be turned into <span style="font-style: italic">the</span> raid-mez.
<br />

<br />
Want a mob to be hard to mez?  Well, if so, the -40 resist mez makes it much easier.  It will require to enchanters to hit their mez keys in order to keep him locked down reliably.  This isn't fun, but the math tends to make it optimal.
<br />

<br />
It happened with Rapture.
<br />

<br />
If all mezzes have the same net resist modifier, it means that it isn't the mob which decides which mez we use -- it is the situation.
<br />

<br />
Maybe you are right, and next time it will be different, and a recast-balanced mez won't result in the ridiculousness of rapture.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

A better solution than elliminating faction adjustment for some (all?) illusions would've been to create a class of NPCs that see illusion. Much like see invis, only they can see through illusions.

The harder a zone is intended to be, the more saturated the zone would be with 'see' critters. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

On this one I'd like to add that they already have this in game.  Well at least a portion of it.  For those of you who remember hunting Stonebrunt Mountains might remember the kitty city.  The one thing you could NOT do was run in there wiht an illusion.  ANY illusion.  So is SOE had that kind of issue with some faction problem they could have easily dropped in a few well placed mobs that agro'd on illusions.  Top em off with See invis and BINGO problem solved.
<br />

<br />
Since SOE decided to completely BORK the entire Illusion line including the one REQUIRED to get certain mana spells by ourselves yet left other classes alone says volumes for what SOE thought about our class.  Of course they may not have been aware that that was something they could do, or maybe see invis and see illusion don't stack. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
My idea as a top ten list item then?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bring back illusion faction</span>
<br />

<br />
I would LOVE to get Illusions back, because using them as faction adjuster was a big part of the class.  Being able to wander the hole since you could pop on Earth Elemental, or werewolf/boon for getting better bloodsaber,  was a way to use the abilities of the class for epic work.  Like charm is. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I think Lilly's idea has some merit, but needs a LOT of work.  The racial thing is not the way to go (IMO).  Factions should be brought back though.  It makes no sense to see Werewolf/Boon people sitting in the city whiling away the hours at a loom. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  Although I like illusions, I don't think they should be used to address all the shortcomings we have been handed recently.
<br />

Unfortunate for me I have no better ideas right now. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I disagree. -40 is -not- -huge-.  It's the difference between "before tash" and after tash.  One enchanter can -easily- keep lockdown on a mob that is initially tagged by this spell, especially by using the "long term" mez we describe about, and recasting it early.

I wouldn't mind a fast casting, short duration (1 or 2 ticks) slow as well, something to pop on to a mob and then immediately put on a longer lasting slow. Similar to what shaman get, but reduced effectiveness so they still are best at slows.  I sorta do that using an aoe stun, but a single target slow would be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
I would LOVE to get Illusions back, because using them as faction adjuster was a big part of the class.......I think Lilly's idea has some merit, but needs a LOT of work. The racial thing is not the way to go (IMO). Factions should be brought back though. It makes no sense to see Werewolf/Boon people sitting in the city whiling away the hours at a loom.  Although I like illusions, I don't think they should be used to address all the shortcomings we have been handed recently. "
<br />

<br />
All the mobs have "see through illusion" right now and have the god-like ability to see your faction without ever having even met you.  This is just un-fair and defeats illusions totally.  Faction should be important but not insumountable.  If there is some specific quest that SOE wants you to have some specific faction to complete without using an illusion then those specific npc's should be given the ability to "see illusion" and not give the quest reward or otherwise operate to advance the quest. For the majority of npc's, I was in neriac just the other day, and I was kos as a de to the green conning guards who were ready to attack me in de illusion.  They have not even seen me in years, how god-like in memory and inconsistant in role-play is that? 
<br />

<br />
The issue is not to make illusions the be all and end all, but to illustrate how flavor could be placed into our class definition to make it more logical and consistant.  I gave examples previously of the generic root spell many classes have being replaced with illusions that would have the same effects but different graphics other than roots coming out of the ground, such as illusionary walls of fire or ice, and based upon those resists.  I gave the example of a fly spell using a griffin illusion. There are many spells that we have that could have the way they work from a role-play perspective replaced by logical illusions.  Yes, we would still do the same things, but we would do them by illusions.  Take the fear spell line that many classes have.  For us, the graphic might be that we change briefly for a few seconds into the highest level mob in the zone and this vision would scare the mob and make him run.  This would not be a real illusion that overwites any of our existing illusions, but would just be a spell graphic that would be visible when you cast it.  When we mez or charm,  perhaps we could get a spell graphic that mimiked the mob we were charming in whatever form it has.  When we cast strangle, why can't we get a graphic of a hand choaking the mob? Have you ever wondered also, why strangle also works on undead who don't breath?  Some things just don't make logical sense.  I want to see illusions worked into our role more, they should be the WAY we do what we do, even if it is the same function and has the same effect as a spell of a different class. Our EFFECTS are due to us using ILLUSIONS, like a druid's effects are from using NATURE, or a necro's effects come from using the dead, even if they all have the same effect of root or fear, the WAY each class does it needs to be defined and spells consistant with that definition need to developed.
<br />

<br />
We need a consistent explanation for our abilities that involves our using  ILLUSIONS to achieve them, and these effects need to be expanded so that our abilities are more adaptable and versitile, as I have previously discussed.

=> explain and remove the ridiculous resists on mobs that are inside the limits of the mezzes you gave us with OoW - there is absolutely NO reason that an Enchanter with Euphoria, mezzing the Bridgekeeper's guards, gets 5, 8, 10 resists in a row on the mob when it was Tashed, Malo'd, and HoS'd..................No reason in the world will justify this, and before anyone comes along and says its a fluke.........explain the occurence of same resists from 3 different Enchanters, all level 70 , all with Cha > 300, all with Int > 330 (mine is 380), and no fizzes occurring at anytime, all with greater than 100 AA's in the 'appropriate' places (I have 310 AA's ), and this has occurred weekly or more when we deal with this activity.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Yes, quite old. However, in the old days, no ench went with the puller.  In guk, the ench and everyone else stayed in camp, you wait there and then when the puller had 6 mobs, you just area mezed them.  Ahhh..the good old days of area mez... This continued up through sol b, Karnors Castle and into sebilis.  Once luclin came out it was critical in aoe groups to stay in camp and be ready for chain stuning. Still we had little reason for geting out of camp or knowing what mobs were incoming. We stunned them all.  Casting Cast sight was usefull to check on the progress of the puller in Acrylia Caverns, and after that was nerfed, in the Deep and Fungus grove.  The disadvantage is the loss of stamina as you presumeably stop breathing. But even there, no reason ever to leave camp. So historically, in the "old World" of which you speak,  ench's NEVER had reason to travel with the puller or otherwise coordinate with them. 
<br />

<br />
This changed in the new would of POP with Plane of valor, there was again room enough to travel and plan when mobs needed to be pacified in conjunction with the puller.  In Bastion of thunder, we would be moving around to mez or charm mobs, and this was involving and fun. In LDON, moving was forced and pulls would often have adds, coordination was usefull, but with a monk or bard pulling, not really required. 
<br />
  
<br />
In GOD, we had to move and most especially charm.  That was the biggest thing and the only reason I was invited for groups there. I had to charm pets for killing the named for getting the KT flag.  It was an over reliance on one spell, and it was very stressful, since a moment of inattention when charm breaks would lead to wipes with long cr. 
<br />

<br />
Now I don't have to charm, it is a lot less stressful, but I am unable to mez many times and resists suck, death is quick.  There are no options anymore, I can't stun if I get a resist, I can't do anything except hope my instant aa rune will be up and keep me alive for 6 seconds to re-cast my mez. We have lost alot of power in GOD. However, DON seems to have a better balance, mobs are not overly resistant, they have wanderers that need to be mezed and hidden mobs that add on a pull. I find myself a bit more needed again.  Now, if only we had some meaningful illusions... <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />

<br />

<br />
Keeping an eye out depends on the place you are in. If you are in a camp type enviornment with enough space, for example an open zone like Overthere, Dreadlands or KT, then you can use the view feature to look back down at the camp from way in front of you and see and target any mobs that add. If you are in a maze camp, it is more difficult to get a good view and you need to look forward.  However, seeing the mobs is not the problem, it is that they resist and you die. With leader aa's it is easy to see which mob the tank is attackign and which to try to mez. 
<br />

<br />
And I have never left a group if somone has a suggestion for me in terms of what needs to be done, that would sort of contradict the idea of "we had communication that folks from the old world don't seem to acknowledge anymore" that you speak so highly about above.  How can there be any communication if you won't listen when people offer suggestions and you leave the group when they try?  Hmmm.. ? <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I agree with your comments on mezing Phylassein.  I have proposed that we have effective alternatives, such as illusions that act to root with more reliable results.  Our stuns, which were based on illusions like color, are now useless and we need 1, just 1, that would help us live through a resist.  I really don't think people would be complaining as much about resists on mez if they gave us back our stun weapon that in the past enabled us to survive.  It also made it more enjoyable, since I had tools to deal with bad events. Now it is just luck if you survive, not skill and being prepared.

I'm sorry, but this is nonsense.   First off, if you're pacifying in Valor, well, nevermind.  But the reason people never coordinated pacifying prior to PoP has nothing to do with open space, and everything to do with Pacify -not- -working-.  Remember when Wake of Tranquility was referred to as Wake of Trainquility because you had about a 75% chance of a resist and aggro on each mob it hit?
<br />

<br />
And if you were only learning to move around and mez and charm in BoT, it's because you were leaning too heavily on the crutch of AoE mez.  At level 30 in kedge keep, I got pretty damn good at maneuvering around to mez incoming fish.  And puller -always- told me how many he was expecting and what.  And I was charming.  Then. Under water.  Charm kept me playing this game from level 16 upwards.  Not because it was uber, but because it was useful, something not everyone did, and because it was cool.

They already fixed that issue with level caps and linked timers. If they dropped the cast time of our upper stuns, de-level capped them (effectively allowing us to use 1 at a time, depending if you have CC or CS), left them linked, removed all the freaking immunes (dear good is that annoyin), and put a resist mod on them, it *would* help the problem.
<br />

<br />
Right now, if we get a mez resist, no way in HELL is that stun going to land, and 85% of the time, the damn mob is immune as is. 
<br />

<br />
Lilly, old school enchanters memorized spawns locations, patterns and times. Hell I never *had* to leave camp to know exactly what was coming in. And if i did leave camp, it was cause I was pulling, and never used paci. Almost never needed AE mez, stun + single mez was more effective and safer. Didnt matter who my puller was, because I knew the area, the mobs and what was going to aggro what on the way inc, including wanderers. That is what made "good" chanters, knowledge of the dungeon, all the possible bad things that could happen, and knowing how to handle it.
<br />

<br />
MR needs kicked down, if you dont want a mob to be slowed, make it immune to MR based slows, dont jack the MR up thru the roof just so only the shm disease slow works.
<br />

<br />
And like Unmei, I dont understand the illusion thing. They were great when they had faction, but I never considered them a core ability. To me, mez, haste/clarity, stuns, and charm were our bread&butter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Actually they don't.  In fact except for the mobs in stonebrunt I am hard pressed to find ANY mob that sees through illusion.  I admit there are plenty of zones I have yet to see, so I may be missing something. What they CAN see is religious faction.  That is always a part of your character, although most Enc were made agnostic to bypass this.  But your own faction in dealing with mobs on factions X has always been a part of the end value in your final faction total.  Unless you are really hardcore KoS you see a difference under illusion.  Maybe not enough to get off KoS, but it does move the faction.
<br />

<br />
I started off killing in Crushbone.  DE illusion makes me glower, not liked, but not KoS.  Then I dropped a couple more things that had DE faction, and I might have dropped to Glare, which is still KoS.  But I can fix that with DE and tossing a Benev (or the higher one which for some reason excapes me atm <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />).  The point is that the faction adjustment for race is the same for me as well as the same for DE's who kill the wrong orcs in trying to get faction up for walking in Kelethin.   Then again I follow E Marr so I also have that going against me in a city dedicated to Inny. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Don't confuse role-play with EQ.  EQ is only marginally RP, even I gave up trying to do that a long time ago.  It was in teh way in pick up groups who rarely liked any decent RP, and with my RL friends we wanted to get done so RP was tossed there more often than not.  Faction may/may not decay over time, but decrying it not decaying only means you would rather have a different system.  I would prefer a better system that had permanent changes to your max faction.  You have a current faction, and a max faction.  You can increase your faction, but the lower it gets the lower your MAX faction would be able to get.  That would mean no ping pong like the Velious faction were done.  Cap your Dragon and Thug faction for this week cause we are dropping Tormax and you want to quest the head if you get it.  Whoops, not enough DKP/luck on random.  No worries . . . Tomorrow get the faction back up since you raided Thurg and got Dain's head so you can finish that quets before next weeks raid on the dragons, which will get your faction back up for that next Tormax drop.
<br />

<br />
When you make 9 of your top 10 relating to illusions, then yes you are attemping to make illusions the be all end all of the class.  That's just my opinion, but it seems to have merit.  Not all of them are bad, I liked some, but I don;t think making a new root via illusion is good, nor is mana regen via illusion.  We get minimal abilities form illusions, and that is nice, but I don't think extending the abilities on illusions helps, I think factions and or the ability to hide them is good.
<br />

<br />
Now if you want an illusion that can mask our religious faction, I can see that.  An illusion that is not projectable but makes us non KoS to scout some portion of a zone?  I want it.
<br />

<br />
Illusions to cause fear?  Nope, we have that in . . . Fear spells.
<br />

<br />
Illusions to cause damage?  Nope we have that in . . . Dots and Nukes.
<br />

<br />
Illusions to root?  Nope we already have . . . Root.
<br />

<br />
I can relate to the idea that an Enc is powerful in illusions and that is why you work them all towards that end.  But I don't think we should head that way.  Lessen the insane MR on mobs and flag them immune to certain spells.
<br />

<br />
Things I'd like changed:
<br />

<br />
Less of a raid only oriented game.  I want some raids, I just don't want the entire end game to be only that.  DoN seems to be a big step in the right direction from all accounts, and once I buy it I can say for certain. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  Tradeskilling should NOT require being in the top end raid guild.
<br />

<br />
Factions brought back on illusions.  And add some interesting illusions at the same time.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  Say the religion faction mask, or maybe an illusion that has a particular religion (improved DE that also has Inny religion).
<br />

<br />
PoP should have been a quest dream, what with each player having the diety available.  If you are going to RP, make sure that improving YOUR diey faction becomes imprtant.  If they added quests to the old PoP zones you could also add in a quest to change religion, that way your DE can actually make friends with felwithe.  Make it involved, make it fun, make it a quest kinda like the epic. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Change EQ back to EverQUEST, instead of Everloot. Real engaging quests and not farm mob y loot item x get item z.  The Qeynos badge quests are a great example of what could be tried, Coldain rings and Shawl of olden times are even better examples.
<br />

<br />
Add challenging single group/solo missions for the appropriate level that CAN be completed solo.  Don't make them time sinks, maybe make them instanced, force characters to use the SKILLS, not the hours. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Fix the charm nerf debacle.  I never charmed much, my only real success was once in blackburrow at level 12.  I charmed a tough one and was able to take him into the heart of the dubgeon with a group and we got into a furball, but we made it.  Challenge! Tough! Almost dead! It was FUN!!! <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  Have tried to work on charm skills, but once you get to a certain level it's ont quite as fun to die over and over, just so you get your timing down.  I respect teh ones who did it.  Actually I admire them, but with the nerf in place I see no reason to practice skills that will be useless.  Except for the Pooka trial.  Since I will most likely be along with a group I should have a snare person along, and hopefully a shammy.  Or I can take the long approach should I ever desire to a) purchase said expansion. . . and b) get the flag.
<br />

<br />
Failing the charm nerf fix, then give us at least a REASONABLE pet.  Make it come through AA's (possible high cost and lvl reqs), but make sure we have a CHANCE to play in some places.  My brand new 62 pet does okay in the Hole, and in PoN, as long as I don't let it tank.  So how in the world is he supposed to be able to tank for me in higher zones since I have to move out of the quickly becoming green zones I inhabit now?  Sure he's low DPS that's fine, but his mitigation and HP are awful.  If he takes a LONG time to drop mobs, well that's the price I pay for being an ENC.  But a MUCH improved Shiny BoB as far as survivable would not be game breaking.
<br />

<br />
Remove the Peridot cost on runes.  If clerics have no cost on components then we should not have it either.  The rune is fairly useless as it is, even in the few places we CAN use it, it's really not enough.  When fighting in PoN on lt blue trash, I usually have to re-rune at least once, and that's with constant refresh of berserk, and having the shammy load up on dots AND meleeing.  The only one with out a dot cost is arcane, which is what I use now since I don't have the inclination to load up packs with dots.
<br />

<br />
Well, well.  Maybe I have some thoughts on what I'd like to see fixed after all. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
I worship Erolissi, so being the direct opposite of Inoruuk, perhaps that is why even when I am in de illusion the guards in neriac all have "divine see thru illusion " Perhaps an aa ability that would give our illusions the power to cover faction and then even our religion would be useful, if there were some usefull quests at level 70 that made such ability useful and required us to go there to do the quest.

<br />
You wrote: " Illusions to cause fear? Nope, we have that in . . . Fear spells."
<br />

<br />
I have not checked to see if fear even works on mobs in mpg or RS. Normally you don't want to do this since it causes trains.  If it does, it would be so inconsistent that a high level mob is immune to having its emotions charmed or mezed by our level 67 mez, yes would be suseptable to such low level emotional manipulations. Maybe with fear and root mobs would be easier to tank and less damaging, if you can get past the magic resistance.   
<br />

<br />
You wrote: "Illusions to cause damage? Nope we have that in . . . Dots and Nukes. Illusions to root? Nope we already have . . . Root. "
<br />

<br />
My purpose in this was to give us an alternative way to do croud control on mobs with incredible mr.  If you can't get a mez to land due to mr, then geting a root to land that is also based on magic resistance brings us back to the same problem, we can't control the mob.  If we had a different way of rooting based on resistances other than magic, we would have alternatives when mez could not land. Shaman have disease based slows, why not give an ench a cold based one where the mob believes an illusion its arms are freezing up?  The spell could be a flat rate 40% slow and immune to partial mitigation, maybe not as good or effective as forlorn deeds ot the shaman slow, but still effecting and less resisted option. For root, I suggested a ring of fire illusion that would be based on the attacking the mob's fire resistance. 
<br />

<br />
This post was for "new ideas".  I had 2 goals.  The first was to give enchanters useful abilities based upon their job description as "masters of illusion and mental manipulation."  Well, we do not have that now.  For all of the ideas above,  I was just trying to give EXAMPLES of how our spells could be better related to this job description from a consistent role play point of view. The second was to solve real problems and issues in new ways while still advancing the first idea.  One EXAMPLE, was combat illusions that are based upon resistances other than magic would be very useful, add flexability, and provide us with alternatives solutions to existing problems in game play. And I have tried to show how these 2 "new ideas" could be merged together in a consistant logical way.

<span class="postbody">Yup, Errollisi Marr worshipers have tough times in Neriak, and in Qeynos Catacombs. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Took me about a month or two doing that tacklebox quest before human illusion got me to glower. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  I still have tough times in Neriak depending on where I walk.  The guards are something I can get past, but I think the Cleric based factions are now beyond Collaboration and DE illusion to fix.
<br />

<br />
But on to the discussion. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Yes, fear is one that gets shelved unless you have lots of room and very few possible (or none) adds available.  A snared feared mob can be chewed on by pets quite nicely. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  But that's hard to find in higher zones.
<br />

<br />
I think the problem with the Illusion based spells is that you really can't change the resist type, since it's all done via magic.  We aren't actually using cold even if they think icicles are forming on the elbow.  It's still magic controlling the mind.  So that kinda drops the modified resistance checks for certain spells.  You could argue that that's how our slow spell acts now, or our root, or any variety of our spells.  The magical control over the mind makes them act out what we want them to think.  It still falls under the base of magic though.
<br />

<br />
Which brings us back to the insane MR because they don't want a charm to land.  They jacked up the resistance not taking into account the whole set of spells based on one resist type.  I really think we should pursue it more this way, and have them use the tools they made to block the spell they don't want affecting said mob.
<br />

<br />
Part of this is because they don't have a WILLPOWER stat.  In old pnp we used willpower to check against a myriad of things that attempted to take over control of the characters mind.  Since most of our spells seem to indicate that we affect the mind directly, this would be where the resist should be.  Doesn't exist in EQ though.  That would give us the out we would need to move some of the spells they didn't like to the new resist, while allowing our direct spells to still take effect.
<br />

<br />
I like the additions of new illusions, and some are nice, although I would put the ring of fire as a snare effect myself. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />  And that one I DO like. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
And I did get DoN, and so far I really like it myself, but it's still tough to solo.  I went into lavaspinners and I dropped a dervish (smoke or stone or something) but it took half my mana, and the pet was pretty much dead.  so I regain mana, pet heals up (I heal up), and the second one I take on drops the pet, and if I had not gotten a couple heals from a nice person watching, I would not have made it.  While soloable, it's still pretty tough, but then again I am only 62.  I have a few items that could use upgrading, and I need more FT and possibly regen to handle solo work anyways.  It's nice that I can make an attempt at stopping a 20 mob train.  I didn't pull it off, but at least I was given a CHANCE. <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
All that aside we still need some help in a few areas, and we have to get SOE to drop the idea that we are so overpowered that stealth nerfs are a valid way to control the class.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

While using cold resist for a mind spell convincing you your arms are freezing  doesn't make sense, using the average of cold and magic resist does.

Classes with many resist types could get chromatic spells within their domain, and those with few resist types can get prismatic spells outside their domain.

We all know that the power of NPCs has climbed and the difficulty in charming NPCs has retreated. This has led to an imbalance where you were able to charm NPCs that do far more damage than ever intended and with minimal risk. This lead us to the unfortunate decision to make many NPC's uncharmable. With OOW, we introduced a change to charm that allowed us to make most NPCs charmable again, but reduce their effectiveness and remove the gameplay imbalance. We did this by reducing their stats while charmed. This presented some new problems though, the largest of which is you like to haste and buff your pets to get the most out of them and when the charm breaks, you face a much more powerful NPC. We have a plan to ensure charms usefulness and want to gather your opinion before putting it into motion. 
<br />

<br />
a. We want charm to be an integral part of your gameplay. You should be able to grab a charmed pet in most circumstances and use that to benefit your group. 
<br />

<br />
b. We will be looking at the stats NPCs use when charmed to ensure they are within the intended range. 
<br />

<br />
c. We would like to add innate buff effects to enchanter charm spells. While an NPC is under the effects of the charm, they will also be under the effect of spells similar to what you would use to buff your pet. When charm breaks those effects will go away so you are only dealing with the NPC in its base state. 
<br />

<br />
d. The change mentioned above would cause further imbalance in zones where NPCs dont currently lower their stats when charmed, the changes that were made in Omens will need to be made across the rest of the game and this will be the way new charm works in all of Norrath. 
<br />

<br />
e. After charm changes for all zones, we can go back and open up the use of charm in areas where it was previously excluded due to balance problems making charm much more usable throughout the game world. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Trying to be constructive...the xp nerfs on charm are unnaceptable with the current state of the pets DPS.  As of right now everyone but the enchanter benefits from charming.  (them asking for it to be nerfed is ludacris when it benefits them more then us)  If the xp nerf is not undone then give the pet full out dps....its not like we are getting good xp per kill anyway.  I also think charming should be more reliable and a more viable means of soloing in more zones.  Perhaps have a charm that is more viable for a means of cc.  One that doesn't last long and does DPS but after the charm fades does not run straight for the enchanter.  Maybe walks away with a chain memblur that hits it as a result of charm fading.  The buff that charm is supposed to become being a low level haste that doesn't stack with others hastes is not acceptable.  Once OoW charms came out all enchanters basically stopped charming.  Its just not worth it....If you are using oow as the model to change the entire game then you are getting even closer to removing charm from game/ensuring no one ever uses it again.  You are also about to make Tipt very difficult...
<br />

<br />

<br />
4) Better Slow.
<br />

<br />
5) Less Aggro specifically on tash...but wouldn't mind less aggro on everything.
<br />

<br />
6) Close the gap between tanks and enchanters in survivability.  We gave to be able to take hits.  I think Higher AC gear especially in the end of expansions for encs would help.  Or an innate AC boost?  Maybe Shielding and Avoidance boosts?  Increase our dodge?
<br />

<br />
7) Upgrade AoE nukes.  Give us an AE tash.
<br />

<br />
<img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif" border="0" /> Give our rune a form of mana regen or some other benefit.
<br />

<br />
9) Remove dots reagents from some of our rune line.
<br />

<br />
10) Crowd-Conrtol - We want to cc....that is where alot of the thril of being an enc is...and I don't think we mean in a sense like TRC.  The balance between single pullers and cc has been tipped too far in the pullers direction.
<br />

<br />
***Group Desirability.  I have listed procs, illusions, dps, cc and slow as ways to do this.  I would love to see SoE creatively come up with something we haven't suggested that we all come to love.  (without dangling it in front of us for a long time making us wonder if we are going to get it or not)
<br />

<br />
I do not want to see mobs mitigating mezz....that isn't much better then a resist.  Then we are getting ourselves into what happens with charm from time to time....CHARM and then INSTANT break....How did that help?  At least with a resist I am prepared to cast again and hitting AA rune when needed.
<br />

<br />
Are they possibly opening up fear charming?  I wish soloing was more viable....I honestly do not prefer the charm/root method in an attempt to get full xp....the risk is so much higher then any other soloing class.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Enchanters should be an add-control class. In todays game you can either eliminate adds with pull control, or control them in camp. Control in camp means getting hit.
<br />

<br />
Enchanters should specialize in in-camp crowd control, and hence they need to be acceptable -- nay, I would even say exceptional -- at getting hit.
<br />

<br />
Back in the day this was dealt with by Enchanter PBAOE stuns, and the fact that creatures had no danger of single-rounding players: damage was about healer mana and aggro, not about instant death. This has changed.
<br />

<br />
This also can't be dealt with by aggro-bleed abilities, like boggle or doppleganger. Redirecting an add from the crowd controller to a random member of the group (often the healer) results in group wipes. These abilities have their place, but that cannot be the core of enchanter defence if enchanters are to be viewed as effective add control.
<br />

<br />
So, to this end, I have a number of proposals:
<br />
First, +% self-rune foci should be added to the game. 5% to 50% (non-random) and higher. These foci should work on any self-only rune, making it useful to necros wizards and enchanters (but mainly enchanters).
<br />

<br />
Every 5% of rune focus works out to 100 extra enchanter rune and 50 extra necro/wizard rune (roughly).
<br />

<br />
Alternatively, two kinds of rune foci could be added: +% on self-rune spells, and a stacking 'combat modifier' like +% on runes that land on you.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Secondly, rework "Mind over Matter". Remove the reuse timer, place the buff in the short-buff-box, remove the hit count, and change it's ratio to 3 damage per point of mana at L 3 (2 and 2.5 at L 1 and 2 respectfully). Have MoM only work on damage that gets through runes.
<br />

<br />
This means MoM would be up whenever the enchanter wanted it up. For the most part, I suspect enchanters would keep it up at all times -- which means enchanter mitigation for short-burst damage is as good as a tank's, but they can't keep this mitigation up for long periods of time.</span>
<br />

<br />
Thirdly, return the enchanter PB line to a decent state.
<br />
The OOW PBAOE stun should have a 1.5 to 1.0 casting time: it is supposed to be cast when creatures are beating on you, 2.0 seconds is silly. Add in a L 66+ PBAOE mez spell: having 2 PBAOE defence spells is tactically important for when one is resisted.
<br />

<br />
Together, these changes make enchanters good tanks against spike DPS from monsters. At the same time, sustained enchanter tanking isn't viable. Even with +50% efficiency, arcane rune on an enchanter isn't efficient enough to tank. And the 3 damage:1 mana ratio of improved MoM is laughable compared to current heals, even ignoring tank mitigation advantages over a cloth class.
<br />

<br />
However, using these abilities, enchanters can be relied upon to deal with an add. Resists make the encounter more costly, which means the enchanter may need a break, but don't kill the enchanter quicker than they can be healed.
<br />

<br />
This results in crowd control abilities whose cost increases with mob DPS. It also retroactively makes high-mana gear (typical enchanter itemization) good for crowd control purposes. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I'm a big fan of the "varied mez" ideas. This absurd "one size fits all" mez spell stuff is for the birds. We should have: 
<br />

<br />
A) Fewer identical mez spells. Give us a "basic" mez at our first level of each expansion (like apathy in PoP) and a "high end" mez towards the end of our progression in each expansion (like bliss in PoP). Heck, Ideally, we would get -one- "generic" mez each expansion - a high end one like Euphoria. Felicity shouldn't exist at all, and Bliss should go to 70. 
<br />

<br />
B) A "lockdown" mez. 100% more mana than the equivalent "generic" mez. 2.0 second cast time. -40 resist mod. 4 tick duration. Possibly a short recast (4 seconds?) to keep it from being the only mezz used during lockdown. 
<br />

<br />
C) A "holddown" mez. 50% more mana than the equivalent "generic" mez. 8 second cast time. No resist mod. 20 tick duration. 
<br />

<br />
D) A PBAoE mez. 1.5 second casting time. Just like WoM only maybe give it a -10 resist mod. This should be in addition to a stun (which should also cast in 1.0 or 1.5 seconds, dangit. 2 seconds is stupid for a PB defense spell.)</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

On the head.  I liked being able to save groups with being able to multitask slow/mez and figuring out what to use where.  I never charm as I see it as driving a wedge between an enchanter and a group, which I've always enjoyedmore. If they want to make it group friendly woopie, but I've never really cared one way or the other.  When I do usually use it, its on mez immune mobs, ghetto mezzing.  Aside from this and fixing our 1.5's effect....
<br />

<br />
WHERE THE HELL IS A NEW FRIGGIN SLOW?~?~~??
<br />

<br />
We're the kings of haste and enchantment.  we make enchant arms to make them move faster and learn how to do that better with nearly every expansion, why the HELL can't we learn a better slow since kunark?  I have no problem having a less supierior slow then shammies, but an UPDATE for crying out loud! Beastlords have nothing about them at all that should let them slow aside from being animal shammies, and they're slowing faster than us, and only 5% less effective at it!  hell, rip the slow effect off the Serpent of Vindification and stick a new name at it and I'd at least feel better.   Our slow is kunark era and now 13 levels lower than I am.

<span class="postbody">It seems to me before we get to specifics on what Chanters need we need to look at the issues the Average Chanter has. These could be;
<br />
1. Use in Group Passive, (Buffs etc).
<br />
2. Use in Group Aggressive (Debuffs, Mez, Charm, CC, Nuke)
<br />
3. Survivability in groups
<br />
4. Survivability Solo
<br />

<br />
1. I dont think Chanters want much more in the Passive line. Sure if some one said, want a Self only Mana buff? Some would say yes please. But maybe they would also want a 6k Nuke, ability to feign death and so the tipping of any balance goes. Some sort of a mana refresh for the group may be good, but it would depend on what was added elsewhere. Somehow I think the average Chanter would like to see a bit more action, a bit less buffage.
<br />
2. Use in Group Agreesive. Ah the Crux I think. I dont want pets to change. I feel a bit indignant that SoE made the problem, when players took the initiative and the risk ( I am angry at the statement that charming a snorting,slobbering,procing, death machine comes with 'minimal risk' is utter nonsense. However, if we have to loose pet dps, we need something in return. Having the mob loose haste etc when charm expires is not enough. You loose the dps, what can we get in return. A possible answer is a caster pet. Just an idea, but a pet that stuns, or memblurs, or nukes. Make it so the charmed pet can be given a stun/hate proc and he becomes part of CC. Give it Nukes proc and it becomes part of the DPS. Also give the Chanter more flexibilty on commands. It just doesnt sit well that, as the masters of controlling others, we dont get basic commands such as Sit, stay, fetch until late 50's early 60's. Allow the pet to guard not just the Chanter, but other casters. This idea could be adopted for their own pets, but they would need better ac/hps. 
<br />
3. Survivability in Groups. With the higher end content comes higher end damage and the enchanters protection ramps up with that. Right? Wrong. The Self only rune should be ramped up in hps, and/or a chance to memblur proc when hit.
<br />
4. Survivability Solo. SOE says its going to improve those classes that arent able to solo well. I think the Enchanter class could do with a tweak.
<br />
An idea as above if you could summon a healing pet. (Pally pet? Cleric pet?) That could buff and heal itsself?
<br />
I think the nukes could be ramped up a little, not as high as a Mage but a little higher at least.
<br />
Possibly take away summon from non boss/raid mobs, may help us solo too.
<br />

<br />
Just a few ideas.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I challenge you to create a stun that will keep us alive in today's content the way our old stuns did, without re-enabling AoE groups (which Sony has taken great pains to avoid.)  '
<br />

<br />
1.0 casting time stun. 8.0 duration. Places an "immune to stun" (or even "immune to PBAOE stun") counter on the mob that lasts 12 seconds. Zero recast delay. 
<br />

<br />
This is a PBAOE stun that will keep you alive, but will not allow AOE groups. If it gets resisted, you can simply recast it. "
<br />

<br />
Just the 1.0 casting time stun with 8 second duration and norrmal recast would be sufficient. There would be no need place an immune to future stun on it.   AOE groups would still be impossible in OOW, due to the high resist rate, summoning mobs, and intant death and wipe that would follow from a single resist on any AOE attempt.  Recall the pulling in Acrylia Caverns(AC) or fungus grove(FG) or The Deep(TD). The puller was runing with 20-30 mobs behind him.  Often they would be damaged when they got into camp and needed cleric heals right away.  The aoe groups succeeded then because the tank would live to get to camp.  
<br />

<br />
Imagine now, a hypothetical AOE group in odi/bh in mpg.  The puller invises and runs to taskfiend camp.  Then he clicks it off and begins running back.  He gets a couple mobs, one begins summoning him, he can't get away, and splat in 1 sec or less.  Imagine he does somehow get to camp with 20 mobs.  Say you have 2 enchs with the single 1 sec spell with a normal 2 second rescast.   As you recall, for AOE in luclin, we had 4 spells that you could mem and cycle through.  This provided adequate coverage and overlap.  But how many resisted? Hardly any ever did, and when they did, the timer from the last stun was still up and they were stunned the next cycle.  There were times, that some mobs did get free, cleric heals kept the ench alive long enough to recover sometimes, or other times, it was a wipe.  Imagine the situation in odi/bh.  Assume a 20% resist rate. The puller brings 20 mobs to camp, your first stun mezes all of them for 8 seconds except for 4 of them who resist.  The second ench's stun mezes 3, and leaving 1 on you.  You die in the 2 seconds it takes to recast. Group wipes.
<br />

<br />
Assume somehow that you make it past the first round.  Now the nukers need to start nuking.  Recall how many hit points the mobs have, this will take a while.  All that time, you have to surmount a 20% resist rate on 2 mobs with 2 ench's haveing just 1 stun spell.  It will be a wipe.  Imagine doing FG or TD or AC with just one 8 second stun spell for each ench where the resist rate was maybe only 5%.  It would have still been a wipe. 
<br />

<br />
A single fast 1.0 cast time normal stun spell is all we need.  AOE groups will not be possible.

<br />
No, do not give enchanters a 'chance to memblur proc when hit'.  Dumping aggro on the cleric may make us survive a second longer, but it doesn't let us help the group survive.
<br />

<br />
Just say no to aggro-dumping on other group members.
<br />

<br />
This may work on raids or other situations where there is already enough tankage that an enchanter isn't needed, but in groups it's foolishness.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

What is with you people and deception?  Lets get our core functionality fixed before we worry about goofy toys like this.  (And yes, no matter what sort of random functionality you attach to it (being NoN-KoS in the zone, or whatever) this is -still- a toy.  Until crowd control and survivability is fixed, this spell should remain dead.  I refuse to have some dev who could be doing something useful for our class wasting time fixing this spell.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
