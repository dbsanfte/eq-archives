<span class="postbody">It's winter, and since you're probably stuck inside a little more, thought it might be time to have a new thread on books.
<br />

<br />
I'm currently reading Forgotten Realms - The Dark Elf Trilogy, which is surprisingly well written (not to say that the D&D line of fantasy novels are crap, just that I am really enjoying this one).  It's the history of a (famous I guess) Dark Elf ranger named Drizzt - available in larger size softcover.  Don't recall ever reading Forgotten Realm's before, but I did read some Dragonlance novels about 10-15 years back.  This one is decidedly better than those.
<br />

<br />
One of my all-time favorite authors is Stephen R. Donaldson - Chronicles of Thomas Convenant, Mirror of Her Dreams / A Man Rides Through, the Gap series.  He recently published the first of what is billed as "the last Chronicles series" in which Thomas is dead and features Linden Avery (female heroine from the second trilogy) in her return to the fantasy world.  It's available in hardcover only at this point.  I think I will wait until the second of the 3 is published before I buy it - can't stand waiting 1+ years to know the ending.  If you've never read Donaldson, do yourself a favor and pick one up.  In terms of plot development and ease of reading, The Gap series (SF and not fantasy) is the best of the 3 out there.  I recently learned that he published a few novels in the Private Detective / Mystery genre back in the 80s (possibly under another name at the time) and I might look those up.
<br />

<br />
Last year, I discovered L. E. Modesitt and devoured 2 of his series - Recluce and Spellsong.  They are a bit repetitive in theme and plotline, but still good reads.  Recluce series (about 11 published) is my favorite of the two.

The only thing that I didn't like about the Drizzt books (and I don't know why it bugged me, but it did) was that everytime RA described Gwenhwyvar (sp?) he always wrote the same thing.

"So and so was walking along and was pounced upon by 500 pounds of panther."

<span class="postbody">I've read everything by Salvatore, with the exception of the Star Wars and EQ stuff.  Personally, the part I like best is how he keeps the story flowing along.  I can pass hours without even noticing.
<br />

<br />
Another couple series I keep up on are George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice (and the offshoot Hedge Knight short stories) and Sean Russell's The Swan's War.
<br />

<br />
All of these are similar in that they have many "main" characters and the stories bounce around keeping you up-to-date on what's going on with everyone important.
<br />

<br />
Of the three, I'd probably have the hardest time recommending Sean Russell to anyone.  Personally, I love the story and how he writes, but then again, I'm odd.  /shrug
<br />

<br />
Oh, and I've read the Dark Tower up to and including Wizard and Glass, which was my favorite after the Gunslinger.  My brother has the others, I just can't bring myself to read 'em after I know he rushed to get them done.  And too many people complaining about the ending... 
<br />

I have a ton of other books I read, just not really worth going into the detail of 'em all.  I have quite a collection of different takes on Arthur and Merlin.  Some of them are excellent, other are still good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Much more court intrigue and strong-character driven plot (and plotting) than typical High Fantasy stuff, but truly amazing books.

Actually, I'd suggest you go ahead and read Wolves of the Calla and Song of Susannah.  Both of those were very good books, IMO.
<br />

The Dark Tower itself isn't a bad book, but if I could go back, I really would stop where King told me to stop (unprofessional as it was).  It's the same ending I had imagined, yet feared, since I read the very first book.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Fiest: some good things early .

Nivens: the entire Ringworld series, and some of his other writing is good, including some of his collaboratives.

Goodkind: a very good up and coming author; fairly new but not = in last 10 years anyway - I am very far behind in his works.

For those enjoying Rice, take a look at Brian Lumley, if you haven't yet: the series on Vampyres is a marvelous twist on them and theirs - Necroscope is the first, all others listed on the pages by publishers are very good reads; Gods what I wouldn't give to have that series or the foundation story made into a movie - the effects these days would Roxxors.

<span class="postbody">I haven't touched a forgotten realms book in years. Liked whatever the first Drizz't book was (Can't even remember the name now.  It's been that long) but found that the series largely degenerated into "look how cool my characters are!" after about the 2nd or 3rd.   Not many authors can really sustain good fiction on a common theme over more than three or four books, I find.  (I haven't read the Dark Tower, so I'm willing to cut Mr. King the benefit of the doubt in this regard, but it holds true for every other longer series I can think of.)

I haven't had a lot of success finding good new fiction lately - though I'm about halfway through Garth Nix's <span style="font-style: italic">Sabriel</span> and enjoying it thoroughly.  I also liked <span style="font-style: italic">The Dreaming Tree</span> by C.J.

<span class="postbody">Foundation was an AWESOME series. It really is a great read. One of the best SciFi series IMHO. 
<br />

<br />
I like most of Raymond Feist's novels but the last one, Conclave of Shadows series just kinda didn't do it for me. The series name was misleading as the CoS was barely talked about except more as foreshadowing for an upcoming series...a three novel foreshadow.
<br />

<br />
Herbert's Dune series was great. 
<br />

<br />
Piers Anthony's Xanth series is a good read but it seems geared towards young adults. Still entertaining but it's not what one would call serious fantasy. One series I really liked was the Incarnation of Immortality series by him. My favorite being the next to the last book which is about Satan. Not the most serious of series but I found it an enjoyable read.
<br />

<br />
Aside from the Dark Tower series by King, I also found IT and the Stand to be very good books if very long. Each book is about the equivalent of 2-3 novels in itself. 
<br />

<br />
Watchers by Koonts is also a book that I highly enjoyed. It was the subject of two very shitty movies that butchered the story.
<br />

<br />
Probably relatively unknown but I found it to be good was James Clemens the Banned and the Banished series. 
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=pd_sim_b_1/002-5024563-7447227?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=JAMES%20CLEMENS" target="_blank" class="postlink">Amazon link here if you wanna peruse what people had to say about it.</a> That is not my personal Amazon link or anything, I just put it in there for easier access. If you wish you can go to amazon and do a search for James Clemens instead.
<br />

<br />
The Pern series from Anne McCaffrey are also good if you like dragons and the like. It's not for everyone but I enjoyed them. 
<br />

<br />
While not a novel in the traditional sense, I think most will enjoy the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman. He wrote the story but the art was done by various people. It is a comic that was published by DC under the Vertigo line which featured more serious stories than your typical comic. This is one of my favorite series. Seasons of Mist was perhaps the best story arch of the whole series.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Frank Herbert - fantastic series, and yes, it is for a thinking person, but damn finely written
<br />

<br />
Modesitt's Recluse series is awesome. Although I prefer the early series based around the Order guys.
<br />

<br />
Donaldson's Thomas Convenant series was good. I am also waiting for the next book to come out before I pick up the new series.
<br />

<br />
Robert Jordan's series is good although, he REALLY needs to taking a writing class in order to figure out WHEN TO STOP!!!!!
<br />

<br />
George Martin's series is also good although, a little choppy as he has too many chracters for my taste.
<br />

<br />
David Farland's Runelord series is also a good choice. Trilogy starts with "The Runelords"
<br />

<br />
I really enjoyed all of the Dark Sun books from TSR. They were well written and the game world is pretty interesting. 
<br />

<br />
Feist's early works were nice. The later works were.. well.. a bit lacking IMHO.
<br />

<br />
Joel Rosenberg's Guardians of the Flame series is also good.
<br />

<br />
Phylassein had a good point with Brian Lumley. I personally can't stand Rice's vampire series,  but Lumley takes an interesting twist on things, which I enjoyed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I enjoyed these, but mostly for the characters being sarcastic back and forth at one another.   I don't consider them fine, fine fiction, and I felt that the 2nd series was pretty much the first one all over again. (Come to that, his later series, the Elenium (or something. it's been while), which started out fairly original, rapidly devolved back to the same formula. (When it got to the point of the main character, who has become king against his will and married the princess he loves but was never willing to admit to loving, is crusading west, bearing the most powerful BLUE magic item in the world, with the express purpose of slaying a mad god, the similarities just got too strong.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I just thought Dune was tedious and contained a bunch of characters I couldn't stand.

If I can't empathize in some fashion with the main character, the book gets put down. Dune got put down in a hurry.

<span class="postbody">Eddings has the problem that  his characters, whatever the world, always include a sarcastic dwarf/god/thief and a earth mother and a pre-pubescent 50 year old ... The Tamuli and following  series were so repetitive. The series about Polgara and Belagarion after the Belgariad were well done.
<br />
Having said that his psycho thriller is brilliant and his new elder gods series while sharing the character issue has a stunningly different world and theme. I like his chatty writing style, which he shares with a few, and the ability to make the books fast paced but not vacuous (TR anyone)
<br />

<br />
David Gemmel has the same ability as Edding's and Asimov and Heinlein and Niven and very few others to take non stupid content but make the immersion so great that it seems to be easy reading.
<br />

<br />
Andre Norton's Troy book
<br />

<br />
Just read Altered Carbon and Broken Angels which were a brilliant exposition of a future where nano and brain dumps combined. The first was Mickey Spillane on Nano and the second was sorta same world concept but John Wayne at the alamo. Like him very much.
<br />

<br />
Feist love his series, especially the first three, and the later lot after the serpentwar crap is essentially as good as the first especially the collaborations

Now that I can understand. Personally I didn't get through the books after the original for that reason, and the fact that all the good ideas are contained in the first book and the rest is fluff. It's pretty typical science fiction, in that it has some neat ideas tied to science in it, but it's still written by an marginally social math/physics nerd. It's a fun read from that standpoint but I don't consider  it a classic outside the genre. I consider Asimov the same way, in that he's good for SciFi but not really a good writer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

To the best of my knowledge, there are two.  I’m still waiting for more of these also…
<br />

<br />
The Hedge Knight was originally published in the Legends compilation.  This is the story that the “graphic novel” was written from.  Other than losing some description because it was shown, it’s the exact story.
<br />

<br />
There are about 10-12 authors that all wrote a short story based in their worlds.  While George R. R. Martin’s Hedge Knight was my favorite, they were all extremely well written and worth the time.  This compilation came out in hardback around 1997ish I believe.  I could be off as I usually am.  But, it was re-released in 3 parts, paperback style.
<br />

<br />
Then, Legends compilation #2 came out.  This was a couple years ago now I think.  Dunk and Egg have been together a while and have traveled quite a bit and end up in a very small keep working for a family that was once great, but have fallen far.  IMO, it’s at least as good as the original Hedge Knight.  Unfortunately, I can’t think of the title to this story.
<br />

<br />
In case anyone was wondering…. Yes I do wander Barnes & Noble (or equivalent as available) quite a lot.  It’s actually how I can across the Legends compilations and most of the other authors I read.  I usually wander for about 4+ hours and walk out with about 5 or 6 new books.  Once they’re done, I head back for another barrage of reading.  I’m currently finishing my last book before I’m off to find my next set.
<br />

<br />
Hmmm… I get paid Friday…..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
