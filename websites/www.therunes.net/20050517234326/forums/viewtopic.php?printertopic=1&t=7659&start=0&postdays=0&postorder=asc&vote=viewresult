<span class="postbody">I've only played a few games so I'm trying to tap into the experiences of those who read this forum to narrow down a search.
<br />

<br />
I'm looking for a MMORPG out there where the game is not so depedent on a single class (i.e. healer).  Is there a game where a few friends of any class can go out and have the same chance to succeed in an encounter as any other group with a different class makeup.  A group of 3 mages has the same chance as a healer, tank and CC.
<br />

<br />
If someone made a game like that it would be awsome.  You can choose the class based on what you enjoy.  Meet new people and play with friends based on how much you enjoy playing together instead of worrying about the class makeup.
<br />

<br />
If someone knows of one I would be very interested in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">It's very rare you'll have a MMORPG with healing that doesn't rely on that class. Consider a boss encounter where you've got 5 people fighting a single monster. In order for that monster to be balanced ideally they'd be 5 times as strong as a single player. So you have a monster with 5 times the hit points that hits 5 times as hard (assuming all classes are balanced). In order to survive a group of say 5 mages would have to unload all their mana to kill him before any of them get killed. Now lets assume that this is possible, and the encounter is balanced with that in mind. Take the same group and replace a single mage with a healer. Now suddenly you aren't in danger of dying at all and the four mages with the single healer would suddenly find the encounter trivial. Add a tank and it only increases the ease of the encounter. 
<br />

<br />
I think of this as 'defense bias' in MMORPGs and I think it's fair to say that it's largely unavoidable, and also a good thing. MMORPGs tend to have a 'offensive bias' as well that makes the best DPS classes sought after as well, although they tend to be more popular so you don't run into problems as much finding them for groups. It would make the game significantly less challenging if they balanced encounters around the idea that the weakest formation was capable of everything, because it's inevitable that someone will form a group that isn't the weakest possible set up. On top of that their is something to be said about trying to encourage groups to be well balanced so that everyone is wanted in a group for different reasons. 
<br />

<br />
I think ideally you'd look for a game with only a small number of classes or at least a situation where you have clearly defined roles for each class and you required at least one of each role to form a balanced group. WoW hit the mark on this one in my opinion but they definitely do require healing classes and I've seen many people become frustrated with their inability to find a balanced group as a result. I guess I don't see this is a correctable issue for any game that intends to have group based content that isn't very easy. I don't think solo content will ever be the focus of MMORPGs and from your post I get the impression you're more interested in the social aspects of the genre which keeps you coming back. I'm just not sure the kind of game you're looking for would be successful for this genre.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Groups can get awfully creative with use of "tanks" in WoW.  That said, it's true that high end instances most definitely require healers.  Two of the last 3 non-raid instances currently in WoW also favor one particular healing class, the priest - due to their ability to shackle (mez) undead.
<br />

<br />
WoW does have its "holy trinity" as some players call it.  IMHO, it's more of a holy duo - Priest and Mage.  Priests are highly favored due to shackle undead (a priest-only ability), the most efficient quick heals (WoW is all about fast heals, and less about big, slow casting heals) while Mages are favored for AE damage and Humanoid mez.  Oh yeah, priests have a castable rune good for keeping mages alive.
<br />

<br />
True, a warrior or paladin will significantly reduce downtime compared to having a pet tank - but druids seem to be able to tank fairly well in bear form.  I don't know how viable paladins are at the high end, with respect to ability to get and maintain agro.  My group has relied on a shaman tank on more than one occasion in instances, although I don't know how well this would work in Stratholme or Scholomance.
<br />

<br />
As new content becomes available for WoW, we'll see if the holy trinity/duo perseveres.  My bet is it will.  Outside of instances (think LDoN in EQ - though in WoW it's where the best quests/drops take place), any group can defeat any encounter within appropriate level range.  That and any class to solo to max level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Probably not, for the reasons described above. I've done instances in WoW with no healer and won, but we certainly did not have the same chance to succeed (it was rough).
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, WoW has plenty of content outside of instances where a few friends of any class will do just fine. So if you can't find a balanced group, you can always go do something else.

Mage: heals pets by using 'mana' to prevent damage.  Pets can take damage, if they die the mage does.  Does damage

Lich: posseses monsters.  As a monster, can take damage.  Does damage, and protects the vessel which it occupies.  Switching vessels is hard and cannot be done in emergencies.

Make them catered to that class specifically just focusing on their core abilities and working together.

Easy to answer this one:
<br />

<br />
Quake
<br />
Doom
<br />
Soldier of Fortune
<br />
Medal of Honor
<br />

<br />
Any number of 'rpg's out there that cover a wide range of classes wherein the situation is always doable no matter which class you choose...
<br />
/sarcasm off
<br />

<br />
Any game where each and every class can, essentially, solo will break down to being tantamount to a first person shooter... thus the sarcastic reply above.  With WoW, I felt like I was playing an unbalanced FPS, so, I quit.  Same goes for CoH.  Both games have one thread in common: they both tried to keep downtime minimized by ensuring that all classes could stand alone and that no single class was absolutely necessary.
<br />

<br />
Problem is, if no class is necessary, all classes have to be able to stand up on their own and you end up with a situation where you don't group as much as you otherwise would... even worse, you don't really have to develop any play skillls, as a group, since by definition grouping only makes the same content easier.  This is obvious when you compare WoW to EQ by watching how each class member acts in a group.  In EQ a healing class WILL heal or the group will eject the healer (assuming the healing class is fulfilling the role of primary healer) in WoW you will find primary healers who don't heal but rather tank a lot... and the group won't care because the group will get along fine, if a bit roughly, without a healer.
<br />

<br />
Sorry if this upsets anyone, I don't mean this as a slam to WoW or EQ (or any other game) but an observation of games where classes can stand alone and solo with impunity versus a game where classes have to work together to make progress... at least in limited cases (the whole game doesn't have to require grouping, but, some content will, is what I'm getting at).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">As near as I can tell, this dependence on healers (and preferrably a tank class for them to heal) is necessary.  If you stick to the idea that players have hitpoints and they die at zero hitpoints, but there are clerics to heal those hitpoints, and dragons hit hard enough that you need some healing to survive... well, it becomes almost inevitable.  So we're stuck with it in pretty much every game for awhile.
<br />

<br />
What would it really take to get away from healer-dominated MMORPGs?
<br />

<br />
Idea 1:
<br />
In most games today clerics have at least enough healing per second to match the damage output of a mob.  If they couldn't heal that fast they'd be unable to keep a person alive.  HPS &gt;= DPS.  Imagine if HPS was much much lower than DPS, or in the extreme if there was no healing at all.  The only way to win a battle would be to spread the damage out to everyone in the group, there couldn't be one dedicated tank.  You'd just hope that you could kill the mob fast enough, before everyone's hitpoints were gone.
<br />

<br />
For practical reasons, that DPS would have to be pretty low.  For a 40 person raid to have a ten minute fight against a dragon, each and every person in the raid needs to tank the dragon for at least 20 seconds each -- in addition to any sort of AE damage that happens during the fight.  Or for a group of six to fight for 3 minutes each person has to tank the mob (or multiple mobs) for at least 30 seconds.  And if DPS is low, then HPS is even lower.  At that point it's actually usually better to get another warrior instead, so you can kill the mob faster.  Congrats, you made healers so weak that there useless.
<br />

<br />
Well, that's not completely true.  Only during-battle healing is made useless.  There could be all sorts of powerful healing and buffing between battles.  But that's another story.
<br />

<br />
Would such a game be exciting?  Maybe, but it would definitely seem 'slow', there would be hardly any twitch factor at all.  It would be more strategic.
<br />

<br />
Idea 2:
<br />
Clerics like to hit the heal button almost as often as offensive classes hit their attack buttons -- once every ten seconds at least, preferrably more.  It makes them feel involved in the battle.  So we get mobs that hit really hard and a huge amount of healing is needed.  With mobs hitting so hard, even tanks can't go more than ten seconds without a heal, and as a result groups in general can't accomplish anything without a healer.
<br />

<br />
Result: if clerics aren't the dominant class in a MMORPG then they're boring and nobody will want to play them.
<br />

<br />
Idea 3:
<br />
There IS another option, one which was actually used in EQ for awhile.  Have healing limited by mana rather than speed.  When the wizard gets aggro away from the warrior the group doesn't have to think 'oh no, the wizard is going to die quickly if the cleric doesn't react fast'.  Instead they think 'oh no, the cleric will run out of mana and need a med break because the wizard has weak armor'.  Personally, I liked that version of EQ, but I know the clerics complained about spending all their time meditating and doing little else.
<br />

<br />
That's fine and dandy for groups, if they don't fight efficiently they pay the price in downtime or sometimes even death.  But what about raids?  If mana, or mana efficiency, is the limit to what you can handle, then winning is a matter of doing enough DPS to the dragon to kill it before your clerics run out of mana.  Basically, you get those marathon Luclin fights that lasted an hour.
<br />

<br />
Excitement is also limited in this case.  Med breaks are not exciting.  And in raids you don't have the constant fear of death every few seconds.  Rather you have the clerics' mana gradually going down, at roughtly the same rate as the dragon's health goes down, and once you find the rhythm there's almost zero chance of anyone dying during the last 59 minutes of the fight.  You also get some less-than-heroic roles for some classes, such as mod-rod-dispenser or twitch-the-cleric.
<br />

<br />
So... it's not terribly surprising that in PoP and later EQ switched to more fast-paced healing and much higher-DPS mobs to make battles, and especially raids, more exciting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
