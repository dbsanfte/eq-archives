<br />
Hello Everyone,
<br />

<br />
We sincerely apologize for the downtime this weekend. We had some hardware issues that caused us to have to tread very carefully in bringing the game back up. We wanted to triple check everything to make sure there wouldn’t be any major problems, and it’s taken a while to both fix the problem (we had to fly out engineers from one of our hardware vendors) and to bring each of the servers back online because of the careful validation process we need to go through. We have to do this very carefully and we hope you can understand our desire to do this right. We're trying to balance that with getting the game back up as quickly as possible. So far most servers are back up and the rest should be up in the next 4-6 hours, hopefully less. I realize that ETA's that come and go can frustrate people, so we do our best to give you the most realistic estimates possible.
<br />

<br />
Out of respect for our players, we’re doing the following:
<br />

<br />
1) Every player will receive 3 free days.
<br />

<br />
2) Early this week (Monday or Tuesday) we will have a 24 hour period where we will have accelerated XP gain. Details are still being worked out and we’ll communicate this to you as we firm up the plans.
<br />

<br />
We are committed to providing you with excellent service. Our team has been here for over 40 hours straight, <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: red">and I can tell you our dedication to doing right by our players is the thing that’s foremost on everyone’s mind here at SOE.</span>
<br />
</span>
<br />
Thank You,
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<span class="postbody">The crux of the matter is that every concern, every question, and damn near every promise made to the <span style="font-weight: bold">enchanter</span> class has been largely ignored.  It doesn’t matter how many enhancements they add to the game itself when the class most of us loved has been made a shadow of anything resembling what we used to be.

This too was taken directly from the Summit attendees notes….

The entire list of posts, suggestions and concerns were sorted and given to the correct people. Developers and Customer Service all assured me that the weekend was NOT the only opportunity to discuss these issues. This weekend was the begining of a new era of SOE and players. Open communication and a desire to HEAR what we have to say is going to be the norm, not the exception. I truely believe that they are sincere in the desire to make the kind of game the players want.
<br />

<br />

<br />
They WANT to fix our concerns and they want us to be happy with the solution…... The balance to that is the fact that an open line is now open between us and the people who make this game. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

So if this was their idea of “better customer service”, what happened?  What happened to listening to the classes, soliciting feedback, better communication?

They were a bit surprised that the spell cast recovery bug was still there. That was also on the top of my list for Rytan (the spell guy) Stackablity during raids, and the loss of our concern that there is a loss of our class defining abilities at upper levels were also discussed.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

They can leave mobs charmable then as they will be dealing "reasonable" damage. My response was .. but wait a second. In all fairness what happens when charm breaks?

No, not from reviewing that list. Of course, I never said there were, just pointed out that saying nothing was done as a result of the summit is an incorrect statement.

I <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> speculate that OoW was draqstically changed as a result of the summit. We have no idea what they were planning to release before it. It could have sucked really bad, and the summit had them redo it mostly. There is no way to know that.
<br />

<br />
As far as promises made to the enchanter class as a result of the summit, I don't recall any being made. As a matter of fact, I recall most reports saying that they avoided all class specific issues all together. More so, I can't, off the top of my head, recall an actual promise they have made to the enchanter class at all since the summit. Perhaps there were, maybe you can refresh my memory on a promise they made specifically to the enchanter class directly from the summit or even since then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Show me SoE is listening….show me changes that happened to the enchanter class that affected us in a positive manner. Show me where our issues and concerns have been addressed.

We, as enchanters tried and tried,  sometimes eloquently and sometimes a bit more crudely.  Regardless of the delivery method, one  thing stood out.  SoE was not listening.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Again, I am completely baffled by this. The summit occurred on June 5th, Juwel's last words before posting the note were "At dinner that night, we were all given this:", and the first paragraph states "In fact, in trying to generate this list to give to you this evening, we realized there was so much to go over that wouldn't be able to get a complete list together in time. " What gave you the impression this list was compiled and decided on long before the summit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Show me specific improvements to the enchanter class that came about as a result of the last summit.    Show me the increased communication....

It has ALWAYS been apparent to me that Sony's primary goal was (and is) to make money. Occasionally the best way to make money is to do right by your players. Often, it is not.

Of course, thinking about it, I suppose it is obvious why Smedley would make that claim. Because you make more money when your players think you're going to 'do right by them'!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Bad arguements, internet tough-guy nonsense, circle-jerking and saying the same thing again and again more loudly until you're right do nothing. 
<br />

<br />
SOE is a company. As such it cannot be good and it cannot be evil. It exists for the purpose of making money and will take actions to that end. If it believes, like blizzard for example, that being percieved as a "good" company will help, it will do that. If not, then not so much. But let's not fool ourselves: They can't be nice and they can't be mean. They're a company, not the guy who makes you breakfast or the other guy who shits in said breakfast. 
<br />

<br />
SOE, as a company, cannot be said to be incompetant because they make too much money. If you don't like SOE, don't buy their services. If SOE does something like give the players a few free days and some experience gain, getting worked up over it makes NO DAMN SENSE. 
<br />

<br />
I hate wal-mart. When wal-mart has a sale, do you see me frothing at the mouth at everyone who thinks it's a good price? When someone mentions it, do I use it as an excuse to fly into a blood frenzy over the evils of the bad, bad people who run wal-mart?

This is not news! This is not interesting! This is not productive!

You do not run into a mcdonalds and scream about how evil mcdonalds is and then expect to have everyone just deal with it because by god you used to eat at mcdonalds and you know how it is.

um.. you should maybe learn a bit more about companies.. past and present.  if you look at it from .. 'just trying to make a buck' then no.. that isn't evil.. everyone in the world almost is trying to do that... but when you fire your employees here so you can open up a sweat shop that uses children to make clothes and pay them almost nothing... id saw thats not very neutral on the ol good evil slider.
<br />

<br />
so yes.. companies can be evil.. or good.  as far as soe.. I don't think they are good or evil.. I think they incompetent.. like most people are saying.  but you are so busy getting huffy over people that you don't seem to want to see that.
