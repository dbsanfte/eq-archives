        <p>1. Hail Historian Sharar<a name="epic1"></a><br>
          Hail historian Sharar and she gives you some long text about taking 
          a book to Elder Animist Dumul. Just answer [yes] to this and she hands 
          you the book. Now the key here is to notice the last line of text. She 
          states that the Khati Sha are disturbed as of late. If you ask what 
          they are disturbed about she doesn't have a complete answer but knows 
          it has to do with the spiritual realm. This is VERY important. Head 
          to the Beastlord guild and Elder Animist Dumul is standing behind a 
          counter next to the guildmaster. </p>

        2. Take book to Elder Animist Dumul<a name="epic2"></a><br>
        Hand him the book and he says something to the effect of not trusting 
        you or something. He asks how much you know. This is where you use the 
        text from Sharar. You state you know the Khati Sha are disturbed about 
        the spiritual realm. I believe the trigger here is the word spirit/spiritual. 
        He then states basically you are a nosy little punk but he likes that 
        and you might be the person they are looking for. He asks you to bring 
        him back the Copper Medal of War. He says it can be retrieved by helping 
        the scouts in the Grimling Forest. <br>

          <br>
          Go to the outpost in Grimling Forest. Ask the General 'which camps'. 
          He will tell you which camps are available. Completing a camp quest 
          is the quickest way of getting a medal, as at least one should drop 
          in all camps (but some people say it doesn't always). </p>
        <p>If camps are available, go to a Scout or a Veteran, and hail them and 
          follow the conversation. You will find one who will offer you one of 
          the camp quests. He will tell you a trigger phrase to start him towards 
          the camp; when you are ready, say it and follow him - he moves slowly, 
          so there shouldn't be a problem with mobilising yourself or a group. 
        </p>
        <p>When he reaches the camp spot, he gives you further instructions. You 
          have to speak another trigger phrase, the camp repops, and he heads 
          back to the outpost. You then follow instructions, which will usually 
          involves killing certain mobs while others are untargetable; when you 
          have killed all the targetable mobs, others will spawn and become targetable. 
          This continues until you have cleared the camp; then a boss mob should 
          spawn for you to kill. </p>
        <p>The copper medal might drop off any mob in the camp; in some it drops 
          from the final mob, in others from some of the waves of mobs. Remember 
          to loot all mobs. The various camps also drop some special loot. </p>
        <p>The first three camps can be soloed by a mid 50s beastlord easily. 
          A duo of 49s should have no problems. The later camps get harder; from 
          camp 4 upwards you may need a small group of mid 50s. </p>
        <p>The camps are the surest way of getting a medal quickly. If the camps 
          are not available, and all the camps are populated with bandits, then 
          the medal is a rare drop from coin couriers. Use a tracker to find the 
          couriers, or just kill bandits until one spawns. </p>
        <p>You do not need to buy anything to start the quests; you must speak 
          the trigger phrases to the scout/veteran, and he must return to the 
          outpost. If you don't, the quest hasn't started and the medal will not 
          drop. <br>
        </p>
        <p> Once you have the Copper Medal of War in hand, run back to Elder Animist 
          Dumul. When you hand it in, he hands you an Official Seal of the Khati 
          Sha and a Carved Wooden Crate. The crate is a 6 slot container that 
          has a combine button and the Seal (haven't id'ed it yet) seems to look 
          like those ancient coins you get. He states that if you lose the seal 
          at any point to return to him and state that you have lost the seal 
          and would please like another and he gives you another. He also says 
          to stash those two items and return to him in a bit when you are ready 
          to be briefed. I stashed the two items in my bank, ran back over there 
          and stated [I was ready to be briefed]. He speaks of a magic-user that 
          is using wooden totems to siphon the power of elder spirits using [new 
          magic]. He is using this power to summon entities of malign intent. 
          He then states that through further research, they (the Khati Sha) have 
          discovered the name of the magic-user</p>

        <p><b>Scout Location</b>: (by Entrence/ladder, behind some rocks)</p>
        <p> Hand the scout the coin, and a big bear will spawn in the bear caves, 
          so you<br>
          should probably clear them out first. Not to mention, there is supposedly 
          a<br>
          new NPC there that is pretty tough for a new quest.</p>
        <p>If you are heading towards Lady Vox's lair (map coming soon). If you 
          go straight instead of turning left, you will fall through the floor 
          and into a room with about 5 bears in it. Either have your MT jump down 
          first, or drop down invisibly and get to work killing them.</p>
        <p>Once they are cleared, have the beastlord turn in the necklace, and 
          be CoTH, or RUN RUN RUN to the group. The Icebound Spirit spawned next 
          to the rock in this room. he wanders around the caves, so be careful. 
          We just used the MT agro, then everyone goes in, and kills the bear, 
          and it was fairly easy.<br>

        <p>Hand the coin to the scout, and a Giant White wolf will spawn in front 
          of the Shadowed Men tower. His blind spell can last a good bit, so Have 
          the main tank, try to keep agro, and try to keep everyone close at that 
          point, so if you do get blinded, the wolf doesn't get pulled to far 
          to hit him, and you should be fine.</p>

        <p>Hand the coin to the scout, and a Giant Gorilla will spawn. From the 
          scout if you look off to your right towards the zone, you will see some 
          ruins. He spawns in the middle of the ruins. Have your group ready to 
          fight when you hand in. We stayed at the scout, and had the druid track 
          since we weren't postivie where he spawned. It helped to be this far

        <p>Hand the coin to the scout, and a giant Will-o-wisp will spawn. The 
          wisp spawns at the top of the waterfall, so we had our MT waiting up 
          there to nab him. It might be wise to get someone with safefall, since 
          the spirit can dispell your levitation and knock you off the cliff with 
          the stun. Other options would be to have a lev ring ready so if you 
          did get knocked off, you could click it before you hit the ground. Or 
          have the tank a ways back, and use a bow to pull, and fly down FAST. 
        </p>
        <p>We fought him at the bottom of the waterfall, and we didn't really 
          have much problem with the water, but we did seem to have a distance 
          problem, so make sure your clerics stay close enough to heal.</p>

          Dumul requested has almost been completed. We need you to gather a few 
          items in order to complete the weapon. These items will not require 
          much effort to acquire, but I will need to tell you where to look. Place 
          all of the items that I request in this box and return it to me as quickly

          <p>Weapons Master Rahoul says 'The ore that I require is often used 
            to create living rock formations. These collections of rocks and boulders 
            will often leave a trail of energy that causes other rocks to collect 
            and come to life. Our scouts have seen these formations in a variety 
            of areas. Take care when you attempt to gather this ore. '<br>

          <p>Weapons Master Rahoul says 'If you look in the Maiden's Eye, you 
            will find entities that are the embodiment of darkness. Their twisted 
            spirits are not allowed to escape the form that they inhabit. They 
            have no hope of escape, unless they are released during the destruction 
            of their material form. There are some occasions when the power that 
            is used to keep them in this realm will turn upon itself during this 
            period of destruction. This process is what produces the Gems of the 
            Void. '<br>

          <p>Weapons Master Rahoul says 'When traversing the Deep, you will run 
            across a shrieking fungus. Those creatures are much more durable and 
            dangerous than the other fungi that you may encounter in the caverns 
            of Luclin. It is for this reason that we use their flesh as padding. 
            Take care when hunting them, for they will provide a good challenge.

            The design was research by Historian Qua. They should work to neutralize

        <p>Turn in seal to Scout Halimia in Fungus Grove. This will spawn Draz 
          and his warder in two huts. You will find these huts on the wall in 
          a valley between 2 bandit camps. For us the pet spawned on the right, 
          and he spawned on the left, so we stayed at the tree, and pulled the 
          pet to us, and killed him first. Then we pull Draz and worked on him.</p>
