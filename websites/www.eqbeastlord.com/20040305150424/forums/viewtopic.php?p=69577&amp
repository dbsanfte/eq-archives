				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone just thought i would add my own guide to fast exp here on this board. I have been playing every since everquest went live so i thought i would share a few pointers=) 
<br />

<br />
There is Deffinatly a variaty of places to hunt in EQ i will name as many as i can for evil races. When you first start out it will be tuff(Unless your Twinked=) but just remeber to keep at it and good things will eventually come. I know alot of people want the best loot posible and the easiest way to make money to get better equipment. In my opinion equip will come to you as you level and so will platnium. So dont freak out if other players have Very nice equipment and your sitting there in all cloth=) 
<br />

<br />
Evil Races Iksar/Orge/Troll
<br />
 
<br />
Field of Bone-
<br />
(Levels 1-5) 
<br />
This is one of the best newbie places i have ever seen. The XP really flys here even if your new to EQ. Just kill yard trash till level 5 here. Always remeber to try and keep all skills maxed. Later on you wont regret it=). Also there are alot of newbie quest here to get Curscale Armor,exp and money. For Curscale Armor there is a place in Cabalis across from the monk Guild. Hail the NPC behind the counter and follow the quest text and he will give you an 8 slot backpack to combine 8 scale wolf pelts into. Go out into field of bone and kill scaled wolf pups collect the pelts put them in the backpack and hit combine. Hand the combined backpack back to the quest giver and he will give you a random Piece of curscale armor and some money and XP(I know you will probully think the armor is crap if your twinked but if your not it is quite good to start out=). There are a few more quest that are easy but i didnt do them. I firgured they were almost a waste of time cause it dosent take long to go from 1 to 5.
<br />
     For the other races above just hunt in your Newbie area till level 5 or so. There are good hunting grounds for Orge and troll too in the newbie areas. But i have seen alot of the other evil races move to Field of bone because of the great exp. Just dont go near Cabalis cuase you will surly get hammered. It can be a long road to get to field of bone form Ferrot but if you have the Planes of power Expansion its a breeze.
<br />

<br />
Field of Bone(The Pit)
<br />
Levels 5-9)
<br />
  After you hit level 5 make sure you go back to your guild and learn kick it really helps at this point. There is a place at the end of the path from cabalis (A.K.A The Pit). this is a very good place to hunt solo or group.
<br />
It might be a little difficult solo at first but the exp is outstanding here. If you cant handle it there is usally a few people around that will group. Stay here untill level 9 (Finally=) Now you should have enough money to buy your first set of spells. The spell locations are kind of tricky because they are all scattered from shaman spell venders and beastlord spell venders in Cabalis. The level 9.15 and 22 spells are all in cabalis except for Tiny companion which is in plane of Knowledge in PoP. I have noticed they must of added some of the hard to get spells in there. They used to be a few that wernt there. But anyway go ahead and summone your first warder=) Aww isnt she cute LOL. Now comes the best part=) Also dont forget to put at least 1 point into casting skills. After the first point they increase fairly easy but if your having trouble casting certain spells you could always put in more. Also Bind wound is a very Important Skill to Master. I know at first it will seam like it isnt doing anything for you but it does get alot better later on. I also set up a hotkey for sense heading and just got used to clicking it all the time. it might seam useless but it can help later on down the road finding certain locations.
<br />

<br />
Kurns Tower
<br />
Levels 9-17 or if you want to hunt down below till 19
<br />
  This is a very easy to solo on the first floor here. Just pull the two door mobs till you get more comfortable. Make sure you learn how to use your pet or it will get you killed. Set up camp to one of the sides near the zone and park your pet(Pet guard here command) Now once you pull a mob and at any time the mob swings at you your pet will come to the rescue. So what you have to do is hit the Pet back off command untill the mob arrives so you dont get any adds here. After you learn how to effectively use your pet you could explore a little bit. I would suggest staying on the first floor untill you get level 12 or so and dont go down to the third untill at least 16 or 17. Make sure you loot the skeelies for money and bone chips. you can either use them for the Newbie bone chip quest sell them at the vender or in Baz what ever best suits you=). unless your Rich and dont need it. Another thing to Remeber is to keep going back to your guild in Cabalis to learn new skills or if you KOS there you have to hike all the way back home=( . You get Dodge at level 10 and meditate at 12 so dont forget about them=)Take addvantage of this spot becasue this will probully be the fastest leveling you will see. I went from level 1 to 19 in 10 hours of play=) So you can be the judge. After you get your level 15 spells it will go bye very fast in here. Especially with thre pet proc and DOT you get. And to confirm any rumors you might have heard Pets no longer take any XP from you so dont worry if your pet is out Damaging you=). Which he probully will at level 15 because he is Yellow to you at 15 (Very Nice pet)
<br />
 As for the other two evil races i recommend comming here to level fast but if for some reason you dont have one or any of the expansions you could go elsewere for exp. Northern desert of ro gives good exp at the platform. Just be carful of the poison and disease because it can really hurt. Also the orc camps in East commons can be pretty good XP but i dont suggest soloing them unless your higer level but bye then the XP will stink anyway. There is alot of different level mobs to kill up till level 14 or so. But once you hit 14 or 15 you would probully be better of going to WC killing wandering bears and such. But if your KOS to druids make sure you stay away from the Druid Rings cause they can really kill you fast. There are also a few NPC they are really nasty near the sand area of WC. try to stay away from there. This zone is probully not very populated any more because of the PoP portals. If you happened to see a high level druid or shaman around try to bum a few buffs of them cuase it really helps the XPing. the loot isnt all the great here but is ok for you level anyway. Once you start geeting crappy exp its time to move on. Oasis is pretty good exp but most of the time its way overcrowed. Since they added the new XP increases it can really go bye fast but personally i hate Oasis because there are wandering Madmen(that cast) Hill giants and those stinking casting mummys ouch=(. But it is fairly safe in groups. Also higher level classes like to come here and hunt the Specters which are really nasty. Sometimes you will be doing good and all of a sudden you get mowed down bye a bunch of Specters someone trained on you. it is totally up to you were you hunt=) Another thing to mention you might want to buy your level 19 and 22 spells after this area becuase once you venture out it will take a hike to come back and get them in less of course you cant afford them yet
<br />

<br />
Overther (Mub Pit)
<br />
Levels 17-22
<br />
  The Mud pit in The OT zone can offer pretty nice loot and XP. Plus there is a vedor right there to sell to and get supplies even though she is quite expensive. The easiest way to get here is taking the PoK portal to the OT zone and following the water on your left till you hit a wall and then go right you will see a little mudpit with a iksar merchant standing there Just make sure you dont go right from the PoK portal cause just about everyone is KOS to the Outpost very nasty mobs in there and also goons sometimes hang out there. I have found backing up againts the zone wall at the Mubpit area a nice place to pull from just park your pet there and go out and find a mob. This way you dont get alot of adds. These mobs give about 2 to 3 % per kill so not to bad. I would stay here untill level 22 or if you want to try to find blue mobs level 24. I reccomend that all evil races hunt here very nice exp at this point.
<br />

<br />
 At level 22 you will start to become more versatile to places you can hunt at. I will go threw some of them. 
<br />

<br />
Warsilks Woods Giant Fort
<br />
 This is a pretty good place to solo from 22 to 30. Also it isnt far from the Mud pit in OT.  Also if you are Iksar Cabalis is just up a little ways from the giant fort. Just zone into warsilks woods from OT. From the vender next to the mud pit walk to the zone wall and head with the wall facing your left till you hit a little path that seams to dead end. Head straight up from there to get to the warsilks woods zone. Just watch out for wandering goblins,bandits giants and brutes as you head to the giant fort.
<br />
Follow the path to the right all the way to the fort. But dont go threw the little badit camp or gob camps avoid those at all cost. The easiest way to get into the giant fort is to go around to the front were there arent any giants guarding it. Theres is a hill at your immediat left as you go into the fort. Summone pet and park him there. These are easy to single pull so it should be a cake walk.
<br />

<br />
Cave into Dalnirs
<br />
Levels 22 to 30 possibly higher
<br />
  This is pretty easy place to solo or group but there is rarely any body around here. To get there from the OT zone going into Warsilks woods follow the wall to your left till you hit the water. Then with the water to your left head down some. It is kinda tricky finding the entrance to the cave but just keep looking for it it should be on your right if you follow the water line up the hill some. Its there might take a min to find. There are two camps inside the cave one of them has 3 brutes and one has 2. The good thing about these things is they dont aggro from each other so they are easily singled. You dont even have to pull them out of the room=). The bad thing is once they start to run(3 spawn only) they can get stuck in the wall and and still hit you for damage. if this happens just go down the tunnel and zone into Dalnir. (dont go afk in Dalnir cause there are very nasty mobs in there) It might be hard at first at 22 unless your twinked but it gets better as you level=) some people stay here till 34 or so.
<br />

<br />
Lake of Ill omen(Kunark)
<br />
 This is a very nice place to level from 22 to 30 also but it gets really repetitive here. I have taken 3 charecters threw and frankly i am sick of it=) But there is alot of good stuff to solo here and it does have its rewards. At first you might want to head to the windmill area till you get the hang of killing here. If you need to find the windmill just shout for a Location.(be nice though) Also you can get a group to do the Sarnak fort here which is pretty good exp. At level 30 most stuff turns light blue to green here.
<br />

<br />
Pauldral Caverns(Luclin)
<br />
 This is also a very nice place to level and it has an experiance bonus. the bad this is it can get very over crowded. It is possible to solo but may be difficult cause it may be hard to single pull. Also we dont have root to keep them from running. If you can find a group XP can really fly here. If you need directions to this zone ask around or look on the websites it isnt to bad to get there.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Frontier Mountains(Kunark)
<br />
Level 30-45
<br />
  This zone is located Adjacent to lake of Ill omen There is a Giant fort in the Middle of the zone here which can rack up some decent Xp and great Loot. Just shout if you dont know the loc and usually someone will tell you. Also try to have levitation up here cause the rocky terrain can cause some nasty damage if you fall down it. This is a very good place for loot i still come back here with my high level charecter and farm weapons and forrest loops. It may not be feasable to solo these at 30 without mayjor downtime anyway but thats totally up to you. Even grouping here can weild some greap XP.
<br />

<br />
Another alternative at level 30 is the other halve of Overther zone. Its down quite a ways from the Mudpit area from before, or it is possible to zone in from frontier Mountains also. Its quite a hike from lake of ill omen zone but its pretty safe most of the time. Just follow the wall to your right from the Lake of ill omen zone untill you see a clearin to your right. Its pretty far but easy to get to. Soloing here is a breeze just make sure to watch out for GOONS they kill just about eveyone on site. I wouldnt reccomend setting up camp at the ledge cause it gets trained with goons all the time. In the SW corner of the zone is a pretty good setup point to go too (unlees its overcrowed). Also down by the SkyFire zone is good also cause if you get in trouble the zone is near bye.  This place will be good all the way up to level 49 if you want to stay that long. Just be careful of the Sabertooth tigers and Sarnak knight cuase those are alot higher in level and the tigers dont run at low health they just keep on whacking away at you=(. 
<br />

<br />
Dawshroud Peaks(Luclin)
<br />
 Level 30-42
<br />
  This is another good place to solo with not to bad of loot envolved. Just make sure you watch out for tains and people trying to kite mobs It also can get very boring here but some of the mobs drop Acrylia Ore used in Tailoring which sells between 50 and 70pp depends on how quick you want to sell it for Bazarr. Some of them also drops hides used in tailoring.
<br />

<br />
Dreadlands(Kunark)
<br />
 Level 35-49 or more depends on how ambitious you are=)
<br />
  There is a good place to solo in here that i enjoy hunting at. This zone can be dangerous so make sure to watch out for Gorenire the Dragon she is level 65 or higher and sometimes gets trained to Karnors castle thats in the zone. The zone in to here is located off of the frontier mountains. There is also a few other ways to get here. You can take the wizard spire port down from Luclin, theres a Druid ring here and there is also The zone in from firona Vie which has a portal book from PoK. I recommend printing a map of this place unless you have been here before cuase it is very easy to get lost.  There are a few Different Yeti caves here that are pretty good solo. They are mostly located on the outer walls of the zone but be very careful as you travel becuase there are alot of wandering mobs here. You can also try to solo near Karnors castle at higher levels or grouping here is good exp also. Karnors castle is the big structure you see when you travel around a bit. The loot here isnt that bad and the XP is really good in chain pulling groups.  Once you hit 49 or 50 you can also try to get a group in Karnors castle there is very good droped items and XP in there BUT this is almost the worst trained zone i have ever seen so be careful. you might try to solo a few but thats up to you. its hard to stay safe here solo. The zone isnt to hard to get out of though but thats were all the trains are right where you zone in.
<br />

<br />
Ocean of tears
<br />
 Levels 45-54
<br />
  This might be another option to do at level 45 or so but might be a bit difficult getting there.  You have to take the boat in freeport to get the the islands in here. So either you have to take the evil tunnel to East freeport boat area or hope someone can invis you and it holds up to get threw here without getting killed. There are a few islands here you can hunt on but the secound island is good for this level(Sister island and such). The one i am tallking about is the one with the Giant named Gornet on it. There are also seafury cyclopses on this island. Gornit is a very good way to make money he drops Giant toes worth about 5pp and at  anywere between 1pp to 40pp. He is also on a 6 min timer so he pops fast=). Once you get about level 49 you can start to try to kill one seafury cyclops at a time. They drop gems and fine steel weapons also and not to bad money. pretty good exp. They have alot of Hit point though so it can be tuff just be careful.
<br />

<br />
 I just thought some of you could use some ideas of were to hunt i know there are alot more places that i havent even mentioned in this guide but i couldnt possibly know everything=). I hope you can use this information and become a very powerful EQ player if you have any questions or comments feel free to let me know. Remeber to always keep your skills maxed at each level and dont forget to train in them as you get them. If you dont keep them maxed you will be sorry later becuase it is very hard to raise them at high levels. Hope this helps =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
