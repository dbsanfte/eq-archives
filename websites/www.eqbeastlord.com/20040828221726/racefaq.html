        <p>Stat Overview:</p>
        <p>Iksars come out as having the most smarts which will mean you will 
          have more mana and be able to raise in other non-melee skills quicker. 
          Trolls have the worst starting wis and wont have as much mana. The other 
          races are all average in there wis.</p>
        <p>Ogres have the best Sta and Str which will make them better meleers. 
          They won't run out of stamina as quicky when using heavy weapons. They 
          also have the most HP. Iksars are the weakest and least ammount of hp 
          of the beastlord classes. Trolls and Barbs also have higher hp then 
          the other races but not as much as ogres. Cats are average.</p>
        <p>Iksar and Vah Shir have highest Agi which will give them slightly better 
          ac, but Iksars also have there ac bonus which is even better. Ogres 
          have the worst agi.</p>
        <p>Vah Shir have the best Cha which will cut down the cost of items compared 
          to the ogres who have the worst. This isnt very important in the later 
          levels but it can make an untwinked newbie char's life easier to have 
          higher cha.</p>
        <p>Dex - Not the most important stat, helps procing weapons go off more 
          often, but not drasticly much more. It also helps raise melee skills 
          quicker the higer it is. Iksars have the highest in it.</p>
        <p>So it basicly comes down to this:<br>
          <strong>Iksar:</strong> Best Mana and AC but weak<br>
          <strong>Ogres:</strong> Best Str and HPs. but lower mana and worst ac<br>
          <strong>Trolls:</strong> Better Str HP then ave, but worst mana<br>
          <strong>Barbarian:</strong> Average but little more str and hp<br>
          <strong>Vah Shir:</strong> Average but little more ac</p>

        <h3>Race Abilities:</h3>
        <hr align="left" width="75%">
        <b>Barbarian:</b> 
        <hr align="left" width="10%">
        <strong>Gods:</strong> Mithaniel Marr, The Tribunal 
        <p><strong>EXP Mod:</strong> +5% extra to level</p>
        <p><strong>Good:</strong><br>
          <u>Slam</u>: This is good for stunning mobs since BL kick can't stun. 
        </p>
        <p><u>Good faction in all good cities</u>: Makes life easier. Easy to 
          find banks and vendors.</p>
        <p><strong>Bad</strong>:<br>
          <u>Blind in dark</u>: Means your forced to carry light stones with you 
          until the high levels when BL get spells to fix it. Still hard to see 
          in outdoor zones even with light stones.</p>
        <hr align="left" width="75%">
        <strong>Iksar:</strong>
        <hr align="left" width="10%">
        <strong>Gods</strong>: Cazic-Thule 
        <p><strong>EXP mod</strong>: +20% extra to level</p>
        <p><strong>Good</strong>:<br>
          <u>Regen</u>: Double the hp gain is always good at any level. Its less 
          mana you and others have to spend on healing. Mostly usefull while medding 
          then healing yourself after your done medding.</p>
        <p>Swimming starts at 100: Means less hassle trying to learn it later. 
          Most of us will need swimming eventually. Very usefull on PVP servers 
          where it can be an early edge over slower swimming foe. But its still 
          nothing too usefull when your fighting out of water.</p>
        <p><u>Forage</u>: Capped at 50 and its only usefull before we get summon 
          food and water. Not really important at all.</p>
        <p>Scale skin AC bonus: Iksars have an AC bonus which isnt anything to 
          ignore since BLs armor selection isnt all that great. Its about +1 ac 
          every other level, at level 60 they would have an extra 40 ac. </p>
        <p><u>Infravision</u>: Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. 
          Not as good as Ultravision.</p>
        <p><strong>Bad</strong>:<br>
          <u>+20% Exp Penalty</u>: Tied with Trolls for the worst exp penalty 
          in the game. Just means you will level a little slower then ther other 
          BL races which most have bigger then average exp penalties too.</p>
        <p><u>Hated</u>: Iksars are KOS in all cities in the old world and all 
          cities in Kunark except for Cabilis. Its hard to get good faction in 
          most cities. But they like Iksars in Temple of Cazic Thule. They are 
          not KOS in Ice Dorf town in Velious and Shadowhaven and Cat town on 
          the moon.</p>
        <p><u>Cant wear plate</u>: Well since beastlords cant wear plate anyway 
          this doesnt really much matter. But there are a few plate wrist items 
          other BL races can use. Not a big loss for Iksars though.</p>
        <hr align="left" width="75%">
        <strong>Ogres: </strong> 
        <hr align="left" width="10%">
        <strong>Gods</strong>: Rallos Zek 
        <p><strong>EXP Mod</strong>: +15% extra to level</p>
        <p><strong>Good</strong>:<br>
          <u>Slam</u>: This is good for stunning mobs since BL kick can't stun. 
        </p>
        <p><u>Cant be stunned from front</u>: Less stuns is good.</p>
        <p><u>Lots o' hit points</u>: This drives most clerics insane too.</p>
        <p><u>Infravision</u>: Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. 
          Not as good as Ultravision.</p>
        <p><strong>Bad</strong>:<br>
          <u>Evil</u>: Only not KOS in Dark Elf, Troll, and Ogre Cities. Also 
          not KOS in Evil fort in Kunark, Ice dorf town in Velious, and some cities 
          on Luclin</p>
        <p><u>Big</u>: Only an annoyance most of the time. You will get stuck 
          more often in dungeons then the little people will. And you get in other 
          peoples way.</p>
        <hr align="left" width="75%">
        <strong>Trolls:</strong> 
        <hr align="left" width="10%">
        <p><strong>Gods</strong>: Cazic-Thule, Innoruuk</p>
        <p><strong>EXP Mod</strong>: +20% extra to level</p>

        <hr align="left" width="75%">
        <strong>Vah Shir: </strong> 
        <hr align="left" width="10%">
        <p><strong>Gods</strong>: Agnostic</p>
        <p><strong>EXP Mod</strong>: None</p>
        <p><strong>Good</strong>:<u>Sneak</u>: Good for getting past some mobs 
          before we get invis. Also very usefull for getting vendors that dont 
          like you to sell to you.</p>
        <p><u>Safe Fall</u>: Makes traveling safer. Less annoying falls for 1 
          to 10 damage while going down hills too.</p>
        <p><u>Good faction in all good cities</u>: Makes life easier. Easy to 
          find banks and vendors.</p>
        <p><u>High Stamina Regen</u>: Vah Shir's sta bar will regen twice as fast 
          as every other race. Wont need to be shouting for Zing every 5 seconds 
          when using heavy weapons.</p>
        <p><u>Infravision</u>: Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. 
          Not as good as Ultravision.</p>
        <p><strong>Bad</strong>:<br>
          <u>Big</u>: Only an annoyance most of the time. You will get stuck more 
          often in dungeons then the little people will. And you get in other 
          peoples way.Consume Food Faster: Cats eat food and drink twice as fast 
          as all other races. Just need to carry more. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Pets:</h3>
        <p>Theres no known diffrence in kinds of pets other then the way they 
          look.</p>
        <p>Barbarian: Normal Wolves<br>
          Iksar: Scaled Wolves (mini Dinosaurs)<br>
          Ogres: Brown Bears<br>
          Trolls: Alligators<br>
          Vah: Tigers</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Other Considerations:</h3>
        <p>Iksars have the best level 1-20 hunting grounds then any other race. 
          They will have it easiest in thoes levels finding mobs to kill. Field 
          of bone is the best newbie zone in the game. Also the Vah Shir have 
          good hunting grounds. The moon has well designed zones. Barbarians have 
          the third best hunting grounds with lots of weak animals that drop items 
          for tailoring.</p>
        <p>Most Beastlords are also Vah Shir since there new, so if you dont like 
          being the new Fad race then don't pick the cats. At least 80% of beastlords 
          are Vah Shir on my server.</p>
        <p>Vah Shir currently have the best Quests. The other races quest seemed 
          like Verant spent 10 min making.</p>
        <p>Most Beastlord weapons and armor drop on the moon, So plan on taking 
          a Lunar module to the place eventually. Vah Shir start there so they 
          have better access to the items. But the moon is a very laggy place 
          on most peoples computers. Might be very annoying to go there. I get 
          mixed reports on how good the zones there are for camping and exp. Most 
          say its ok exp. others say it sucks. </p>
