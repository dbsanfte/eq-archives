Either way the logic is flawed, especially when you recognize the fact that Sony and Yantis/IGE have to have some sort of collusion for them/him to have gotten so big, but thats a different conspiracy theory for another day.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Then, as was alluded to, you don't have clue one what an RPG is about. I've been playing, and DM'ing, AD&D games, as well as playing in, and admining, various offline, online, and convention tournament games since approx 1974. You bet your bippy players who know what an rpg is spend long periods of time with no level progression in favor of questing, "tradeskilling", or just conversing with people, elevating their knowledge, and community stature just from their behavior. Leveling is secondary, not primary. In an FPS, yes...it's all about the levels and loot, so you can slaughter more people while taking less damage. They are two different things.
<br />

<br />
EQ has made provisions to both mindsets, though. This is great. But the last 3 expansions have been geared to the hack and slash, "powergamer" mindset of upper end players, NOT the low-mid levels. All previous expansions had great amounts of content for all levels of play (as of the time of their release). PoP, LoY, and LDoN were geared to high level players with "nothing to do", though...and only bones thrown to the mid-high players.
<br />

<br />
PoP, unless you're in your mid to upper 50's, is just about a BYOG, or you're sol...and you can't even enter the whole of the primary expansion area unless you're 46+. LoY has creatures for those level 35+ to fight, but unless you have an army, or a solid group of 65's with some good aa's, you aren't getting to most of the content to enjoy it. LDoN was supposed to be level 20+, but the raid content is for level 65's with a lot of aa's who are, at minimum, VT geared. The high end raids, unless you've been farming PoTime, you WILL fail, many times just on zone in. There is NO raid content in LDoN for less than VT/Ele prepped. NONE. As for normal groups, unless you are 60+, it's very difficult to get a pickup group in an LDoN dungeon. I've had to go with friends, or not get groups at all in them, in my 50's...forget about lower than that, period. The point system for LDoN caters to the post 60 crowd as well. Again, just bones thrown to any but the upper end of the population. Nothing substantial for those that play for play's sake.
<br />

<br />
Shadows of Luclin had things for lowbies... Of course! It had a starter town! One thing should be noted, though, about this expansion. MOST quests aren't done. Why? Because for all the richness of the stories, the elaborate detail of the quests, events, interconnected stories, etc, the results of the work that requires, often, again, HIGH level people even for the lower end quests, the rewards for them are subpar even by old world comparisons. The Qeynos Badge of Honor Quest can be done with fewer, and lower, people than many of the basic "lowbie" quests in Luclin, and the Badge is a MUCH better reward for all the work. Most Luclin quests, you'd be lucky to get the help needed to do them...Too many of those required for doing them don't want to "waste their time on that crap"... Even beyond Paludal Caverns and Echo Caverns, Luclin is surprisingly devoid of people. Well, not completely surprising. For, while there are areas ostensibly laid out for all levels of play, the experience for working there, the things to accomplish for all levels of play, are counteracted by the obscene AC of the mobs...even the low-end ones geared to the lower people. It near requires you be a "twink" to survive the same level encounter that is found in Kunark and the old world.
<br />

<br />
Scars of Velious was a great expansion for, at the time, the upper end people. Nowadays, it's good for groups in the 40's and up, as the content for those below that are near nothing, with a couple camps that were, when I hit that level range on my first character, hotly contested. ooooo 2 snow cougar camps was it unless you had a friend already higher level that could run you in and get your GD port shard key thingie... Then you could go to CC...IF, again, you had the friends of higher levels to help you get into it...
<br />

<br />
More content with bones to the low people but geared towards, or requiring, high levels interact there with, or on, your behalf.
<br />

<br />
Kunark was the last expansion that really had "something for everyone" with equal care taken to see that there was something worthwhile for every level of player, and ever playstyle with enough quantity to make it worth going there en masse on all levels of said playstyles and levels. Quests, raiding, solo, and grouping. EVERYONE had many things to do, and multiple areas tailored to them.
<br />

<br />
SOE has NOT been playing out expansions since Kunark aimed at the low-mid and mid-high set. They've been throwing bones to the majority of the players to cater to members of such guilds as Afterlife and Fires of Heaven by releasing some of the most stiflingly high content and a few sheckles of meaningless content for the "average joe" player who plays for play's sake... I know people, far more of them than I know "ubers", that log on to relax after a long, hard day at work, and just want to enjoy themselves. They don't care if they wipe to a mob, and often laugh about it because of the company they keep... The mob, often, being one that powergamers put them down for wiping to... It's sad.
<br />

<br />
All of the people who play this rpg to play in an rpg and just enjoy themselves do NOT hurt the gaming experience of powergamers. But, conversely, powergamers often make the gaming experience sometimes highly intolerable... Taking camps meant for lower level people just because they're "bored"... Treating them as inferior simply because they don't choose to be powerful... Insult, berate, and degrade those who wish to RP. Put down anyone who's opinion is other than theirs about the game in general. Again, I've received serious hate tells from people just for saying I enjoy the ldon raids... For saying I love doing Plane of Earth. For saying I love messing around in [insert newbie zone where I go to rp here]... I've been told I'm an idiot...a moron...on drugs...stupid...a loser...have no clue...for saying I still find a ton of things I enjoy to do in the game. I have never once sent a tell to someone calling them similar for NOT finding the game enjoyable. In fact, I say "well, if it's so bad, quit. go play something that's fun." To that, I get more hate tells...
<br />

<br />
Excuse the hell out of me, but when EQ isn't fun, I'll stop playing. Maybe y'all should do the same. And I mean the <span style="font-style: italic">game</span> itself...Not the players who make it a pain in the butt...<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=919244" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dahnyiel Jaxohn</a>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I am a newer player of EQ, so my opinion should be taken somewhat with a grain of salt.  That said, however, I've played many MMORPGs and generally they have similiar issues.
<br />

<br />
1)  Content is key to maintaining  a player base.  Earth and Beyond had an excellent concept and good base foundation and was beautifu to look at, but as soon as you reached level 30 (of 150 possible) everything stopped.  There was nothing to do.  No quests, no uber-mobs, nothing but driving from one end of the universe to the other and back again for hours on end.  Why bother?  I lasted a month.
<br />

<br />
2)  DAoC - I was there the day the game came out and it was wonderful.  Everyone was new and experiencing for the first time.  However, it quickly became a levelling treadmill of hours and hours fighting the same mobs for less and less XP while competing with the other players for pops.  It wasn't fun.
<br />

<br />
3)  Anarchy Online - I got in in the very-late beta.  It was buggy and overcamping was a major problem.  Never even bothered to buy it, even when I was offered 3 months free.
<br />

<br />
4)  Asheron's Call - My first real game and I never liked the system.  The XP system was twitchy and I never really saw the socializing I'd hope for in a game.
<br />

<br />
5)  Before all this, old-school text-based MUDs.  This is what I was looking for in an online game.   Socializing, friendly namecalling, things to do and goals to reach!  Get a good programming crew and you could have hours of fun while avoiding your masters thesis.
<br />

<br />
----
<br />

<br />
Now, where am I going with this?
<br />

<br />
Everquest has so far been exactly what I'm looking for in an online game.  A tremendously huge social network both in the game and online (you can't shake a stick without hitting a forum dedicated to some obscure EQ group).  
<br />

<br />
The LDoN adventures have been a godsend for the casual gamer like myself.  I can log in when I get home from work and get into a quick group at my level and be done with the adventure in around two hours.  I often find myself running with the same people over and over which encourages the social aspects and because each adventure is instanced, I don't have to fight with other people outside of my group for monsters to kill or get accused of kill stealing or loot stealing.
<br />

<br />
The one thing I have seen though is that EQ has grown beyond the newbie gamer.  This is to be expected.  Older characters hand down their lesser gear so even level one characters have good gear.  Granted, these are often alts or friends of high-level characters.  When I was brand new, I found myself alone in the cat-city newbie zone barely able to kill silk worms while someone else of my level was quickly wisked off to be power-leveled to 20th in an hour and outfitted with battleship armor.  Groups actually rejected me because I was under-equipped.
<br />

<br />
I felt like there was no place in the game for me and considered actually either quitting (which I didn't want to do because the later levels looked so much like what I wanted) or buying some platinum from an online resellter.  I know the last one makes everyone feel kinda dirty all over, but in reality it was the only legitimate way to enjoy the social aspect of a game that demanded twinkness to be included in all the reindeer games.
<br />

<br />
That said, a couple of very kindly handouts of large amounts of equipment and platinum allowed me to get some very good weapons and armor.  A half-dozen people took pity on me and showed me around and helped me get equiped.  From there I got got invited into a good group in Kurn's Tower that got me from 13th to 20th level over the course of a hard Saturday's play and from there I got into some LDoN groups and started making friends and here I am less than a month later at almost 41st level.
<br />

<br />
Think about it, what the hell am I doing at 41st level in my first month of play?  
<br />

<br />
Earlier in this thread somebody made a really good point.  When I was 30th level, what was there really for me to do, except get to 31st?  Sure, there are a hundred quests out there if you can find them, but A) who can keep them all straight (poor quest journal, IMHO) and B) the gear at those levels is worse than the hand-me-downs I'm being given so it's not worth my time and C) all the really cool is at later levels anyways <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
So, what am I trying to say in this message?  I don't really know.  LDoN is great, that's for sure.
<br />

<br />
In any case, happy hunting.
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Hehe.. speaking of quests... I still find it funny that in Ever<span style="font-weight: bold">Quest</span> - the quest system in game is a bit .. well... crap really. I kinda agree with some of the posts here that the game has turned into a powerleveling frenzy hack and slash game where the aim of the game is more about getting "Uber" rather than enjoying a well put together storyline, that is part of a quest and well.. you know.. the feeling of <span style="font-style: italic">Adventure</span>.
<br />

<br />
I started playing EQ just after Kunark had been released and even back then the quests were crap, especially when you were a newby. after buggering around for a couple of hours trying to find various NPC's, collect various items and figure out various crappily thought out puzzles your final reward was?.. a lantern and a few gold.. whoopie foooken-dooo..! By the time SoE put in the class based newby armour quests, EQ was one big twinkathon.
<br />

<br />
Now I have been watching people play the new berserker class - and yes.. the majority of them twinked to the gills. I saw one aggro kiting with his throwing axes.. wow.. another aggro kiting class.. just what the game needs. Also the race is on to be the first Berserker to level 65.. I did a /who ber 1 5 all, on Karana and I got the "The list has been cut short - too many players" message - the new flavour of the month it seems.. but I keep feeling that with this expansion .. it's just.. more of the same - Another class.. few more zones for high high level players.. more skills.. a tradeskill UI that I thought was nice, but annoying - I use a deluxe sewing kit as an extra bag and the UI .. well it just got in the way - and.. yes, MORE items.
<br />

<br />
I would imagine a few more quests had been put in as well.. but only again.. for high level players - and lets face it, with the EQ twink age waxing at it's full level, if they included low level quests with this expansion with worthwhile rewards, not many would do them. It's just plainly apparent to me as I write this, that EQ is a victim of its own over-itemization... and everything that SoE brings out to expand on the game just expands on this idea.
<br />

<br />
Is GoD and future expansions going to really be enough to add more <span style="font-weight: bold">Fun</span> to EQ? I mean.. as the game stands right now, it's getting to be a full time job for many people. <span style="font-weight: bold">Kukana</span> makes very good points and has given me an insight into how a new player views the game - and she is absolutely correct and has already discovered how itemization has effected EQ.. Kukana - the game was a very different kettle of fish in 1999/2000 ... it had more... "magic".. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> - but the quests were still really crap back then too.
<br />

<br />
Now to LDoN... which I havn't yet purchased. I've had a long break from EQ - I left just before Luclin release and came back a month or two before LoY came out. I'm still in two minds on whether or not I should get it - I do realise that it'll add the "Adventure" element I referred to before - but my mind is still grumbling about forking out .. yet.. more cash for this updrade in order to add the "Adventure" element into the gaming experience - and at no extra cost to boot.. bah, now you see my grumpy side..
<br />

<br />
Anyway... I am getting a little jaded about paying and paying and paying for expansions and then trying to figure out how much this newfangled expansion will actually improve the game for me.. and by how much..and if it's worth paying out for it..  and whether or not SoE will do the old "Bait and Switch" tactics they usually get up to when promising us one new shiny thing or another.. like the original poster that started this thread pointed out when they "Switched" the zerker frenzy ability.. or whatever.. bah.. I'm Jaded.. as you can see.
<br />

<br />
Seriously considering, and looking for a new, fresh MMORPG here... EQ still has it's "moments", although they are few and far between, now. Dahnyiel makes a lot of really valid points, but for me.. EQ, with or without expansions is losing its fun factor - and it'd take a REALLY bloody good expansion for me to stop looking for a new MMORPG.. just how I'm feeling right now..<br />_________________<br /><center>

Twinkage has certainly gotten out of hand. Even the so called 'true Beastlords' of the other board have alts twinked to the max. Many even bring Alts to the raids they attend to get them no drop items no one else wants, many two boxing so they don't even have to relog.
<br />

<br />
The more I play my Alt on Fironia Via, the less I want to log into my main on the regular server.
<br />

<br />
Sony has set up the rules on FV to make twinking an alt pretty hard. One toon per account. You cannot even move a toon to FV from another server, something I concidered doing with my main til I logged in to the Sony site and read no toons could be moved there.
<br />

<br />
No, you must create just one toon, and level him the old fashioned way. Couple this with OOC removed from most zones, the language barrior (no common tongue) and you've eliminated most things that drive me crasy on the regular server- level one's begging in PoK for handouts, Level 10s walking around in raid gear, and with no drop removed, casual players actually being able to level up (the hard way) and buy decent obtainable gear without being looked down on by the UBER raider (who on FV is selling it) when in reality those Uber raiders have used two box'ing and twinkage to zoom alts past everything this game was designed to be.
<br />

<br />
I haven't logged into the regular server in a month, though my main sits there with 350AAs as a member of a raiding guild, with 6 other alts also in gear my toon on FV has yet even started to dream about.
<br />

<br />
My alt currently on FV is sitting at the giant camp at level 45 in crap gear, with not a single item on him costing more than 200p as money is so hard to come by at the lower levels. My plan is to stay at that camp to get my first UBER item- A soltice earring- then maybe a haste item for when I ding 49.....
<br />

<br />
I've had more fun struggling with this toon than any of the the alts I had on the regular server- the temptation, especially now with the shared bank- is just too great to hand items and money to them.
<br />

<br />
My second computer, with the second account will never be fired up to two-box on FV either- No, this time I'm playing the game by the rules, the way it was meant to be played.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I don't think the game itself has too many items.  
<br />

<br />
All of the items that grow in power as you level higher in theory would make it irrelevant if a 1st level twink is wearing the Uber Plate of the Whale with a recommended level of 65, because it's protection and stats are only 1/65 of what they should be.  However, there's a lot of gear out there that is full power regardless of level and to see level 10 people wearing stuff that was obviosly created to be worn by 50th level people is what makes the newbie player like me feel as if they can't compete.
<br />

<br />
However, the drawback to having twinks wear the level-rated high level gear is that it discourages them from ever going to those areas to get the gear that they are wearing.  For example, I have a Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic.  It's a great weapon.  It must drop somewhere pretty cool.  No idea where it is and I really don't have any reason to go there - I've got MY gizmo (even if it stopped proccing until 55th -- grrrrr).
<br />

<br />
I think one of EQs major short-comings is the under-emphasis on long-term questing.  It's wonderful that there is the search for the epic weapon.  I've read the beastlord one and a few of the others and these are GREAT and involved (although I think they way over-emphasis rare spawns and huge battles).  However, what is there to carry you from level 1 to around 45 when you start your epic?  What is there to carry you after?  In my perfect world, I start a single HUGE quest at level 1 that will carry me through to the "end" of the game where my power rivals the guildmasters and I'm the envy of my hometown.  Along the way it includes my weapon and armor and spells and upgrades to all of those.  I can commisserate with other beastlords and say "Yea, I'm level 12 and I just recovered Lady Bambi's golden corsette from the Duke of Earl!  Really?  Wow I can't wait to get to that next part."  Show me progressing, guide me through a story.  Make me participate.  Otherwise, you have a fancy chat client with some gaming elements, but nothing engaging.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and a better quest journaling system.
<br />

<br />
All of that, of course, takes development time.  It takes writers and programmers and it's not easy to balance it.  In additionl, SOE has the problem that all the low to mid level players are just passing through on their way to getting to uber and the high-level and bored people are leaving.  Content has to be made for them to pay the light bills.  I can understand it.  So the lowbies are given no content and just drive hard to be higher level.
<br />

<br />
At least LDoN taylors the mobs and taylors the drops to your level and your cabilities.  It would be nice of there were more dungeons, more themes, and genuine class and race related quests rolled into them, and maybe a few things that I'm supposed to go in and do by myself.  In the Star Wars mythos (and not SW:G, btw - no idea there), the jedi is supposed to go on walkabout and make his saber alone.  An LDoN where I'm supposed to crawl a dungeon alone to find the Widget of Whatzit  gives me that accomplishment.
<br />

<br />
Sorry, I'm just rambling.  I'll stop now - promise.
