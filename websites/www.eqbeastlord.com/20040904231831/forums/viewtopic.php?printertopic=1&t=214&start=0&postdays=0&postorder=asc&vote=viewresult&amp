Acumen - Move it to 61, or just get rid off it.  A vision spell has no place as one of our level 65 spells.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Plague - With its super long duration, it's useless in groups and most solo fights.  1k damage over two minutes is horrendous, considering that Scorpion Venom does over 700 in 40 seconds.  While I realize they stack, that doesn't change the fact that plague is sub-par for 65.  Chance the duration to something more reasonable, say 12 ticks, and increase the damage by about 50%.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Frost Spear - Increase the damage to 750, giving it a 3:1 ratio, the same as our other cold DDs. I can accept the fact that they don't improve in ratio, but having them get worse is ridiculous.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Arag's Celerity - As it stands, this buff is hardly better than Sha's Ferocity, as it has the same haste %.  Increase the haste to 100%, or add some other bonus to it.  Say, an innate chance to proc more, or a couple hundred HP.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Ferocity - Still nothing but a toy, just like Savagery.  The bonus damage from ATK is not worth having to spend a huge chunk of mana and a peridot every 6 minutes.  If it were a group spell, or lasted half an hour, that would be understandable.  Raid use?  Insignificant.  Letting two rogues do slightly more damage should not be our role on raids.  And extra atk isn't going to help the MT hold aggro.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Spirit of Rellic - All we get is a very minor damage upgrade?  Give it a low-resist over the cap stun, or mana drain, anything to differentiate it.

They are not great, but I have no problem with them being 60+, remember there are 50+ shaman spells, so it scales.

100% agree.  Lower it to 62 or so, make it group version - something.

Shaman have been saying that since pre-kunark, I doubt it will change now. It is good damage, and it's a hell sight better than the Disease dot we have at level 64 (sicken)

/shrug  Would be nice, but not a deal breaker either way. I'd put this on down the list of spell tweakage

With the haste cap this is a very small upgrade, I agree I'd like them to look at this spell again.

Disagree 100%  I keep it up on 3 people, and it is a nice dps boost. MT's love it.  Every little bit helps, if the mob turns away from the MT for just one round, someone(s) may well get wacked. I dont have this yet at 63, but you can bet I will use it plenty when I do.

<span class="postbody">Keep in mind that the advantage of the new pet haste spell is not so much the haste/buffage it provides but the duration.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Sha's Ferocity is 17.5 minutes duration and 350 mana where as Arag's Celerity is 45 minutes (almost 3 times as long) for just 100 mana more.  
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
So instead you end up using 450 mana in 45 minutes compared to ~1050 mana over the same amount of time using Sha's Ferocity.  That along with minor but not bad increases in STR, AC, and ATK.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
The longer recast time also makes it easier to give up that spell slot for a more practical spell.

The problem is, we get very very few spells post 60.  Having three of them taken up by minor utility spells is ridiculous.  That's one fifth of our spells!   Give us a single 62ish spell that gives the resists of Shadoo and Jasinth, and the stamina regen and vision of Acumen.  Hardly overpowering, and it frees up spell slots for useful spells.

<br />
It's an appropriate spell when shaman get it, but 1k over 2 minutes at 65 really is laughable, when 95% of fights will be considerably shorter than that, and when 1k is 1/10 or less of the mob's HP.  Either significantly increase the damage(say, double what it is now and keep the length), or decrease the duration to about one minute.

<br />
But the extra ATK isn't going to help the MT hold aggro!  Aggro is maintained through AA like AoE taunt, and through procs.  A little extra melee damage isn't going to help.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
The only useful part is the additional resists, and with most Luclin and PoP mobs having lure resist AoEs, it's still barely useful.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Increase the regent needed to emerald, double or triple mana cost, and make it a group spell with 9 minute duration.  Of course, I'd prefer it were simply removed and replaced with something more useful, but if we're going to keep it, upgrade it.

The mana upkeep for Sha's Ferocity is low enough to allow it to easily be made up for by SP.  Better duration simply doesn't cut it.  We get a 20% haste boost from Omakin to Sha's, but a 0% boost with our next spell?  Since our pets are level 60, the haste cap shouldn't be a problem, and it can be 100% haste.

I totally, completely, and vehemently disagree with you.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Arag's Celerity is vastly superior to Sha's Ferocity.  Sha's Ferocity was a large mana drain and a pain in the butt.  A 15ish minute pet buff is just plain annoying.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Arag's Celerity is more AC, more ATK, more Str, and the same amount of Haste, but lasts 3 times as long.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
By asking for the spell to be 100% you are asking for beastlords to do more damage.  In my opinion, asking that beastlords do more damage is asking for beastlords to verge on being over-powered.
<br />

<br />

To be honest, if I had to choose between an 85% haste spell that lasts 45 min or a 100% haste spell that lasts 15 minutes, unless I was on a raid or participating in an extremely important fight, I'd choose the 85%/longer duration pet haste. <i></i></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Quote:Talisman of Shadoo/Jasinth- Two low-use utility spells are too many for our sparse 60+ line up. Combine them both into a single spell, and add a stam regen component. Call it 'Fortitude of the Wild' or something similiar.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I won't begrudge these spells, I won't use them often, but they are nice to have. They aren't a total waste, they just aren't that useful. Some classes have spells like that. Hybrids more often than not.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Quote:Acumen - Move it to 61, or just get rid off it. A vision spell has no place as one of our level 65 spells.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I agree that 65 is a bit far for this. It's a usefull spell for Barbarian type people, but I would never use it. 61 or 62 sounds about right to me.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Quote:Plague - With its super long duration, it's useless in groups and most solo fights. 1k damage over two minutes is horrendous, considering that Scorpion Venom does over 700 in 40 seconds. While I realize they stack, that doesn't change the fact that plague is sub-par for 65. Chance the duration to something more reasonable, say 12 ticks, and increase the damage by about 50%.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I sorta agree. Dot's are neat and all, but duration needs to be kept at a minute or under. Any more than that and you have a high chance of the spell losing a lot of power. Increasing the damage isn't necessary, but duration decrease is a good idea.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Quote:Frost Spear - Increase the damage to 750, giving it a 3:1 ratio, the same as our other cold DDs. I can accept the fact that they don't improve in ratio, but having them get worse is ridiculous.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Ratio means nothing. This class isn't all about mana efficiency. We aren't wizards, and I thank Verant for this spell.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Quote:Arag's Celerity - As it stands, this buff is hardly better than Sha's Ferocity, as it has the same haste %. Increase the haste to 100%, or add some other bonus to it. Say, an innate chance to proc more, or a couple hundred HP.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I agree with the others. This is all about the duration.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Quote:Ferocity - Still nothing but a toy, just like Savagery. The bonus damage from ATK is not worth having to spend a huge chunk of mana and a peridot every 6 minutes. If it were a group spell, or lasted half an hour, that would be understandable. Raid use? Insignificant. Letting two rogues do slightly more damage should not be our role on raids. And extra atk isn't going to help the MT hold aggro.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I have no solid opinion on this and it's predecessor.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Quote:Spirit of Rellic - All we get is a very minor damage upgrade? Give it a low-resist over the cap stun, or mana drain, anything to differentiate it.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I agree on this one. All it is is a 10(?) point increase in damage and puts it back to Cold based.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Not only that, but it lacks the stun component of Flame.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I would request them to add a 3 second stun to this spell, and then it would be equivalent. 
<br />

The problem is that we only have 15 spells post-60.  Having multiple ones eaten up by semi-useless ones is ridiculous.  Combine them to a single spell.

I know efficiency isn't everything, which is why I'm not complaining that our nukes are only 3:1, and that they don't increase in efficiency.  That's completely fine.  But having them get LESS efficient, with resist rate and casting time remaining the same, seems a pretty obvious oversight.

<br />

<br />

<br />
The mana upkeep for Sha's Ferocity is roughly 3.5 mana/tick, which is completely manageable.  Giving us a virtual clone of a spell we get quite a few levels earlier, with nothing but a better duration is not a worthwhile upgrade.  Giving us a 100% haste spell might give us a very small DPS upgrade, but I see no problem with that.  Doing more damage at 65 than we do at 60 is not &quot;overpowering&quot;

Unless they make it hard to resist, and allow it to stun over the cap, I don't see much use.  Limiting it to mobs under level 54 makes it useless in much of PoP.  I'd rather see a significant damage upgrade, say 180-200 dmg proc.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Of course, what I'd REALLY like to see is a proc spell revamp that replaces the post-50 damage procs with effect procs, but that would take effort and creativity

We have the most spells for a hybrid class. Having less in PoP is no biggy. Even with a few of them being of questionable value.

Again, you are fixated on the efficiency, which is totally irrelavant to the Beastlord class. I don't care if the ratio is 6:1, it's a good spell.

<br />
And Arag's is 1 mana per tick. Again, it's not about the mana savings. It's the TIME. It's a hassle to keep buffs on something, especially when that buff lasts less than 20 minutes.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I welcome this spell in it's current form and have no gripes about it. So it doesn't have more haste. It has more Atk, and in my opinion that's FAR more important for a pet that has issues based on it's level vs the level of the mob it's attacking. Atk is major. Haste is less so.

If they added the Stun, it would at least scale with the rest of the procs we get.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I don't think a 200 Damage proc for a pet is reasonable. I think our pets are strong enough as it is. I would like to see it resist against Disease or Poison, and add the stun. Anything more is just asking to eat the cake too.

<span class="postbody">Now that I've spent time in the Tier 2 planes I find Plague is a fine addition to our arsenel. Remember kids, mobs after the Tier 1 planes(PoD/PoN/PoI) have a butt load of hitpoints. 
<br />

<br />
Plague would easily last an entire fight in Valor or Storms, where the fights can last 2 minutes. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
For those of you who've learn the fine points of kiting, it's even better. I can easiely burn through 3 Scorpian Venoms in a kite, plague would be a nice add to those.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I think you will find shadoo and jasinth more useful on higher planes. As people start to build mini raids, your not always going to have a Shammy around. Last night 3 groups in PoS and no shaman. I was only buffer for a while(thank god Smote had an extra copy of Infusion of Spirit!)

In PoV in the caves or glass wasteland, or in PoS killing giants or frogs, even in a group that's only 'decent', I have to cast Scorpion Venom at the very start to get the full duration in.  If plague is going the full duration, then you're in a horrible group.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Plague stinks.  It does only slightly more damage than our level 61 DoT, but in more than twice the time.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
If we get a dot as a level 65 spell, then it should be Bane of Nife or a beastlord only spell that's similiar to damage, efficiency, and time. <i></i></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
