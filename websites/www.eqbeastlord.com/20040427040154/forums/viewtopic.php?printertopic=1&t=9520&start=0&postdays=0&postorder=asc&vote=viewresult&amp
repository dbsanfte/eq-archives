<span class="postbody">Well got my epic for my twink beastlord a week or so ago when he was lvl 50. (I knew I could do it sooner but didn't want to go though the hassle)
<br />

<br />
I did all but two fights solo with my necro (see magelo below)... here's some info I learned that might help people with these fights. I did all of them with just self shielding and no outside buffs. The whole thing took me 5 days from start to finish.
<br />

<br />
First fight was the monkey in EJ... This was a extreamly easy fight... I could have done it with no pet at all, he has horrable attack and misses and his low quite a bit. His AOE never hit me or my pet.
<br />

<br />
2nd is the spider, this fight is about as easy as the monkey was... I did happen to get his by his AOE once or twice but really doesn't do much and lasted an extreamly short time. I just pet tanked and healed.
<br />

<br />
3rd fight I did was the wolf. This was one I couldn't do solo to well and was the hardest fight of the hole epic, at least I couldn't to well without an improved healing item or my pet LOHs AA. He resisted a lot of my lifetaps so I couldn't lifetap tank him very well... I had to FD and wait for him to re-pop days later and tryed again with a cleric to help healing and it was really easy. I never once got hit by his AOE.
<br />

<br />
4th the croc in SONH. I died on my first try at this guy but rushed back and finished him before de-pop. He was pretty easy to pet tank pet needed almost chain heals... Started the fight with only 40m ended it with 60m. The first try I tryed to lifetap tank him above water... was working fine so I got on my horse then my life taps wouldn't hit him... so I died having no way to heal myself. The 2nd time I just pet tanked him under water and I would swim above water and throw on a lifetap/dot on him then swim back down to heal pet. I never got hit by his AOE stun.
<br />

<br />
5th was the whisp. This fight was also extreamly easy and it died probably the fastest of all the mobs. I says it should have a dispell proc but my pet never got dispelled or hit by any other proc.
<br />

<br />
6th the bear. cleared the way there, camped and spawned him with beastlord, then logged necro back. I had a 51 ranger in the zone track him for me because I had no clue where he would spawn. I walked up to the wall where he said he was and he dropped down from the roof on me. I just lifetap tanked him because his proc made it hard to keep pet up with heals. Was probably the 2nd hardest epic mob (first being wolf).
<br />

<br />
The images. I got help for this one because if I failed solo I'd have to do the whole epic over again and I really didn't want to do that =P I just had a 65 SK and 65 shammy friend and I used my beastlord and we did it very easy. This fight could possobly be tough solo if you were to get more than one, for us we had 2-3 at once though and didn't seem to be to much trouble. This would have taken a LONG time solo because it took quite a while with the 3 of us.
<br />

<br />
Last was the final epic fight. I ran my necro to the place where he spawns and camped out to beastlord... used beastlord to spawn him then logged back into necro. I didn't use a pet for this fight because I figured it wouldn't do much anyways. I pulled with a dot and he came running solo and his pet didn't argo. I just tanked him and dotted/lifetapped when needed until dead. The fight took a while but this guy is extreamly weak. He hits for the low 100's... His pet however hits much harder (over 200 I think) but you really don't even have to kill the pet at all. When I first got there his pet was still up, probably from the last people that did it... this how I figured I didn't need to kill it. On top of this he is slowable... This is an extreamly easy fight. The hardest part was at the end when he started running away at SOW speed... I lifeburned him at the end so he didn't get far but this could be a problem unless you have a nuker or something to kill him before he gets far.
<br />

<br />
Over all the epic seemed very easy. A lot of fights but no really hard fights like most other epics have (IMO beastlord epic has the best stats of all the other epics as well, then again it is Luclin). I think a well rounded group of around lvl 55's could do it all pretty easy or a few 60+. Good magic resist is a must for some of the fights (esp the blinding and stunning AOEs) with over 200 magic resist I never got hit by them.
<br />

<br />
Hope someone finds any of this info useful.
<br />

<br />
EDIT:
<br />

<br />
Forgot grimmling. I did the ring events with my necro as well, I got the metal the 2nd time. The first fight was just kill everything. The named mob at the end was dark blue at 65 and hit in the high 100's. Seems it wouldn't be dueable solo by a beastlord at least until you're mid to high 50's if not 62+ because I got around 3-5 mobs at once a lot of times because they just rush me as they pop. (Maybe some of the other events are easer?) The 2nd one that I got the metal on was where I had to protect some NPC from tons of mobs beating on him. This was very hard because I had to basicly tank 8+ over 100 hitting mobs at once to make sure the NPC doesn't die. I almost died doing this. You have to tag each mob once as well to get it off the person your protecting, otherwise they wont attack you. These might however be much easer as a beastlord seeing as you can slow them. Some of the named drop FT1 items (my beastlord got some FT1 mask from it). The other loot they dropped was all avrage low/mid lvl stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Thanks, this is very interesting to me as I've been thinking of trying it with my 65 shaman, but had strong doubts as I know all the 6 scout mobs are immune to slow - my main strength as a shaman. If you can pet tank em I'd guess I can too as although shaman pet is weaker, with pet toys, quiessence and tnargs he can tank quite a bit. 
<br />

<br />
Any idea what kind of dps and hp the mobs have, and what were their pr/dr like?
<br />

<br />
Stuck on the copper medal at the moment though, all 10 wars are complete on my server and have been for the last week or more every time I checked (including 8 hours after the restart post-patch)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<span class="postbody">Nothing is necro slowable... some of the images are slowable and one of the 6 mobs is slowable (the wolf, the wolf is also the hardest but will prob be easy when slowed).
<br />

<br />
Last mob is also slowable but not by necro. I tanked him easly un-slowed so shouldn't be a prob.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
