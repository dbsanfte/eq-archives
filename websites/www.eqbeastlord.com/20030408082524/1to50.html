        <h3>Gomstel's Guide - Level 1-50 Solo</h3>
        <p><strong>1-4</strong>: Stay in your newbie yard and hunt what ever comes, 
          if you die you get all your gear back and no exp loss. </p>
        <p><strong>4-7</strong>: Get to freeport and get a bind I found one in 
          like 1 min and once I got there went to EC and hunted everything that 
          coned blue and even to me. Note that I was a troll and I had no problem 
          with porting with PoP ports, getting binds is a little harder. (remember 
          to train in kick at level 5)</p>
        <p><strong>7-9</strong>: Orcs are easy at this level, I like the patch 
          in West Commons because they come in groups of 2 or 3 and most of the 
          time 1 </p>
        <p><strong>9-15</strong>: Befallen - This zone is very easy, undead die 
          so fast and there is a 12% exp bonus in this zone which is amazing, 
          the trick to my guide here is to keep you in exp bonus zones as much 
          as I can. Also note this is the level you get your spells (and pet which 
          is also a spell now took me a while to find this out hehe) Must buy 
          spells: Flash of Light, Spirit of Sharik, Sharik's Replenishing and 
          Minor Healing. With PoP just jump to your starting city or the cat city 
          to train or get spells) Notes: Train in Dodge at 10 and meditate at 
          12, also make a trip to the bazaar and look up h2h weapons and armor 
          using search race / bst. these days good stuff sells cheap and you will 
          be amazed what you can find for 5 to 10pp which you will have about 
          100pp from 9to 15 in befallen.</p>
        <p><strong>15-19</strong>: Oasis of Marr I know what your thinking &quot;why?&quot;... 
          what im telling you is these days its hard to find people in this zone 
          its almost always clear. Crocs dont agro on each other and its easy 
          to kill the no casting crocs. IMO this zone was made to level fast! 
          15 is the next spell level and here are my recommended buys: Spirit 
          of Kahliz, Sicken, Keshuval's Rejuvination, Spirit of Lightning. Note: 
          at level 17 train in Dual Wield and get a second weapon. Note money 
          making at these levels will suck, because the croc and orcs do not drop 
          anything really good to sell, after 15-19 I only made 4pp.</p>
        <p><strong>19-30</strong> Marus Seru - This zone is like the oasis of 
          marr, great xp but very poor loot, even the named critters that drop 
          any loot, drop mediocre loot. For a few levels (until 22 and new spells) 
          just focus on killing &quot;A Greyhopper&quot; they are level 22 - 26 
          and only kit for about 20, you can be a cleric (letting pet run in and 
          you heal him) or help your pet (by attacking yourself and the pet help) 
          or even fight and drop (You and pet fight until your 50% then you drop 
          and let pet fight on his own) Level 22 spells recommended: Spirit of 
          Keshuval, Spirit of Blizzard, Drowsy and Light Healing. At 22 you should 
          move to a split of Greyhoppers and &quot;A Giant Lightcrawler&quot; 
          These will give you good exp and are easy to solo with the items and 
          spelld you have. Note: at level 25 train in Block. Stay in Marus Seru 
          until 30, IMO the exp is too slow at 30 because you need to start killing 
          stonegrabbers at 30 but you can stay here until 30/35 and still see 
          exp move fast. If at anytime you are finding it hard get a group they 
          are easy to find here.</p>
        <p><strong>30-45</strong> Mines of Nurga - This is a 14% exp bonus zone 
          and the exp to kill at level 30 is 6% of level per kill and on some 
          reds 8%. At level 30 you will start off weak but you just need to plan 
          your attacks right DO NOT attack the following mobs at 30 to 35: A Goblin 
          Stalagknight, and A Goblin Boneseer The Stalagknight is a SK and will 
          HT for 310 to 150 everytime and the Boneseer is a general pain has a 
          lot of spells and will use them. Get up the waterfall at the entrence 
          and stick with the 2 pull down the hall and the singles in the first 
          room you get too at 30 you can solo pull 3 and 2 pull the top and these 
          are always &quot;A Goblin Slavedriver&quot; who do not cast spells. 
          This is a 6 to 7 spawn area and beween rests will repop so if you do 
          this area it will get you to lv 34 in 5 hours and 30mins. Note that 
          the lv 30 spells you should get are: Herikol's Soothing, Spirit of Wolf, 
          Spirit of Inferno, Spirit of Herikol and shrink if your a troll / orge. 
        </p>
        <p>The money in Mines of Nurga is AMAZING.. about 2plat a kill and a FS 
          weapon on 1 in 5 mobs the also drop skins (keep) and Mt dust (also keep) 
          at 35 I made a run back to PoP and sold the items for 490pp and make 
          a trader which I left on over night and sold the skins for 10pp each 
          and Mt dust for 20pp (the dust is used to make mindmelt and faction 
          for chardok faction, and the green skins for chardok faction) so in 
          5 levels I made 1210pp. Go back to Nurga after you get Ice Spear spell 
          from PoP is a good DD.</p>
        <p><strong>35-39</strong> you can start taking on some of the casters 
          and have less downtime but I would stay near the top zone area and not 
          move too deep (you can inv this whole zone if you die) after you get 
          39 get your spells this level of spells is amazing and make sure to 
          get them all.. The dmg output of your new pet is amazing.. and you will 
          have a good amount of money now. I bought alot of nathar armor and picked 
          up sever procing weapons at the bazaar. 39 to 45 is 100% killing your 
          downtime will be almost none and by 45 you will be killing almost the 
          whole zone before they repop getting about a level every 2 hours up 
          to 45. Note at 45 train in Riposte.</p>
        <p><strong>45-49</strong> Lord Nagafen's Lair (lavastorm port) At this 
          point I had almost full armor and 2 6ac 65hp rings and 2 weapons that 
          proced in total after spells in nurga I made 4508pp. Lord Nagafen's 
          Lair is a 12% exp bonus zone and you can solo here no problem with your 
          current pet the exp is comming slower now and it will take you 3-4 hours 
          to level solo. You goal here is to kill &quot;Greater Kobolds&quot; 
          and &quot;Greater Kobold Shaman&quot; These die so fast you will be 
          thinking you are the man =). Now Lava Duct Crawlers for me where hard 
          to solo, they had alot of hitpoints and when I was sitting fighting 
          on I would get several adds.. I started a group here myself at 46 and 
          it took me 6 hours to get a level (which sucked) at 47 I started to 
          kill sonic bats and spiders with little to no problems solo and was 
          getting amazing exp on kibikds still even though they are light blue. 
          at level 44 get the spell Spiritual Light (its 3mana 3hp regen)</p>
        <p><strong>49-50</strong> Plane of Disease You will have your new pet 
          and OMG is it amazing.. you will be the power master.. but you still 
          want to level fast.. and solo as a BL you can.. so so easy. NOTE: 49 
          spells to get (ALL) PoD is where I soloed to get lv 50 from 49 in 2hours 
          10mins here is how I did it... I pulled a A Tachnian Fly to the wall 
          attacked it my self until I was 50% backed up healed myself to 100% 
          jumped back in.. to 50% jumped out sat down pet kills by the time the 
          pet kills you will be Full mana and the pet at 40% heal him with one 
          cast of Vigor of Zehkes. Med for 40seconds and pull another A Tachnian 
          Fly. My exp as a troll was 5% per kill</p>
