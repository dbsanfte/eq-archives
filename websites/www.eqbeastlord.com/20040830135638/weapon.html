        <h3>Which Weapon do I use (by Buku Da Hoesmakker)</h3>
        Here is a little formula I got from a guildmate(Leolan, BTW he is a Bard 
        if you couldn't tell) that should help you determine which hand a weapon 
        works best in. <br>
        <p>Use this formula to figure out which to use in mainhand:</p>
        <p>[(Base Damage of Weapon * 2) + Damage Bonus ] / (Weapon Delay / 10)</p>
        <p>Higher number yields better result.</p>
        <p>Also have to take into account extraneous things like procs, stats, 
          and erm, looks.</p>
        <p>Take these two weapons for instance:</p>
        <p>Blazing Rapier: 17/20<br>
          Nature's Melody: 15/19</p>
        <p>Most people automatically assume that lower delay weapon automatically 
          goes in main hand. That's not always the case.</p>
        <p>(17*2) + 11 = 45 / 2 = 22.5<br>
          (15*2) + 11 = 41 / 1.9 = 21.578</p>
        <p>Offhand weapon, assuming you want optimum damage and not some particular 
          utility, should be whatever has the next best dmg/dly ratio. Remember, 
          no damage bonus to offhand. You also need to consider weapon skill -- 
          if you have lower skill in one weapon type (e.g. piercing), you might 
          not want to sacrifice the ATK you could be getting from a different 
          weapon. </p>
