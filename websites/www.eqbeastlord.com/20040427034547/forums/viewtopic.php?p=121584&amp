				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"You will be the death of me!" A Dragon Strike knocked me of balance and into the waterway that ran through Cabalis like veins supplying the life to the body which was Cabilis, home of the Iksar. Sensei Zakax Scalestrike, the last surviving diciple of Grand Master Glox, tried to control his emotions but the anger could still be seen in those fiery red eyes. "Again I see you playing with these...these vermin that roam our city instead of training!" These 'vermin' he spoke of were none other than the young scaled wolves that now inhabit Cabilis. "You're way behind the other students in your training and to think I am your father! You are of my bloodline and you disgrace me infront of my own Master!" "Your brothers & sisters had their fate decided even before they were hatched as was yours! They are doing so much better in their chosen path than you have!" "But it was not clear of his path Zakax. The elders could not discern his fate, not as clearly as the others." That was Elder Khasix Spiritscale, wife to Zakax. A modest shaman by Iksar standards. "They did sense some of the spirit magic in him." "Look at him Khasix! Do you think he'll be a capable Mystic? He can barely pay attention let alone concentrate on spells!" With that he stormed off into Court of Pain to speak with Grand Master Glox, possibly asking for forgiveness for his son's lack of abilities." Come out of the water child. Your father has gone. Come." Her voice somehow had an almost enchanting way of making one obey and that I did. "Run along to the Temple of Terror. Find Prime Hierophant Vek. Maybe you share more of my bloodline than your father would like to think." She smiled, revealing her numerous incisors, a smile that only her child would take comfort with whereas another being would run away terrified. On the way there, I found another young scaled wolf hiding behind some rubble. It obviously heard my approach and scurried to the safety of the shadows. Do not be mistaken. These wolves are still very young and feed on whatever scraps they can find here but as they mature they become full fledged hunters, pretty much like the Iksars. Our scales toughen with age giving us a natural protection, our reflexes are honed to perfection and thus transforming us into the warlike race that our Lord Cazic-Thule deemed us to be. "So you were sent here by your mother? Khasix is one of Cazics finest and now her son approaches. You do posses some knowledge of our craft but not as much as I would expect of someone your age. None the less, I shall train you as requested by Khasix, much to the displeasure of your father I assure you." "My parents know their paths and have walked them well. I now seek my path." Prime Hierophant Vek smiled to himself. "Very well. Before we begin, I suggest you throw that filthy beast out of the temple or I shall administer a very slow and painful death for its insignificant life!" I turned to see the young scaled wolf that was hiding in the rubble looking at me with fear in its eyes. "Where is that rotten little beast? I'll skin this one slowly for making me run all over Cabilis!" hissed Exterminator Sahizz... (To be continued)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />

You had better be telling me the truth or I could find other uses for that tongue of yours.." hissed Exterminator Sahizz and promptly scurried off in search of the 'vermin'. "Hurry now! Go its safe." Why was I talking to this creature was beyond my understanding but having said that, the wolf seemed to have understood me and ran off in the opposite direction. " Now that you have finally gotten rid of that pest, we can proceed." With that Prime Hierophant Vek proceeded to teach me about the ways of a Mystic, the meditation, the spells, the words. Yet my mind once again drifted of to that wolf. "Did she make it? Was she safe?" was about all I could think about while Prime Hierophant Vek continued to talk. A hard slap on the head brought me back to my senses. "Pay attention! If it wasn't for your mother, who has served Cabilis well in the past, I would have given you a fate worse than that I thought of doing to that wolf a while ago! At your age the others are already learning the next rank of spells and yet you're still struggling with your first!" Yes I did have some knowledege of them but I never did have the attention span of the other students. My mind wandered off again, thinking about the Field of Bone where I've seen more of these wolves but the more mature ones. The full grown ones like the predators and hunters. I've also heard of an Elder Scaled Wolf. Rarely seen but its presence was always felt. Very few of the wolves live long enough to become elders due to the other Iksars hunting them down to make some armor. " Leave now! Your obviously ignore my teachings and thus mock me! Leave before I decide to use you as a test subject for my alchemy!" As I ran out of the Temple of Terror towards the Field of Bone I could have sworn I heard a chuckle comming from somewhere upstairs...

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"He's good that young one!" "Yes indeed. Grand Master Glox must be proud of him. One of the finest I've seen in along while." These were the whisperings of the guards as I entered the Field of Bone. Curious as to whom they were talking about, I enquired. "None of your buisness! Now run along before I haul your scaly hide in for posing as a spy!" These guards never had anything nice to say to others. I've always wondered who chose them. Along the path towards the Field of Bone I saw a small gathering of students & the answer to my enquiry. Sharax Shadowclaw. He's the best student the Court of Pain has and unfortunately has the same bad attitude of those guards. "Ahh! The son of the Great Zakax Scalestrike! Come to challenge me to a duel?" Always striving to prove that he is better than everybody else, he has beaten everyone our age group and a few older ones. "No. I've just come to see what's going on and now that I know I shall be on my way." I replied and turned to walk back to Cabilis although I wanted to head out further to hopefully get a chance to see some of the scaled wolves." "A coward is the son of Zakax! Maybe he isn't his son. Khasix may have been busy while Zakax was away eh?" The other students all begun to laugh. I was young and brash & fell for that statement to which I turned & charged towards Sharax. He was extremely fast for someone so young. I tried in vain to hit but he dodged my repeated attempts to pummel him. He didn't hit back but found it amusing to see me trying to hit him. Finally I did to which he crashed onto the ground. Satisfied I turned to walk away. Before I could take my first step I was swept off my feet with his tail and I fell heavily onto the ground knocking the air out of myself. The next thing I heard was another roar of laughter from the group of students. "You're a disgrace to not only your family but to Cabilis as well!" As the group walked away, I couldn't help but to find some truth in what Sharax said. As I sat there looking out into the Field of Bone, I could see the scaled wolves wandering around. How I wish I was one of them. Picking myself up and dusting off the dirt, I heard a heavy sigh, comming from behind one of the walls of the nearby ruins. I decided to investigate. As I turned the corner of one of the walls of the ruins, I froze. Standing before me was an Elder Scaled Wolf! As the wolf moved closer, memories of tales told by the elders of how these wolves could tear apart even a hardened Iksar to shreads, flashed across my mind. Huge incisor teeth that were designed not for chewing but for tearing and ripping apart came into view. Its sleek wiry frame moved with remarkable silence as it homed in on me. Just as I started to ramble a prayer to Cazic, a scaled hand grabbed my shoulder...

I turned to face my saviour and was shocked to see Prime Patriach Vuzx! Rumours spread throughout Cabilis since his return from the moon that he has lost his mind. Walking and communicating with beasts deemed as nothing more than game to the Iksars. "I've been observing you since the day you were hatched. The one whose fate was not told." He smiled to himself, pleased at having made that statement. I turned back to see that the Elder Scaled wolf was no longer to be seen. "Whe..How..." I was both surprised & relieved that she was no longer there. "All will be answered in due time. First, tell me how did it feel beaing beaten by Sharax in front of everyone?" How did it feel? He really must have lost his mind! Chuckling he said " Let me tell you now, you will never be able to beat him in a duel alone. You will never beat any of the students from the Court of Pain alone."" You laugh at my misfortunes? You mock me?!" I began to feel the anger in me rise again. "Oh! Not only that. You will never master the mystic arts either. Never as good as those taught by Prime Hierophant Vek. I heard your lessons with him." He bust out laughing again! It was him who I heard chuckling as I left the Temple of Terror! Furious at this ridicule, I ran, ran out to the Field of Bone. The one place I could find solitude. "When you can accept what I've told you, find me again and I'll tell you the path you were meant to follow!" I sat out in a clearing watching the wolves. Am I really a failure? Am I really a disgrace? Those thoughts seemed to have found a home in my heart. "I'll train hard! I show you! I'll show everyone!" I shouted. Filled with determination to prove myself I set out to find something to vent my anger on. Something to kill! Blinded by rage I charged straight towards a Greater Scalebone! I may not have Sharax's skills but I'm sure I can dispatch this abomination with ease! Applying what I learnt while in the Court of Pain I attacked with a Beastial Frenzy I never knew I had. To my surprise this adversary seemed a little bit tougher than I expected! Soon I realised this was not a wise idea. I was getting beaten on. I tried to run by was knocked down from the back. As I turned onto my back the skeleton was raising his Shan'Tok to finish me off. Just then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this tiny little scaled wolf charging towards the Greater Scalebone...

The tiny little wolf was no match for it yet it was biting away at the creature relentlessly. With its back turned to me I executed a flurry of attacks on it and before it could retaliate it fell to the ground in a heap of bones. I looked at the wolf and realised it was the one that I saved from Exterminator Sahizz. "Well my little friend. Looks like you've returned the favour of saving my life." The wolf looked up and wagged its tiny tail so hard it seemed like it would fall off. Laughing, I picked it up and proceeded to walk back to Cabilis, happy that I've made a new friend. Passing the ruins I saw Prime Patriach Vuzx again. "I see you've made a friend. Not surprising since this is the path you were meant to take." I was confused. What was my path? I didn't learn anything. Seeing the puzzled look on my face he asked, "Don't you remember what I told you? I said you will never defeat Sharax alone. You will never defeat anyone or anything alone. You will never walk alone." Pointing to the wolf I had in my arms "Now do you understand?" I looked at the tiny little scaled wolf who was snuggling up to my chest. "This little wolf is going to help me defeat my adversaries?" It was my turn to laugh! "You really have lost your mind haven't you?" Strangely, Prime Patriach Vuzx smiled and replied " You remind me so much of myself. Alone, unsure and afraid of what lies ahead. I was once in your place until I learned to accept my destiny. The path that was chosen for me is the same that you will walk." What was he talking about? What was my chosen path? " You're a beastlord. It was your calling all along yet you chose not to see it. You thought that being an offsping of Zakax and Khasix you were meant to follow in either one of their footsteps." How did he know that? Yes all this while I thought I was to be a shaman or a monk, never a beastlord? "I can teach you, nuture you and help you walk your path if you accept it. "Go home now & tomorow come see me in the Temple of Terror. We will begin your training." I walked back towards Cabilis again but this time my mind was over whelmed with thoughts of what has just transpired. A Beastlord? Is that what I am? A tiny little snore broke my train of thoughts. I looked to the bundle that I had in my arms to see, the wolf, my new friend, sound asleep...

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"So you've come back to beg eh? No! No amount of pleading will ever make me take you back. I simply refuse to teach you!" "Forgive me Prime Hierophant Vek but I'm here to see Prime Patriach Vuzx" I said smugly and made my way to the second level of the Temple of Terror while the students were snickering at him. "Greetings. I'm glad you've come." He didn't turn to face me but seemed busy with something. "This is for you. Learn to use it well. It has served me well when I first started out and now its yours to use." He handed me a claw." I now wield these" and showed me a pair of claws the likes of which I've never seen in all my years here in Cabilis. It had a blue aura that danced about the blades of this weapon seemingly bringing it to life in the hands of its wielder. Seeing my eyes light up with awe he smiled and pushed me out. "Go and learn these spells and how to use that which I gave you." Like a child with a new toy I ran excitedly past the Prime Hierophant's class and out of the Temple of Terror towards the Field of Bone with my warder in tow. Eager to test my new weapon but mindful of my rash judgement of my previous battle with an undead I started on some scorpions. Progressing onto more challenging advesaries I realised that as much as I was discovering my fighting capabilities so was my warder discovering hers. Soon the two of us were dispatching foes that I previously could not handle alone. With each vanquished monstrosity she seemed to be getting more and more ferocious in her attacks. The spells that were entrusted to me to learn by Prime Patriarch Vuzx not only were beneficial for myself but also aided my warder in some way. After what seemed like hours, I decided to rest for a while. My warder was right beside me obviously pleased that we have done something together. Smiling, if you can call her wide maw filled with dagger-like teeth a smile, she was bouncing around obviously urging me to carry on. That's when she stopped and stared in the direction of Cabilis. Thinking that it could possibly be a Scalebone or a Heartsting Scorpion I leaped to my feet. I saw nothing of the sort but instead a group of Iksars approaching our direction. To my dismay it was Sharax and his band of followers. "So this is what you've been reduced to? Making friends with vermin?" My warder seemed unimpressed with what Sharax had to say and began snarling at him. " Oh! What's this? A challenge?" "No it's not" I said and called my warder to my side. "Too late!For your lack of respect, you're going to watch this filthy beast die!" Before I could react I found myself firmly rooted in place! Looking at my obvious frustration Sharax grinned, "Don't worry Vashis over there will make sure you'll be only watching." Vashis was Prime Hierophant Veks favourite student. As I struggled to free myself, Sharax began beating on my warder. Despite my repeated attempts to call her to my side she fought on bravely. She was no match for Sharax, yet she battled on. Biting & clawing away as best she could Sharax just toyed with her just as he did with me in the past. Finally he grew bored of this and unleashed a flurry of blows on her. I watched painfully as she took hit after hit. Finally she collasped. "Let this be a lesson to you! You will never beat me nor will anyone else ever!" They walked back towards Cabilis laughing all the way obviously proud that their vile deed has been done. Breaking free of the spell that held me I ran to her. She looked up at me and tried wagging her tail. I tried using what spells I've learnt to help but to no avail. Her tiny little body was obviously suffering from all the broken bones and internal injuries she sustained. With one last smile and one valiant effort to wag her tail, she lay there....dead.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"Sharax! You will learn to fear my wrath!" I swore. I scooped up the only friend I ever had, held her close to me as I walked. Anger & sadness both welled up in a storm of vengence within my already cold heart. Ignoring the snide remarks of the guards as I walked past I had only one thing on my mind. I will have my revenge. I walked all through the streets of Cabilis with my warder in my arms. Puzzled stares from the elders, curious peeking from the younger ones & knowing glances from those from the Temple of Terror and Court of Pain. I went to Western Cabilis past the Tower of Death where the Necromancers where casting interested looks at my 'cargo'. There in the Arena I buried her, the sacred ground for all those who died in battle. Only appropriate that she should take her place amongst other fighters like herself. As I walked away from her grave, sadness slowly faded as well. In that void, rage began to swell. I knew I could not best Sharax, not like this. I needed an advantage, something to tip the odds in my favour. In the back of my mind I could see a blue light. A pulsating blue, almost alive, aura. Prime Patriach Vuzx's claws. Yes, those will be my emmisaries of revenge. I made my way to the Temple of Terror. I glared at a few of the students who were chuckling at the sight of me. One in particular Vashis just grinned. I smiled back and headed up stairs. He wasn't in which made it so much easier to 'borrow' his weapons. There it was! Despite being bound in leather in a bagpack nothing could conceal the blue aura. It was calling out to me, begging me to wield them. As I slipped my own scaled claws into them I felt a rush of energy. I felt as light as a feather yet strong as a beast! The claws seemed to amplify my desires, my yearning for revenge that it blinded my senses. I was bent only on killing anything or anyone who stood in my way. Just then their owner returned. Blinded by this new influx of power I charged straight at him! I was greeted with a swift kick in the sternum which knocked me back over a table. Even more furious now I stood up only to be confronted with that Elder Scaled Wolf! "Remove those claws now or you will never leave this room alive.""They killed her! For no reason other that for what she was! I will avenge her. I will teach Sharax a lesson which will cost him his life!" I was begining to sink more and more into an almost primal state of mind. "Take them out now! I will not repeat myself!" To which the wolf snarled to to make it perfectly clear what would happen if I did not heed his command. Reluctantly I removed them and placed them on the ground in front of the scaled wolf. When I stood up again she was gone! "I did not expect this to happen so soon. I was hoping to tell you about it some years down the road when you would be ready", all this said while picking up those claws. "Did you think she was going to live forever? Aye they live long lives when taken care of but not nearly as long as us. What would you have done then? Hunted down every last species of the creature that killed her? What if she died of other unnatural causes? Diseases? Age?" I stared right past him looking at nothing in particular pondering those questions. "You might think this strange of me to say this but its good that she died when she did. Now you can begin your training early instead of later like myself. How is it possible for my warder to appear and disappear seemingly at will? Because that is the truth. Our warders are now spirits that we call forth to aid us in battle. She may be a spirit but she feels and fights as if shes alive. You are a beastlord and in you is the power to call forth your companion." I sat down trying to absorb all this. Call forth my warder? But how? "Remember this. From this day forth, You'll Never Walk Alone." he said as footsteps could be heard comming our way. It was Prime Hierophant  Vek and with him, my father...

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"Greetings Zakax and Vek. What brings you to my humble study?" inquired Prime Patriach Vuzx. Staring straight at me cowering behind him, my father answered "Greetings Vuzx. I was told by Vek that my son has been seeing you.""Yes Zakax your son has not attended one of my lessons and he...""Silence Vek. I was asking Vuzx.""Indeed you son has been training under me and I must say he posses remarkable skills for one so young. I can see he posseses inherited talents from his father." To this my fathers eyes widen in surprise. "What? This lousy excuse of a son can actually fight?" "Aye! Not only that he posses undoubtedly some of his mother's heritage as well. I will not lie to you Zakax now would I? He's showing remarkable progress. You should be proud!""But he.." Prime Hierophant Vek's sentence fell flat after seeing the piercing gaze that my father had. Turning that very same gaze back at me he said in a voice as cold as the blood that runs through the veins of Iksars,"You can thank Vuzx for saving you today." He stormed off with Prime Hierophant Vek trailing in his wake. Heaving a huge sigh of relief I sat back down. "Thank you for..." Prime Patriach waved his hand to cut me off. "You can thank me when you prove, not to your father, but to yourself what you truly are. Now while your emotions are still strong I want you to focus. Call out to her. Will her to your side." I cleared my mind and focused on my warder. Memories came flooding back. How we met. How I save her life. Then how she repayed the favour. Our battles. Her death. Sharax. The other students. Prime Patriach's Claws.I looked down at my side and saw nothing. "Focus! Concentrate on your companion and nothing else! Your mind is still clouded with your rage! Focus with your heart not your head!" I've never seen Prime Patriach Vuzx so stern other than earlier when he confronted me with his claws. "Your warder exists within you. She is of your likeness. Bring her out!" I tried once again. This time I even said the words taught to me by him. I yearned to see her again. To feel her scales to see her smile. I missed the wagging of her tail. I felt a presence taking form next to me. From out of nothing, swirling purple smoke began forming into a familiar shape. When it cleared there she was! I knelt down beside and hugged her! Something was wrong. She just stood there. Unwavering. Staring straight ahead. No wide smiles. No excited bouncing. No wagging. I turned to look at Prime Patriach Vuzx once agian for answers. Seeing the puzzled look in my face, " Aye that is your warder. You did well. Do not expect her to behave the way she did when she was alive. Aye she may feel & look alive but do not be mistaken. That is her spirit, bound to serve you both in life & after. She will not feed or thirst. Nor will she seek you attention to entertain her. She will however obey your every command. She will 'die' a hundred times and rise a hundred times again at your will until the day the two of you are reunited again in spirit." I turned to look at my warder who was still staring straight ahead. Lifeless yet so alive. Single minded but emotionless. I went up to her again and whipered the words for her to leave and she vanished almost as suddenly as she appeared. "Go now and learn once again to do what you did before she met her demise. Learn how to do battle again together with her." I stood up and began to leave. "Remember, you must learn to harness the spirit that resides within you now. She is a part of you just as you are of her. Neither can do without the other." With those words echoing in my mind I left the Temple of Terror but I went to Western Cabilis, to the Arena, to visit her. As I sat down beside her tiny grave, I thought of what I've become. What I'm capable of. With a renewed purpose in my heart and a gleam in my eye, I vowed that I will not let her death be in vain. I will prove that I'm not a failure, not a mockery and not a disgrace to my family! "Well looks like our dear friend has lost his pet. How sad. Unfortunately you're here in the Arena and this is my world. Prepare for another beating!" With a grin I turned to face Sharax...

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"Another beating eh Sharax?" I laughed! It took him by surprise. " No, Sharax. You will learn to respect others. Regardless of their differences, you will learn to respect them." I lowered my head and chuckled. I was losing my sanity. My desire to defeat him and possibly end his life brought me to that familiar primal state of mind. Before he could recover from my sudden display of courage I blinded him with a spell. Focusing my mind, or what was left of it, I called out to my companion, my warder, my friend. Once again she heeded my call and appeared at my side. Shaking off the effects of my spell, Sharax was stunned to see my warder again! "You?! But how?! I killed that beast! You're not from the Tower of Death!" He was speaking of the nearby Tower where the Neromancers practice their dark magic in solitude, away from the rest of the Cabilis society. "No Sharax. I'm not what you think. I am a beastlord!" With that I charged at him with my warder. Sharax was confused. He didn't know how to defend himself being attacked by 2 opponents. Everytime he turned to face me my warder would attack him leaving deep cuts on his legs from her bites. When he tried to defend himself from her I would lash out at him with my claws and kicks. He tried pretending again that he fell but my warder seemed to sense his trickery and continued attacking. "Please! No more! Stop!" he begged as my warder continued to attack him. Turning my gaze to the others who were with him they backed away slowly trying to avoid my gaze. I roared a blood curling battlecry and leaped above Sharax with my weapons facing him, ready to impale him to the ground he lay on. The claws that Prime Patriach Vuzx gave me, although aged, still had its razors edge and I plunged it deep into Sharax's chest. He screamed in agony as I stared into his eyes. The grin returning to my face. Suddenly I was knocked off, not by him but by a bolt of frost. I got up to see Prime Patriach Vuzx standing with the other students." Call off your warder now!" I saw my warder charging straight for him! I called her to my side and she obeyed. I whispered for her to leave and faced Prime Patriach Vuzx, who was now joined by Prime Hierophant Vek and some more of my people who obviously heard the commotion. "I told you he was mad! Even worse he's been seeing Prime Patriach Vuzx. Look what he has become! He's a threat to us!" wailed Prime Hierophant Vek as he used his magic to heal Sharax. Prime Patriach Vuzx shot back, "What are you implying Vek? That I trained this one to kill? To destroy others? To survive? Yes! That is exactly what I did! This is the Arena afterall and everyone knows and that includes you Vek, that this is a battleground for opponents!" A familiar voice replied, "Aye it is Vuzx and he did well. Although I am disappointed that his path differs from the one I had hoped it would be. You have defeated the best the Court of Pain had to offer! Well done, son." My father was standing there staring at me as he said that but do not be mistaken. He would never reveal his emotions in public nor in private. A simple smile escaped him and that was all it took to know that I've made him proud! "What if he does this again? Who knows what could happen! He could kill someone! You saw it! You all saw his uncontrolable rage!" babbled Prime Hierophant Vek. Many around him were beginning to nod their heads in agreement. I could see the fear in their eyes for they cannot fathom what I am. Like a frightened herd of cattle they backed away & eyed me carefully as I made my way towards them. At this moment they parted and made way for someone who was comming from behind the crowd. It wasn't what I expected. Satar the Unrivaled floated towards me. I was terrified! Already I was wondering how I'm going to defend myself againt him. Though I saw his lips him his voice found its way in my head. "You have done well young one. Cazic has taken notice of your potential and has entrusted me to inform you that in order to one day transcend to the realm where I am from, you will have to leave Cabalis. You will have to see the rest of the world, experience different things & meet other beings & of course spread Fear to every corner of Norrath. Through Fear your enemies will cower before you just as this weakling did." Slowly his spirit faded out of existence. I looked at my father then at Prime Patriach Vuzx. Both gave me knowing looks in return. Somehow they knew I had to leave...(To Be Continued)  <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" /><br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=980784" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2004-4/702191/Testing.JPG" border="0" /></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"Well that is how I became what I am today. I've seen alot places, met alot of people, even seen some of the Gods in their planes. My journey is far from over. There are still many things that I'll need to do. Places to go and people to meet and adversaries to defeat. But of course every year I do go back to Cabilis. Not to visit my family nor my friends. Not even Prime Patriach Vuzx. But to visit the grave of my warder." I gently stroked my warder as she stood beside me. Now fully matured as an Elder Scaled Wolf she was an impressive sight indeed. "Remember, you & your warder are one. Neither can do without the other. You'll never walk alone." I smiled and looked at them. Young and full of life. Their journey lay ahead of them. "Dat gud story! Wun day me be big strong beastlord too! Big & strong like da bear!" "Bah! Yoos bear no match for me nasty lizard! He swim and bite yur bear hairy butt!" "Look at those 2 idiots! With them squabbling like that any tiger could sneak up and rip'em to shreads." "Aye! I'm sure my wolf could sniff'em out from miles away even if he's had to much of me ol' ale to drink too." Laughing to myself I can't help but think how lucky these young ones are to be able to come here together in this place to learn and grow. To be able to learn from one another, to share their cultures and tolerate'em. Yes the Plane of Knowledge is a great place to learn and interact with many others. "Entertaining my trainees again I see?" Savage Lord Etherat was one of 3 Beastlord guildmasters in the Plane of Knowledge charged with training these new beastlords. "Well I wasn't doing anything & they seemed very interested." We had a hearty laugh as we both knew how we were just like them during our younger days. "Well come now young ones I have a new friend to introduce to all of you. She comes from Cabilis & she's here to join us. Say farewell now." All of them turned and together through the rough voice of a Barbarian, the purring of a Vah Shir, the burping of an Ogre & the snorting of a Troll said "Farewell Elder Rakarsis!"

Well that's the end of it.
