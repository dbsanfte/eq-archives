                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">I think this was a pretty fun week.  We wandered back into Sebilis again (had been awhile for me) and had a pretty cool time killing in 4R with our rogue friend Lwenha and a really cool enchanter named Aabyien.  We tried to take out the emperor room once too and got killed like a little girl, but after Ledeny came and rescued our asses again, we continued to play in 4R and have a good time until we could no longer stay awake.  It was great fun, and I look forward to going there again sometime soon.</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">We also got to play in Kael with Ledeny for a while to help him with his faction and try to get some loot.  Did not get much exp or loot as it turned out, but it was nice to play with Ledeny a bit, and we did get good and tanked from a GM who was handing out some beer and cake to our responsible drinkers, and the children got some milk and sandwiches =)</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">We played a little more with the folks from GoA this week too.  I played with Calura and some of her friends in PoI for a while, and our golden dwarf friend dinged 55 while we were there (yay!).  Doczillums has also been playing regularly with a few GoA folks in LOIO, and having a lot of fun.  Hopefully we can all play with them more and build up a good active alliance with them.</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">Acre has also created a pretty cool Gallery tool for the website - Be sure to check it out.  It has several categories where you can view thumbnails and titles/descriptions of screen shots we've taken, and then click on the thumbnails to view the pictures.  All guild members have access to create new categories and upload new pictures.  It is really coming along nicely - thanks Acre!</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">Well aside from the usual leveling and such this weekend, some of us had an interesting time in The Deep.  Acre, Aeina, Balfamor, Detour, Flatin, and Wizenbeak ventured into The Deep in search of Wizenbeak's level 51 Levitate spell.  We had some assistance getting to the camp from two level 65 monks from Eternal Flames, but once we got there and they left, we were pretty much instantly wiped as the mobs started spawning.  So we learned why the spell costs about 9K to buy...  Afterwards, we had to call upon Concha and our old friend Lwenha (actually his Necro alt Caligo) to help get our corpses.  We finally got them all back, had an overall good time, and managed to get Caligo to join our guild - YAY!</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">After talking with several of you, and deciding that I do not really want to have a lot of content to maintain, I've decided to have the Roster page as it currently is.  It simply lists the character name, level, class, and guild rank.  The character name is also a link to your character's online web profile (Magelo, etc.) if I have one for you.  Each time I play, I will export the guild maintenance window data, and I have a program that will update the roster page.</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">Hi all, it looks like the daeamarth.com domain has been activated and is pointing to my web server machine correctly now.  The site is still very much under construction and I'm mostly working on layout type stuff more than content right now.</font><br>
                      <br>                      
                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">If you have some suggestions as far as what kind of areas and content we should put up, send me an email (kreator1@airmail.net) and I'll see what I can do.  I'm especially looking for suggestions on what kind of information to put on the 'Roster' page - maybe some EQ information as well as some RL information if people want...  I can probably pull down an export of the guild maintenance window every once in a while to get main information about the characters like name, level, class, etc., but I thought it might be kinda cool to have a few sentences about the character, and maybe some other stats such as race, diety, etc. that are not currently on the guild maintenance window.  I also thought it might be kinda neat to have a little RL information about the player too - maybe as minimal as what state or time zone you live in, but maybe even more depending on what you want to share.  I know Zill and I are always a little curious about the people we spend so much time with hehe.<font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">Also, the 'Bank' link does go to the magelo profile for Tufftodd (our guild banker), so you can see what all is in the bank, etc.  Magelo is a really cool tool, and I suggest it to anyone who wants to have an online profile for their characters without having to do anything really.<font><br>
