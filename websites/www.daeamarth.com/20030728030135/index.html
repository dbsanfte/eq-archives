                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">This weekend was a blast and Daeamarth hosted its first public raid of sorts at 4r/emp in Sebilis. First, I would like to say a big THANK YOU to Ainjel from Guild of Avalon and to all the Lucid Visions folks who attended and made this trip all the more enjoyable. We had a great time and walked away with some decent loot and a sense of accomplishment. Second I would like to say w00t to Lwenha for the excellant raid leadership. Awsome job! Unfortunately our goal was not achieved and we never did get the emperor to spawn and along with it no chance of looting the spells Finse needs. Hopefully we will have better luck next time.</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">On the other side of things, we have three new members. Forgedblade has joined our ranks and he is quite the warrior. This little dwarf swings to fast I think he could just quite possibly take flight at times. Naerril, a druid friend of Quelhkan also has joined us. And last but not least Terigan has joined us as well. This is her first game in many years but she is enjoying it a lot and cant wait to join our upper ranks.</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">The leadership of Daeamarth has also begun to take steps to making the structure and goals of Daeamarth much stronger through meetings and debate. Keep an eye out for posts on this matter. I encourage all members to give their input.</font><br>

Acre is 56, Balfamor is 57, Detour is 53, Doczillums is 33, Finse is 63, Flatin is 53, Rubee is 45 and happy to have KEI again :), Quelkhan started a new rogue named Spinetear he is leveling like crazy.  Sorry if i missed anyone...</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">Several of us ventured with our Guild of Avalon and Lucid Visions friends into the new Veksar zone under the lake in LOIO.  It was a pretty cool place with some neat new graphics and mobs (mostly undead) and some people picked up some cool new loot.  The experience was very good here too, but with the new group experience changes, we can get good experience in many fun places now where it used to suck.</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">We hooked up with a number of friends from Guild of Avalon and Lucid Visions today to strengthen Mithril Daggers raid upon the Overking Bathezid of Chardok. A good time was had by all and we got the piece for Berthils epic. Balfamor was designated the main tank again and did an awsome job of chopping and bashing mobs into the the ground. The only mishaps we had was the rogue getting through the doors decided it was time to leave and never came back. We still dont know what happened with that situation but Naffel came through with Marygold on another computer and got us on the move once again. The other eye popping incident was when an entire group (Aeina included) was accidentally ported out. =) Within seconds posts popped on the screen, "WTF?!", "What happened", "Holy ***!", and so forth. It all ended fine though with COTH on hand we were back in order within minutes. Balfamor, Wizenbeak and Aeina all had a good time (poor Acre was put in the useless pile again =P) had a great time and enjoyed very much accompanying MD, GoA and LV on this trip. Hopefully we can all do it again and group up more often.</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">A number of us got together in SkyFire once again to make an attempt at Torpor and Shards for Finse and Aeina. Even after dozens of kills no go. Better luck next time I suppose. Zillums was along with us and got some decent exp and we had good company so it made it worth while.</font><br>

We got farther into the event than usual, but unfortunately the war was lost.  We did have a great time however, and we also got Lwenha to join the guild.  Yay!  Welcome Lwenha, glad to finally have you with us.</font><br>

I'll probably miss a few, but Aeina and Balfamor hit 56 (so we have 96pct rezzes now, yay!), Wizenbeak hit 53, Qualkhan slid into 30, Doczillums is 28 now, and Concha is back on his necro and dinged 44 too.  Grats everyone!</font><br>

                      <font face="verdana" size="1" color="#000000">Several of us worked on our alliances a little bit more and had a good time with some Lucid Visions and Guild of Avalon members.  Some of our lower level alts played with some of the Lucid Visions gang a bit, and had a great time playing with and meeting some new folks.  We also did a couple of raids with the GoA folks too.  Sunday night, we helped Cyrax from GoA get his epic by killing Faydedar in TD - it started hectic with the dragon heading right for the casters at first, but worked ok and he got his item.  Monday night, we also helped Kirenai the leader of GoA kill Venril Sathir and he got his epic drop he needed as well.  It was all great fun! And Gratz to the GoA members on their epics.</font><br>
