What makes any of you think that gun control will keep guns out of the bad guy's hands? It won't. You are fooling yourself if you think that every gangster or armed robber took the time from his busy life of crime to get a permit or register the side arm they have chosen to help them achieve what they feel society has not provided for them.<br>

<br>
Rob, you have a right to buy and own a car as long as you don’t operate it on public property (such as a highway). If you owned 100 acres in New Mexico, and had a race trak built, you could drive it all day and not need a drivers license or insurance, etc. However, if you want to operate that same vehicle on “public” tax paid for property, then the government has the wiggle room to step in and require a drivers license (proof of competency, or a certification if you will), and all the other stuff they throw on. Same way with firearms, you can own (in those states that are still part of the US) as many, and whatever type you want, BUT if you want to carry one in public, you need a “certification”, or license. While I don’t agree with this in principle, I do understand the need for it in some cases.<br>
<br>
Being able to own a firearm was considered a “right” by those guys back in the 1700’s because as Mao said, “Political power flows from the barrel of a gun”. They wanted to construct a government where the political power came from the “people”. If the “people” could not be armed, or could be disarmed by that government, then they no longer had real power over the government. Firearms in the hands of the citizenry was considered a deterrent to the kinds of oppressive governments that they had first hand knowledge of (and still exist). They were also viewed in the light that everyone has a basic “God-given” right to be able to defend themselves, their family, and their country to the best means that they see fit. This was though of as “freedom” (gad, what a concept).<br>
<br>
Today, the same concepts as being able to defend oneself from other armed aggressors (foreign or domestic) is still valid.<br>
<br>
Owning a firearm is a big responsibility, and those who are irresponsible should have that right curtailed. Those who do practice responsibility and accountability should be left the hell alone.<br>
<br>
In case you haven’t figured it out, I am a gun owner <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Matter of fact, I have a sizeable collection I’ve built up over the past 20 years.<br>

Guns make it so people can kill on impulse very easily. Accidents happen with guns... often killing children.  <br>

<br>
I fully support the ability of every qualified American to own a gun. <br>
<br>
I'll give a sad true story from my area. Last week a policeman responded to a distrubance call about 5 miles from my office. He was jumped by a drugged out freak who wrestled the cop to the ground. The druggie took the cop's gun from him and shot him - unloaded the clip in the cop. Dead cop. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  His funeral is today.<br>
<br>
What does the story have to do with gun control? This happened on the side of a busy street. When the cop went down two bystanders pulled their own pistols on the cop-killer. Sadly neither fired. But ... they could have. Maybe if someone a touch more aggressive with their weapon had been there the policeman would be huggin his wife and daughters good-bye this morning rather than them getting ready for his funeral.<br>

As an Alaskan, the need to defend oneself has more than one aspect. Consider the notion that there are more threats to oneself than humans in the Last Frontier. Bears. Angry Mama Moose. Rabid Mosquitoes add to the Peril Factor.<br>
<br>
Sure, you can carry that 16 oz bottle of Pepper Spray with you into the Great Outdoors with a feeling of being protected or having a Way Out, but when The Bears use it as seasoning, you know you have a Serious Problem on your hands. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Note to the readership: Bears in Alaska LIKE pepper spray. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So, you either carry a gun, or carry pepper spray or nothing at all. You can try talking your way out of getting et to a bear, but bears don’t speak English. Or you can hose yourself down in that Pepper Spray to make the dining experience more pleasant for the bear. Or you can cycle the hammer back, knowing full well that the bear will have a Really Hard Time Eating You after you just put his anus into orbit around Mars.<br>
<br>
Take my guns away, and I can’t defend myself in the wilderness.<br>
<br>
I live in a really nice BIG house out in the middle of nowhere. It has a Great Big Loot Me Rob Me air about it. My neighbors can’t see me, and I can’t see them, so to a burglar, my house is open season.<br>
<br>
My house has been open season 2 times a year for the last 4 years. I would LOVE to be not allergic to dogs, since a good dog is far better than anything electronic you can put into your house. A good dog is miles better than the best gun. <br>
<br>
I won’t go into details or pith on any further. All I know is that the same laws that made drugs illegal will do no more to safeguard ME by making GUNS illegal. Heroine, cocaine, and crack are no less prevalent today than they were when they were outlawed, and yet, I am lead to believe that outlawing guns will make my community and MY life more secure by simple virtue that a law can and will rescue us all from the sins of mankind.<br>
<br>
By removing the ability of a populace to defend itself, you render that same populace unable to defend themselves in time of great need against a greater foe.<br>
<br>
Which is why we have the right to keep and bear arms.<br>

<br>
My story was meant to show that gun control will not stop gun deaths. There were 3 legal guns in my story and yet a cop died. More laws to restrict guns will not prevent gun deaths.<br>
<br>
Had the bystanders been better trained perhaps the cop would be alive. <br>
<br>
And for the record the cop did exactly what he should have done. Maced the guy twice before pulling his pistol according to witnesses. The guy simply overpowered him. <p><center>

I doubt very few criminals care about finding a personw ith a gun in a house...<br>
And to be honest... what the possibility of encountering a gun.. could just make criminals get bigger guns...&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, a few years ago, a letter was written to a politician by an inmate in some prison (sorry I don't remember the details anymore) saying basically &quot;The only thing keeping me out of your house is the fact that you MAY have a gun in your bedroom dresser drawer.&quot;   Criminals don't want to get killed any more than anyone else does.  If a criminal breaks into your house in the middle of the night, with or without a gun, if you can wake up, you have a lot of advantages.  You know the house, even in the dark.<br>
<br>
As to outlawing guns, or taking the guns away.. does anyone actually think those laws would apply to the criminals (the people who would use guns to hurt innocent people) in the first place?  &quot;If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!&quot; -- it's kind of a cliche, but it's absolutely true.<br>
<br>
As for maintaining an armed militia to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government... well, I guess that argument has its valid points.  Hitler and Stalin were both big on gun control, and you know what happened there.  I don't see America becoming similarly tyrannical, but I imagine the mid-30's Germans didn't think they'd be embroiled in a holocaust, either.  And once they surrendered their guns to their government, there wasn't a lot they could do to stop Hitler's madness.<br>
<br>
Abery: Just a question: You said that most people would be non-effective with a firearm for home defense.  Any specific reason over any other?  Non-familiarity with their weapon?  Hesitation? <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

<br>
My stand is that if you have to get eductaed to drive a car.. you should get relatively similar educationf or fire arms.<br>
<br>
I remebr when i lived in florida... people walking into gun shows and pawn shops and buying a fire arm without proving that they do not have mental defects.. or without havign to show that they did not have criminal records...<br>
<br>
By all means.. hell I wouldn't mind if they required EVERYONE to take firearms courses.<br>
<br>
My problem is with making it too easy to buy guns by not having any laws.<br>
<br>
Explain to me what does a person in NY need a pump aciton shotgun for? <br>
<br>
whould a handgun do anything other than piss the bear off if you shot it with a 9mm 40cal or even a 45?<br>
Is there any handgun short of specialty ones that could do enough damage as to stop a bear?<br>

When all the foreign tourists in FL where getting mugged and killed they asked one of the people they got.  His reply to why they where robbing the tourists is that they knew they where not carring guns, and they didn't know if the FL people where since you could now get a carry permit from the state.

They were robbing tourist cause they carried cash, cameras and other valuables... Not to mention that tourist don;t know better and go into places and get into situations that get them in danger and language/cultural barriers means they are slower at getting help.<br>
<br>
I lived in florida... and not everyone carries a gun... Most of the people I knew didn't own any.  And those who did.. didn't carry them around.<br>
<br>
Most people who are on vacation don;t have their bank nearby.. and if they are from other countries.. they need dollars to spend while out... so they carry more than you or I do on an average day.<br>

Gun control will only affect law-abiding citizens, if you think that it will stop crime, you are deluding yourself.  You propose an all out ban on all firearms?  Say that goes into effect, do you think the criminals will pause and say, &quot;Oh gosh, I can't use my pistol to rob this house/bank/store, that would be illegal.&quot;  The criminals will always have guns; the only people that you are effecting are the victims.  Take for instance England, there is a complete ban on all firearms there.  The crime rate has done nothing but go up since its inception.  Or there is Australia who has also passed a complete ban, home invasion and violent crime has skyrocketed.  All those laws have done is to disarm and make defenseless the honest people.  As someone previous to me has posted, illicit drugs are outlawed and they are still steadily streaming into our nation.  Point of this portion of my tirade, laws will only effect those that are law abiding.  <br>
