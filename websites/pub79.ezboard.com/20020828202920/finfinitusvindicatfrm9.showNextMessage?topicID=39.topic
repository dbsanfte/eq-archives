So does that mean every decision made by the US government was illegitimate until womens suffrage?  No one under 18 can vote - does that mean every decision made by our government wasn't democratic?<br><br>The same arguement can be applied to the Revolutionary War, by the way.  Women didn't get to vote . . . they had no say in the matter, so that wasn't democracy either.<br><br>So if you argue that the Southern States seceding wasn't a democratic decision, because black people weren't allowed to vote on it, then I respond that the Declaration of Independence wasn't either, because women couldn't vote on that.<br><br>All democracies have restrictions, for whatever reasons (some good, some not) on who can vote.  Historically, these have usually been age, race, sex, wealth, and in some nations religion.  This doesn't eliminate the fact that decisions voted on WERE voted on democratically.  <br><br>I'm not defending slavery, because I don't think slavery is right, never have.  BUT, and here's the catch - the Federal Government wasn't taking any action to eliminate slavery - that came about as a tactic to disrupt the Southern economy (if you can call it that) and lifestyle, and frankly worked pretty well to do so.  Smart strategic and PR move.<br><br>The Federal Govenment did not go to war to tell the southern states they had to free their slaves - it went to war to force the Southern States to stay in the Union.  It wasn't about slavery, it was about whether or not individual states had the right to dissolve their membership in the United States of America. <p></br><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~shay01/morksiggy.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ufesteringwounds.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FesteringWounds</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 2:49:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The War of Northern Agression (aka Civil War)</span><hr size=1> /nod <br><br>i agree that the north's decision was not a selfless act.  <br><br>i only countered your statement about the &quot; &quot; remark about the desire to secede was a unanimous decision. <p><img src="http://home.triad.rr.com/apassmore/sig3.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ulachlann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lachlann</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 3:26:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bonq.net/~lachlann/ivicon_copy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The War of Northern Agression (aka Civil War)</span><hr size=1> &quot;A People's History of the United States:  1492 to present&quot; by Howard Zinn .. its really interesting reading, and while not trying to get off topic, you'll learn a LOT about the Civil War in it.

With all of its faults it is still the best country to live in in my opinion.<br><br>Democracy has been a farce since the constitution was written.<br>The writers of the constitution felt that the average person was neither educated nor informed ehough to be able to make a descision on what should be made into a law or who should be in charge, thus they instituted the current voting laws to include the electoral vote.<br><br>The electoral vote is so unfair that the country is no longer what we originally fought for, FREEDOM. The lack of a direct vote has made the ideals of a government by the people a farce.<br>4 times in our past electoral voters voted against the majority of thier state, and 2 times a president with the majority of votes lost the election.<br><br>In a goverenment led by old rich people how can we be an accurate representation of the people. You cant get elected to office unless you have money to run a campaign. Once a person is voted into office they run the government by cronyism. <br><br>Every president we have had has been separated from the people they govern by a generation, and sometimes by 2 genrations. When we have people in charge of us who are making descision based on ideas and beliefs that dont coincide with the current change of the nation, we are doomed to forever be behind the power curve.<br><br>So yes, the civil war was a farce upon the government, but nothing as bad as it has become lately. <p><a href=mailto:Dandaelus@allakhazam.com>Dandaelus Wyldheart</a><br>57th Outrider<br>EPIC ENHANCED <br>Infinitus Vindicat<br>Prexus<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24243>Veiw Me Here</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/umorkenlar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morkenlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Councilman</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 5:49:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The War of Northern Agression (aka Civil War)</span><hr size=1> Actually, Dandy, the electoral system (this includes congress, not just the electoral college) wasn't a farce at all.  It was (and is) a necesary medium.  Unless you care to argue that we could assemble everyone for a vote on issues in the late 1700s?  <br><br>You simply couldn't do a public vote on issues then, because people weren't capable of traveling to do so, they weren't educated (you want a large population that can't read making laws?), and weren't knowledgable about the complexities of govenment, economics, foreign relations, etc.<br><br>Hell, I don't think you could do a RELIABLE public vote on issues now, even with computers.  It wouldn't take but maybe a dozen key people in whatever system you set up cooperating, and they could corrupt the entire system.  A couple programmers, network engineers, security specialists, and maybe a statician to make sure the numbers don't look too off to get caught, and they would rule the nation forever.<br><br>The electoral vote doesn't take away freedom.  Yes, its been abused a few times in the past when the electoral college didn't vote as the people directed, but its all our fault for allowing that.  Not doing so should be a criminal offense of a major magnitude, but it isn't, so people apparently don't think it was wrong enough to warrant a change.  As the old saying goes, every country has the government it deserves.<br><br>Have to have money to get elected?  Nope.  You just have to be in one of the two political parties, they supply the cash for campaigns.  Sure, extra money helps, but if thats all it took, Perot would have won a few years ago.<br><br>Cronyism?  Now you complain of politicians putting people they know in positions of power?  You'd rather they pull someone off the street, in whom they have no trust or knowledge of the person's abilities, to run the govenment?  <br><br>Presidents have to be, what, 35 or 40 years old?  Something like that, anyway.  Whats the objection here?  You want someone that has less experience with the world in power?  Sorry, age doesn't make everyone wiser, but it does make most people wiser, and I'll settle for that for now. <p></br><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~shay01/morksiggy.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ufesteringwounds.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FesteringWounds</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 5:58:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The War of Northern Agression (aka Civil War)</span><hr size=1> eloctoral vote is out dated..<br><br>only reason why they had that was because they could not physically count up all the votes in the nation.<br><br>they do have the technology now to do that. <br><br>Al Gore would have won the last election had we went with the popular vote. <p><img src="http://home.triad.rr.com/apassmore/sig3.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/umorkenlar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morkenlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Councilman</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 8:40:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The War of Northern Agression (aka Civil War)</span><hr size=1> Yeah, Fest, we have the technology . . . but would you trust it?

Kethuvim can tell you that we have had many &quot;discussions&quot; about the topics in the forums, but I never post them.<br><br>I have to say that I may disagree with Mork on some issues, but I can see that we have the same love and feelings about history.  Mork, I must say that I agree with all of the above posts.  Fest, I agree with you, it was not an &quot;unanimous&quot; decision.  <br><br>I am from Louisiana, and am surrounded by people who could care less about those in bondage at the time of the Civil War.  I have always believed that the South had a right to leave the USA if the states so chose to.  That is not saying that I believe that slavery was a just cause to leave, but the ELECTED leaders of the southern states voted to leave.  I know that some southerners did not want to leave the US, as did all of those enslaved.  But I do feel that a vast majority of southerners did approve of the act of succession.

The more automated something is, the easier it is to take control of.  Heres an easy example: most people that bother with anti virus have their software scheduled to do scans at off hours(automating it), and then completely forget/neglect to worry about it anymore.  Now, assuming you don't control physical access to your computer very well (most people don't - I could probably get into most of your computers in under 5 mins), all it would take would be someone to modify something to interfere with the automation.  A new virus, custom made to avoid your automation - say, it alters the time on your machine right before the antivirus software is supposed to start, and resets it 10 mins later to the correct time.  Voila - your computer is now wide open to attacks, yet you have no clue, and think you are secure, because you use antivirus software.<br><br>Next, the comparison with banks.  I think everyone can agree that people will, in general, put forth more effort and take more risks for a greater reward.  A few million dollars is NOTHING compared to what could be done if we automated all our voting.  Reasons people would put forth more effort:<br>1.  Power motivates people more than money.<br>2.  Power can give money.  Imagine the TRILLIONS of dollars that could/would be gotten, from manipulation of legalities, taxation, and high dollar industries (automotive, power, etc)<br>3.  Even &quot;good&quot; people would probably try this - using the &quot;ends justify the means&quot; as their justification.<br><br>And, as for the people breaking into banks - that HAS happened.  The reasons all the safeguards are in place now, is because they had so many problems with that initially.  Imagine the level of power that would be in the hands of the first people to exploit holes in the security.  If they planned adequately, they could abuse it in such a way as to not be punishable.  Remember, we're talking about people making laws.  First law to make - create a new class of citizen, said class being above criminal penalties.  Join said class.  Wow - now, even if they catch you, they can't do anything to you, because the laws say they can't.  How do you stop them now, without violating laws?  <br> <p></br><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~shay01/morksiggy.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/usapiens1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sapiens1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/24/02 9:52:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The War of Northern Agression (aka Civil War)</span><hr size=1> Oh you mean like the south created a &quot;special citizen&quot;  that had all the rigths...  while others didnt?<br><br>As to making it harder... i don't think so.<br><br>If anything.. makes it easier.<br><br>for example...

I found it interesting reading, and as it fits in this topic, here it is.<br><br><br>A New Look at the &quot;Civil War&quot;<br>by Carl Pearlston<br>While barge traveling down the Mississippi this Spring, we stopped at Vicksburg to tour the historic Civil War (or as it is variously termed in the South, the War Between the States, the War for Southern Independence, or the War of Northern Aggression) battlefield marking the city's siege and surrender, which gave the Union final control over the river and divided the Confederacy. Like so many, I've always been fascinated and puzzled by this tragic war in which some 630,000 Union and Confederate soldiers lost their lives. I had always learned and believed that the South's &quot;peculiar institution&quot; of slavery was the cause of that conflict, but in discussions with the local tour guide, he opined that the real cause of the war was Union tariff policy. This was a novel idea which piqued my curiosity. Fortuitously, a day or two later in the museum at Natchez, I found a book entitled War for What, by Francis Springer, which purported to give &quot;the real cause of the war between the states.&quot;<br>Springer points out, amid a good deal of apologia for slavery, that in 1860, the 15 Southern states had 8 million whites and 4 ½ million black slaves, compared to 19 million whites and ¼ million blacks in the North's 19 states. The vast areas of undeveloped western territory were rapidly being settled by people whose economic interests were not with the South. It found itself continually outvoted in both the Congress and Senate, especially on commercial regulations, with the prospect of an increasing majority against it. The nub of the problem was that the North wanted high tariffs on imported goods to protect its own manufactured products, while the South wanted low tariffs on imports and exports since it exported cotton and tobacco to Europe and imported manufactured goods in exchange. High tariffs in effect depressed the price for the South's agricultural exports; the South paid high prices for what it bought and got low prices for what it sold because of the federal tariff policy which the South was powerless to change. Southerners viewed themselves as being dominated by the mercantile interests of the North who profited from these high tariffs.<br>At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Virginia had proposed a requirement for a 2/3 majority to enact laws regulating commerce and levying tariffs, which were the chief revenue of the federal government. George Mason of Virginia stated:<br>&quot;The effect of a provision to pass commercial laws by a simple majority would be to deliver the south bound hand and foot to the eastern states&quot;. <br>Virginia withdrew its amendment at the Convention in the interest of securing adoption of the Constitution, but ratification was with the proviso that it could be rescinded whenever the powers granted to the Union were used to oppress, and Virginia could then withdraw from the Union. True to George Mason's prediction, the high tariff of 1828 did bring the South to the verge of rebellion, leading Senator John C. Calhoun to unsuccessfully champion the concept of Nullification and the doctrine of the Concurrent Majority in 1833 to ensure that the South could have a veto power over commercial acts passed by a simple majority in Congress and the Senate.<br>Springer's book had certainly raised a host of questions, when I was informed of a new book entitled When in the Course of Human Events: Arguing the Case for Southern Succession, by Charles Adams, a noted scholar and writer on the history of taxation. It is a fascinating and somewhat disturbing revisionist history, for it posits the Civil War as but a continuation of the tariff controversy from 1828, ignoring the issues of slavery and the admission of new non-slave states from the territories as reasons for the South's secession and the resultant conflict.<br>Adams takes the skeleton which Springer had sketched and fills out its flesh with statistics, facts, and timely and instructive details from the newspapers of both the US and England. Consider, for example, a quote by author Charles Dickens in a London periodical in December 1861, <br>&quot;Union means so many millions a year lost to the South; secession means the loss of the same millions to the North. The love of money is the root of this as of many other evils....The quarrel between the North and South is, as it stands, solely a fiscal quarrel&quot;.<br>As Adams notes, the South paid an undue proportion of federal revenues derived from tariffs, and these were expended by the federal government more in the North than the South: in 1840, the South paid 84% of the tariffs, rising to 87% in 1860. They paid 83% of the $13 million federal fishing bounties paid to New England fishermen, and also paid $35 million to Northern shipping interests which had a monopoly on shipping from Southern ports. The South, in effect, was paying tribute to the North. The address of Texas Congressman Reagan on 15 January 1861 summarizes this discontent: <br>&quot;You are not content with the vast millions of tribute we pay you annually under the operation of our revenue law, our navigation laws, your fishing bounties, and by making your people our manufacturers, our merchants, our shippers. You are not satisfied with the vast tribute we pay you to build up your great cities, your railroads, your canals. You are not satisfied with the millions of tribute we have been paying you on account of the balance of exchange which you hold against us. You are not satisfied that we of the South are almost reduced to the condition of overseers of northern capitalists. You are not satisfied with all this; but you must wage a relentless crusade against our rights and institutions.&quot; <br>As the London Times of 7 Nov 1861 stated: <br>&quot;The contest is really for empire on the side of the North and for independence on that of the South....&quot;.<br>If the South did not secede to protect slavery, why was that prominently stated as the principal reason in the secession resolutions of the various Confederate states? Adams claims that slavery was never in danger, pointing out that Lincoln pledged to enforce the fugitive slave law, declared he had no right or intention to interfere with slavery, and supported a new irrevocable constitutional amendment to protect slavery forever. The South's proclamation that slavery was in danger was a political ploy full of political cant to stir up secessionist fever. As the North American Review (Boston October 1862) put it: <br>&quot;Slavery is not the cause of the rebellion ....Slavery is the pretext on which the leaders of the rebellion rely, 'to fire the Southern Heart' and through which the greatest degree of unanimity can be produced....Mr. Calhoun, after finding that the South could not be brought into sufficient unanimity by a clamor about the tariff, selected slavery as the better subject for agitation&quot;. <br>An editorial in the Charleston Mercury 2 days before the November 1860 election stated: <br>&quot;The real causes of dissatisfaction in the South with the North, are in the unjust taxation and expenditure of the taxes by the Government of the United States, and in the revolution the North has effected in this government from a confederated republic, to a national sectional despotism.&quot; <br>And on 21 January 1861, five days before Louisiana seceded, the New Orleans Daily Crescent editorialized: <br>&quot;They [the South] know that it is their import trade that draws from the people's pockets sixty or seventy millions of dollars per annum, in the shape of duties, to be expended mainly in the North, and in the protection and encouragement of Northern interests....These are the reasons why these people [the North] do not wish the South to secede from the Union.&quot;<br>When South Carolina seceded in December 1860, followed by the other Confederate states, all the powerful moneyed interests in the North were in favor of appeasing the South over slavery in order to preserve the Union. If the South were to be a sovereign nation with low tariffs, it could undermine Northern business and trade. The South believed that it did not need the North, since it could buy the goods it needed from Europe, but the North needed the South as a market for Northern goods.<br>The Republican platform of 1860 called for higher tariffs; that was implemented by the new Congress in the Morill tariff of March 1861, signed by President Buchanan before Lincoln took the oath of office. It imposed the highest tariffs in US history, with over a 50% duty on iron products and 25% on clothing; rates averaged 47%. The nascent Confederacy followed with a low tariff, essentially creating a free-trade zone in the South. Prior to this &quot;war of the tariffs&quot;, most Northern newspapers had called for peace through conciliation, but many now cried for war. The Philadelphia Press on 18 March 1861 demanded a blockade of Southern ports, because, if not, <br>&quot;a series of customs houses will be required on the vast inland border from the Atlantic to West Texas. Worse still, with no protective tariff, European goods will under-price Northern goods in Southern markets. Cotton for Northern mills will be charged an export tax. This will cripple the clothing industries and make British mills prosper. Finally, the great inland waterways, the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Ohio Rivers, will be subject to Southern tolls.&quot;<br>Earlier, in December 1860, before any secession, the Chicago Daily Times foretold the disaster that Southern free ports would bring to Northern commerce: <br>&quot;In one single blow our foreign commerce must be reduced to less than one-half what it now is. Our coastwise trade would pass into other hands. One-half of our shipping would lie idle at our wharves. We should lose our trade with the South, with all of its immense profits. Our manufactories would be in utter ruins. Let the South adopt the free-trade system, or that of a tariff for revenue, and these results would likely follow.&quot;<br>Similarly, the economic editor of the NY Times, who had maintained for months that secession would not injure Northern commerce or prosperity, changed his mind on 22 March 1861: <br>&quot;At once shut down every Southern port, destroy its commerce and bring utter ruin on the Confederate States.&quot; On 18 March, the Boston Transcript noted that while the Southern states had claimed to secede over the slavery issue, now &quot;the mask has been thrown off and it is apparent that the people of the principal seceding states are now for commercial independence. They dream that the centres of traffic can be changed from Northern to Southern ports....by a revenue system verging on free trade....&quot;<br>In late March 1861, over a hundred leading commercial importers in New York, and a similar group in Boston, informed the collector of customs that they would not pay duties on imported goods unless these same duties were collected at Southern ports. This was followed by a threat from New York to withdraw from the Union and establish a free-trade zone. Prior to these events, Lincoln's plan was to evacuate Fort Sumter and not precipitate a war, but he now determined to reinforce it rather than suffer prolonged economic disaster in a losing trade war. That reinforcement effort was met with force by the South, and the dreadful conflict was upon us.<br>Adams attacks the opposing views of those like Horace Greeley and John Stuart Mill, who held that slavery was the one cause of the secession and the War, as uninformed and based on inadequate research. Mill's article of February 1862, reprinted in Harper's magazine, was a welcome shot in the arm for the Northern cause, giving it an undeserved moral virtue.<br>As part of this revisionist history, Adams discusses Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, his order for arrest of Chief Justice Taney after the Justice's opinion holding such suspension to be unconstitutional, the military courts martial which replaced civilian courts and imprisoned some 14,000 dissidents or Copperheads for varied opposition to the war, the closure of some 300 newspapers for opposition to the war, Reconstruction, the rise of the Klan, the planned trial of Jefferson Davis, and the legality of secession. He also provides a critical examination of the Gettysburg Address, of which one reader stated, as quoted on the bookjacket, <br>&quot;Having read this book, I can no longer, with ease, recite the 'Gettysburg Address' or sing the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic'.&quot;<br>What then are we to make of the case Adams sets forth? Was Karl Marx correct when he wrote in 1861: <br>&quot;The war between the North and the South is a tariff war. The war is, further, not for any principle, does not touch the question of slavery, and in fact turns on the Northern lust for sovereignty.&quot; <br>While historians may differ, Adams makes a convincing case. But one fact is clear: without its &quot;peculiar institution&quot; of slavery, the South would have never developed its agricultural might so dependent on masses of black laborers. Without slavery and the resultant plantation economy, the cultural divide and fierce sectional rivalry between North and South over tariff policy would not have developed. So, in that sense, slavery was at the root of the entire conflict between the North and the South, though tariffs may well have been the immediate precipitating factor, just as Adams contends. Whatever the cause, it is hard to quarrel with Adams' conclusion that <br>&quot;... the Civil war was not just a great national American tragedy, but even more so, a tragedy for civilization ....
