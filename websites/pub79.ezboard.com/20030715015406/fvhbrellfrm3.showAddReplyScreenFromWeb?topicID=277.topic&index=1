He removed his helm and scratched his head, trying to recall things that where blured beyond what it is normal for him.  Unbridled rage welled in his throat as he struggled through the muddled memories and the like.  A halfling ran past him in a hurry to get information back to the group that had taken up an outpost in the forest.  <br>
<br>
The unfortunate creature never new what hit him as Tevesh grabbed him and crushed his skull with his forhead.  Licking the blood as it flowed over his lips, he tossed the lifeless body down to the ground as he made his way back into Neriak.<br>
<br>
He quickly moved past the Trolls in the foreign quarter, wondering through the muck in his mind...&quot;When where there so many of them here?&quot;  Shrugging he continued down, rushing to the third gate to check on his family, something told him it was necessary to check on things, to make sure no one screwed anything up worse then Khasirath did by leaving.  &quot;The house's Golden Boy my arse&quot; he muttered under his breath as he turned down a side passage that would lead in through the servents quarters into the compound.<br>
<br>
Movement in the shadows caught his eye, without thinking (not that anyone would be surprised) he brought a mailed fist down on the back of the Tier'Dal's head.  Reaching down he looked over the Tier'Dal's belongings. The only thing that seemed to interest him was the wound up scroll.  Opening it he sat down on the still breathing body of the unnamed Tier'Dal and started trying to read the scroll.<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later he finished the scroll.  Casually he looked down at the body and wondered if he would wake up.  He took the scroll and threw it back down onto the Tier'Dal.  &quot;Obviously he was going to deliver it to me.  Oh well, this saves him the trip.&quot; he thought to himself.  Kicking the body over so it could breathe he continued into the compound.<br>
<br>

<br>
Natori accepted the rolled parchment with a deep bow.  When Nilvenia made no move to leave the warrior's private chambers, Natori took it to be a sign that the house leader wished to know what the letter said.<br>
<br>
After reading the letter, Natori closed her eyes.  Memories of the last time she has seen any of them came flooding back to her.  She was so young then  The harvest was her family, her home.  They had essentially raised her from a whimsical teenager to a hardened warrior in the height of hate-filled battle.  Memories of Faeolin, the powerful but aging warrioress that had taken her under her wing, guiding her heart and her sword.  And now it was she, in Faeolin's shoes.  <br>
<br>
She opened her eyes and looked out of the window onto the courtyard below.  Several of the young of the house were practicing with their swords.  She noted with pride as they adjusted their hold on the weapons according to her teachings.  Turning away from the window, she again faced Nilvenia.  &quot;The Harvest reforms.  It requests the presense of all those that have served before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you answer that calling?&quot; Nilvenia asked, leaving warrior with the choice to leave, or to stay.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Harvest will always be my family, my brethren in arms.   My sword is theres whenever there is a battle to be faught, but this is my home now.   I stay with the House, m'lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I leave you then to form your response.&quot; the priestess turned and walked out.<br>
<br>
Natori sat to the spartan desk, and cleared aside a few training documents.  Staring at the blank parchment before her she sighed.  It was much more difficult to refuse the calling of the Harvest than she had indicated to Lady Nilvenia.  The Harvest was her family, it’s members her brothers, her sisters, and in a way, her parents.  She thought fondly back to days fighting beside her old companions.   They were the ones that helped make her the warrior she was.  They were the ones that stood beside her as she honed her skills.  How could she say no to Daiunus?<br>
<br>
She stared again out onto the courtyard, though her mind was elsewhere.   She recalled that with the Harvest, she was one of the few young ones amongst them.  The Harvest was aging.  There weren’t many young ones in that day ready to step up and take there place amongst the Harvest, none to continue the traditions once battle claimed the elder members.<br>
<br>
But here, in the House, the youth were many.  They needed guidance, they needed one that could help them to rise to the Hate of the Father.  Maybe one day, when they were ready, they would take their place in the Harvest, if there was one here to guide them. <br>
<br>
Daiunus would have to contend himself that in her own way, she to still served the Harvest, assuring that once the old died, or set aside their blades, there were youth to step up and replace them  Natori picked up the quill, and dipped it into the bottle of ink, firm in her decision to keep to her new calling.  <br>
<br>
An hour later, a long apologetic and explanatory letter sat drying before her, along with the promise that she would watch for any that showed promise that he or she would make a valuable asset to the Harvest.   <br>
<br>
After the letter dried, she sealed it with the wax impression of her new alliance and handed it to a messenger, along with a few gold pieces, to ensure it’s safe delivery to the grange.  Once the delivery girl had left, Natori strode down to the courtyard, and the waiting youth.<br>
<br>
