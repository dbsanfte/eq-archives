So I was looking through Allakhazam's....<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 and I stumble across Kedge Keep, a zoner I have heard about but never seen.<br>
<br>
I look at unique items and start looking them up, and OMG! the loot here is amazing, and more to the point, it is exaclty the level dungeon I should be hunting at right now! Never been there neither so suddenly I am overcome with curiosity.<br>
<br>
Just wondering if any of you have been here, and if you would like to plan a day when we can go again in the future. I'd love to see how the stragety of underwater fighting and pulling works, plus by the end of the trip my swim would definately be maxed..<br>
<br>
Any one interested?<br>

I also heard that it was the place with the highest experience modifier in Norrath before the patch that changed the experience modifiers for alot of dungeons. Point is, it still is a high exp yield.<br>
<br>
Though I heard the dungeon is TOUGH. This is *NOT* a place that a few friends get together and poke around for fun. This is a place that you go with a plan, get in, kick the crap out of your target, and get the flock out.<br>
<br>
Of course, that last paragraph is all second hand info, I've never been there myself, though I was in Evoluxa during 2 of their raids and had the advantage of listening to the colorful language being used. *grin* <br>

 Worry not.<br>
<br>
I've had my eye on this one a long time. It's an underwater dungeon...very difficult<br>
to maneuver in...and quite 3 dimensional. I plan to attend at KK raid with some of<br>
the more experienced guilds...others will go as well.<br>
<br>
Should anyone from VH attend a KK &quot;party&quot; before I do, please post your comments<br>
and observances.<br>

 Xosha, I have been there a few times (personally dislike the zone) the zone trash can be done by a group of 40+. It gets much tougher as you go in. One of the things you should be considering is camping the fishbone earring in qhills if you are serious about this dungeon.<br>

 Yup, it can get smoking tuff in a hurry.<br>
<br>
Plus, the pain in the butt of watching your stamina bar dying constantly as you are swimming full time. The need to keep enduring breath or DMF running is not that bad.<br>
<br>
CR can be a nightmare due to the 3 dimensional layout of the sunken city.<br>
<br>
As you go deeper, you will find mobs that don't mez worth a dam. Have huge magic resistance and far to many hitpoints for their con.<br>
<br>
They have huge cold resist, so use fire based dots. They also seem to have huge magic resist period, but the fire based spells work with consistency.<br>
<br>
Its something you really should raid first with a large, experienced group. And its worth doing at least once. Very very different experience from other raids.<br>
<br>
I quite liked it. <br>

 Honestly the difficulty of it is not my concern, and frankly I am surprised it bothers any of us, after all we are not in the game to hunt the same damn camp endlessly because it's good experience and items. Maybe I led to that in my first mention. But the true draw is that I've never been there. Don't you guys have that unquenchable need to see all the zones in the game, see all the pretty monsters, hunt in the most difficult and rewarding places?<br>
<br>
3D fighting would be a blast! Sure the dungeon looks hard as hell, so WHAT!? I've never been there and that's enough reason to try and to go and maybe to even die, but at least I would have seen it.<br>

 Ebonbone's face is masked in shadows as the candle's flame reflect in his eyes. An old yellowed tome lays open on the sturdy but age-splintered table before him. He looks up from the faded pages that were once dancing with brilliant colors. His eyes finally focus on the nub of a black candle as he returns to the world from deep in his own thought. Ebonbone places his hand over the flame and grins evily as the smell of his own singed flesh reaches his nostrils.<br>
<br>
Reassured that what is real exists, he flips up the front half of the tome with his other hand as he twitches not the one over the candle. On the cover he reads: &quot;Arcaine Sciences: Where and on What Necromancy Fails.&quot;<br>
<br>
He places the cover back down upon the pitted table with respectful ease. He then rereads what he had just read.<br>
<br>
Dead Man Floating is a most useful spell as it grants not only Levitation for rough terrain but also a significant resistance to poisen of all forms as well as the ability to breath in all enviroments save one. Due to some ancient curse whose origins are unknown, the water in Kedge Keep sufficates those of the Necromatic Arts even with this, our grandest of enhancements, applied to one's self. The enhancements of many objects as worn by us mortals do seem to overcome this curse as do the Enduring Breath enhancements of the Practitioners of other of the Arcain Arts. <br>
<br>
Ebonebone looks up from the tome once again. His eyes wander to his suspended hand. He withdraws his hand from over the flame and examines his blistering palm with morbid curiosity.<br>
