====================================== <br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Test Version 1.53a <br>
<br>
September 5, 2002 <br>
<br>
====================================== <br>
<br>
Welcome to the first installment of Dark Age of Camelot version 1.53. This version has some long-awaited melee-class RvR updates, as well as a new dungeon, lots of world updates, and the debut of the even-longer-awaited Spellcrafting/Alchemy tradeskill system, which allows player craftsmen to make magically imbued items. <br>
<br>
<br>
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT <br>
<br>
Folks, <br>
<br>
Just a none-too-brief note regarding the future of Camelot (full text of this message can be found on the Camelot Herald at www.camelotherald.com). Over the next four months we are working to implement the following things for DAoC. In no particular order, here is our Best of Fall Plan. <br>
<br>
1) Encouraging players of a wider level range to group. We are thus making some adjustments so that players of more disparate levels are able to group together without anyone taking too much of an experience point hit. <br>
<br>
2)Speeding up the leveling time between levels 41 and 50. As above, we have seen that these levels take longer to go through than we believe is optimal. Thus, we are greatly reducing the time it will take to complete them. <br>
<br>
3)Doubling of available character slots. We have worked out the technical issues involved with this, and thus, we are going from four to eight! <br>
<br>
4)Spellcrafting/Alchemy going LIVE. We will continue to work carefully on these two crafting skills as their potential to change the balance of the game is quite large. They will start testing on Pendragon later this week. <br>
<br>
5)Housing is still being developed and we are committed to adding this to the game as part of subscriber content – so it will not require the expansion pack. Like Spellcrafting we are taking our time with housing to make sure that it is done right the first time. <br>
<br>
6)Self-evolving encounter areas with changing locations. What we are working on is a way to add intelligent monster groups to the game that will actually evolve on their own over time and based on player interaction. <br>
<br>
7)Continued improvements to the interface. We are looking at ways to improve the interface for all our users and not just those who buy the expansion. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Improved melee classes. More love coming your way now – check out this week's Pendragon version. <br>
<br>
9)Improvements to the RvR areas. We are looking into ways to give you more reasons to take and hold keeps. We will present them to you over the next few months. <br>
<br>
10)A major new server type will be added to the game. As always, we listen to our users and based on popular demand we will be adding a &quot;Cooperative&quot; server to our game. <br>
11)A special bonus for any player who has a character that attains 50th level. Players who achieve this level will be able to create new characters at a higher starting level. We haven’t decided exactly at what level we are going to start at but it will be at least 20th. <br>
<br>
12)More information about Shrouded Isles. We intend to begin weekly Shrouded Isles Sneak Peaks on our SI website. <br>
<br>
As required by lawyers everywhere, the usual disclaimer that this letter is a guide as to what we hope to have in during this period and not as a guarantee of any kind. And also as usual, this list does not encompass the only things we are working on. <br>
<br>
As always we thank the community for its continued support and patronage of DAoC and we will continue to work to improve and add to DAoC. We have lots more content/features/abilities on the way. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- Found and fixed a bug (hopefully THE bug) that was causing players to not evade, parry and block in RvR at the same rate that they were parrying/blocking/evading against monsters. All characters who evade, block, and/or parry should now see themselves parrying/blocking/evading much more often in RvR. <br>
<br>
- We've substantially updated the in-game (F1) help system. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MELEE CLASS UPDATE <br>
<br>
In order to make everyday life in RvR more fun and compelling for primary melee characters, we've made some updates to the Realm Ability system. These changes and updates are focused on the RvR capabilities of these classes, hence the use of the Realm Ability system to implement the changes. <br>
<br>
The intent of the changes is to make primary melee classes (i.e. those melee classes that do not have spells) able to close with their enemies better, and to be able to have the chance of preventing their enemies from escaping once they have closed with them. <br>
<br>
The following changes to realm abilities for Armsmen, Mercenaries, Heroes, Blademasters, Warriors and Berserkers have been made: <br>
<br>
- Reduced cost of the Realm Ability Ignore Pain to 8 points. <br>
<br>
- Reduced cost of the Realm Ability Determination to 1/2/3/6/10 points. <br>
<br>
- Reduced cost of the Realm Ability Purge for these classes to 2 points. <br>
<br>
- Added new passive Realm Ability &quot;Prevent Flight&quot; When active, if the tank's selected target turns and runs, the tank has a 35% chance of hitting and proccing a 50% snare for 10 seconds. Cost: 14 points. <br>
<br>
- Added a new realm ability called &quot;Charge&quot;, learned by Blademasters, Mercenaries, and Berserkers only. To charge, the tank selects an enemy, and initiates this ability. When active, the tank sprints at full sprint speed, with no endurance loss, for 10 seconds towards the target. If he breaks off, or changes target, or the 10 seconds expires, the tank goes back to normal running speed. Can be used every 5 minutes. Cost: 5 points. <br>
<br>
All of these primary melee tanks will be able to respec their Realm abilities to take advantage of these changes. <br>
<br>
Please note that this addresses only pure melee classes - we are next looking at some of the hybrid tank classes, especially the Paladin. There is a possibility that Paladins will end up with some of these same changes, but we're going to evaluate their chants first. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
REALM ABILITY SYSTEM UPDATE <br>
<br>
Here's the first round of updates and tweaks to the Realm Ability system. Please note that we will continue to make changes throughout 1.53. At some point we'll add in the respec option so players can respec to take advantage of the changes. <br>
<br>
- Added Wild Power to Cabalist realm ability list. <br>
<br>
- Armor of Faith is now properly set to be 1 level for 10 points, which provides +150 AF for 60 seconds. <br>
<br>
- Added Ethereal Bond to Minstrels. <br>
<br>
- Changed Nightshades to gain power from Intelligence boosting items and Augmented Acuity. <br>
<br>
- Changed description of First Aid to the following: &quot;Self heal that heals a set amount of hit points per level gained in the ability. This value increases with the character's level. At level 50, it heals approximately 300 hitpoints per level. It cannot be used in combat.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPELLCRAFT AND ALCHEMY <br>
<br>
Spellcraft and Alchemy make their debut in Dark Age of Camelot with this patch, which are the two crafting skills that allow player crafters to imbue weapons and armor with magical properties. This is an extensive system that has many options and associated skills. For full documentation of the Spellcraft and Alchemy, go to the Camelot Herald at www.camelotherald.com/documentation/spellcraft/. You'll find all the information you need to get started there. <br>
<br>
We have also made a Spellcrafting calculator, which you can find at: www.camelotherald.com/documentation/spellcraft.html. With this calculator, you'll be able to run the numbers to be sure you know exactly what to purchase when you go to a Spellcrafter. DISCLAIMER: This calculator is currently a work in progress, so it may not work properly, as our trained web gnomes continue to hack at it. <br>
<br>
We'll also be putting up pages with all of the raw numbers for Spellcraft (that the calculator uses) as well as what all of the Alchemy items do within the next few days. Check out the Herald for that notice soon. <br>
<br>
<br>
General Overview of Spellcraft/Alchemy <br>
<br>
Spellcraft and Alchemy work exactly like the other tradeskills as far as their recipes, and the objects they create go. Once you have the object, you &quot;combine&quot; them, via the trade window to an object. <br>
<br>
For example, Player A takes their Sword they want to have strength added to it to a Spellcrafter. They place it in a trade window with the Spellcrafter. The Spellcrafter places a strength Gem in the sword's gem socket and clicks the &quot;combine&quot; button. Satisfied (both players will get text information on the combine, how many points it took, etc), Player A places some money in the trade window and hits Trade. The Spellcrafter then hits trade, the combine happens. Viola! Player A has a sword with a strength bonus, and the Spellcrafter has the satisfaction of making another magic item... oh, and the money, too... <br>
<br>
The &quot;forge&quot; object for Spellcraft and Alchemy is the nice, new, Alchemy table that you will see placed in various parts of the home cities. You will find the merchants needed for these two crafts close by. <br>
<br>
The tools that you will need for various recipes are the Spellcraft Kit, Alchemy Kit, and Mortar and Pestle. The kits are always needed for their specific trade, the Mortar and Pestle is needed for making any of the poisons. <br>
<br>
You may need to scroll sideways in the Spellcraft/Alchemy Merchants to find the items that you need. <br>
<br>
<br>
Names of Guild Masters: <br>
<br>
Albion <br>
<br>
Spellcraft Guild Master: Clayton Gage <br>

<br>
<br>
The following Spellcraft/Alchemy items have yet to be fully implemeted: <br>
<br>
- Procs/Reverse procs and charges are not yet implemented, however you can make the proccing or charged item; it just won't proc/take charges until a future 1.53 patch. <br>
<br>
- Any recipes that show in the Alchemy list as requiring a skill of zero are ones that require a dropped component. They haven't been placed at their final skill value yet. We'll add those dropped in a future 1.53 patch. <br>
<br>
- The ability to wipe a current tradeskill profession to choose a new one is not yet implemented. <br>
<br>
- Some other misc. items that should be in before 1.53 goes live (splitting stacks, self trading, some additional trading commands, etc.). Look for these in a future 1.53 update. <br>
<br>
- We've had to shelve particle effects created by Spellcraft/Alchemy for the time being while we work out some technical issues with the system. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
New Dungeons <br>
<br>
- Adventurers in all three realms are complaining of increased sightings of undead in their frontiers. There has been word that a new group has risen to power whose only interest is the complete and total domination of the three realms. By using their powerful magic, they have managed to carve a maze of dungeons beneath the frontier allowing them to enter and leave each realm's frontier at will. They have also amassed an army of undead big enough to wage a three-front war. <br>
<br>
- We have found an entrance to Marfach Caverns in the Hibernian frontier of Breifine. <br>
<br>
- In the Jamtland Mountains of the Midgard frontier, we have located the entrance to Gruva av Dod. <br>
<br>
- The entrance to the Hall of the Corrupt has been located in the Pennine Mountains of Albion. <br>
<br>

Albion Quests <br>
<br>
- Legend of the Lake: We have made some changes to the 15th level portion of this quest in an attempt to bring it up to the level of other quests within the realm.

Players who encounter this step of the quest will be given the option to perform two of the possible four sub-quests. Please note that these changes will not affect players that have already performed this section of the quest. <br>
<br>
- The material type on Bernor's Numinous Robes has been upgraded to be in line with the rest of the epic armors. Wizards may notice their current robes appear to have lost a few levels. To exchange your current robe for the new one, please see Gardowen Egesa in Camelot. This exchange can only be made one time. <br>
<br>
- A merchant by the name of Grindan Halig at Caer Ulfwych, is looking for a brave soul to descend into the Catacombs of Cardova and search for something. <br>
<br>

Midgard Quests <br>
<br>
- Asdis in Upplands is no longer charmable. <br>

<br>
- Koalinth Caverns - The rare, existing, monsters of Koalinth Caverns have been capitalized appropriately. <br>
<br>
- Treibh Caillte - Several rocky golems who insisted on facing the wall while fighting have been adjusted. The thralls have received new orders to attack and kill all on sight, and are consistently attacking all they see. <br>
<br>
- Additionally, the constant traffic from Culraid to Treibh Caillte has forced the roaming monsters along this route to seek new homes. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Dungeons: Midgard <br>
<br>
- Cursed Tomb - The aggressive monsters at the entrance to Cursed Tomb have found new homes - scouts returning from the dungeon report that fewer wanderers appear to inhabit the dungeon. <br>
<br>
- Spindelhalla - the untargettable cave trow trollkarls in the Pit area have moved into the interior of the room. <br>
<br>
<br>
Monsters: Albion <br>
<br>
- Tales abound that the Green Knight has returned to Forest Sauvage. Should you encounter this knight, caution would be best. He cannot be happy with all that has happened during his absence. <br>
<br>
<br>
Monsters: Midgard <br>
<br>
- The soul sinkers in Myrkwood Forest will no longer chain cast their DOT. <br>
<br>
- The Briton Woodcutters who had invaded Odin's Gate seem to have left as quickly as they came. <br>

<br>
- The wraith Evern within Breifine has discovered the key to a powerful ritual! She now has the ability to summon fairies to do her bidding. Those who anger her must be ready for a prolonged battle. <br>
<br>
<br>
