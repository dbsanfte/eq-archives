<br>
As I see it Jah, you need to understand that leading a raid doesn't give you free reign over loot decisions, (hell it doesn't even make you that much more important that a random person who just shows up to help imo), and leaving because of it is extremely selfish. Threatening to take half the guild with you is rediculous and is undeniably deserving of a guildremove. <br>
<br>
Ajahn, I feel that your decision to tell Mork what Jah said was justified. Things like that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be brought out into the open! It would have exploded sooner or later, better now than when the tear drops I'd say.<br>

I think you basically lumped Aerika in with me too.  All this seems pretty typical.<br>
<br>
It's kinda funny, the only names I ever see listed for loot on your site front page whenever you do big raids is you and Carit.  <br>
<br>
I didn't come here to fight, but I did read the chat log, and I do know someone that I got to know for months was booted from his guild in a very abrupt manner for something he said to a RL friend on the phone when he was angry.  I feel bad for him, I'm sure I'm not the only one.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think you are sitting there trying to justify something you did out of the very same type of anger that caused Jaharad to make comments to his friend over the phone.  It sounds like egos were flying and you just happened to be in the drivers seat.  I think you regretted it as soon as you deguilded him right up to the point that others started jumping on the bandwagon to support you.  There was no turning back then, was there?  You will never admit that you acted in haste, but that's nothing new.  I think you regret a lot of things, but the male ego is something that doesn't easily bend. <br>
<br>
I highly doubt you will see Brewt post to this thread, though, he is aware of what was said.  He's probably surprised as you are that I'm posting, especially since I've been the one that's been saying &quot;get past it&quot; for so long.  I guess I've been carrying around a little animosity that I wasn't aware of until I saw Jah's post.  He did a lot for me when I played eq, and I think he deserved a little support, even if it was from the peanut gallery.<br>

I don't give two shits what HE says because these days he denies ever hearing things that I told him two hours earlier.<br>

He was NOT angry.  He did NOT speak out of anger.  He was NOT blowing off steam. <p><p><center><a><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~shay01/ajahn.gif" border="0"></center> </a>

Unlike some other guilds we have a points system that allows people who raid hard to be rewarded for doing so by spending those points to get items. Mork and Carit raid their asses off and have earned the right to loot what they have. You, not being privey to how we do things wouldnt understand that. As a matter of fact, Mork and Carit passed on at least 6 plate BPs in TOV before finally looting one, even thought they had the points to do so before anyone else.<br>
<br>
Glorund, while I understand this is a public forum, I ask that you and other folks coming here have some real insight into what has been going on with us and Jaharad for the last couple months before posting opinions. Simply viewing a conversation log or peoples arguements is really not enough to base an opinion on. A person would have had to been in our chat or on our raids to fully know where most of this came from.<br>
<br>
Jaharad that whole log seems VERY mean spirited on BOTH sides. I know Mork has been really bothered by your attitude since the TOV/BP incident, so have I. However lately things seemed to have been healing. I was starting to see signs of the old Jaharad that I respected SO much and that I felt was SO good for our guild. All of this came as a real disappointment to me and Im sure to others in the guild. Im sure nobody, and I know Mork feels this way too, feels you belong anywhere else, you are PART of the reason that we are where we are today, your dedication to pulling raids and helping people helped set a standard in the guild that has helped us grow so fast. <br>
<br>
I do take some offense that you feel youre solely responsible for what we have done. We have all had our moments where our tactic turned out to be the right one, we can be proud of that but its also because we are inclusive of ideas that that happens. Im not gonna get into a finger pointing arguement over who has done what, we have talked on the phone and you know how I feel about that.<br>

If everyone in your guild is happy with the system and no one feels like they are being slighted by such a system, then I guess my comment won't hit a nerve.  Personally, I've always thought straight NBG (decision being left with the raid leader) was always an acceptable and very fair method of loot distribution, but, that really doesn't matter to this subject.<br>
<br>
Ajahn, he says he was mad, you say he wasn't.  Doesn't matter really.  In the end, he had a conversation on the phone with a &quot;friend&quot; and it got him deguilded.  /shrug, I've said things that I didn't &quot;mean&quot; to friends because I felt that what I said would be held in confidence.  Sometimes it just feels good to talk &quot;shit&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Really, it seems to me some people need to stop and review what is really important.  That is,  what people tend to say in the context of a game or the deeper idea of RL friendships.<br>
<br>
Well, that's all I'll say on the subject, I'm sure you are happy about that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
