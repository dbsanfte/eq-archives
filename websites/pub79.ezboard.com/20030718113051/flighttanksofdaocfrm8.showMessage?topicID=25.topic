SCHEDULING NOTES<br>
<br>
We're wrapping up the changes for version 1.52, which consists of changes that will affect players will want to respec - i.e. we've made lots of changes to spells, abilities, combat armor tables, as well as lots of other specialization-specific updates. We don't plan on putting any more changes into 1.52 that will change skills, abilities, or specializations, so we currently plan to take 1.52 live on Tuesday, August 6 with the changes that have been included in 1.52 up until this time. Of course if we find that we need to re-address an issue or find problems with the version, we'll take the steps necessary to fix them. <br>
<br>
We're doing this so that we can get the respec out to players as soon as possible - there's no need to wait for respec while we work on Spellcrafting and Alchemy, the next two big items on the plate.<br>
<br>
So, 1.53 will start testing internally next week as soon as 1.52 goes live, and will contain Spellcrafting and Alchemy, as well as any other melee fixes and RvR tweaks that will not require specialization changes. Expect to see these items up on Pendragon for testing soon after that.<br>
<br>
Of course if, in the future, we decide that we need to make changes of such a large magnitude that they will require a specialization change, we'll add in a respec option for those classes/specializations that are affected by the change at that time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A NOTE ON BOLTS<br>
<br>
A quick note of explanation about bolt spells. As every &quot;robe&quot; caster knows, bolt spells are intended to hit targets that are not in combat. They do much more damage than direct damage spells, but they are usable only in certain situations. A bug was fixed in 1.52C which changes how the game determines if a player or monster is &quot;in combat&quot; - now to be truly flagged as in combat, you must actively be attacking someone (or something) else. Previously, large numbers of players would be flagged as &quot;in combat&quot; when they were in fact not actively engaging someone. So, theoretically, that change made bolts easier to use in RvR, although they still will not be usable in all situations. Please test this on Pendragon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br>
<br>
- The Flurry ability for Blademasters and Mercenaries is no longer resistable. This fixes a Pendragon-only bug.<br>
<br>
- Staves are now repaired by Fletchers instead of Weaponcrafters. There was a bug where Fletchers could make staves, but not repair them.<br>
<br>
- Some spell and ability icons had the wrong &quot;widgets&quot; on them. These have been fixed. These fixes are to Pendragon-only bugs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ARMOR TABLE REDUX<br>
<br>
Based on player, tester, and Team Lead feedback, we've made some additional changes to armor tables, which specify how damage from different weapons is assessed against different armors. With these changes, you'll find that there is no one best weapon to specialize in - there is a good one that will work in most situations, but judicious use of another may result in better damage in some situations.<br>
<br>
- First and foremost, you no longer get a double defensive bonus base on your armor's resistance to an attack. You get the standard bonus, but nothing extra. This will even out the damage allotment.<br>
<br>
- Now armors are set to &quot;vulnerable&quot;, &quot;resistant&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot;. If an armor is neutral to a damage type, it will literally have no bonus or negative.<br>
<br>
- We've added specific armor tables for Norse Chain, Norse Leather, Norse Studded, and Hibernian Leather to spread out the damage options. We'll post these tables on the Camelot Herald for you to check out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPELL NOTES<br>
<br>
- All targeted spells should now properly print their damage type when Delved.<br>
<br>
- Increased radius of Healer &quot;Allay Area&quot; line to 350, which is more consistent with the radii of analogous lines in the other realms.<br>
<br>
- Fixed the Bard and Warden spec healing line's spell characteristics to match the Druid's as originally intended. This affected casting time and power cost.<br>
<br>
- Lowered casting time on the Wizard &quot;Summon Fire&quot; and &quot;Minor Combustion&quot; single target direct damage lines to make them more consistent with the casting time of analogous lines in the other realms.<br>
<br>
- Put the Wizard's Calefaction &quot;Bolt of Lava&quot; line on a separate recast timer from the Pyromancy &quot;Minor Fire Streak&quot; line.<br>
<br>
- Changed the Spiritmaster &quot;Gloom Wave&quot; line to have a casting time of 3 seconds and a range of 1500. This rounds out Midgard's ranged area effect Crowd Control capability.<br>
<br>
- Fixed the Warden pulsing bladeturn line (starting with &quot;Nature's Guard&quot;) to be castable in combat as originally intended.<br>
<br>
- Increased the run speed of Theurgist air and earth summons.<br>
<br>
- Reduced the chance of the stun proc on Theurgist air summons. The high chance of these procs going off, combined with the lack of re-cast timer, was able to chain stun targets with no hope of escaping.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES<br>
<br>
- The name regions on the cities have been adjusted.<br>
<br>
- A few horse routes have been changed so you are dropped off closer to the stable master. They are:<br>
<br>
Snowdonia Station to Caer Witrin<br>
Gna Faste to Hugginfel<br>
Adribard to Castle Sauvage<br>
Caer Ulfwych to Cornwall<br>
Tir na mBeo to Drum Ligen<br>
<br>
- Paladin trainers will now give a thrusting weapon choice when you join your guild. Armsman trainers will now give a two-handed choice when you join your guild. Infiltrator trainers will now give a thrusting choice when you join your guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Realm V. Realm - Battlegrounds: You will no longer take faction hits from monsters that are killed in the Battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
- Albion: The spiritual advisor room in Stonehenge Barrows has been revisited and slightly tweaked again.<br>
<br>
- Midgard: Tomte Runners are no longer set as Scouts in Nisse's Lair.<br>
<br>
- Hibernia: The Koalinth bouncer in Koalinth Caverns that kept walking through the wall after he finished his patrol has been fixed.<br>
<br>
- Hibernia: The rocky golems in Treibh Caillte should now react in a more consistent manner.<br>
<br>
- Midgard: The two windswept wraith camps in Jamtlands have had their spawn rate increased.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
- In Hibernia, the Mischievous Greenbriar set of armor should now have an appropriate 25% magical bonus instead of 15%.<br>
<br>
- Nightshades wishing to exchange their weaker Moonlit Leggings for a more useful pair of Leather Moonlit Leggings should speak to Blathnaid's assistant, Nona, in the Chamber of Stealth in Tir Na Nog. You may only exchange the item one time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mordred Specific Notes<br>
<br>
- There is now an alternate means to complete the Departed Fellowship Quest. Search the druid groves near Keltoi Fogou.<br>
