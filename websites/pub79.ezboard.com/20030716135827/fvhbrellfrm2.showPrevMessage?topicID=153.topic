Warning its gonna be long :P &gt;<br>
<br>
She sighed softly as she turned on her a side. A sudden flash of dull pain had her jerking up right. Rudely wrenching her from sleep. Blinking the sleep from her eyes she glanced to the wound that had so rudely awaken her. <br>
A bit stunned to see the now bandaged wound. She frowned as she poked it with a finger. So, it had not been an illusion, or dream. She was indeed mortal. A frown tugged at her brow, as anger began to well. It was simply not fair, she had done his will.. had'nt she sacrificed enough? <br>
The door to the room clicked, a lock opened. How odd, she'd been locked in. Quickly she feigned unconsciousness, to better judge her captors. <br>
From beneath long ebon lashes she noted the Teir'dal priest as he walked in. Ahh.. she was in human form. Must be why they had locked her in, till they could best ascertain what to do with her she s'posed. <br>
&quot;I dont see why we have to care for her. This foul human should be in a cell. Not laying about being waited on by us!&quot; He grumbled as he moved towards her. A second entered behind him. A faint smile could be seen on the seconds face. &quot;Tis best brother, until we find out who she is. So as not to cause undo harm to ourselves.&quot; <br>
None to gently the old dressing was removed from the wound. Fingers prodded brutally at the wound testing it for any infection. Salve was roughly slathered on as the Priest continued to grumble to himself.<br>
Meanwhile Kat's anger grew, made worse by the indignant handling of her person. The Priest found his grumbling abruptly cut off as a hand snapped out and fingers wrapped about his thin throat. He found himself pulled down, his face close to Kats. His eyes widened even further as he saw what to him was death in those dark emerald eyes. &quot;You will take your hands off me, and go find the Prophet. Or die here.. &quot;<br>
Abruptly he was flung away from her before the second Priest could even react to this. The scrambled back from her as she rose from the bed. Crouching she hissed the incantation that would begin the transformation. <br>
They had started to advance on her but quickly found themselves scrambling for the door as the human became beastial. Long red tinted claws, and even longer fangs, putting some fear into them. The door slammed and the lock clicked home. Kat chuckled softly as her body resumed the shape of the Tier'dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Should we go find the Prophet?&quot; The second hissed to the first in question. Both badly shaken by the display of power that they had never witnessed before. &quot;Bah, let the wench stew for a few days.. How dare she lay hand on a Temple Priest? I say we give her a couple of days to rethink her actions and then find the Prophet.. After all we where told he was not to be disturbed and needed his rest.&quot; They moved off down the hall, quickly forgetting about the human female held in the small room.<br>
Several days passed and Kat was growing restless. Her wound was healing nicely. To pass the time she meditated, prayed and excersized to regain her strenght. Though without nourishment soon, she'd find herself back on that bed. She paced most of the day away.. awaiting some word from Nospiratus K'Thalion or the Matron Shaede K'Thalion. <br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean she's been locked up for days? Bring her here at once!&quot; Nospiratus glared at the young priest, who quickly left his office to hurry back to the temple. Muttering softly to himself as he rose from his desk to prepare himself a drink. <br>
Why had she not returned to the alter world? Why had she allowed them to hold her locked up for so long. This would bare further investigating. Bits and pieces came to him from several days worth of dreams. Perhaps they had not been just odd ramblings of sleep. <br>
Something told him she was here to stay for some time, and would need his guidance. His protection. Breif snatches of insite gave him the knowledge that she was no longer near as powerful as she'd once been. That she would be in this world for a considerable amount of time. That somehow, she was now his responsibility. A gift? He knew in time he would learn more. <br>
A plan quickly formed in the Prophets mind. He knew what he must do. The descision made he abruptly left his office to speak breifly with Khasirath. <br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Kat swiped the silver hair from her eyes as she found herself rudely thrust into an office. The door was slammed shut behind her. She shrugged non-challantly as she surveyed her surroundings. She had been brought to the Prophets office. <br>
Gracefully she crossed the room and settled herself into a chair to wait his return. Spying a bowl of what looked to be fruit upon his desk she snatched a small round fruit and bit into its soft surface. <br>
She shuddered at the bitter tast and quickly spit the piece into her hand. Gads they actually ate this stuff? She studdied the yellow fruit, a grimace etched upon her face then glanced about. Noting the small can near a small bar she tossed the offending piece into it and resumed her seat. She'd rather starve than take another bite from that wickedly bitter fruit. <br>
<br>
Nospiratus entered his office silently. He paused a moment to study her before moving to take his seat at the desk. Silence hung heavy as their eyes met and held. Nospiratus broke the silence first.<br>
&quot;Dark eve Handmaiden. I'm suprised your still with us. Forgive the ill treatment. I didn't know till now that you where in Neriak still.&quot; She shrugged in answer but held her tongue. How much did he know she wondered. &quot;Why have you not returned?&quot; <br>
He frowned slightly as she continued to hold her tongue. &quot;I sense there's a reason you remain with us. And that you will need my help m'pet.&quot; ahh this got a reaction out of her as she shot a glare at him. &quot;How many times must I remind you Prophet, I'm no mans pet.&quot; She hissed at him, her eyes blazing. <br>
Nos chuckled softly, &quot;Tis good to see you have some spark in you Handmaiden. Now.. lets us discuss your predicament and how best I can help you.&quot; Kat settled back in her chair remaining silent. &quot;Fall from grace... &quot; Nos whispered softly.. unsure where that had come from.<br>
Nos shook his head to clear the haze and set papers before her. &quot;One way I can best protect you.. is for you to become a part of my house.. &quot; He fell silent as Kat lifted the papers to read them. &quot;Take them to Registrar of the Houses. They will take a Blood Oath when you turn them in. You will swear to uphold the laws and customs of the Empire and fealty to the Emperor in all things not directed by I.&quot; He fell silent.<br>
Kat again glanced over the paper. They where an official affidavit vouching that she was fitting of the Line, worthy of citizenship of Neriak, and listing herself as a of the House K'Thalion with todays date as her birthdate. In the fine print she read. All properties, lives and histories of House K'Thalion may be forfeit if Katarinia K'Thalion did not abide within these strictures.<br>
A faint smile tugged upon her lips as her eyes once more rose to meet his. &quot;Your.. adopting me?&quot; She chuckled softly as he seemed suddenly nervous. &quot;Do I call you.. Dad?&quot; at this he flushed. &quot;I am Patron on formal occasions.&quot; he snapped at her obviously agitated. Still chuckling softly she rolled the paper and once more sat back to watch him. <br>
&quot;There is one other way to insure your protection,&quot; He paused a moment as their eyes once more locked. &quot;I've been given permission to offer you a place in the Grange. If you accept you will need to seek out the Reaper soon. He will want to see you. You will also need to contact either Dreadlord Faeolin or Dreadlord Xareth for your quest of culling.&quot;<br>
She frowned slightly at this, &quot;Have i not proven myself worthy yet? How many more ~tests~ would you have me perform like a puppet on your strings?&quot; she glared at him, mildly offended that she should have to prove anything!.<br>
Nospiratus chuckled softly again, &quot;Tis our way Katarinia. Dont argue, just do. Things will go much more smoothly if you chose your battles wisely.&quot; Kat hmphed softly then nodded. He was right, she would do as he asked. <br>
&quot;I shall accept your offers Prophet. Both a position in your House, and a position in the Harvest. I will do my best not to bring dishonor to either your Name or this Guild.&quot; She rose then and bowed formally before him. <br>
&quot;I shall leave you now to rest some more, you look still tired from your ordeal. I shall go seek out Reaper Khasirath as you ordered.&quot; Nos nodded silently at her words. Contemplating her as she glided from the office in search of the grange and Khasirath. <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Her first stop was to the Registrar of House's office. Where the papers where signed and the Blood Oath sworn. Where she became Katarinia K'Thalion. Pondering the new name she then went looking for the Grange.<br>
It did'nt take long to find the Grange. She found a slave more than willing to point out the offices of the Reaper. Kat braced herself a moment then knocked upon the door. At his bid to enter she stepped in, &quot;I was told you wished to see me Lord Khasirath.. &quot;<br>

The Revenants that were captured had already filled the cells of the Home Guard, and the remainder were now locked within the wards of the Temple and its adjoining hostel.  Every Priest and Preistess, every Alcolyte, every Disciple and Inititate was busy tending the half-dead citizens of Neriak who had been unfortunate enough to survive the week-long plague of blood.<br>
<br>
Nospiratus had been present with High Priest Perreus, as had his mother Svana Dvinn and a variety of other high ranking clergy, when the Spires were summoned to address the Chancellor and the Council regarding what to do about the several thousand afflicted.  The Indigo Brotherhood recommended steel and fire to solve the problem, but at the urging of Nospiratus, the Spires suggested incarceration to give the scholars of the Violent Harvest time to determine if the malady could be reveresed.  The Chancellor had given them 30 days to succeed, and had directed the Brotherhood to prepare the stages of Execution in their arena should the Spires fail.  He had not clearly stated who was to be executed if failure came about.  Nospiratus shook his head.  Few things in Neriak had changed since the Blood Harvest, other than substantially more maneuvering than normal for power and position.  It seemed that the Handmaiden had visited a variety of High Houses in a most liberal fahion, and there were abundant vacancies within the bureaucracy.<br>
<br>
After the address, during which he had remained dutifully silent while Regent Perreus represented the Will of the Spires, Nospiratus went directly to the Registrar of Houses.  Tuvan S'Darik was in his office visiting with a lesser noble, apparently resolving a minor issue of pedigree.  Upon seeing Nospiratus, he cut short his conversation, and escorted the noble from his office.  The dark flush of the noble's face paled considerably when he saw the Mad Prophet of Innoruuk outside the door, and he bobbed his head once and hastily vacated the building.  Nospiratus didnt understand the effect he had upon people, but he had little time at the moment to either ponder or address the situation.  He entered the office of the Assistant Director of Pedigree, and shut the door behind him.<br>
<br>
No words were shared.  Nospiratus withdrew a bag of fire opals from one of many pockets hidden in his deep red vestments, and tossed it onto S'Darik's desk.  Hands as quick as a viper snatched it and stuffed it in a drawer, replacing it with a sealed leather scrip.  Nospiratus picked up the packet, then turned and left the room, leaving the door open behind him.  Neither man checked the contents of the packet - they knew better.  There was an honor in the bribe that was understood between the Spires and the Empire's government, and violation of that honor and its implied contracts, would have very detrimental effects upon the offender.<br>
<br>
Nospiratus forsook his afternoon visit with Katarinia, instead pacing directly to the privacy of his family's small compound in Third Gate.  Nodding absent mindedly to the K'Thalion House Guards, offered in service by his foster father, he moved directly to his private study where he once again closed himself off from the world.  Once he had settled in, pouring a small glassfull of vodka from his silver flask, he opened the sealed scrip and withdrew the papers.<br>
<br>
Everything was in order.  Nospiratus was impressed with S'Darik's work and smiled in appreciation.  Katarinia Nevermore, the papers had proven, was in fact a member of an obscure lesser House from the ancient Teir Dal estates that existed in Lesser Faydark prior to Mistmoore's total occupation of the lands around the ancient Feir Dal fortress.  Borderlings they were called, servants of the Empire still, but raised beyond the predominate culture of Neriak.  They had survived in various camps and villages across Norrath, occasionally seen still today.  Such was her heritage, and her House name had been N'Vramor.  The papers further attested that she had been adopted into House K'Thalion, certifying the date and signature.  She had done as he asked, without question and without delay.<br>
<br>
Nospiratus looked at the vodka in his glass, swirling the clear fluid and watching as it reflected the light.  He had done what was needed and covered her tracks.  The Handmaiden would be a target for revenge by the High Houses if it was known that she had been made mortal and remained within the city - even if she had served the will of the Prince of Hate.  He had protected her.  She was not the Handmaiden after all, but rather a wilder, a Borderling who came to the city of her People at the wrong time.   And now, she was taken into the House K'Thalion, which was known for adopting and absorbing the Houseless who walked within the Blessed Realm.  After fully joining the Harvest, she would be safe for now - at least as safe as he could make her.<br>
<br>
Only one question remained as he stared at her name inscribed upon the vellum in indigo ink.  Why was she here?  That question spawned another.  Why did she do as he asked?  The second question was far more troubling to him than the first.  Nospiratus drained the glass, then stared back at the empty page, his thoughts adrift, his finger tracing the beautiful lettering of the Teir Dal calligraphy that was her name.<br>
<br>
&quot;The game is afoot, Katarinia K'Thalion,&quot; he murmured quietly.  &quot;I only wish I knew what the game was and how it is played.&quot;  <br>
<br>
***                 ***                 ***<br>
<br>
*A letter for the Reaper arrived that evening at the Grange.  As he opened it the Reaper saw but one line followed by a familiar signature.*<br>
<br>
<br>
I will stand for Katarinia K'Thalion as Sponsor.<br>

&quot;Indeed, please be seated.&quot; Khasirath gestured towards the chair. &quot;No thank you, I shall stand. What is it you wished of Me?&quot; Khasirath leaned back in his chair as he studied the woman before him a moment. &quot;I had hoped to speak further with the Prophet before we spoke... &quot;<br>
Kat nodded to his words, &quot;I see, I shall return another time then.&quot; She stepped back and bowed. About to leave his next words stopped her. &quot;Seek out Dread Overlord Faeolin, or Xareth. They will hand you a test of Culling.&quot; <br>
Kat nodded to this, &quot;I've been unable to find them at this time, but I am searching for them.&quot;<br>
Khasirath nodded to her words, &quot;Most likely with your power and skills, they'll set you to planning and executing a raid upon one of our enemies.. once you have decided on a goal seek out the Thresher Daiunus to assist you. Should you need further assistance or have questions feel free to come see me again.&quot; <br>
Khasirath's brow arched as a wicked smile began to play on Kats face. The very devil seemed to dance in her eyes at his words. &quot;Indeed... I shall enjoy doing such a task.. I do hope you will be prepared when things are set in motion?&quot; The grin remained as she spoke.<br>
Khasirath smiled wolfishly at her words, &quot;Oh, I think I shall be ready.&quot; Kat laughed softly at his response, &quot;And I think you'll enjoy it.&quot; With a wink she replied.<br>
Kat stepped back and bowed once more, &quot;Now then, I've much to plan. I shall leave you to your work.&quot; Thus stated she turned away and made her way out in search of the Prophet.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukatarinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katarinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 7:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fall from grace</span><hr size=1> &lt;ooc ON&gt; see Fall from Grace in the Chronicles for a continuation of this SL.
