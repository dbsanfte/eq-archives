<br>
Of the people who arrived late/left the raid early, less than half of them contacted me (attendance person) to make sure they were in attendance.<br>
<br>
It is hard while one is fighting/talking/getting rezzed for them to see and hear everything that happens. Do not assume that because you said you were leaving in Guild chat that the attendance taker heard you. Guild chat may be off. <br>
<br>
I happened to see when somepeople said they were leaving and went ahead and marked their time down, in the future, that wont be able to happen. As you can see from this raid, 2 people got zero hours. one was from not being there long enough for points (min 2 hours) and the other cause I have no clue when they left.<br>
<br>
The new attendance rules that are in effect are thus.<br>
If you arrive late to a raid or have to leave early, you must send a tell to the attendance person to let them know. If you are not on both the /who GUILD lists, the one done right before first mob killed, and the one right after the raid is called, you will not receive points for the raid. It is too hard to keep track of 5o some people and be aq productive member of the raid.<br>
Group leaders are responsible for letting Attendance person know if a non IV person is in their group, if they arrive late, or if they leave early.<br>
<br>
The person who is making groups/raid leader (normally Morkenlar or BA for merit raids) will know who is taking attendance. Ask them who it is when you ask for a group.<br>
<br>
/tell raidleader, I am here late and need a group. Who is the attendance person?<br>
<br>
Its that easy. The less time we have to leave a roster up on the message board to verify who was where, the quicker that raid can be put into the points list. <p><a href=mailto:Dandaelus@allakhazam.com>Dandaelus Wyldheart</a>

I was in ToV from 1pm est to 8:30pm est. I know that points depend on when the raid started,etc, but I'm just curious as to how it changed to 4hrs.<br>
<br>
Hypothetically if we started at 4:30est and I left at 8:30, I would have been there 4hrs. Then I would understand why this was changed.<br>
