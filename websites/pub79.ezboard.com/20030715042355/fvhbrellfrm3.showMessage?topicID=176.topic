The Magician known as Sediyna had gone against the word of the Magician elders and tried to conjure up an air pet to carry out her will. None knew what really happened during the process, but outside her door, you could hear the screams. A shouting of words, a deep glow, coming from under the door, a fierce outburst of unknown energy racing through the air. Yuna was first to arrive on the scene; she stood outside the door, to frightened to enter what she could not understand. An explosion was heard, and then the hideous growl of a force never heard before. Yanu's eyes glazed over with a new sense of fear never experienced before. Screams from Sediyna, quickly drowned out by the noise of the monster, and silenced forever. Suddenly the door crashed open, and bits of wooden shard were wedged into Yuna's body, she lay bleeding on the floor. When the dust had settled, the monster was leering over her body. Like so many of the stories she had heard before about the demon like entities know as &quot;elementals&quot;, one now was before her. As she was told it was nothing but a torso with two arms and the bottom of the torso came to a point. The creature floated above her. It was made up of swirls of light gray and white colors, and it was transparent. Other Magicians now gathered in the hall to see what was going on, they all stood frozen in fear. It was now obvious that Sediyna had conjured up an air elemental, and this one had grabbed a sword from her room. <br>
<br>
&quot;How dare you mortals summon me from my plane among the gods.&quot; I am Gekn! The air elemental spoke with a loud booming voice, one with great anger in it. For this I shall slay each and every one of you, and destroy this place. With a swift downward stroke of its arm, the sword sliced through Yuna's stomach, exposing her internal organs for all to witness. With one last breath Yuna let out a cry. &quot;It wasn't my fault....&quot; That was the last words ever spoken by Yuna, the young innocent Magician.<br>
<br>
The audience of Magicians screamed in horror and began to flee through the guildhall. Gekn began to cast a spell, as the magicians ran. One Magician stopped, and began to yell, &quot;I can't move, I'm stunned, help me, help me.&quot; None of the other Magicians even stopped to look back, they just kept running. Gekn flew over to the Magician, raising its sword, and with one swift blow, decapitated the Magician. His bloody head fell to the ground with a splat, Gekn laughed. He soon made his way down from the 3rd floor and began cut down anyone in his way. One Magician stood his ground and castled small spells like burn, upon the creature, but Gekn was not hurt in the least. The elemental flew as fast as he could, and crashed into the Magician, knocking him over. The mage huddled in a corner, terrified of the beast lurking over him. Gekn leaned down to the mage and whispered to him. &quot;You really want to know what pain is?&quot; With those words Gekn had then sliced off the Mage's arm with one critical blow. Screams came from the young Mage, and he lay there, bleeding to death. Shouts could be heard in the distance, calling to assemble a strike team and destroy the beast. &quot;Well, it would appear your little friends are plotting to destroy me.&quot; Gekn said to the nearly unconscious Mage on the ground, who was now drenched in his own blood. Perhaps I'll go see what they are up. The young Mage looked up to see Gekn cackling to himself, and slowly disappearing, casting invisibility upon itself. The last sounds the Mage heard before he died, was the cackling of Gekn's laughter, growing more faint, as Gekn traveled further down the hall, to surprise the so called strike team.<br>
<br>
Down on the first floor, lesser Mage's were fleeing out the door, some stood ready to fight. One Mage spoke up &quot;Assemble the strike team, we need our strongest Magicians.&quot; Teltna, the strongest within the mage guild of Celenta'Ka stepped foreword and called upon his elite group. Jucala ran up to him, grabbing at his robe. &quot;Oh please, stop the beast, it’s tearing this place apart, you have to stop it!&quot; Teltna slapped jucala in the face, and his body fell to the ground. A feeling of humility came over Jucala. &quot;Stop your whining and pull yourself together, this beast will easily be dealt with.&quot; The Magician's shall overcome this war as to say with the elementals. Us and us along shall overcome them and someday turn them into our pets. This is our problem and we shall deal with it. As I say.... Another, one who could not be seen, interrupted Teltna’s voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that so.&quot; As the invisible Gekn said, floating behind Teltna. A sense of wind, a little trickle of it could be felt by the hairs on the back of Teltna's back, suddenly it appeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch out sire.&quot; Renetal said as he blasted a cinder bolt at the creature, knocking it back a few feet. Renetal looked in amazement as his strongest attack barely phased the creature. He thought to himself in his mind on what was going on. How could this creature be so powerful? Why had it not been hurt by my strongest spell? What evil power from hell has Sediyna released upon us? Who could stop this?<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, now you mortals will feel my true wrath.&quot; Gekn was enraged now, getting ready to make its charge upon the group of Magicians, the battle was about to come unde......<br>
<br>
Tenzing closed her book and book it in her backpack. &quot;That is enough reading for today.&quot; Such horrible times my ancestors lived in, I can't bare to read anymore today. Tenzing was sitting on a hill in East Commonlands listening to the auctions of her fellow adventurers. She sat observing the rich colors throughout the forest, and the shinning light around her, and it sickened her. Tenzing was now in her 12th season, and beside her floated her pet, her air elemental. &quot;Come pet, I wish to return to Neriak and rest in the safety of my dark city.&quot; &quot;As you wish master.&quot; Jobn promptly replied. &quot;Jobn.&quot; Tenzing said in an inquiring voice. You would never hurt me, would you? Jobn turned to Tenzing, and casted its spell of invisibility, fading away into the air. &quot;Never master, never....<br>
