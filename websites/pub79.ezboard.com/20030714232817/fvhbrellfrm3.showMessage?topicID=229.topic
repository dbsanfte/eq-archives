<br>
 She had tarried overlong in the Commons, and then, just as she started the descent at last, she had been startled by a faint, but haunting familiar mental call. The call had been garbled, but it's meaning was clear enough. It was a call to arms from the Obsidian Blade. <br>
<br>
She new not why they called, for since her untimely and unexplained expulsion from their ranks, no contact had she had with her former associates. The call was urgent, and tinged with overtones of fear and violence. For a brief moment, a vision, clear and sharp, of swinging blades and unleashed magics washed over her. She saw, with a growing shock of recognition, the bodies of those she had once called friends, now cruelly hewn on the floor of what she saw to be the Blade's keep. Then as quickly as it had come, the vision, and the call was gone. <br>
<br>
She stood, chewing nervously on her lip, contemplating what to do. The clarion call had been urgent, no doubt, yet little could she, but a 15th Season apprentice do against the violence unleashed against her former comrades. Besides, the quest upon which she had now embarked concerned not just the Blade, but her own future. The madness of hate that had almost overcome her, and the path to the downward spiral of her former existence were still with her, for the moment cowed, but ready to burst forth at any moment. <br>
<br>
No, though her heart had surged at the contact, and longed for the release from isolation it signified, she must eschew for the moment association with the Blade, lest it lead to her own oblivion. Anyway, she thought, there may be no Blade to return too, if the visions that had told her aright, there may be no Blade to return too. <br>
<br>
She had shut her eyes then, against the grief that unexpectedly arose within her at the though of her fallen comrades. This was not an emotion with which she felt familiar, and it threatened to overwhelm her with it's intensity. But with an effort of will, she set herself once more upon the path she had chosen, and loped off on her interrupted journey Westwards. <br>
<br>
Now Crieth stood, nervously fondling the pommel of her sword, while she searched her memories for guidance as to the way to go from here. <br>
<br>
Ahead, a narrow path led off into the deep gloom of the forest, lost all to soon in the mists that swirled around the trunks of the mighty trees. The moonlight that lit the pass behind her, seemed swallowed in the inky darkness ahead, and even her keen ultravision, gift of all the Teir 'Dal, could not penetrate all of it's depths. <br>
<br>
This path had been well trodden once, or so she remembered from younger days, when the woods were not the realm of the unquiet dead. But then had come the daughter of Innoruuk, whipping up the Teir 'Dal into a frenzy, and leading an army of eager young warriors through this woods, and on to a futile confrontation with the lightdwellers in High Pass. <br>
<br>
Too many of her kin had met a bloody end in that foolhardy escapade, and now their tortured souls walked these woods, barring to all but the most stout-hearted, or the most foolhardy, the road to the West. Though she, and many of her kind were familiar with the ways of the Undead, and used them for their own purposes, the creatures of Kithicor took no quarter, and would slay the creatures of the darkness with as little concern as for those of light. Perhaps with less, for the victims of the folly of Lanys T'Vyl had little love for their living brethren, and hated their freedom to walk as they woulds't through the lands of Norrath. <br>
<br>
To her right, the encircling hills stretched off to the North, like a line of moor-clad senturies keeps guard over the denizens of the forest. That way was easier, for sure, but far longer, and the creatures of the dark would surely keep some guard over that way. <br>
<br>
Her contemplations were shattered by demonic laughter that burst from the gloom down the path. Not waiting to confront the owner of that fell voice, Crieth set off at a pace along the longer road, and hoped that her choice would go well, not ill. <br>
<br>
A change in the pitch of the laughter let her know that the vile creatures had caught her scent, and she redoubled her pace. Hooting cries of derision from the gloom ahead letting her know that no escape was to be had that way. <br>
<br>
Unsheathing her blade, and cursing herself for not retrieving her arms from her last demise, she steeled herself for the futile battle to come. Out of the darkness loomed not one but three Skeleton Lieutenants, armed each with halberd and clad in scraps of raw hide. <br>
<br>
Whirling like a cat, she swung the heavy two-handed blade in a vicious arc, sliding through the guard of the nearest enemy and biting into it's pelvis like an axe into wood. Bone and marrow sprayed from the gash in a wide arc, but it's pace, and menace seemed undiminished. <br>
<br>
Barely recovering her balance, she had scant time to raise her blade to check a deathly blow from the next attacker and though she did, she could not evade the bony fist which rose to strike her exposed head. Her vision spun for a moment as it jarred her skull, and her mouth filled with warm salty evidence of the damage the blow had done to her cheek. <br>
<br>
Striking and parrying again and again, the tiring Crieth new that the battle was already lost, and wondered why the killing blow would not fall. <br>
<br>
Through her weakening guard, a scything halberd came, biting into the ebon flesh of her shoulder like a mighty steel fireband, spraying blood and gristle into the air, tearing a terrible rent into the flesh, even to the bone. Bereft of support, her sword fell from the now useless arm, and she slumped in mind-numbing agony to the forest floor. <br>
<br>
Yet the releasing death blow would not come as her antagonists drew their defeated prey up to a stand. Turning their bony visages towards the trees, they hooted evil calls in her own tongue. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come my lord, see what we have caught thee&quot;. &quot;Come and see.&quot; &quot;Come and play&quot;. <br>
<br>
Lifting her head with what little strength remained, Crieth stared through misty vision at the approaching figure. A mighty Teir 'Dal stood now before her, garbed in the decaying remnants of what was clearly once the livery of a noble house. Once a mighty Commander in Lanys T'Vyls army, now risen in fear and wrath and hatred - the figure was more skeleton the dark elf now. Decaying strips of what was once taut black flesh now clung to rotting muscle and bone, and a gagging reek of putrefaction oozed from every pore.<br>
<br>
In the orbless sockets of its undead eyes the fierce fires of Hell burned, and from its leering mouth screeched words of death, and hatred, and vengeance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh the taste of a Teir 'Dal maiden, come to me at last for my sport alone.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I shall feast on the warmth of thy flesh slowly, my pretty one&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;You shall beg me to slay thee long before I have consumed thee to the last&quot;. <br>
<br>
The cruel digits pinioning her arms gripped tighter and fresh waves of pain from her shoulder washed over her, but refusing to allow her the blessed peace of unconsciousness. Tighter and tighter her captors gripped, bony digits penetrating the flesh of her wrists like tiny teeth, stopping all movement. Her nemesis stepped forward, arms spread to receive her like a welcoming lover, eyes full of an unearthly lust and hatred. <br>
<br>
Try as she could, Crieth knew that she would never truly expunge what was to follow from her memory. The indescribable sensation as the Undead Lord lowered the lipless slit of his mouth to her breast, his putrid tongue like some vile reptile lapping at the carmine flows of her life essence from the wound above. The excruciating pain as it moved up and probed the wound itself, parting the torn flesh and sinew, lapping inside like a thirsty beast at a waterhole. <br>
<br>
Always her dreams would be tormented by the lecherous mad jeering of his undead minions as they held her helpless form, urging their lord to leave the choicest morsels for their own feasting. <br>
<br>
As she felt at last the ridges of the Commander's teeth take hold of her flesh and begin to consume, the jeering faltered, and turned to alarm. <br>
<br>
Corruscating swirls of light now filled her dimming vision, and stunning blasts of fire and frost and lightning filled the air around her. Through a fog filled with the stench of ozone and pieces of corpses, dim figures could she see, in robes and mail. Deprived of its vicious supports, her body slumped at last to the mossy ground, and into sweet oblivion. <br>
<br>
Crieth heard, and felt, no more. <br>
<br>
Crieth. <br>
The darker side of the Dead<br>
<br>
