Heedless of the noise she was making she continured on.  She knew that in another  hour she would reach the edge of the forest and enter the Lavastorm Mountains.  Another day after that she would reach the druid ring, errected by the ancients in hommage to the Mother of All and the Rainkeeper.<br>
<br>
The elf kept her thoughts on her destination in an effort to drive all else from her mind, but her memories always returned to the darkness of Neriak, the gathering of Innoruuk's faithful that she had attended two nights before.  Her fists clenched as she thought of that meeting, and of being dismissed from it.  As the thought of the Violent Harvest swept through her mind she snarled unconsiously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn them,&quot; she growled to herself, &quot;and damn that black-skinned bitch Creapiing to the darkest corner of the Abyss!&quot;<br>
<br>
As she made her way through the twilight forest, the elf replayed the events that had led her here in her mind.  Over and over the images played, and every time the drow scowled a little more fiercely.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kassy had left all she owned with the exception of a few spell components and the clothes on her back and made the journey from Qeynos to Neriak to meet with the Harvest.  They had something she needed: Knowlage of Innoruuk.  She had gone at the risk not only of losing all she loved, but of losing her very life as well, and she had been accepted into the dark family.  Let them think that she had come to embrace Hate, she knew that her heart yet rested with Tunare.  She said as much to them, repeatedly, yet they were blinded by darkness and heard only what they wished to hear in her words.  She didnt care, she would learn what she needed to.<br>
<br>
All that had changed when she had refused to kneel before an unholy alter in a place sacred to Innoruuk.  Kassy had stood her ground, lowering her eyes in respect as her mother and father had taught her when she was toddler, but no more. The Reaper had commanded her to fall to her knees before the sacred statue, and she refused.  Enraged, the Reaper had challenged the enchantress to single combat.  Kassy refused, saying that she had come to learn, not to fight.  She tried to explain that she would not, could not, kneel before an idol of the Prince of Hate, that she was not disrespectful and ment no sacrelige but could not do so and remain true to her own faith.  When she refused to kneel a second time, the Reaper had announced that she was anathema, banished her from Neriak, stripping her of all guild affiliation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Without noticing, Kassy had come nearly to the narrow pass that led to the Lavastorm mountains.  Only when the temperature began to rise noticably did she come out of her memories and look about her;  she was nearly to the mountains.  Ahead lay the last few stands of trees, withered from the heat, and she made her way toward them quickly, wanting nothing more than to be away from the accursed forest.<br>
<br>
With a final glare over her shoulder toward the dark city, the enchantress turned to step toward the mountains... and couldnt move.  Mocking laughter echoed through her mind.  Terrifying laughter.  His laughter.  Kassy felt herself slipping into unconsiousness and fought against it, but the world was quickly fading from her sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;You cannot escape me little elf.  You have been chosen.  Accept your fate, my Daughter...&quot; the words flowed like blackened, unholy water through her mind.<br>
<br>
As she lost consiousness and fell to the forest floor the dark elf gave no fighting words, no challenges.  She only reached for the medallian of Tunare that hung about her neck and whispered a prayer of a single word.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother...&quot;<br>
<br>
*   *   *   *   *<br>
<br>
Kassy awoke sometime later as a soft rain dripped through the canopy of trees above.  She sat and brought her fingers to her brow, wiping her silver bangs away from her eyes.  The elf tried hard to remember what had happened, to walk in waking memory the steps she had taken in black unconsiousness, but found she could only grasp the image of wisps of gray, a fog that hid something far darker within it...<br>
<br>
Rising, the enchantress lifted her small pack.  I must get away from this place of Darkness, she thought to herself as she headed once again for the edge of the forest only a  hundred yards away.  Without looking back, she left Nektulos Forest behind her.<br>
<br>
*   *   *   *   *<br>
<br>
When the storm over the forest finally ended, all was still in the dark wood.  Neither animal nor insect moved about.  The only sound to be heard was the dripping of water as the trees shed their weight.  Weak beams of sunlight permiated their way down to the forest floor here and there, and one of these landed upon something that reflected the light back toward the covered sky.  Slowly, though the sunlight never changed, the reflection became fainter, as though the luster of the object was fading, until no more light shone off of it than would be reflected from an unformed mass of cold lead.<br>
<br>
The medallian of Tunare's Light faded completely, and the forgotten charm lay unnoticed among the dead leaves of seasons past.  Somewhere far away, the Prince of Hate's cold laughter echoed darkly.<br>
<br>
<br>

That morning they had come across a caravan of merchants traveling from Highpass Hold down the long road to Qeynos, City of Men.  The caravan was only lightly guarded, men fore and aft with crossbows and short swords, and a shining long sword across the knees of the merchant leading the company.<br>
<br>
They had fallen quickly before the nine trained bandits, and all the men had been slain.  Only one remaind alive of the caravan, and a far worse fate than death awaited the merchant’s daughter.<br>
<br>
As the moon rose, Jareden, a large human and leader of this circle of bandits rose from his seat at the fire and walked toward the bound and gagged girl.  He grinned down at her with rotten teeth and said it was high time the band sample her father’s wares.   Roars of laughter came from the assembled group of highwaymen but stopped suddenly as an explosion of light blinded them.  When they could see again Jareden was no more than a corpse, a large dagger cruely twisted in his gut.  Above him stood a single Tier’Dal.  The camp broke into chaos.<br>
<br>
A pair of half-elven females began to chant and roots sprang from the earth, grasping for the Tier’Dal’s feet, but she deftly avoided them spinning to the left.  Coming to a stop she raised her hands, chanting softly and the two half-elves fell silent and stood mesmerized.  Three down, six to go.<br>
<br>
A large barbarian came at her with a long curved sword but he had drunk too much and she easily dodged his attack and, speaking a word, called fourth dazzling colored lights.  The dark elf passed him, touching his temples with slender inky fingers and sent his mind sliding into chaos.  As he fell she caught the sword from limp fingers and spun around to face his companions just as the colors faded from the night air.<br>
<br>
The scimitar was heavy in her hand, but the balance was good and felt familiar.  She’d not wielded such a weapon in months, perhaps a year, but her childhood training had not left her when she had been cursed by the Father of Hate.  All wilder elves were trained in the use of such weapons from the day they could lift the dulled practice blades, and this elf was no exception.  <br>
<br>
The blade twisted in the air before her faster and faster as she summoned the swiftness of the wind into her swings.  Block.  Swing.  Parry.  Counter.  Remembered lessons came into her mind, Hartwood Master’s voice clear in her thoughts as she fought them.  She blocked the dagger of a human female and fell back a step calling the earth to aid her with roots to hold this oponent and the earth answered the call.  Trapped by the roots the bandit threw down her knife and held her arms wide in surrender.  The drow only sneered and spoke a word, melting the unfortunant human’s mind as her sword’s keen edge slid between her ribs.  Five remaining.<br>
<br>
One she rooted as she had done the dagger-wielding female, and left to suffocate by magic, another she dazzled with the colored lights before turning again to the troublesome pair of half-elven casters.  She smiled darkly at them as she drained them of their mental energies and still they just stood with unseeing eyes.  Her own strength returned by the spell she walked away from the three remaining bandits.  This had gone on long enough.<br>
<br>
The Tier’Dal stood on the outter rim of the firelight and closed her eyes.  When she had called fourth the spell that would end this little game she looked up, saphire eyes glinting with deadly light.  She pointed at the three with her scimitar and spoke a long string of words in the spidery language of Norrathian magic.   All three of the bandits returned to reality as they were thrown far into the air and screamed and they made the long decent back to the rocky ground.  A few seconds later the lone elf stood smiling darkly in utter silence.  The battle had lasted less than five minutes.<br>
<br>
The drow turned then, and stalked over to where the merchant’s daughter was tied.  Terrified, the girl shrank away from the dangerous elf as she approached but had no where to go.  Firelight sparkled on steel as the scimitar flashed out, cutting the bonds on the girls wrists and ankles with speed born of the wind then dropped to the ground at the girl’s feet.  Immediatly the girl backed away toward the fire and pulled the gag from her mouth but the dark elf did not advance.  Instead she stepped slowly backward into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Overcoming her fear the merchant’s daughter called out after the disappearing figure, “Who... who are you?”<br>
<br>
From the dark of night came the answer, “I was once called Lightborn...”  Then there was silence.  The Tier’Dal was gone.<br>

Somehow the illusionist managed to keep on her feet despite being on the holy ground.  The source of the strength to resist the urge could only be hate.  Only hate was strong enough to withstand the urge to kneel.  Creapiing could see Kassy's legs trembling with the effort.  The one who knows nothing was here to learn their ways and the path of Innoruuk , --so be it.<br>
<br>
I strip you of all afiliation with the Violent Harvest, I hereby declare you anathema!<br>
<br>
The path of hate is best discovered alone.  The path of hate is not learned or observed.  The hate in this one runs very strong.  Let her discover hate and her true power alone.<br>
<br>
The ceremonies concluded. Kassy gone from Neriak.  Creapiing sends a few messages out by dark messengers.  A few *situations* might help the one who knew nothing learn hate.  Creapiiing nodded  in satisfaction.  There was always hope Kassy would learn something...hate...and power... <p>Creapiing V'Etch<BR>
