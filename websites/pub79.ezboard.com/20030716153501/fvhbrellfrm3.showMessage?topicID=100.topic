&quot;I'll be first,&quot; she wept...<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;And thusly the Innate one ran from the stocks of Holy Aramus and into the Darkness CAST his mighty wand! All was gone with the will of his mighty deed! The Tier'Dal turned GOOD would be the final salvation of our people in that day! IT will EVER be the GREAT MOTHER TUNARE who is our REAL Goddess! WE being made of the FLESH of her KIND and PERVERTED into the unholy FECES we seem to be now by the IGNOBLE hand of DISCUSTING Innoruuk!&quot; The preacher wailed to a congregation of tier'dal. <br>
<br>
Karana's plains. They are wide and open. The wars fought here would provide no cover, in a clear day you could see straight from High Hold to Qeynos. But clear days were rare, and staying hidden seemed easier in the plains than even the forests of Feerrott. <br>
<br>
Xosha stood some hundred yards back. There seemed about twenty of them, they stood together watching a man screaming over the torrential rain. This preachy one stood on a cart and flung his arms about wildly. Sprays of water flying from his disjointed limbs and falling to the crowd. Though they had thier back to Xosha, she could just see the exaltant faces turned to the rain. Eyes closed and mouth open, drinking in the refreshment. Xosha walked twords them. <br>
<br>
&quot;I used to HATE! I used to unquestioningly follow the will of the FATHER,&quot; the priest spit the word out, saliva falling to the ground and being lost in the flood-like rain in moments. His words seemed to follow, flowing right out of his mouth and washing into the crowd like water. They bathed in it, and swayed in exstatic jubilation. As he preached she would hear them occasionally hoot and chant back blaspheny like &quot;PRAISE the mother!&quot; &quot;KARANA is the SAVIOR!&quot; <br>
<br>
Xosha walked to the very edge of the cluster and listened. They were dressed as peasents and seemed to have been walking for months. Cloths made of burlap, all belongings in leather backpacks sitting at the feet of every pilgrim. Xosha stood behind them all, beautiful battlemail and daggers held in display. <br>
<br>
As the congregations shouted and gyrated, eyes closed and rubbing rainwater over thier bodies, the priest turned his face down and looked to the crowd. He settled upon Xosha. <br>
<br>
His blue eys were ignorant, she thought. The held each other in check for a moment, the priest ceased to chant, though his order was too far gone to follow, the continued thier revelry. Finally, Xosha saw and idea creap across the back of the preachers neck, over his face as his eyes took a piercing look, and into his brain as he began to grin widely. Eventually, eyes still holing eachother, water matting Xosha's hair to her face, rain water pounding the earth in thuds, eventually, he spoke again. <br>
<br>
&quot;MY PEOPLE! THERE IS EVEN NOW A SINNER AMONGST YOU!&quot; the people assembled kept thier eyes closed but seemed to wail differently, as if in desperation, or pain and fear. &quot;Look now at what you once were!&quot; <br>
<br>
Xosha sheathed her weapons, and put her hands on her hips, he face held a crooked smile, and her eyes dared the man to continue. He did, without fear. <br>
<br>
&quot;See the HORROR you once were! SEE the PAIN she is in! How can such a BEAUTIFUL woman know of life! HOW SHE MUST SUFFER SO! I pity the woman for not knowing the WRONG of her ways! I PITY HER!&quot; the crowded awakened in a fashion, that is to say, fell enough out of thier trance to turn, wooden faced, and stare at her. Xosha walked forward slowly. <br>
<br>
&quot;WE have been SAVED dark one! I ONCE KILLED! AS you do now! I once had NO WILL of my own! I was a creature of DARKNESS!&quot; the priest had stopped looking at her now and started the thrust his open palms twords her with every exclamation. Perhaps he thought to drive the evil from her heart. &quot;I SUFFERED! I was LONELY! The FATHER knew no PEACE or LOVE for me! But then, as I was commanded to kill yet again, a WOOD ELF BROTHER looked into my eys as he died! HE SAID NOTHING! But his eyes held FORGIVENESS! AND IN THAT MOMENT I WEPT FOR FORGIVENESS!&quot; the preacher started to weep. <br>
<br>
&quot;I ONCE was an EVIL man! I was a KILLER! AND then I saw the BEAUTY of TUNARE! I FELT the HEALING cold RAIN of KARANA wash my sins! AND I WEPT AND WEPT FOR A THOUSAND DAYS!&quot; <br>
<br>
The crowd looked at Xosha with pity. She studied them all, one at a time. She logged thier faces in her mind. That one, a scar on the cheek, THAT one, missing an eye. Some twenty of them, she memorized, all the while thier leader thrusting himself at her, and chanting his prayers louder and louder. When Xosha had put them all in her mind, she walked forward, through the thick curtains of cold grey rain, to the cart upon which stood the chanting man. <br>
<br>
&quot;DO YOU WISH TO BE HEALED! I HAVE SEEN THE PATH, I CAN SAVE YOU!&quot; Xosha put on a submissive face an nodded. The preacher shrieked in triumphant jubilation. &quot;THEN KNEEL my child! KNEEL AND RECEIVE YOUR CLEANSING!&quot; Xosha calmly dropped to one knee and bowed her head. The preacher turned his face to the crowd and began some sort of invocation. Xosha turned her face slowly to the crowd. The rain fell harder, the din of it echoing in the ears of the now silent crowd. The saw Xosha's slow smile, the saw her hand move slowly to her dagger. <br>
<br>
The preacher coughed in shock at first, then stumbled back and grabbed an his stomach where now Xosha's dagger resided. Her hand still gripping, Xosha twisted and stood. The man coughed, blood coming to his lips and spilling over his chin, he looked at her, scared and began to cry. &quot;No... please.... please don't...&quot; The blood washed from his face in the rain, and fell diluded and invisible to the wooden cart. Xosha grabbed the back of her head with her free hand firmly. She pulled his face to hers to that thier noses brushed and whispered, &quot;you are saved.&quot; <br>
<br>
Then suddenly and angrily, she kissed him, tasting the blood of his death flow into her anxious mouth. The preacher wept, the blood fell from both thier mouths, it seemed impossible to tell from who it came. <br>
<br>
As she withdrew her dagger, she pulled her mouth away and released his head. He fell, near death, clutching at his wounds and weaping. Xosha turned to the crowd, mouth reds, eyes alive, and pointed her dagger at the crowd. <br>
<br>
&quot;I shall be your salvation, who is next?&quot; <br>
<br>
The Tier'Dal looked at eachother. Somehow overcome with shame and remorse. Some were in shock, others covered thier faces with thier hands. Xosha heard one utter to the person next to them... &quot;what have we done?&quot; <br>
<br>
A beautiful young woman stepped forward first and raised her hand. &quot;I repent, may the Father forgive me. I will be first...&quot; <br>
<br>
Xosha killed many that day...   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=100.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=100.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate<option value="vhbrellfrm19">Hate's Culling Guild</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
