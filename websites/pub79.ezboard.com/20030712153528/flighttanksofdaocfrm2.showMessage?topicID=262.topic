Cut and pasted from the other topic..<br>
<br>
&quot;Dirty Tricks - Now this is a change worthy of a Mercenary. Procs almost all the time (since that resist bug whent away), can get multiple targets and the effects make a hefty difference. A real &quot;Get out of trouble&quot; card every 7 minutes. With this, I can actually stand a chance with buffed stealthers. Throw in IP/Purge, and the battle is mine. Over all, great change. The best thing out of the patch for mercenarys, and maybe the whole intire thing. The only problem right now, is the lack of information. When it goes off, it makes a wind-spell noise. Because there's often tons of other noises, i can't hear if it goes off or not. A message saying he was effected (even when you effect him over and over again) would help a bunch in determining weather I should hit someone else or stay here. I don't really see any more 'needed' changes to this ability, but it's always nice to add things to it (maybe cause damage output to be lowered when using aswell as its current ability. Throwing dirt in their eyes would make it tougher to hit us, and when you do hit, it won't hurt as much since you can't really see what or who you're hitting. Though this isn't a nessessary change, it isn't overpowered and gives us a slightly better edge. I'v also never liked the idea that our &quot;key&quot; ability was based on defense. Something that can be real usefull is based on defense for an offensive person. With the damage reduction, I know that I get some effect out of it, and not a chance-effect).&quot;<br>
<br>
Great change. I'm glad I can finally rely on it now. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

New changes made it overall better than before so it's now in my quickbar.<br>
<br>
Timer 7 minutes. This is the greatest change means i can almost always use it in a fight.<br>
<br>
The duration is however a bit low and while it's an amazing ability one on one it does little against multiple opponents unless you attack one after the other. It also is resisted prety often.<br>
<br>
Overall im happy about the changes but it still has isues. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nalfen Silverblade</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

<br>
Old Dirt:<br>
With the old dirty tricks, you would throw your dirt on 1 attacker (pray it stuck) and attack a 2nd attacker. This meant that even if the 1st attacker got behind you, he would fumble. The overall objective was to deal with 1 attacker at a time. When dirt stuck it worked very well. Problem was that it was purgable and was resisted alot. The 30 minute timer was awful too. This could also be done at range so you could pick your targets as you charged.<br>
<br>
New Dirt:<br>
<br>
The new dirt works on 2 different factors, having the dirt proc on the enemy and then the enemies chance of fumbling being 35%.  Also the dirt only lasts for 10 seconds so you have to keep on hitting the enemy to reapply it. On 1 vs 1's this works well as they can't really purge it and if its resisted once, then chances are they will fumble the next time.  The new timer is better too. The problem now is that it doesn't work well in taking 1 attacker out of the equation. You constantly have to keep switching attackers to reapply the dirt. This makes fighting very messy since F8 doesn't always work with many enemies around and targeting people that layer is hard (e.g. 2 lurikeens on top of each other). Its no longer a fire and forget kind of fighting.  Its almost impossible to tell who has the effect as well as the dirt wind sound will go off even if the person resists. <br>
<br>
Edit: Forgot 1 thing.  DW only works on melee. Triple Wield and Veno work on all classes. DW should work in some kind of fashion for casters.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fester@lighttanksofdaoc>Fester</A> at: 6/23/03 6:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=uhno>uhno</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.grumbled.com/images/paradoxicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#000000>(6/23/03 4:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dirty tricks change</span><hr size=1> As mentioned already.<br>
7 minute timer - much better (finally has made my hotbar too)<br>
It is resisted quite often.<br>
I have to apply the dirt to my sword and poke my enemy in the eye with it makes little sense.<br>
It's ten seconds and 35% chance and makes it more then likely 1 fumble if you are lucky per attacker if it isn't resisted. I think I'd rather it be thrown like before at one attacker but maybe that's just me.<br>

I feel that the new Tricks has more potential, but more room to fail as well, resists, dice going against you, etc.  My main gripe with DT is that to do its potential, you have to be a mez breaker: not like before where you could just &quot;fire and forget&quot; and &quot;ghetto mez&quot; a melee or an archer.<br>
<br>
The other gripe I guess is that it has no effect on casters; but this is kind of an ignorant statement because if you're hitting a caster with dirty tricks, you're already in melee range and interrupting them (and hopefully killing them).  But it doesn't really give any advantage to use against a caster, whereas TW and Zerk will be more effective against casters.  And of course, if a caster, especially a PBAOE or lifetapper, pops MOC, then well...<br>
<br>
In 1v1 versus archers or melees, however, it's wonderful: it works, it also has a &quot;placebo effect&quot; of raising defense, can't be effectively purged since we attack so quickly, and it will defeinately give the advatage, especially against a slow attacker... one fumble on a 5s attacker is 10s of free damage, and we can do a lot in 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
All in all, I like the changes, especially the timer change.  It helps in both PvP and in PvE, with a less effect in RVR unless you're fighting like a dervish and hitting everyone, then if dice go your way, you've just taken 10 seconds of damage away from quite a number of attackers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#000000>(6/23/03 9:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dirty tricks change</span><hr size=1> It's definately an improvement over the old dirty tricks based on it's timer, making it more available, more potential use.<br>
<br>
At the same time compared to frenzy or triple wield it's also much less effective (due to it being a defensive vs MELEE ability) in RvR. <br>
<br>
Dirty tricks is useless vs casters and doesn't help you kill anyone any faster. Frenzy and triple wield work vs all and in all RvR scenarios, helping you do damage faster.<br>
They also work 100% of the time, no 35% chance to proc, from the first hit. And triple wield also confers a defensive melee ability (immune to crits).<br>
<br>
I think they should consider either giving dirty tricks an offensive use OR lengthen the duration to make up for it being a totally defensive ability OR make it also effective vs casters (one idea would be disrupting mastery of concentration just like shield attacks etc) OR make it also a reverse proc so anyone hitting the merc has a chance to fumble at a reduced rate. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A> at: 6/23/03 9:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwerraldarkmorn>Gwerral Darkmorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#000000>(6/23/03 9:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dirty tricks change</span><hr size=1> Overall, I like the changes to dirt.

TW has a dual effect in the fact they can not be critted and they get a self stacking DA.<br>
Why can't dirt for a merc increase magic resists by 25% or something for the 30 seconds.<br>

<br>
TW - Stackable Damage Add &amp; Immunity to Melee Crits (both offensive &amp; defensive bonus, especially against Beserkers and people with high crit rate)<br>
<br>
DT - Increased Fumbles (&quot;aggressively defensive&quot;, since we have to be attacking something to have it work.  defensive bonus doesn't directly effect us, it's projected defense on our target's target)<br>
<br>
Frenzy - 100% Crits, 0 Defense (potentional for most offensive, with defense negation for all that attack)<br>
<br>
Kind of a raw deal, really.  Everything is in the right spirit, but things have become out of balance.  Granted DT can negate a person's offensive bonus (see Berserkers), but really when you think about it, it's really only geared for fast attackers, sure it's devasting on a Pole/Spear/2 handed attacker if they do fumble, but if they don't, well, it's completely useless.  At least TW still has the passive bonus if they miss, get stunned, etc.  If a Zerk or Merc gets stunned/rooted while using their abilities, that's it, no effect, and in the Berserker's case, they're worse off.<br>
<br>
I do like that DT isn't Purgeable now, that perhaps is the best change outside of the timer.  But I think that the effect could use some tweaking... how about this.<br>
<br>
What if DT gave a Mercenary a passive chance to force a fumble to any attacker (maybe within block radius), and gave our attacks a small, stackable bleed component or perhaps a small debuff?  As if as a reaction, the Mercenary was able to counter attack with dirt in the eyes, and our low blows hit sensitive areas of our enemies.<br>
<br>
However, if they make this change, or a change like it, then it's only fair that Berserkers have Frenzy changed: remove the defensive penalty, and even add in an absorbtion bonus, maybe with a absorbtion penalty cooldown.<br>
<br>

<br>
By killing a target faster you are reducing the damage you take in most situations and eliminating your target by the same token.<br>
<br>
Dirty tricks is a means to reduce the damage but it doesn't work in all situations and further more it doesn't eliminate your opponent. Making it significantly weaker.<br>
<br>
Triple wield is more consistant but doesn't have the same potential for damage as frenzy. But in return it protects you from critical hits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=locnor>LocNor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#000000>(6/30/03 8:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dirty tricks change</span><hr size=1> Going with the 'effecting caster' idea, how about a fumble/nearsight effect.
