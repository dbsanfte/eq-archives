The city was located between the humid and dark Misty Thicket, and the dangerous and deadly Kithilcor Forest. It was a haven of light and love, if not a little mischief, between Goblin menace and Undead horror. The light of the day slowly receded behind the surrounding mountains, which provided the protection and security that the city so desperately relied upon by the diminutive race. Halfling Grandma’s began to set out the food on the many tables of Riverdale, while Halfling Grandpa’s finished their pipes and called the children into dinner. Mothers and Fathers came to the doors of their small dome shaped huts and watched their children finish their games of “Goblin Hunt” or “ Catch the Will o’ wisps”. The “Goblins” being designated children with mud smeared on their faces, and the “Will o’ wisps” being fireflies. The scent of fresh baked bread, sweet berry pies and herb roasted trout mixed with the aroma of newly tapped stout, and both wafted lightly through the cities peaceful avenues. The quiet sounds of merchants closing up their shops could be heard, along with cheerful chorus of “G’nights” and ‘Softdreams”, being exchanged by friends and strangers alike. There were smiles and waves, even to the few High, Wood or Half Elven wanderers, that had come to enjoy the hospitality of their Halfling hosts. It had been a good spring, the crops where all planted, and many sproutings had begun to show themselves through the rich, well tended soil of the scatted small farms. All was well and happy in the city of Rivervale, as the Bouncers and Deputies took their posts for what would certainly be another peaceful and quiet night of duty.     <br>
<br>
As Deputy Banto nodded goodnight to Merchant Teelie Meegles, he was taken aback by the sudden look of surprise, and then horror upon her face. He barley had time to register it, before his head fell from his body with a wet sounding splat upon the ground. What Teelie saw, was a shadow behind Banto suddenly come to life, and take the form of a Teir’dal Dark Knight. Before she could utter a sound, the female Dark Elf had completed her stroke. Seething in rage and fury Teelie, who had been an experienced Warrior before retiring to Rivervale, grabbed at a nearby club and charged the Shadow Knight. But, laughing in a gleeful and contemptuous voice, the Teir’dal took a step back and disappeared into the shadows again. As Teelie stood above the corpse of her dear friend, her mind barely had time to grasp what had just happened, when she was suddenly aware of a sound she had not heard in a very, very long time…the sound of the city alarm. On the other side of Riverdale, near the entrance of Misty Thicket, did the Children of Neriak assemble for vengeance. For too long the troops of the Nektulos Legion had gone unavenged for attacks upon them. Now, as Kelethin had recently, so now would Riverdale pay for it’s crimes against the Respected Race. <br>
<br>
Standing at the tunnel to Misty Thicket was the Knight of Innoruuk, hate burning in her eyes, and a grim smile of anticipation upon her lips. She was clad in dark armor, and it was her who had so skillfully dispatched Deputy Banto. Next to her was a female Necromancer, her eyes seemingly dead, with cold and despair emanating from her person. A Cleric of the Dark Father stood by, straining against some unseen force, occasionally shouting out an incoherent word to ones that only he could see. But still, cruel determination was etched upon his ancient and scarred face. Behind them, stood two Teir’dal Wizards, contempt and distain in their eyes, an aura of fearful arcane power surrounding them. Upon the chest or robes of each was an emblem that had become known and feared, even more so then the legendary Obsidian Blade, so long now extinct. It was the symbol of the Violent Harvest. Within the huts of the Halflings themselves, sudden screams of terror and fear were cut short with a gurgling shriek. Then, a moment later, the fleeting shadow of an Assassin was momentarily glimpsed. To fast and well hidden to be actually seen, it passed  through the now dead family’s doorway, and headed in the direction of yet another hut.<br>
<br>
So it went, that night of vengeance and death. The small group of Teir’dal stood and battled the forces of Rivervale, neither side giving or accepting quarter. On and on it went, Deputies Dopkin and Hiltop, Antana and Rollin, and so very many of their Militia,  all fell to the power of the Teir’dal attackers. The Dark Knight faced them in grim silence, only laughing when one of their hacked bodies fell to the bloody ground. The Cleric infusing her with Unholy strength and healing energies. The defenders ravaged by excruciatingly painful spells of rot and disease, doomed by the beautiful but merciless Necromancer. The look of surprise and confusion upon their faces, as the Assassin would suddenly “appear” behind an opponent of the Dark Knight, delivering the killing blow, only to vanish before the corpse had expelled it’s last breath. All the while, the two Arcanists of evil, casting their fey spells of destruction and despair, even managing to set the fields and farms afire, destroying the crops therein. Finally, just before the dawn broke upon the horizon, did the dark “guests” take their leave of the little hamlet. In a sudden flash of purplish/black light, all but one of the Teir’dal departed. Having sated their lust for blood…for the present. The one who remained was a Wizard, old and disdainful, no light of fatigue or fear upon his statue like visage. Throwing a bundle upon the ground before the exhausted and grieving survivors he said simply, “Behold, the Violent Harvest has come to reap justice against those who dare raise a hand against the Empire. You are not the first, nor shall you be the last, little furry mutants, to feel the power of Hate, and the displeasure of the Respected Race”. With that he cast a spell, and was gone into the first rays of the sun.<br>
<br>
Inside the bag, much to the anguish and horror of the battered and abused residents of Rivervale, were 50 right Halfling hands. Each group of 10 were bound with a cord and fastened with a small badge. The older adventurers of the city recognized the badges as emblems of various Houses of the Neriak Nobility. They knew them as belonging to the guards of Nektulos. 10 hands for each emblem, 10 Halfling lives for each Teir’dal guard killed in Nektulos. Weeping in sorrow and pain for the dead, and the survivors as well, the assembled group of Halflings and their Half-Elven friends cried at the carnage. Then they remembered the Dark Wizard’s words about “…not being the last”, and turned a worried eye towards the single High Elven adventurer in their midst. First Kelethin, now Rivervale, the next target was obvious. The High Elf, in turn, turned and faced toward the direction of his home of Felwithe, and whispered a quiet prayer to Tunare for protection. But, his words were lost in the wailings and cries of the dead and dying of Rivervale…     <br>
