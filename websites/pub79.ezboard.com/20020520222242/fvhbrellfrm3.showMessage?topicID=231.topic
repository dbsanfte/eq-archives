The battle had begun with a surprise attack by the forces of the Damned, led by the Spawn Mythral. Mythral was born of the traitor House Mistmoore, banished in ages past for it’s crimes against the Empire. House Mistmoore had once been one of the founding Houses of the Empire. It had grown strong during the accession of the Respected Race, and amassed a powerful army of it’s own. But, as was sometimes the nature of the Teir’dal, lust for power overrode obligations of duty and honor. One could not really blame House Mistmoore, after all, if they had won they would be the rulers of the Empire. The Dark Father Innoruuk was more concerned with those in power doing his bidding, more then who was actually in power. Such is the way of the Children of Neriak, the strong take power because they can. Most other considerations can be settled or worked out later, after the blood has dried. But, whether due to bad luck or poor planning, House Mistmoore failed in it’s bid for supremacy, fell from power, was labeled traitorous, and banished from the Empire. Only the confusion and destruction that followed the civil war that Mistmoore had started so long ago prevented the entire line from being tracked down and exterminated. For many millennia, House Mistmoore had all but been forgotten. Then, slowly at first but growing in time, the power of Mistmoore was once again established. Many rumors were spoken about how this came about. About how Mayoung Mistmoore was able to capture and occupy a Koada’dal castle in far off Faydwer. About how the Line enslaved it’s servants with unnatural magics. About the price that the Patron had paid for the power he now gathered about him. Inevitably, House Mistmoore once more turned it’s eyes in hatred and vengeance toward Neriak.<br><br>Likewise, House T’Rhennic had existed as a founding member of the Empire. During the civil war, it had led the Imperial forces to victory over Mistmoore and their allies. As such, the Noble Line had risen as high in power and influence, as the Mistmoore line had fallen. Each had sworn oaths against the other that transcended even the boundaries of death. Thus had House T’Rhennic been the primary might of the Empire ever since. Wisely, it kept track of it’s enemies, even those outcast and defeated. All through Mistmoore’s slow rise to power, House T’Rhennic watched and waited. It knew this day would come, either from an army of battle, or a wave of terror. Therefore, when the Night of the Blood Harvest came, their Imperial Majesties were safe and protected. But, even House T’Rhennic could not be everywhere at once. It was decided that Zirrix would take to the field, and his brother Tzlar would stay in Neriak to maintain order. The attacks began with savage ferocity and chaotic randomness. Some obvious targets, like the Grange of the Harvest and the headquarters of the Indigo Brotherhood, were struck first and hardest. But, the attack upon the 3rd Gate came as a surprise. Who would have thought that the forces of the traitor would be foolish enough to make an enemy of all the Great Houses. Perhaps they sought to gain converts, showing that the time of their Imperial Majesties was at an end. As the rest of the city screamed in agony and pain, the 3rd Gate suddenly erupted into conflagration. The Greatest of the Estates where brought under attack from fire or ice. Magical energies of unheard of power laced through the grand avenues, laying death and destruction onto all in it’s path. But, the worst was reserved for T’Rhennic Keep.<br><br>An army of Undead literally erupted from the grounds of the estate, and began to shamble toward the walls of the Keep. The outer troops were slaughtered into non-existence, and the House Guards were barely able to secure the front gate against the wave of corpses. Other creatures, such as werewolves, ghouls and stone gargoyles also assaulted the Keep. All were under the banner of the traitor House Mistmoore. Tzlar knew that he was not the one to command the defense of their home, he was a War Wizard, not a Warrior. Besides, there were defenses of the Keep that he, as a Caster, could not call upon. Ancient, secret things that could only be activated by a true Warrior of the Line. Tzlar and Zirrix had discussed this scenario many times before, and the Wizard knew what must be done. To be surprised is not so terrible thing as to be unprepared. House T’Rhennic may have been surprised this day, but there was no day that they were unprepared. Giving a final set of orders to the Guard Commander, Tzlar cast a spell that would transpose himself and his brother, sending Tzlar to the field and Zirrix to the Keep. As Tzlar faded from view he saw, much to his hatred and rage, the south wall of the courtyard collapse. As he arrived in the Eastern Commonlands, he swore that there would not be enough pain in the Spawn Mythral’s body to pay for his crimes this day. At the same time, an identical oath was being sworn by Zirrix, now upon the top parapet of the Keep. Zirrix’s eyes narrowed in contempt for the enemy, even as he held his head higher in pride of the skill and valor of his House Guards against that enemy. Nodding once, he gave a series of orders to his startled Commander, and withdrew into the Keep. He headed down into the crypts of the Keep, to call forth a thing that he had prayed to Rallos Zek he would never have to. Coming to stand at the door of the largest of the crypts, he stood for a moment in trepidation. The doors were magically sealed, and covered in more then a thousand years of dust and dirt. Raising his mailed fist, he removed his gauntlet and laid his hand upon the House Sigil on the vault door. As he took a deep breath to speak, he heard a familiar voice behind him say, “Husband, are you sure that this is the last resort?”. Turning, Zirrix saw his Lady Wife, the Battle Mage Mephala, standing in the stairway. As he waited, she spoke…  <br> <p>General Zirrix T'Rhennic<BR>Dread Lord<BR>Violent Harvest<BR><BR><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/selilya/TRhen_Sig.jpg" border=0> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/umythralmistmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MythralMistmoore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/02 5:56:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Old Scores - A Pawn's Play</span><hr size=1> A Pawn’s Play<br><br>The sands had cooled with deepening night, yet Mythral remained upon the mound staring into the distance, thinking.  His friends and comrades, those who had listened to reason and chosen to rebel rather than remain directed by the lies of those so filled with lust for power, were sequestered within their tents, nursing their wounded bodies and wounded pride.<br><br>Shintenshi and Faeolin sat upon camp chairs within one of the makeshift tents of the New Grange, as they called their camp south of the human settlement of Freeport, discussing the merits of strategies as yet untried.  Their cause seemed hopeless, and the Harvest had proven quite capable of dispatching them in pitched battle using standardized tactics.  They brought forth decades of experience from diametrically opposed forces, trying to find a way to break the Alliance free of the military noose the Harvest was fitting about their necks.  Tzlar T’Rhennic had pronounced Faeolin a Renegade of Neriak, and a Traitor against the Crown, but it was fear of no huntsman or bounty that motivated her still, but only that undying sense of honor.  In this strange twist of circumstances, she and Shintenshi devised their schemes, searching for a path out of death.<br><br>The young lovers, Maleick and Vladire, were sleeping soundly in a tent of their own, wrapped in one another’s arms.  They both knew that each night might be their last, and yet they chose to sleep.  They rested that their bodies and minds would be ready for the war when it resumed in the field upon the orders of General Faeolin R’Danya.  This was the future they had been chosen to live, the future to which Mythral had led them.<br><br>Mythral took no notice of the others or their thoughts.  He had withdrawn any suggestion from their minds, and let them be as they had been before his bite had forged the rebellion, or at least ensured that they would remain loyal to it and to one another.  His thoughts, his mind, were elsewhere.<br><br>Shaede and Tzlar had both sworn upon their honor and souls that they had not taken him.  Khasirath had said as much, as had Vresk, as had most of the Harvest over the last two weeks.  Mythral had been driven by certainty and urgency.  He knew that Shaede had taken him – in his mind the fact screamed at him, even in his sleep.  But that urgency had faded, the voice had been silenced.  Mythral had accepted Shaede’s sacrifice, had bitten her deeply enough to forge the link between them, just as his mother had taught him.  As Faeolin interrogated her, Mythral’s hand had never strayed from her shoulder.  The physical contact intensified the bond, and there is no way she could have uttered falsehood without him detecting it.  She had not lied.  She had not taken the Prophet.<br><br>Shaede’s fire had found a target though, and Tzlar and House T’Rhennic, steadfast pillars of the Empire, seemed a likely choice.  Mythral had hoped that Shaede was correct, but watched with little surprise when Tzlar’s oath shattered Shaede’s spirit.  She had retreated from his words like a shadow before the sun, fading into the wispy white aura of her summoned gate.  Tzlar had sworn his House had nothing to do with the disappearance of the Prophet, and then gone on to spew his venom.  Mythral had heard it all his life.  In Mistmoore he was the bastard child of a Knight Templar from Felwithe, ridiculed and reviled, protected only because his mother was the daughter of the master of Mistmoore.  Here, he was the honorless spawn of that same Mistmoore House.  Never accepted, ever distrusted, that had been his life and still was, except for here in this camp.  But none of that mattered now. All that mattered was steering a course through the debris that had been the truth he had acted upon.  And so Mythral stared into the empty space between here and there, contemplating the possibilities.  <br><br>Without warning, the eyes of his mother called him from the north, intruding upon that emptiness he focused upon.  The same yellow-green eyes he used to look upon the world, stared into his soul and called him.  He could smell the blood on her soul, the lust in her heart.  She beckoned him wordlessly, beckoned him to take his place with his family and revel in their triumph over the fading Houses of Neriak, and was gone.  Mythral was halfway through the invocation of the gate before he ducked and cancelled his summons.  He had risen and strode out from the camp, leaving his companions alone in the New Grange.  He suddenly felt the compulsion on his mind and in his heart.  She had summoned him and he had nearly gone, with no thought, with no will.  Nearly.<br><br>A dark flame, lit by the Reaper’s touch and nurtured by blind fools like Vresk and Tzlar, was fanned into a furnace of power.  He could feel its touch like acid in his veins, igniting thoughts and sensations while at the same time killing others.  He had been a fool.  Hatred filled his mind merging with the thirst for blood that was the call of his mother’s lineage.  The two mingled into a terrible maelstrom, merging into a deadly power.  <br><br>Mythral silently stalked back to the tent and approached the General.  Shintenshi and Faeolin both looked up as his shadow blocked their light.<br><br>“What is it Mythral,” Faeolin asked with a voice edged with tension.  Shintenshi’s hand lowered instinctively to his bone-hilted dirk when he saw the light in Mythral’s eyes.  <br><br>“My Captain, I must go to Neriak.  There is someone I must seek.”<br><br>“Allies I hope,” she muttered tersely.  Then she waved her hand and said, “Go.  You will no doubt know when we need you on the field.  Make certain you are not late.”  Mythral felt a tinge of guilt as she glanced at the bandage on her wrist, but it disappeared into his hatred as he saluted and spun away.<br><br>Once out of the camp, he wove his gates into existence, muttering the words of conjuring his Mistmoore tutors had taught him.  “I come mother,” he whispered, voice tinted with dark malice.  Then he was gone from the Freeport sands, leaving only an unpleasant memory in the dreams of men.<br><br>Mythral Mistmoore<br>Soldier of the Alliance <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=231.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=231.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=231.topic><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=231.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=231.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
