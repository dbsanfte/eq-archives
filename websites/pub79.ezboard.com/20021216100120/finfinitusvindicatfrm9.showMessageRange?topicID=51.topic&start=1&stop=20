<br>
1. The three reasons women are easy targets for random acts of violence are: <br>
<br>
a. Lack of awareness (you MUST know where you are &amp; what's going on around you.)<br>
<br>
b. Body language (keep your head up, swing your arms, stand straight up.)<br>
<br>
c. Wrong place, wrong time (DON'T walk alone in an alley, or drive in a bad neighborhood at night.)<br>
<br>
2. Women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit (doing their checkbook, making a list, etc.) DON'T DO THIS!  The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get into the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell you where to go. It doesn't matter if your doors are locked or not. If he breaks the window, your reaction are not fast enough to respond. AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR, LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE.<br>
<br>
a. A few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot, or parking garage: Be aware: look around you, look into your car, at the passenger side floor, and in the back seat. Check under the car as well.<br>
<br>
b. If you are parked next to a big van, enter your car from the passenger door. Most serial killers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars.<br>
<br>
c. Look at the car parked on the drivers side of your vehicle, and the passenger side. If a male is sitting alone in the seat nearest your vehicle, you may want to walk back into the mall, or work, and get a security guard/policeman to walk you back out. IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (Better paranoid than dead.)<br>
<br>
3. Always take the elevator instead of the stairs. (Stairwells are horrible places to be alone.)<br>
<br>
a. Do not get on an elevator if there is a weirdo already there. Keep in mind, however, bad men don't always appear bad.<br>
<br>
b. Do not stand in the back corners of the elevator.  Be near the front, by the doors, ready to get off or on.<br>
<br>
c. If you get on the elevator on the 25th floor, and the Boogie Man gets on the 22nd, get off when he gets on.<br>
<br>
4. If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control, ALWAYS RUN!<br>
<br>
a. POLICE only make 4 of 10 shots when they are in range of 3-9 feet. This is due to stress.<br>
<br>
b. The PREDATOR will only hit you (a running target) 4 in 100 times. And even then, it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. RUN!<br>
<br>
5. Women are always trying to be sympathetic. STOP IT!   It may get you raped, or killed.<br>
<br>
a. Ted Bundy, the serial killer, was a good looking, well educated man, who ALWAYS played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often asked &quot;for help&quot; into his vehicle or with his vehicle, which is when he abducted his next victim.<br>
<br>
b. Pat Malone, an expert in the field of personal safety, tells a story of his daughter, who came out of a mall and was walking to her car when she noticed two older ladies in front of her. Then she saw a police car come towards her with two cops, who said hello. She also noticed that all eight handicapped spots in the area were empty. As she neared her car she saw a man a few rows over calling to her for help. He wanted her to close his passenger side door. He was sitting in the driver's side, and said he was handicapped. He continued calling until she turned and headed back into the mall. He then began cursing at her. In the meantime, she wondered why he didn't ask the two older ladies, or the policemen for help. She also wondered why he hadn't parked in the handicapped spots. AS she got back to the mall, two male friends of hers were exiting, and she told them the story. As she turned to point out the car, the man was getting out of the back seat into the front, and the car sped away.  DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THIS TRAP.<br>
<br>
6. Tips to saving your life, if you've gotten into a violent situation:<br>
<br>
a. REACT IMMEDIATELY: if he abducts you in a parking lot, and is taking you to an abandoned area, DON'T LET HIM GET YOU TO THAT AREA!!<br>
<br>
*If you are driving, react immediately in the situation, and crash your car while still going 5 MPH. <br>
<br>
**If he's driving, find the right time, and stick your fingers in his eyes. He must watch the road, so choose an unsuspecting time, and gouge him. It is your only defense. While he is in shock, GET OUT! This may sound gross, but the alternative is your fault if you do not act.<br>
<br>
b. RESIST: don't go along with him: run, if you are able: DON'T EVER GIVE UP!<br>
<br>
7. Always keep your distance when walking past strangers on the street or in dark areas.<br>
<br>
8. GET A CELL PHONE.<br>
<br>
a. There are packages for $19.95 a month that allow you to program only 911 into the dialing out program. This is an alternative for parents who say it is too expensive for their kids to have a cell phone.<br>
<br>
9. BREAK DOWNS: Make every effort to avoid this scenario by ALWAYS keeping your car in good working order.<br>
<br>
a. If your car breaks down: you better have a cell phone to call for help, and lock your doors. If you don't have a cell phone: shame on you.<br>
<br>
b. Keep a blanket, warm clothes, a pair of boots, and a flashlight in your car always, for emergencies.<br>
<br>
c. If it's noon on a business day, you MAY want to put your hazards on and walk to safety.<br>
<br>
d. If it's 2:00 a.m.: put on your warm clothes, and walk to a lighted area. You are a perfect target if you are sitting in your broken down car. Predators search the highways for easy targets like you.<br>
<br>
e. If you're on a desolate road: walk away from the car (in your warm clothes) and go to some bushes, or some area AWAY from your vehicle. It will be cold, and uncomfortable, but you DO NOT want to stay in your car, and there are no psycho bogeymen waiting in the bushes who knew you were going to break down there and then.<br>
<br>
10. Physical defenses that you can use against the violent predator:<br>
<br>
a. Go for the eyes. The eyes are the most vulnerable part of the body. Poke him there, and you have (possibly) your only window of opportunity.<br>
<br>
b. The neck is also a vulnerable spot, but you MUST know where to grip, AND HAVE THE STRENGTH to cut off his breath.<br>
<br>
c. The last place is the KNEES. Everyone's knees are very vulnerable, and a swift kick there will take anyone down. -- A cautionary note about these things is that if you don't do these things right the first time, you are in trouble, because it will only anger the attacker, and that anger will be TAKEN OUT ON YOU. I'm not saying don't attempt them (it may be your only hope), but be forceful when you do.<br>
<br>
11. If you are walking alone in the dark (which you shouldn't be) and you find him following/chasing you:<br>
<br>
a. Scream &quot;FIRE&quot;, and not &quot;help&quot;. People don't want to get involved when people yell &quot;help&quot;, but &quot;fire&quot; draws attention because people are nosy.<br>
<br>
b. RUN!<br>
<br>
c. Find an obstacle, such as a parked car, and run around it, like ring around the rosie. This may sound silly, but over the years, 5 women told Pat Malone that this SAVED THEIR LIVES.<br>
<br>
d. Your last hope is getting under the car. Once you are under there, there are many things to hold on to, and he will not be able to get you out, and will not come under for you (most likely). Usually they give up by this point. The catch here is that YOU MUST PRACTICE GETTING UNDER THE CAR. You must have a plan (he will have one); know if you will be going on your back, front, from the side or back of the car. It must be practiced.<br>
<br>
12. Never let yourself or anyone that you know be a &quot;closer&quot; in any type of business (bar, store, restaurant, gas station). <p><img src="http://abery.spyd.net/Aberysiggy2.GIF" border="0"> </a>

<br>
I was working at a bar a couple of years ago, and I had this regular who always came in and sat at the bar, as with any regular we got to know each other. Talked about our families, religion, the whole nine yards.<br>
<br>
 He became really freaky writing me letters, sending tapes and such. It got to the point where I had him banned from coming in. <br>
<br>
From things we had talked about he was able to track down my Mom and began calling her and sending her letters about me saying how we were meant to be together. I had a restraining order put on him to stay away from me and my family. He called my Mom last year to ask about me. /shudder<br>
<br>
Women need to be very careful about any information, (no matter how insignifacant we think it is) they give out.<br>

Use the heel of your hand, fist or shoe, go DIRECTLY for his Adam's apple. Good chance you can kill him if you use a shoe.<br>

Knees and Elbows - high heels are your friends - step on his toes too - a 90 pound woman stomping on someone with a 2 - inch heel is enough.<br>

A lot of police and security agencies are switching over to the idea that the important thing is to stay out of the bad guy's clutches, not to go along and hope for escape/rescue later: you are free now, stay that way. <p><center>

hit 'em hard enough in the adam's apple, anyone will go down.<br>
<br>
I must've missed it-- i just sorta skimmed, because I don't feel I'll ever be attacked by anyone (not for the reasons you're thinking though) -- and I know sometimes it's hard to strike, but I (as well as ANY guy) know(s) that if you hit a guy in the testicles, he'll probably go down.<br>
<br>
However!<br>
Being struck there 'by accident' is  NO LAUGHING MATTER!<br>
<br>
It *really* hurts.<br>
<br>
I mean really.<br>
<br>
Really really.<br>

<br>
When i was in college.. we used to teach a course at the martial arts school i went too...  one time.. we had a lady  &quot;veteran&quot; come by saying she had taken multiple courses.. adn that she knew what to do.. but was just refreshing the course cause her kids had asked her to...<br>
<br>
So... I put on the big summo wrestling suit... and let her go all out...  and while the suit was offering some protection.. i can tell you...  she was not doing it right.<br>
<br>
Women have two problems when it comes to self defense...  <br>
<br>
1) they hold back.<br>
2) they underestimate the attackers.<br>
<br>
Yes getting hit in the nether parts hurts.. but...  it might not be enough to drop someone.<br>
<br>
If you have ever seen a boxer named Golgota fight.. you will see what i mean.. in one fight.. he punched full out 3.. count them 3 times.. his opponent in the nuts... and the oponent did not drop.  Yes oponent was wearing a cup.. BUT Golgota is also a profesional boxer.<br>
<br>

Examples:  Somone was breaking into a house and was coming in through the sky light.  He feel and landed on the kitchen counter where the people that owned the house had left a knife.  The knife of course caused some damage he sued the poeple that owned the house and won.<br>

There are many more examples of this, so if someone attacks you or breaks into your house you shoot to kill and make sure there dead because there relatives can't sue you. <p>Herne Lyonsbane (retired)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ucreylin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Creylin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/3/02 4:32:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things all woman should know (LONG)</span><hr size=1> Actually, even if you kill him, couldn't his/her family still sue you for wrongful death? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13891">Creylin McClellan, Dwarven Warlord</a><BR>

I hid while my brother called the police, my parents being the total waste that they were, were nowhere around.  My brother went to hid under his bed but before he got there I heard this guy who broke into the house beat him badly.  In the closet was a double-barrel 12 gauge shotgun which I knew enough about to load it and point the one end at the door.  The closet door had these little slits in it so you could see through it.  I heard my brother tell him that noone else was home.  Well this guy went through the house **NOTE** at this point he had been in the house for 15 mins and NO POLICE.  I then saw him come to the door of my parent's cloest and I braced the shotgun against the back wall and waited.  The door opened and since I could see that this was someone I did not know and had done who knows what to mt brother I pulled the trigger unloading both barrels into his chest and stomach he he dropped like a rock.  I reached up and closed the door and sat shaking in the closet not knowing what to do.  I saw the blood start to seep in under the door and I franticly grabbed clothing I stuffed it under the door to prevent the blood from coming in.  (That part I still have nightmares of) Now about 30 MINS later the police arrived and I found that my brother was taken to the hospital as he was knock out and he recovered 2 days later.  I will NEVER regret what I did to this POS.<br>
<br>
Second time I was walking in Pittsburgh and I was chased by 3 guys and I arrived at a staircase that ran between to roads (these are hard to explain but Pittsburgh is hilly and they have small staircases between roads) about halfway down the stairs the guard rail was rotted and broken I pulled the small section of the rail away and without pause swung it around and it the first guy right in the face with this metal rail.  The other two guys who were just starting down the stairs turned and ran.  I finished running down the stairs and turned around and the guy I had hit with the rail was convulsing on the stairs with blood rolling down the stairs.  I later found that I had killed him but the Police did not presue anything against me, the young 19 white girl with ripped clothes and a badly cut arm.  Again I will never regret this event either.<br>
<br>
There are some crappy people out there and I for one am happy as hell I have the right and ability to defend myself.  So woe to the fvcker that messes with me again. <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~sewelldeanna/Aberysiggy2.GIF" border="0"> </a>

Creylin, you ever take the time to aim for a particular body part?  In that time it takes to do that, your assailant could already be upon you.  Your best bet is to aim for the largest part of his anatomy-the torso and stop him dead in his tracks asap-literally, if need be.  If he lives long enough to sue me, I'll chance it with my lawyers.  If he dies, then I'll have to live with those repercussions, but I'll at least live.<br>
