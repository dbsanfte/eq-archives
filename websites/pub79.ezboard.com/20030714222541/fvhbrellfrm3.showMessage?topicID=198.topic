Gekn lifted up his scimitar from Jeneane's staff, flying over to intercept the running magician. The other mages tried to warn poor Kental to go quicker and that Gekn was coming, and foolishly he stopped. He let out a sigh to himself, Gekn closing in on him. Turning suddenly and reaching out his opened hand, he fired a flame bolt right into Gekn. It was all in vain for Gekn was able to absorb the magicians flame into his own hand. Holding the flame in his hand, he made a fist, extinguishing it, and then Kental's life.<br>
<br>
Slash, slash, slash, one swift slash after another, and Kental's body was in pieces, lifeless on the floor. Gekn's reached down and tore off a piece of Kental's robe and wiped the blood of his scimitar with it. A silent cackle to himself was made, and Gekn threw the blood soaked rag down to the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gekn!&quot; Jeneane screamed out against the elemental to get its attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want Mage?&quot; As Gekn turned around to answer Jeneane, all the mages in the room were hit with a sudden mysterious burst of wind. All the mages were knocked back a few feet except for Jeneane, the only effect the wind had on her was moving her hair around a little. One of the mages suddenly realized Jeneane was something to watch out for.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do believe it’s my turn to see how much power I can put into my spell.&quot; Reaching out her hand each finger began to curl up until Jeneane made a fist, her eyes darkened to jet-black.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not fear you, pitiful magician.&quot; Gekn's body stiffened a little, still no sense of either backing down within the two. Gekn stretched out his arms, as to antagonize Jeneane. Both Gekn and Jeneane were ones of enormous power, never have meeting an equal as of yet.<br>
<br>
With the taunting of Gekn and the death of her fellow magician friends, Jeneane cut loose into a deep rage. No other mage in the room had ever witnessed, or experienced the transformation that was appearing before them.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Jeneane's eyes burst from jet-black to a fiery orange, glowing in a sense.<br>
<br>
&quot;Elemental, your power is one of evil, nothing good will ever come from you.&quot; Jeneane's clenched fist slowly began to glow with an orange hue. Her first did not create a full flame around it, and it didn't appear in a distinct area, but like that of the glow that surrounds a candle flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;By foolishly letting down your guard and underestimating my power you have assured your fate... one of pain and death. Jeneane's growing power was circulating through the room. Parts of the floor began to suddenly crack, strands of her hair began to rise up around her head, all the other magicians in the room felt their bodies ache all over with pain. Finally Gekn's sword shattered in his hand, but before the elemental could do anything it was all over.<br>
<br>
Jeneane rose up her arm towards Gekn, her first pointed at his chest. As she opened that fist, a small ball of flame was huddled in her palm. She began to shout the last words Gekn would ever hear.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOW!&quot; FEEL THE POWER OF MY LAVA BOLT. With that the small huddled flame had burst forth into a stream of concentrated fire and energy right into Gekn's chest. Gekn let out a terrible cry; paralyzed by pain he crashed down to the floor. The fire quickly spread throughout the air elementals misty body, consuming all his essence, until nothing was left but the haunting echo of Gekn's scream throughout the guildhall. Then all was silent.<br>
<br>
Jeneane's eyes returned to their normal green, she dropped to one knee in her exhaustion. Letting go off her conjured staff it hit the floor and dispersed into the air. The other mages quickly ran over to help her to her feet. Jeneane let out a sigh and a small joke to her fellow magicians.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess being five centuries old will take it toll on you a little, just a little.&quot; She brushed her hair to one side with her hand and felt something on her forehead. She noticed sweat on her hand and wondered silently to herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sweat?&quot; I must be getting old; usually a one time casting of that spell doesn't make me break a sweat. Something has to be done about these attacks, I can't keep fighting on like this, and yet, the war is just beginning.......<br>
<br>
Tenzing was sitting at her usually spot in West Common lands, on top of a hill by the tollbooth. Both guards at the booth lay around the hillside, mutilated and dead. The still fresh blood glistened on her pet Jobn's summoned short swords. She had reached her 36th level not to long ago, starting to feel experience increasing for her much easier now. While meditating to replenish her spiritual power (mana) she was as usual reading up on the history of her magician ancestry, and the story of the elementals.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such power magicians back in those days, seems that it was the best thing to combat those huge elementals though.&quot; Tenzing said aloud to herself. At this point in her life she had learned to enjoy the solitude, only her pet kept her company now days. She felt her spiritual energy come back to full. Tenzing put down her book, stood up, and while dusting off her robe called to her pet to get ready. Another guard had appeared and it was time to strike the weak light crawler down. <br>
<br>
&quot;Jobn.&quot; Tenzing ordered. It's time to start the killing. With that Jobn went out to do her masters will, like a magicians pet should and always will do.<br>
