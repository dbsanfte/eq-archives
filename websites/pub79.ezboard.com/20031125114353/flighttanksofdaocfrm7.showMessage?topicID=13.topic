<br>
Although nothing has changed with Mercenaries since my last report (or indeed, since last year), I decided a reminder report was in order considering that once again, we've been told &quot;changes are a-comin'&quot; Let's hope it's for real this time.<br>
<br>
As of this writing, Mercenaries are easily the least popular melee class in Albion by a hefty margin (and second least popular in the game after blademasters). Mercenaries are trounced by most other classes in RVR, as can be seen by any charts analyzing average realm points earned by class. We are hoping the as-yet-unknown upcoming patch changes may help fix this. Below is a breakdown of our major issues.<br>
<br>
QUICK REFERENCE LIST<br>
<br>
As briefly as possible, here is what we NEED:<br>
<br>
- Fix the DW styles to be worth using over &quot;base&quot; style lists<br>
<br>
- Let us put shields into the 2H slot so we can hotkey them and actually use them<br>
<br>
- Make Dirty Tricks unresistable as was said would be done, and lower its timer some<br>
<br>
Many Mercenary players would also like to request the following:<br>
<br>
- Give us and other light tanks the limited charge ability outlined below<br>
<br>
- Give us the option to train in short bows similar to Armsmen and their crossbows<br>
<br>
And now the details...<br>
<br>
TOP ISSUE<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - The DW style list was apparently tested by the strike team and found to be adequetly comparable to a base style list. However, the strike team seems to have forgotten that DW is an &quot;advanced&quot; spec similar in function to 2-handed, polearms, and left axe. These other &quot;advanced&quot; specs have a style list superior to the base style lists, but DW's style list is not. This begs the question, why use DW styles at all? Our double-hit chance is the same with regular styles as they are with DW styles, and as I've shown in the past the regular Slash style list has better choices for most situations, so what's the point in even having DW styles? The answer: we don't. Ask around, most Mercenaries don't use their DW styles, instead preferring to use a &quot;base&quot; style list.<br>
<br>
I would also like to point out that the game's producer has stated that DW is supposed to do the same damage as Left Axe, which would make it more fair for the assassin classes. The Beserker's overall damage may be intended to be higher, but it is supposed to be for other reasons (better base stats, beserk, etc.). However, despite it's recent downtuning, Left Axe as a fighting style is still far superior to DW in terms of usability and total damage output. This can easily be seen by comparing the assassin classes which have similar stats otherwise. The reason for this difference is in Left Axe's superior styles.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the Dual Wield styles are not fine the way they are now; they need to be revamped. Here's the major problems I see with them and some suggested solutions:<br>
<br>
PROBLEMS:<br>
<br>
Problem #1: Base style damage for all Dual Wield styles is way too low, as alluded to above. Long ago in late beta, Left Axe styles received a major style damage boost in order to make up for the reduced base damage associated with using Left Axe and the fact that the style damage only applied to one weapon. However, no such change was made to Dual Wield despite it having similar limitations. On top of that, Dual Wield styles in general do less damage than plain Slashing styles, despite being an &quot;advanced&quot; style list (&quot;advanced&quot; meaning a style that requires you to also train in a base weapon type in order to be effective). DW's styles are very low damage when compared to other &quot;advanced&quot; style lists like 2-handed and Polearms.<br>
<br>
Problem #2: Dual Wield styles do not affect and are not affected by Dual Wield's double-hit feature. A regular style has just as much chance to cause a double-hit as a Dual Wield style does (despite the DW style animations showing a double hit), and niether style type adds style damage to the off-hand during a double-hit. This means Dual Wield styles are nothing more than just &quot;extra Merc styles&quot; with nothing to differentiate them from plain styles.<br>
<br>
Problem #3: Lack of no-opening chains. The Dual Wield style list is the only one in the game that has no no-opening chains whatsoever. Other than the Taunt, Detaunt, and newbie style it only has 1 no-opening style, the level 15 Misty Gloom (which doesn't chain into anything), and the rest are all positional or reactionary.<br>
<br>
Problem #4: Redundant styles. Both the level 12 Eclipse and the level 21 Penumbra styles chain off of the same style, the level 6 back positional style Shadow's Edge. With a clearly superior style, having two styles chain off this same style is a waste of a style spot.<br>
<br>
Problem #5: Too high dependancy on Evade. Merc's only get Evade I, and thus rarely Evade at all. They don't even get it until level 10. Unfortunately, the level 4 (notice 4 even though we can't Evade until 10), 10, and 34 styles depend on Evade and are thus never used by Mercenaries.<br>
<br>
Problem #6: No back positional or no-opening styles that slow or stun. Every melee class needs something like this to keep their targets close enough that they actually have a chance of killing something in RVR instead of just chasing people around until they are killed by a nuker or archer. We have a side positional snare style Flank but when you need to slow someone you are usually facing their back not their side, so Flank cannot really be used for this purpose.<br>
<br>
Problem #7: Chained and reactionary styles are not rewarding enough. Pulling off the very rare Evade-based reactionary chain is no better than just using Misty Gloom 2 times (and much worse than using the Slashing style Amethyst Slash 2 times). These difficult to use styles need to have a better reward.<br>
<br>
Problem #8: Bleeding damage does not stack with itself and does not get better with more spec points spent like other damage types do. This applies to all bleed styles not just DW.<br>
<br>
SOLUTIONS:<br>
<br>
1. Increase style damage on most DW styles to make it a clearly superior choice to basic weapon styles for damage output.<br>
<br>
2. Make DW style damage apply to both weapons when a double-hit is rolled (or half bonus to the offhand), and/or make them give an increased chance to do a double-hit when using them, to make them truly &quot;Dual Wield styles&quot; rather than just more of the same old normal styles.<br>
<br>
3. Throw out some of the redundant/useless styles mentioned in Problem #4 and Problem #5 and replace them with no-opening styles and/or a no-opening chain of 2 or 3 styles.<br>
<br>
4. Change Flank to a back positional (might have to change the name to match though) or replace a redundant/worthless style from Problems #4 and #5 with a no-opening or back positional style that has a snare or stun effect.<br>
<br>
5. Further bump up the damage on any chained and reactionary styles left after 1-4 above to make them more rewarding as they were intended to be.<br>
<br>
6. For all style lists, make bleed damage scale with points spent in the appropriate spec like normal damage scales. Also consider letting bleed damage stack with itself.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can come up with alternate solutions but it doesn't really matter how you do it as long as all the problems listed above are taken care of.<br>
<br>
OTHER ISSUES<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Merc's cannot hotkey Shields since the shield slot is being used by their second weapon. Please allow shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield/weapon combo for RVR purposes. Blocking arrows and bolts in RVR is the only reason we ever use a shield, but this limitation makes it hard to even do that.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Dirty Tricks is still resisted, even though I was told it would be made unresistable but have a low affect on high leveled players and mobs. Please implement this. If you are a Team Lead or dev you can read the post stating this would be done here.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Dirty Tricks has too long of a timer for how unreliable it is. Not only can it still be resisted as mentioned above, but it can now be Purged with the new realm abilities. The other two light tank classes' special abilities (beserk and triple wield) are much more reliable - they do what they say they will do every time no matter what. Plus they can affect more than one enemy, whereas ours can only affect one no matter what. You said you would consider lowering the timer after it first came in, is there any chance of doing this now?<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - We want to fit a role in RVR. We are tired of just being light tanks without any of the assumed benefits of the definition. We want to be light infantry, shock troops, to run in quickly, harass the enemy and soften them up, cause some chaos, and be followed up by the main force of our army (heavy tanks and casters). We also want to be feared by archers and casters because of our increased ability to close in on them and take them down. But right now, this isn't possible.<br>
<br>
The problem, however, is not easily solved. The obvious solution would be increased mobility, but that would give other benefits that could throw PVE balance out of whack - such as increased ability to escape from a bad fight, lower travel times, etc. We don't believe this is something Mythic is willing to give us.<br>
<br>
We have devised a solution that should give us the role in RVR we desire without unbalancing us in any other aspects. Please give this idea your serious consideration for inclusion into the Mercenary class as well as blademasters and Bezerkers.<br>
<br>
Ability: Charge<br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
- You must have a target.<br>
- The target must be an enemy.<br>
- The target must be in your current cone of view and visible to you.<br>
- The target must be within a certain distance of you.<br>
<br>
- You press the Charge button.<br>
<br>
- You immediatly lose a chunk of endurance<br>
- Your character runs at high speed (at least as fast as the Hunter's speed boost ability) directly toward the target.<br>
- Your character cannot be steered by you, and cannot be stopped by you.<br>
- If your target dies before you get to them or get out of range or you charge for too long then you stop automatically.<br>
- Once your character reaches your target, the charge is over and you auto-attack your target (kind of like when you use a Style and it turns auto-attack on for you).<br>
- You must now wait for a timer before you can Charge again.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this ability would not decrease travel times, nor would it allow you to escape a bad fight (since you have to attack an enemy to use it, which would just make the situation worse). What it would do is allow us to charge into the battle quickly in an effort to take out weaker characters and act as shock troops. Optional things you could do is to give a higher Charge at a later level - perhaps one that also grants resistance to mez/stun or allows dodging of arrows while charging to make it easier to get close to casters and archers, or have an increasingly damaging style execute at the end of the charge with special effects like snare. But that's just fluff, the main thing we want is what is described above.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Some Mercenary players would like to know why we can't train in Shortbows like Armsmen can train in Crossbows. It seems odd since we get bows before they do.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY<br>
<br>
Merecenaries are nothing more than a gimmick class in their current state, and are rarely seen on new servers or the new PVP servers at all. Outclassed in every way by Armsmen, about the only players that play them are ones that have been for a long time and don't want to start over; and newbies who didn't do any research on the classes first and chose it based on the brief description of the class. Hopefully the upcoming promised changes to light tanks will bolster the class enough that people may actually want to play them again.<br>
