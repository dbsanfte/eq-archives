I am Tesarra, a Necromancer of Neriak and one of The Dead.  After having met your Ambassador, Vresk of the Iksar, I have been persuaded that I may better reach my personal goals by joining with the Violent Harvest and serving within your ranks.<br>
<br>
I have recently reached the 13th rank of my order, and will soon achieve the 14th.<br>
<br>
I was once a member of House D'Fral and wore the badge of the Obsidian Blade until my mentor, Kiros E'Kieron was slain by Lokus of Evoluxa.  My Hatred mastered me, then, and I lost myself in madness.  When I recovered my senses, I pursued the path of Enchantment for a time, then even attempted to escape the confines of Norrath and Inorruk's clutches.  Yet here I am still, and finally beginning to be the master of the Hatred that burns within my breast.  There is so much for me to learn, and I believe your guild offers me the opportunity to learn and achieve my potential as a Tier'Dal and as a Necromancer.<br>
<br>
I will gladly perform whatever task I am set to prove myself worthy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tesarra<br>

You say you &quot;escaped&quot; the clutches of Innoruuk?<br>
<br>
I see no reason for one to do such. I find it a blessing to be his servant, yet you make it sound almost as if it were...not a good thing.<br>
<br>
Then again, there are few that are more loyal and devout then myself of Innoruuk's teachings. All of whom reside within this guild. For me to fully accept you, we must speak sometime, perhaps I will be able to clear up any misunderstandings you may have about his teachings. <br>
If you so wish, we can keep it confidential and on the low down. Other then that, I wish you Luck, Honor and strength through Hate on the completion of your quest you are about to receive... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uvresk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vresk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ambassador to Kunark</span><br>  Posts: 361<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/02 3:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Petition for Entrance</span><hr size=1> Hate iss sstrong with thiss one, and the blood of the Obssidian Blade runss pure, desspite her muddled passt. <p><img src=http://stardesk.staroffice.com/www/kooK/Vresksig1.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udarkrayne2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkrayne2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/02 4:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Petition for Entrance</span><hr size=1> Mayhaps my wariness is misplaced.

I regret that my obligations elsewhere made it necessary for another to speak for me.  (*OOC* My RL schedule makes it difficult to play or post messages more than one or two days a week.)<br>
<br>
Darkrayne, you may rest assured that I will neither hide in Ambassador Vresk's shadow nor clink to the tassels of his robe.  My life in the past has indeed been muddled and, on occasion, directionless.  I retreated from my Hatred in fear, having seen what unmastered Hatred (not to mention raw ambition and hubris) did to Tier'Dal I considered noble and exemplary.  Your concerns about my character and commitment are understandable, but groundless.  My experience has taught me to embrace the Hatred that burns within me.  Yet I have also witnessed the folly of allowing that flame to consume me.<br>
<br>
During my brief sojourn in another place, far from Norrath, I observed another powerful tool.  It consisted of a focused, concentrated ray of light.  The people of that place called this a Laser.  Few substances could withstand its terrible heat.  I believe our Hatred must become like this Laser, so devastating in its focus and concentration that no obstacle shall prevent us from subjugating all the races of Norrath and Luclin.  I also believe that if we do not begin applying the discipline to do this, our Hatred will destroy us rather than our enemies.  Who can imagine the torments our Father has in store if we should fail Him in this fashion?<br>

<br>
Well met, Tessera. You are not the first Teir'Dal I have known who has strayed into confusion, and turned from the Father. It takes great strength and sacrifice to return to His Path. I pray ye are strong enough, but I am sure that the legendary Obsidian Blade saw to it that you are.<br>
<br>
And as to your words about Hate, and how it can consume the undisciplined... I have always agreed on this. I do not know of the 'laser' you mentioned, but I know that Hate is a powerful tool. Unfocussed it can destroy all around it. We all seek to focus our Hate into a weapon of the Father's Will. Only in this fashion can we truly serve Him.<br>
<br>
As our motto states, Hate with Honor. Hate is first always, but we must have the Honor and the focus to direct it, lest we be consumed.<br>
<br>
I pray we meet soon within the lands of Norrath.<br>

So far so good.  They seemed not to have noticed her attacks on the fringes of the Erolisi Sisterhood's encampment on the island.  They would surely wonder tomorrow who was responsible for the group of corpses piled upon the beach, but Tes would be long gone by then.<br>
<br>
With another glance up to check the opposite shore of the island for any sign of activity (she had narrowly escaped death at the hands of a pirate from that direction a few hours ago), she returned to the task of removing the Purity Belt from her latest victim.  The girl was much younger than Tesarra, but had been nearly her equal in combat.  If not for the melee skill of her bone servant, there was little doubt in Tesarra's mind who would be lying on the beach growing slowly colder.<br>
<br>
She placed the belt in her pack, taking a quick inventory as she did.  She had collected six now, two more than the Dread Overlord Pravdameer had requested for her Culling Quest, but scarcely enough to begin her revenge on the lightdwellers who had invaded her precious Nektulos Forest.  Tes allowed her rage to flare up momentarily, her eyes flickering in the night like bright embers.  Only for a moment did she allow herself to luxuriate in the building fire of anger and Hatred that came from deep within her soul.<br>
<br>
Just as quickly, her eyes resumed their normal calm violet hue as she banked the embers of the fire within.  Her enemies would think her an anomaly.  Before them would stand a Tier'Dal seemingly without the burning Hatred that drove her kin.  She would win their confidence, even their friendship with her poise and quick wit.  Then, oh then...  A hideous grin crept across Tesarra's lips as she carved a few choice portions of meat from the young Koada'Dal bodies before her, wrapping them carefully in packets of their own skin with herbs to preserve them until they could be cooked.<br>
<br>
The wolfish grin still lingered as she invoked the magicks that would transport her back home to Nektulos Forest.<br>
