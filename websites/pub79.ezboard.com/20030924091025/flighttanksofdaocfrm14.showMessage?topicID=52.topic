I want to apologize for taking so long to post in here.  I won't have internet access in my new apartment until July 8th, so it's a bit of an inconvenience for me to get online. <br>
<br>
I set up some boards for berserkers only at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.xenogenic.net/berserkerforum" target="top">www.xenogenic.net/berserkerforum</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
However, feel free to stick to just these great boards that are set up for us light tanks.  I'll do my best to make sure everything that happens on my private boards happens here as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I've been discussing some options for our class with a lot of people, but due to the length restrictions on the TL reports, I'm going to focus mostly on our damage and our styles.  In an effort to fit the positional and reactionary fighter definition that was placed on us in 1.62 and still remain fun and effective, these are the proposed changes that I like:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Style Adjustments</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Since we are supposed to be positional combatants, it would be fitting for us to have more than one type of positional style (Doubler and Snowsquall are Rear positional).  Therefore, it's been suggested that Doubler be changed to a side positional, and that its damage be tweaked to be appropriate for a side positional.  All side positionals have a resulting effect, and so for this a snare could be fitting and not overpowered.  Feel free to make suggestions, though.<br>
<br>
Secondly, many (or most?) berserkers would like to see Aurora Borealis returned to &quot;after target parries.&quot;  Along with this, it has been suggested that this style have a 6 or 9 second stun attached to it.  The reasons for this are: it's our 50 spec style, and should, therefore, be quite powerful. Our only stun, which is 6 seconds off of Frosty Gaze, is very difficult for a berserker to land, while other classes are able to stun after an evade, from performing a simple positional style, or from hitting the button for 'Slam'.  Because Aurora Borealis would be performable only after our target parries, we would only be able to stun an enemy class that has the Parry ability, and furthermore, only an enemy class that is facing us and able to parry.  For these reasons, many feel a 9 second stun would be justified, but feel free to share your thoughts.<br>
<br>
Third, though far less important, would be to increase the bleed damage on our Icy Brilliance style to be on-par with the bleed damage given to Blademasters' Tempest and Twin Star styles and to Mercenaries' Dark Tendrils and Dual Shadows styles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Increase damage for positionals and reactionary styles only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
To maintain this role as a reactionary and positional style, and yet to be effective in combat, players feel our damage should be increased.  However, I'm not sure that it would excite anyone to have all of our damage increased, especially for Doublefrost, so instead I've mentioned increasing the damage for only our positional and reactionary styles.  My suggestion, at least for now, is reducing the 1.62 reduction by 50% for reactionary and positional styles and chains (i.e. reducing their damage only half as much as 1.62 did), thereby leaving our anytime styles and their subsequent chains alone.  The only request I have for these styles is that Doublefrost be reduced to Medium endurance consumption.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Changes to Frenzy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The other major issue for our class right now is our Frenzy ability, but I would like to take this one step at a time.  So for now, the only change I would like to propose is tightening the potential critical range from 1-99% to 30-70%.  This keeps the average critical hit the same (50%), but makes our damage more consistent while disallowing those rare but incredibly painful 99% crits that a lot of people complained about prior to 1.62.<br>
<br>
I agree wholeheartedly with everyone that thinks our Frenzy shouldn't have the drawbacks it does, now that BMs and Mercs had their class abilities' timers changed.  However, like I said earlier, I want to take this one step at a time.  So be thinking about what you'd like to see done to Frenzy, and keep it in mind for the near future <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that's it for the proposed changes to our damage and styles, for now.  Please share your thoughts.  I'll do my best to keep up and respond, but things are still pretty crazy for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: I've been asked to request a new model for when we're in a Frenzy.  The drakulv model comes highly recommended, and I'm willing to go with that.  What do you think? <p>~Bradack Doomhammer, 50th Troll Berserker<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> berserkers would like to see Aurora Borealis returned to &quot;after target parries.&quot; Along with this, it has been suggested that this style have a 6 or 9 second stun attached to it.

<br>
-Or by performing a chain which stems off a parry. Get me?<br>
<br>
Parrying ones enemy is a positive assett. As Tundra penalises people for dual wielding, so Aurora Borealis would be (massively, massively) penalising people for having put more points into parry so they could stop being killed so often. All light tanks know what a 'slap in the face' is... A nine second stun to go along with this is the nail is anybody's coffin. Some classes rely on parrying. <br>
<br>
Change it to 'target evades' and I might look favourably upon it. And, if this sounds absurd, Dual Wield did actually have a style like this once.<br>
<br>
Increasing bleed damage to be on par with mercenaries Dual Shadows: of course I'll react with hostility towards what seems to be the only thing we've been given in a year that's of any worth. So forgive me. Dual Shadows bleed style is our level 50 style with an aggro-holding positional requirement and a medium defensive penalty, and poor bonus damage, yet a level 50 style should be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> &quot;quite powerful&quot; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> . The bleed upping was one of several tiny fixes that was supposed to make up for the fact that we don't do enough damage and never will.<br>
<br>
I'm horribly aware that it sounds like I'm being a bitch, but I feel I speak for more people than just myself.<br>

<br>
No, you make good points.<br>
<br>
Also, my approach has always been to go with Mythic's definition of a light tank and to try to make the berserker fit that role and be useful/good at it, rather than being stubborn and insisting their idea of a Light Tank is wrong or bad.  The definition of a light tank, as per &quot;The Light Tank Explained,&quot; said that we shouldn't be able to go head to head with heavy tanks and win, and letting us stun off of Aurora Borealis would pretty much end the fight with any heavy tank that gets &quot;lucky&quot; enough to parry.  I spoke with the BM TL for awhile earlier, before reading your post, and this very point was made and I have to agree.  The last thing I want to do is contradict myself in my reports. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The bleed upping was one of several tiny fixes that was supposed to make up for the fact that we don't do enough damage and never will.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I honestly think that BMs and Mercenaries should have their damage increased.  Light tanks are supposed to do more damage than heavy tanks, but have weaker defense.  And if we're supposed to have &quot;much&quot; weaker defense, then we should have &quot;much&quot; stronger offense (note: I'm not saying Mythic has said this.  I'm just saying I think the adjectives should be the same in that comparison).<br>
<br>
Even before 1.62, I had a hard time beating warriors in duels because they would block and parry damn near everything.  In RvR, however, it was easier to win because parry didn't work.  Now that parry is fixed, heavy tanks are that much more defensive, and thus negate that much more of our offense in a head-on fight.  It's our job to attack them from different positions and to employ reactionary styles (or at least it's supposed to be), so it's my goal to get our reactionary and positional style damages increased, as well as get Left Axe a side positional and a good reactionary level 50 style, or at least something along those lines.<br>
<br>
I hope that BMs and Mercs get their damage increased, too.  None of us seem very good at being reactionary/positional fighters, so obviously something is wrong.<br>
<br>
 If your TLs ever need help with testing or anything else, I assure you I'll offer whatever I can to ensure that all of the light tanks function as they are supposed to.<br>
