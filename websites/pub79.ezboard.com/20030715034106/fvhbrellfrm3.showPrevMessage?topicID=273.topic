Tattered, shredded and blood soaked remnants of a High Chancellor of the Tower of the Arcane’s robe stuck upon the badly burnt body. The many candles and burning incense placed about the room by the servants did little to mask the acrid and sickening stench. The pitiful body, vaguely resembling a Teir’dal male of advanced years, struggled even to breathe. As it’s labored efforts came out in wheezing hisses and sudden gasps, the crisp flesh twitched involuntarily and convulsed from time to time. Upon the normally stoic face of the General was a scowl of concern and anger. Zirrix thought to himself, “How dare he do this now! Damn him to Tunare’s Evergreen Forest, Neriak was still not completely secure from the vacuum of power created by the disbanding of the Violent Harvest”. Zirrix had been in the headquarters of the Indigo Brotherhood when “it” had happened. He was repositioning his forces to secure his position since the dissolution of one of his power bases of the Violent Harvest. Then, a curtain of dread seemed to descend over the very core of his being. In his life, he had been across all of Norrath. In the foulest and most hideous of dungeons, and even to the outer Planes of existence. But, the feeling and oppressive silence that penetrated to the very depths of his soul moments before the explosion was something even he, in all his 52 seasons, had never felt before. He was one of the first to arrive at the Arcane Tower after the explosion. He thanked the Dark Prince that his Imperial Majesty King Thex was unharmed. The King had been protected by magical wards and shields, the power of which even the explosion could not penetrate.<br>
<br>
But the same could not be said for most of the Tower’s inhabitants. Obviously they had been using every strand of their magical energy to cast the portal spell. Zirrix knew of the spell from his brother Tzlar, Chancellor of the Imperial Council and 55th season War Wizard of  the Empire. Tzlar had said the spell would take the combined powers of the most powerful Wizards of his Order, but was not concerned about the outcome. He, and all the other High Chancellors of his Order, would need to lend their power. It would be a great victory for the Tower and all the Arcanists of Neriak. The Wizards had done this before. But then, all Wizards of Norrath had combined their power to reopen the portals to moon of Luclin some time back. Some Wizards had died at that event, but Tzlar said it was because of their weakness in the Art, and thus they deserved no less. This time it was different though, this time it was just the Children of Neriak that would cast the spell to expand their power over the Luclin portals. Even the King would be in attendance to witness their strength. After all, what good is victory and power if it is not flaunted for all to see. So did they Wizards of the Tower combine their energies and skills, and cast the spell… <br>
<br>
The explosion shook the very foundation of the Indigo Brotherhood’s command center, and sent dust flying. Rushing to the Tower area, even Zirrix was struck for a moment by the scene. The frame of the Tower itself still stood, battered but intact. The upper floors though had been blown off, and the surrounding courtyard scorched and blacked. Heat still radiated from the structure, and more then a few incinerated corpses had been flung about in grotesque poses. To Zirrix it looked as if a giant puppeteer’s stand had combusted and the contents blown outward. Picking his way through the rubble, Zirrix made his way up to what remained of the top floor of the Tower. The scene here was much the same as below. There were burnt and smoldering wounded and dead scattered about the shattered chamber. Seeing the King, Zirrix immediately went to him, bowed in respect and obedience, and respectfully inquired as to his Majesties health. Placing his hand upon the Zirrix’s shoulder the King responded in a satisfied tone, “We are well my General, we are very well indeed”. With that the King was engulfed within his Royal Guard and strode down the broken staircase and out of the scorched Tower. Looking about, Zirrix stepped over corpses and wounded alike, seeking one body in particular. He found it mangled, and in a broken heap in a far corner of the room. Zirrix’s mind calculated the trajectory, weight and speed of impact with military efficiency and concluded that the Wizard lying before him was in the circle closed to the center of the room. In that center was a scene which caused Zirrix to start with surprise. Walking over, he peered into the odd pulsating circle of light. Nodding grimly he recognized certain of the plants and animals he saw therein. Looking with understanding around the room, he thought to himself, “Such is the price of success”. Then, without a word, he went over and picked up the smoldering heap of seared flesh and rags, and slowly left the Tower.<br>
<br>
A sudden stirring of the body on the  bed brought Zirrix out of his recollections. Leaning in, Zirrix listened for what may be the War Wizard’s last breath. Suddenly, the wretch open it’s eyes and looked about. In those eyes was an odd light, of both pain and triumph. Looking up at his brother, Tzlar motioned for Zirrix to come closer. As he did, the General heard his brother whisper one word in a dried, rasping, and croaking voice. The Wizard then lapsed into a tortured sleep, from which he might not ever emerge. Standing straight, Zirrix nodded in agreement with the now unconscience Arcanist. Turning from the bed, an elder servant came up to the General and asked his lord what the Master had said. Looking out, seemingly beyond the Keep, Zirrix took a deep breath and answered, “Success”. As the elder servant stood in dumbfounded awe, Zirrix glanced at the body of his brother. He then turned to the servant and asked, “What of the others?”. After a moment the servant found his voice and said, “It is as we have heard through our agents my lord. Many of the Tower have died, many have yet to…but shall”. The servant involuntarily glanced at Tzlar, then continued on, ”Two of the Wizards went insane, one was immediately killed by members of her Order. The other escaped with a spell, screaming about “All knowledge for all races”. That is all we know now”. Zirrix nodded once curtly, it was as he feared. Now there was a chance that others would learn of the secrets unlocked here today. Turning to his servant he said, “Very well, watch upon your Master and care for him well. I have been summoned by his Imperial Majesty, it seems the Empire is preparing for yet another glorious campaign”. Despite his discipline, Zirrix could not help the flicker of anticipation and pleasure which sparked in his eyes at the prospect of new battles and honors to be seized in victory. As the servant bowed in acquiescence, General Zirrix T’Rhennic left the room of his gravely wounded brother in answer to a summons from his King. Thus, a new chapter of War was begun in the book of the Empire…   <br>
