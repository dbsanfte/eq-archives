<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I. Miscellaneous</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What races can be Savages?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
All Midgard races my join the House of Kelgor upon reaching level 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What are the primary statistics of the Savage?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Primary: Dexterity <br>
Secondary: Quickness <br>
Tertiary: Strength<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What armor can the Savage wear?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Savage starts wearing studded leather and will wear it their entire life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What HP table is the Savage on?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A Savage with 86 CON and no +Hits has ~1050 hitpoints.<br>
A Savage with 292 CON and ~+175 Hits has ~2100 hitpoints.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What kind of weapons can the Savage use?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Savage may specialize in Hammers, Axes, Swords, or Hand-to-Hand weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can Savages use shields?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Savage retains the small shield ability when becoming a Savage, but cannot specialize in the ability.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What level of Evade does the Savage get?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
At level 30 the Savage gets Evade IV.  At level 35, the Savage gets Advanced Evade.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How much impact does QUI have on Evade?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is something we'll never, ever know for certain.  Mythic is not willing to release the formula to us because it is too ingrained in many other highly secret formulae.  I am getting very conflicting statements pointing both directions (little effect, large effect), and am trying to find out for certain; especially considering the 50% Evade cap.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can the Savage hit the 50% Evade Cap?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We have been told that if we expect to be highly buffed on Dex/Qui, then we probably won't need the Dodger RA.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What RA table is the Savage on?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Savage RAs have not been published to the Herald yet.  I will explain them as soon as I have the full information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What is the Savage's unique RA?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I have heard it is called Ravager, but I do not have any information on it yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What are the starting stats of the Valkyn?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
While not a Savage-specific question, I get this a lot: 55 STR, 45 CON, 65 DEX, 75 QUI, 60 PIE, 60 CHA are the Midgard relevent stats. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why is the Valkyn, with it's low CON, such a poorly designed Race for Savages?  I thought the new race would be designed for the new class!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I have no idea why they chose to do that.  Honestly, I don't know what class the Valkyn IS best suited for! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Do any skills Autotrain?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How many Specialization Points does the Savage receive each level?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1.5x<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>II. Savagery Abilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What Savagery abilities does the Savage get?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
See the Camelot Herald's listing of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/spells/line.php?line=6540">Savagery</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Savagery abilities cost health instead of power.  How does this work?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When the Savage chooses to activate a Savagery buff, the system checks to see if the savage currently has enough hit points to cover the cost of the ability.  If he does not, the ability will not fire.  If he does, the ability fires and lasts for it's given duration.  At the end of the duration, the buff drops and the cost of the ability are taken from the Savage's hp pool (whatever the level of hits the Savage has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>at the time the buff drops</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How much health do Savagery abilities cost?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The cost of the abilities are based on a percentage of the Savages <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>base hitpoints</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, rather than the level of hitpoints as a result of buffs, items, or stat bonuses.  The first level buffs cost 5% and the top level cap out at 9%.  This is with the exception of Health-to-Endurance ability, which starts at a cost of 5% and caps at 15%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can I activate more than one ability if I only have the health to cover the cost of one ability?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes.  If you have 10% health, you can activate as many 9% (or less) abilities as you want.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can using these abilities kill me?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No.  If you do not have enough hits to cover the cost of a buff when the buff drops, you will simply be left with 1 hit point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How long do the abilities last?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Savagery abilities last for 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How many abilities can I have active at one time?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As many as you want.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How does the DPS buff work?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The DPS buff works differently than a standard Damage Add.  Instead of adding a specific amount of damage to each hit, the DPS buff actually increases the DPS rating of your weapons for the duration.  The DPS buff ranges in effect from 5% at the first level to 25% increase at the top level.  This means if you have 16.5dps weapons and activate the 25% buff, you will effectively have 20.6dps weaponry for 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick analysis of the 25% DPS buff done by malak8 (slightly altered for formatting by myself):<br>
<br>
[blockquote]The Damage Formula is: <br>
<br>
Damage = WeapDmg (which is a possibly capped weapon DPS) * Delay * Quality * Condition * (WeapSkill / Target's AF) <br>
<br>
The AF of your target is: <br>
<br>
Effective AF = Listed AF * Quality * (1 + (absorb * quality)) <br>
<br>
For total AF you multiply the AF formulae results by 6.(assuming all peices are same AF and quality) <br>
<br>
Effective AF = (Listed AF * Quality * (1 + (absorb * quality))) * 6 <br>
<br>
Effective AF = (102 * .99 * (1 + (.27 * .99))) * 6 <br>
<br>
Effective AF = (102 * .99 * (1 + (.26))) * 6 <br>
<br>
Effective AF = (102 * .99 * 1.26) * 6 <br>
<br>
Effective AF = (127) * 6 <br>
<br>
Effective AF = 762 <br>
___________________________________________________________________ <br>
Damage = WeapDmg (which is a possibly capped weapon DPS) * Delay * Quality * Condition * (WeapSkill / Target's AF) <br>
<br>
Damage = 16.5 * 3.5 * .99 * .99 * (1600 / 762) <br>
<br>
Damage = 16.5 * 3.5 * .99 * .99 * 2 <br>
<br>
Damage = 113 <br>
<br>
Now we activate the Savage DPS buff:<br>
<br>
DPS = (WEAPON_DPS * .25) + WEAPON_DPS <br>
<br>
DPS = (16.5 * .25) + 16.5 OR DPS = 16.5 * 1.25 <br>
<br>
DPS = 20.6 <br>
<br>
Now we do the damage formula again with the new DPS. <br>
<br>
Damage = 20.6 * 3.5 * .99 * .99 * (1600 / 762) <br>
<br>
Damage = 20.6 * 3.5 * .99 * .99 * 2 <br>
<br>
Damage = 141 <br>
<br>
So the difference in damage is 141 – 113 = 28. <br>
<br>
So 28 / 3.5(weapon SPD) = 8 DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Does the DPS buff stack with other Damage Adds?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes.  You can have a Skald DA, a Shaman/Runemaster DA, and your own DPS buff active simultaneously.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Is our DPS buff affected by resists?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes.  Our DPS buff adds directly to the DPS of our weaponry, and thus the additional damage is tempered by the targets resistance to our weaponry damage type.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How does the Haste buff work?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Haste buff works similar to that of the Warden or Friar.  As such, I'm stealing my explanation from Neill, the Warden Team Leader's website (with slight alterations for the Savage specific info). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Haste reduces your swing time (weapon delay). As a result it magnifies your base and critical hit damage because you swing more times and because haste does <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not significantly lower your damage per hit</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. There is aparently a very minor reduction to damage due to not getting a slow weapon bonus, but this difference is in the area of a couple points of damage per hit (it's not significant). So with a quickness of 60 and a 39% haste you do 63% more base and critical damage (1/(1-0.39)).<br>
<br>
As mentioned, haste only impacts base and critical damage. It does not benefit style or damage add damage. They are fixed at a specific DPS. So when you swing faster due to a haste effect the damage done with styles and damage adds is reduced for each hit such that over time you do the same amount of damage as if you were not hasted. <br>
<br>
The downside to all this is that style fatigue cost is not reduced to compensate for the lesssened damage of the styles while hasted. So with the haste buff up after burning a full bar of end you do 39% less style damage that if you had not cast it. <br>
<br>
As an example of haste impact, suppose you have enough quickness to get a 10% haste effect (approximately 120), are spec 48 in Savagery (39% haste), and wield a 3.2s delay Hand-to-Hand Claw. Your effective delay is:<br>
      3.2s * (1-0.10) * (1-0.39) = 1.7s<br>
<br>
Assuming the weapon has 16.5dps, the 3.2s weapon unhasted would hit for 16.5 * 3.2 = 52.8.  Assume each base speed hit is augmented by either 20 points of style damage or 20 points of damage add.  <br>
<br>
In a 30 second fight (the duration of the Haste buff), the 3.2s weapon affected only by your natural Quickness haste would hit would hit 10 times for 528 damage and 180 style/DA damage (completely unhasted at 3.2 seconds you could only hit for 9 full styles/DAs at 180 damage).  A hasted 3.2s weapon (effectively 1.7s) would hit 17 times for 897.6 damage and 180 style/DA damage (style/DA damage does not improve with Haste).  The effective damage improvement is 1077.6 / 708 = 52% damage improvement with a 70% base and critical damage improvement. <br>
<br>
This analysis is made assuming the presence of a Shaman to keep the Savage from running out of endurance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Is the DPS buff affected by the Haste buff?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Using the example above for reference, we activate the DPS buff.  The weapon becomes a 20.6dps weapon.  A 3.2s weapon with 20.6dps will hit for 65.9 damage each swing.<br>
<br>
In a 30 second fight, the 16.5dps, 3.2s weapon affected only by your natural Quickness haste would hit 10 times for 528 damage and 180 style/DA damage.  A hasted 20.6dps, 3.2s weapon would hit 17 times for 1120.3 damage and 180 style/DA damage.  The net improvement with both buffs is 1300.3 / 708 = 84% damage improvement, with a 112% base and critical damage improvement.  <br>
<br>
Again, this is with a Shaman endurance buff.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How does the Savage's ability to dual/triple/quadruple hit affect the DPS/Haste buffs?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The more the Savage swings, the more chances he has to dual/triple/quadruple hit his enemy.<br>
<br>
Let's say the Savage has a 50% chance to triple hit their enemy.  How does that change the effects of the DPS and Haste?<br>
<br>
In a 30 second fight, the 16.5dps, 3.2s weapons affected only by your natural Quickness haste would hit 10 + (10*3*.5) = 25 times for 1320 damage plus 180 style/DA damage.  A hasted 20.6dps, 3.2s weapon would hit 17 + (17*3*.5) = 42 times for 2217.6 damage plus 180 style/DA damage.  The net improvement of both buffs if the Savage triple hits 50% of the time is 2397.6 / 1500 = 60% damage improvement, with a 68% base and critical damage improvement.<br>
<br>
The ability to triple hit 50% of the time, combined with the DPS and Haste buffs, would improve damage over a non-hasted, single swinging character using the same exact weapon by 238% when using styles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Are the Evade/Parry buffs additional or multiplicative?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Evade/Parry buffs are additional.  This means that, when active, the % of the buff is added to the base chance to Parry/Evade.  I.e. - If the Savage has a base chance of 20% to Evade/Parry and activates the 25% buff, they will have a net 45% chance to Evade/Parry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What about the Melee Resistance Buffs?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The same is true of the Melee Resistance buffs.  They are additional as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Does the Savagery Taunt ability interrupt casters?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Do +Savagery items have any effect?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I do not see a use for +Savagery items at the moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>III. Hand-To-Hand Combat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What are the HTH styles?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
See the Camelot Herald's listing of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/styles/line.php?line=124">HTH Styles</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What are the stat modifiers on Hand-to-Hand weapons?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Hand-to-Hand weapons are based on Strength and Dexterity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can a Savage perform HTH styles with other weapons in either hand?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can a Savage wield any weapon in either hand?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Savage can only wield weapons labeled &quot;usable in left hand&quot; in their left hand.  There are now weapons other than axes in Midgard that are labeled this way that the Savage can use.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Savage has PBAE weapon styles.  How does this work?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When used, the ability will hit a designated number of enemies that are within melee range with the style.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What are the benefits of specializing in HTH weapons?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are many benefits:<br>
<br>
1.  You gain access to two damage types:  slash and thrust<br>
2.  You increase your chance to dual, triple, or even quadruple hit in a single combat round.<br>
3.  You narrow your damage variance when using HTH type weaponry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What affects your chance to dual, triple, or quadruple hit?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Your chance to dual/triple/quad hit is based on your attack roll and your specialization in HTH.  I have noticed that it is very rare to ever triple hit before ~20 spec in HTH (I had a total of two triples between spec 16 and 21).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Do dual, triple, or quadruple hits affect all enemies hit by a PBAE style?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I do not know yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How fast are HTH weapons?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The speeds range from 2.5 (I think) to 3.2s delay.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can you hit 3 or 4 times when using non-HTH weapons? (two axes or a hammer/sword for instance)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes.  You can even use non-HTH styles and still hit multiple times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Trolls start with very low DEX / QUI - won't they make terrible Savages?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Using a troll to start the game, with 35 Quickness. We then take him to level 50, adding 23 Quickness by way of autoraising (if Quickness is Secondary stat). Then buff him up with capped +75 QUI gear. Give him a Shaman Dex/Qui buff for another 70 points.<br>
<br>
That gives Mr. Troll 203 Quickness.<br>
<br>
Based on Neill's formula that 6 points of Quickness over 60 are about equal to 1% Haste, this 203 Quickness gives the troll a natural haste of 23% ( (203-60)/6 ).<br>
<br>
So then we take his weapons, the slowest available HTH at 3.2s and apply his natural haste to the weapons. This results in a weapon delay of 2.4s. If this troll were to get Savagery up to the 39% Haste buff, he'd then have weapons whose delay is 1.5s, which is right at the speed cap.<br>
<br>
Let's then say Mr. Troll can't find a Shaman to help him. He's got a Quickness of 133. That's a natural haste of about 12%. That gives him a natural weapon delay of 2.8 and a Hasted weapon dealy of 1.7.<br>
<br>
So you see, even a troll, starting with the lowest Quickness possible, is able to get near the weapon speed cap at level 50 with the slowest HTH weapon available. This is, of course, assuming that the 6 points per 1% haste is valid post-200.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Are there 16.5 dps HTH weapons?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes, player-crafted.  There are also 16.2dps Darkness Falls weapons available.<br>

Some people prefer the Axe or Hammer style lines to the HTH line.  There aren't really any good ANYTIME styles in the HTH line, while something like Axe has a pretty good anytime style and a decent Parry style.  2H Axe specs are certainly a viable option (My level 44 2h Axe/Savagery Savage was evenly matched against a level 45 Axe Zerker). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trevanti>Trevanti</A> at: 12/6/02 11:45:08 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm23>Ask the Savage TL</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
