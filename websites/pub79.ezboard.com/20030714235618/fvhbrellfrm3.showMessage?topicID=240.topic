It had been several weeks since the attack by House Mistmoore’s Undead forces upon Neriak. In the aftermath, many smaller lines had been either destroyed or absorbed by the  Greater Houses of the Empire. House T’Rhennic itself had managed to exterminate two rival houses and “convince” two Minor Houses that it would be in their best interest to meld with the Greater House. If the Minor Houses had known how much the attacks had weakened House T’Rhennic, they would not have agreed. All Houses of the Empire had been weakened by the attacks, and all had taken advantage of the disorder that followed. The Royal Guard had virtually sealed off the Palace, as a precaution, in case one or more Houses had decided to suddenly have a “vision” of the Dark Father telling them to assume the Throne. It was not uncommon for one Line or another to try and justify it’s actions by claiming divine guidance. Some had gone so far as to claim Demi-God status. Saying they were either a child of, or a material representative of, some Planar being. Thankfully, those individuals were usually executed by their own House, before such claims could be acted upon by the Cleric of the Spires. The Clerics were odd about that, when one individual, even one of their own, tries to upset the balance of things by claiming supernatural abilities or influence. Now, at this Imperial Council meeting, was the time to stabilize the Empire once again. Even a representative of their Imperial Majesties was present to observe the proceedings. <br>
<br>
Hours later, after much debate and argument, the structure of the Empire was reestablished. In actual point of fact, very little had changed. The lost Houses were removed from the rolls, the benefited House’s actions and fortunes ratified by the other Great Houses, being for the good of the Empire. Tzlar was remarkably quiet during this time, making the required motions and calls for votes as procedure demanded. He knew what was coming, he had information about what to expect. Being a Greater House, the Line T’Rhennic also had a greater share of enemies. As the meeting began to wind down, the main rival House of House T’Rhennic made it’s move. It wanted to know, what connection there was between House T’Rhennic, the Spawn of Mistmoore and the rebel “General” Faeolin. As Tzlar sat silently his fellow Council member continued. Was not both Tzlar and Zirrix members of the Violent Harvest? Where not the Spawn, called Mythral, and the rebel Faeolin both also members of that same guild? Is it not curious that the Chancellor of the Empire, along with his brother the General, were closely tied to those responsible for the rebellion yet they both “claimed” to know nothing of it? Standing, the enemy representative continued his speech. What would House T’Rhennic gain by such a position, what would one of the strongest powers in the Empire gain by a sundering of Imperial authority? Perhaps this entire event was not such a surprise, perhaps it was more then that. Or do you deny the that you are in a guild that has not only rebels, but Koada’dal and other Lightcrawlers among it’s ranks. As the other Council member sat down, all eyes, including those of the Imperial observer, turned to Tzlar and his brother Zirrix awaiting an answer for these serious charges… <br>
