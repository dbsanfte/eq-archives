<br>
a day of dares and daring<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Come quickly! away from the Aviaks! The Messenger handed Creapiing a scroll, bowed, averting his eyes, and ran back the way he had come from. Quickly unrolling the scroll, Creapiing read its contents, grinned, and began the long run to High Pass. The glories of running long and far--stretching muscles that had only endlessly lifted a blade for days--she felt the freedom of wind in her face as she ran through the dark night. She ran to High Keep based on an intercepted message that had just been delivered to her. It seemed that a Light Lover had recently been slain by gnolls in the pass while delivering a rare shield as a gift to the betrothal of certain dignitaries within Erudin. It would be a fitting item for herself *grin*, as the lightlovers would surely not even know how to best put it to use. <br>
<br>
Racing accross the plains, reflecting upon this, Creapiing suddenly found herself in the air! Rapidly she tucked her lean body into a ball and tried to tumble so as not to hurt herself in the fall. What had she stumbled on? She had not seen anything there. She landed with only a few scratches, and immediately inspected her weapons, always the most important thing to her. Then she turned and looked to see what it was she had stumbled on. Nothing was visible but she heard a low moan, and, used to the hiding of Teir'dal, she turned her head slightly to see the barest outline from the corner of her eye when she did not look directly at the spot. She reached out and grabbed at the outline, and was dumbfounded as the face that appeared was that of the Mad One. In his drunken avoidance of his visions, he had lain in the middle of the plains and hidden himself!<br>
<br>
Come with me, she said, avoid your visions for a time by spilling the blood of gnolls with me. He gazed from bleary eyes and nodded.<br>
<br>
At the first established safe spot Creapiing sent word to Vinar to join them, and knew that he would likely even arrive ahead of them, since she now had the hungover prophet in tow. He ran behind her panting and begging for water every couple minutes.<br>
<br>
Well, Dread Lord Vinar has written of the High Keep story, and I will not rebutt him, but choose to simply ignore the incident. What I will say, is that it was Dread Lord Vinar himself who reclaimed the Shield I sought, and he generously gave it to me proving once again his value to the Violent Harvest. /cheer<br>
<br>
The nights last shadow was beginning to leave, and the Mad One,Dread Vinar, the Winnower, and myself decided to kill Broon in a Drunken frenzy. As we neared broon an over dressed fop approached us. What are all of you doing? he taunted us. Broon falls easily. I myself have camped him when but a child, only you Teir'dal would find challenge in his death. Creapiing bristled at the implication. The fop continued--I dare you to duel me! you are a weak race!<br>
<br>
Creapiing unslung her Dark Reaver, a hereditary weapon, and spoke as darkly as the Kodiaks standing in shadows-- Meet me then. The fop stepped back a pace, summoned magics and the earth moved below my feet. An elemental rooted me before I could move. A slow smile crossed Creapiings face as she saw this could truly be a challenge. I defy you! she raged. She summoned her hatred, broke free of the roots holding her feet and ran at the magician, releasing all of her fury into her blows. IN her hatred she ignored the earth elemental, making sure to bring down the magician at all cost for his blasphemy. Rooted, over and over, she broke free and attacked the magician relentlessly. At last, his magics exhausted he fell bleeding at her feet. She moved back, looked at the crumpled piece of flesh at her feet and spoke....Teir'Dal will return Norrath to shadow-this is but a taste of the pain you will feel.<br>
