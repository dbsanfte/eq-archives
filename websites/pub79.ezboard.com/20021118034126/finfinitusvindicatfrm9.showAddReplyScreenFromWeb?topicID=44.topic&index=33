<br>
First you say &quot;its illegal, of course he should be punished&quot;, then when I toss the oral sex one out, you say &quot;well, yeah, its illegal, but people don't think its bad, so why should they be punished?  the jury should just let them off.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, what you're saying, in essence, is that the law is always right, unless people don't agree with it, in which case they should do what they think is right? <p></br>

Tehcnically: <br>
Both are illegal.<br>
Both should be punishable.<br>
Both up to the jury.<br>
<br>
But the fact is that you would be hard pressed to find a jury that would convict someone for the oral sex....<br>
<br>
Realistically:<br>
Police won't arrest someone for oral sex in the privacy of their home.  But would if you were caught out in public.<br>
<br>
Police won't arrest you if you are your apartment and you are smoking a single join.(Ironic both infractions are about having something in someones mouth). but they would arrest you if you get caugh in your car smoking pot.<br>
<br>
Jury would laugh their ass off when the Da tried to describe the crime... Oral Sex...   While jury would not be so.. favorable towards someone smoking pot.<br>

<br>
I cannot say much about american laws but the situation expressed by Maddie does not call for an arrest in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Two times a day is passed the casual smoker status however but considering the times he does it and that a buzz does not last more than 2 hours ( will not hamper his morning productivity) I don't think it really affects society to any point that any mesures should be taken.<br>
<br>
His children getting a bad example, and him losing moral high ground is wrong however. He can no longer use parents generic line #XYZ &quot;Don't do this, it's wrong&quot; since he himself is doing drugs, however, he can use the &quot;I've been there before and know what it's like&quot;.  This man is setting a bad example for his kids only if he tries to deny that what he is doing is wrong. He could however also use this and educate his kids about drugs and not keep them ignorent.<br>
<br>
This man is not teaching his kids to use any other drugs, he is not supporting Coke, Hero, Crack .... He is using pot and can still properly educate his children to stay away from the harder more noxious drugs.<br>
<br>
A joint is no worse than a cigarette, it is no more a gateway drug than nicotine.<br>

<br>
Smoking a joint twice a day is bad for his kids for a number reasons in my opinion.<br>
 <br>
First unlike a cigarette - it is illegal. It doesn't really matter if you agree with it or not. He is teaching his children by example that you don't need to follow the law. It is a bad lesson to teach your kids. Laws should not be followed blindly - the Civil Rights Movement is a great example of when laws should be broken. But smoking pot isn't a civil rights struggle now is it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  What if our fictious parent decided drunk driving was acceptable? That is not that far a stretch from getting baked twice a day. <br>
<br>
In addition he is teaching them that drug use is acceptable. While he may not be teaching them to use coke, heroin or other truly terrible drugs he is certainly teaching them to use pot. If it stopped right there ask yourself if that &quot;Is that OK?&quot; - personally I don't think so. While not heroin or coke - pot certainly has is downfalls. The only advantage to smoking pot is it's intoxicating effect (and some medical benefits - but we are not talking about a cataract patient <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). I chose to not expose my kids to drugs at all and alcohol only in moderation. My kids have never seen me drunk and I stopped using drugs when I became a father. I want my kids to see a clear-headed adult making responsible decisions. That is the example I want to set for my kids. His kids will certainly smoke pot because that is &quot;normal&quot; - when they rebel in their teen years what shall they do? <br>
<br>
Also where is he getting the pot? Buying it? Growing it? If he is buying it wouldn't his kids be better served with the money being saved? Invested for college? Anything but buying drugs. If he is growing - then he is probably looking at jail time if he is caught. By growing he would be taking a HUGE risk. And I didn't know anyone who grew and didn't sell. I will assume he is buying and not growing. When I smoked getting baked twice a day would cost between $10-$15 bucks a day. Let's assume the prices are pretty close (I have no idea if they are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) that's between $300 and $450 per month. That's a NICE brand new car if he chose to spend the money. It could be a college fund for his kids. Using the money for anything but drugs helps his family more than drug use - anything.<br>
<br>
Should he be arrested? Nope - but again I would suggest he would be better off quitting. So would his family.<br>
<br>
My opinion is based on the events of my life - your mileage will vary. I am trying to not sound too preachy... afterall I did smoke everyday for years <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

<br>
However, the kids would have to first be taught about drug use, in order to learn it was illegal.  The kids would have to learn something was bad, before knowing it was.<br>
<br>
Dad going outside smoking, is Dad doing Dad's thing.  Not much different than Dad that goes outside to have a pipe in the morning and at night, he doesn't smoke inside because Mamma doesn't like it.  <br>
<br>
What will be important, is education and honesty from the offending parent as the children get older.  In many ways, this could put the parent in a better position of coaching away from more dangerous influences. <br>
<br>
If I had a choice between children who smoked pot, and children who drank alcholhal, I'd prefer my kids smoke pot. With exception too the fact that they could go to jail, the end result would be much more favorable provided they didn't get caught. <br>
<br>
2 glasses of Wine a days is actually recommended by the Heart association.  <br>
<br>
Most casual pot smokers don't smoke joints, because it's an incredible waste of weed. Most of us use water pipes, or regualr pipes.  The reason I bring this up is because Sapiens metions amount consumed.  The example given would consume the equivalent of 1 cigarette every 2 days by smoking at this rate. <br>
<br>
Less than a carton a year.<br>
<br>
Wulf is right, cops don;t really go after the casual user.  In fact, if you are nice, polite, and mind yourself, you'll probobly just get in confiscated, if even that.  I've known people in sitations where cops were called to break up a fight a t a party.  When they got there, cop spots the bong in the corner &quot;Nice Bong&quot; he says, and they leave it at that.<br>
<br>
This is what is so frustrating.  Most people accept that pot is not really that dangerous of a substance.  Hell law enforcement agents even admit this; yet because of those money grubbing bastards in office, good people get labeled as bad for doing something that is no worse than what others do.<br>
----<br>
<br>
Let's say our hero is not married.  He's single, owns his own company (ice cream store) and chain smokes pot all day long.  <br>
<br>
He should go to jail?<br>
<br>
Jails are overcrowded.  We let rapists, murderers, robbers, all out early!  Simply because we don't have room for them because we're filling up prisons (70%) with non-violant drug related crimes. <br>

<br>
Again the man should not be arrested in my opinion. And he is not a bad person. I disagree with what he is doing. I believe my points are valid also. <br>
<br>
Pot is not a real harmful drug. I do believe that nicotine and alcohol are more harmful. However just because drug X is more harmful than drug Y doesnt mean drug Y should be OK to expose kids to. I hate seeing kids smoking cigerettes. I do think this is a worse problem than pot smoking. But hemp doesn't have it's own lobbying staff in Congress like tabacco does <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't think we should lock up drug users. I believe in treatment. I know it is unpopular and even /gasp - liberal - but I think the solution is treatment, not jail time. <br>
<br>
If the man was single and owned an ice cream store and chain smoked all day long should he be arrested? Nope - but dayum... I am guessing he would weigh like 400 lbs. <p><center>

I do have one question for anyone who might want to answer, and tho related, is a complete different issue. Are we better off educating our children, or rehabing them?<br>
<br>
In this case, altho smoking pot is illegal, the father is in a great position to well educate his children without them discarding it as old man ramble.<br>
<br>
PS: I stoped smoking pot 8 years ago cold turkey going from 5-6 joints a day to 1 a year yet I still can't kick the tabacco. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/binfinitusvindicat>Infinite Vision</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9>OT Discussions and Debates</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com">Infinite Vision Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <body bgcolor="#333366" text="#FFFFFF" topmargin="0" leftmargin="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
