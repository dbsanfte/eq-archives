Tilling the Soil (RP)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
General Zirrix T’Rhennic marched through the Eastern Commonlands, with a small troop of Imperial soldiers, on his way back to Neriak. He had spent the last few weeks in the Dreadlands, on the lost continent of Kunark, slaughtering the Drachnid menace. The fighting had gone well, and the campaign to eradicate one of the more hated enemies of the Respected Race was proceeding effectively. He had received a message from the Triad, the Leadership Council of the Violent Harvest, that a meeting would be held soon. At the meeting, new “Seeds” of the Harvest would be initiated (provided they were found worthy by the Dark Creator) into the guild. After that ceremony, other matters of interest to the Harvest and the Empire and it’s people would be discussed and debated. Zirrix was not usually one for meetings. He held military conferences on occasion, but they were usually short and exact. He was not very good at “banter” or “witty retorts”, and preferred to remain silent during such situations. But, he did enjoy the company of the Harvest. They were like the old Obsidian Blade, only they had their own purposes. While Zirrix was not religiously inclined, he had to admit that the philosophy of the guild did keep the members strong and the numbers steadily growing.<br>
<br>
He supposed it had much to do with the Triad itself. They, along with the various Overlords, held the respect and admiration of the guild as a whole. They worked tirelessly for both the objectives of the guild, and it’s members individual successes. In return, they were given the loyalty and obedience of the guild’s members. Together, as a group, the Harvest moved ever closer to it’s goals. At the same time, the Harvest acted to serve the Empire and expand the influence and power of the Children of Neriak across all Norrath. The badge of the Violent Harvest was quickly becoming a thing which generated fear, hatred and grudging respect. It’s members where known, not as a mob of fanatics who went of burning and pillaging into the night, but as a well disciplined organization that moved with horrifying skill and determination towards it’s objectives. They were evil without being irrational, ruthless without being wasteful, and honorable without being stupid. Combine these elements, and add the innate Teir’dal characteristics of intelligence, strength, and passion, and the result is an entity to terrible to contemplate. But, such successes do not come without a price.<br>
<br>
Even now, amongst the Lightcrawlers of all races and nations, there were groups and guilds being formed to counter the Harvest. From the wretched Elves in the East, to the tin plated Humans in the West; from the Dwarves in their mountain, to the Barbarians in their ice bound home. Thus did the other peoples of Norrath begin to band together. As Zirrix entered the city gates of Neriak, his stoic visage hid the inner smile he wore. Zirrix thought, “Yes, you pathetic sub races, you miserable mongrel parasites, join together as best you can. So much so the better, to have you all in nice, neat groups to exterminate more efficiently”. Let the rest of the world join hands together, thereby the quicker they will be swept asunder by the scythe of hatred of the Violent Harvest, and the power of the Teir’dal Empire! <br>

Reaper of the Harvest<br>

<br>
Creapiing stood beneath the Dragon of Hate, the sacred spot of their ceremonies and meetings. The Triad had taken their places to complete the triangle. She felt the power of the connection flow through them and engage the ancient power of the dragon. Surely Innoruuk watched over this meeting as he did all them, Innoruuk had never forsaken his chosen.<br>
<br>
Looking about, Creapiing caught the eye of the one called the *general*. He stood with the military dignity of one who would never look relaxed. In fact, she doubted he even relaxed in the baths. <br>
<br>
Something looked a bit different in his eye and she allowed her mind to probe deeper into his thoughts. A dark smile crossed her face. This one had come to the Violent Harvest as a military leader, but now, now he had the fervor of the prophets visions upon him. She nodded to the General, an acknowledgement that she welcomed him into the spiritual *family* that was the Violent Harvest.<br>
<br>
And with that act, the dragon of hate pulsed energy thoughout her body and the body of all in the Triad and they emanated energy and sense of purpose. Carefully she pulled forth the sacred chalice and set it upon its dark cloth, *who here requests a ceremony today?* she asked with a dark smile and deep tone.  <br>
