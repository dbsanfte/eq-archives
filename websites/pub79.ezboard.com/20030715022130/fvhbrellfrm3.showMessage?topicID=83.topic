Pravdameer helps to lay the trap. *RP*<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
*ooc* Let me state at the outset that what I am about to describe is for RP purposes only and is how Prav, ICly, saw the events of the Solus Raid on Befallen. I will state for the record that the 3 people I grouped with were fantastic, and i wish I had been able to stay longer, but RL had the nerve to step in and deny me such pleasures. In any event, on with the tale...<br>
<br>
EDIT: Posted to Vault Network and VH, OED, and House W'Rath boards RP Area.<br>
<br>
======================================<br>
<br>
Pravdameer had struggled hard since his fall to the likes of the rogue Lythe. He understood how to bide his time and build his resources. Many of those he sought vengeance upon had departed from the lands, or faded into retirement - but still there were some left to whom he owed a debt or two.<br>
<br>
As a result, when he was approached by others about one such &quot;happy couple&quot; (he couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony), he lept at the opportunity. He made the sacrifice, and descended into the bowels of Befallen amongst several of the unbelievers. The task given him, by those in charge of this foolish escapade, was to heal those within his group. He wasn’t even given the courtesy of being grouped with members of the Chosen Race - he was forced to work with a half-breed off-key bard from the group associating themselves with the traitor lokus by the name of Aaranos, a human of the lowest of classes named Quezex (he was one of those who claimed to be a &quot;Holy Warrior&quot; or what some fools called Paladins) who was from that group he had crossed paths with before named the Order of Elder Dragons, and some little ankle biter of a gnome named Jezzeth who seemed to be an enchanter who couldn't keep a single creature pacified (he was constantly blaming his failures on others within the group).<br>
<br>
Once the foursome descended into the depths, they seemed to be on their own, and Pravdameer did his best to at least _appear_ to be helping. In all actuality, he simply was waiting for just the right moment. For Atoxus had told him that She would be at this raid. He told the young Prophet that although his last creation had departed the lands for a time, there was still something of it's ilk inside of her, and this could be put to use.<br>
<br>
When the time was right, at Atoxus's command, Pravdameer departed from his body and sped up to the entrance to the caves where he had bound his spirit. (*ooc* Yes, the healer screwed up and bit the big one and died *mutter* I feel so stupid some times. *chuckle*). He searched carefully while awaiting his group members to open the doors to down below, and finally found her. While nobody else was around, Atoxus restrained her so Pravdameer would not be attacked. The young prophet then looked at her and said, &quot;I know you for what you are, creature - and I offer a proposition.&quot; When the beast seemed to offer no response other than a snarl, the young prophet laid out his plan. The beast then smiled a cold sadistic grin as she cackled with unreserved glee and removed the wedding ring from the finger of it's host and handed it to the priest. &quot;Be sure he gets his gift as soon as possible,&quot; she said before rending her way back into the bowels of befallen. Soon after, the Prophet found an excuse to be done with these fools, and left the lightdwellers to their fate.<br>
<br>
At Atoxus's direction, he headed for Freeport. For there, Atoxus told him, was the woman he would need. As he went, he changed his garments and became what many in Freeport seemed to know him as - the wandering tier'dal tradesman who seemed alright. After some work for the town, he had managed to be somewhat accepted - even if only with a degree of apprehension. At least now he could do business in this fould wretched city and not cause too much commotion. He hated having to soil himself so, but then that was probably why Atoxus insisted upon it.<br>
<br>
He arrived in Freeport, and went down the alleys until he came upon the young wood elf lass Atoxus had told him would be there. She was perfect - just the right skin color and size - she even had the look of a ranger to her. He stopped the young woman and said, &quot;Excuse me, but would you try this ring on? My bride to be is just about your size, and I want to be sure that it fits.&quot; Somewhat suspiscious still, the young girl was finally enticed by the bag of platinum that dark elf held out to her. &quot;You can have this if you'll just place the ring on your finger my dear.&quot; As the girl placed the ring on, and Pravdameer saw it was a proper fit he nodded his head, and then handed the bag to the girl with one hand, and brought his mace around with the other and smashed in her skull. He then quickly grabbed the skinning knife out of his pack and neatly severed the finger with the ring still on it. &quot;Yes my dear, and I guess you won't be needing this anymore either,&quot; he said as he grabbed his bag of coins. He quickly hurried off as Atoxus warned him of approaching guards, and hurried back to the safety of Nektulos.<br>
<br>
As he arrived safely back at his new home, he smiled with anticipation. He called for his guildmate Xareth, and gave him the finger with the ring still on it. Xareth smiled with sadistic glee as the young Prophet laid out his plans, then nodded once and was off to deliver the message. &quot;Ah yes, my friend,&quot; Pravdameer said to Atoxus. &quot;It won't be long now before we have a new guest in the dungeons. I wonder if this rogue will be as much fun as the one named Lythe was?&quot; <br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Xareth made his way through the Erudite city, once again locked in the foul body of the young bard he so hated. It was a disgusting feeling, to use this curse in such a manner, but it would work well for the purpose. The rogue he sought, Minz, was somewhere in the forest outside of Erudin, waiting for his guildmate, Silverstarr, to appear. Well, he would soon learn the truth. <br>
<br>
The false bard ran to the edge of the city to the Toxxulia Forest and waited for the half elf to make his appearance. Before long, he did, and Xareth approached nonchalantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, light brother. How goes your hunt?&quot; He saw Minz raise an eyebrow at him and resisted the urge to run him through with his sword right then and there. Best to wait, to make him suffer. <br>
<br>
Minz shrugged. &quot;I'm fine, Sil. You feeling alright? You seem a little different.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, I feel fine. I merely had something of value to give you.&quot; Xareth eyed the large pike the rogue was sporting. A new weapon, probably poisonous. He made a mental note of it for future notice<br>
<br>
The rogue's eyes lit up and he stepped forward. Xareth involuntarily stepped back a pace and held out a hand. &quot;Patience. A moment, I will show you…&quot; He grinned wickedly and reached for the small black pouch he'd retrieved earlier. He loosened the strings and opened the bag, not letting the rogue, who was hopping around him and trying to peek, see its contents. His mall Wood Elven hand (*spit*) closed around the lone item and pulled it free of the bag.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, rogue. I think you should find this an item of interest.&quot; Chuckling coldly, he handed the finger with Orrianna's ring on it to Minz and stepped back. <br>
<br>
Minz stared at it for a moment, frozen with horror. &quot;What… what is this??!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Xareth, no longer posing as the bard, grinned and retreated back a few paces, putting space between them. &quot;What is the matter, elf? Don't recognize your own wife's ring?&quot; <br>
<br>
The rogue roared and launched himself at Xareth, dropping both the finger and his pike. Xareth saw it coming and kicked into reverse, but the bard's body responded too slowly and he wound up on the ground, with a very irate rogue pinning him. &quot;YOU! What have you done! Where is Silver?? Where is MY WIFE!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Xareth regarded him cooly, enjoying the other's hatred and pain. He knew that the rogue would not seriously injure him while he was in control of Silverstarr's body. No, Minz would never do that to his friend. Xareth let the enraged rogue shake him roughly for a minute, and wondered how far Minz would go to get his answers. Would he actually hurt him in Silver's body? He considered that for a minute. It would most definitely ride heavily on the half elf's mind later if he did. No, best not try this time. He needed to get the rogue to go to Nektulos.<br>
<br>
The false bard shoved Minz off him and stood. Minz was panting now, breathless from shouting obscenities and demands. His face was flushed almost purple, and Xareth could see pure rage burning in his eyes. Good. &quot;Are you ready to listen, lightdweller? Or shall I just leave and allow your wife to die at the hands of our priest, Pravdameer?&quot; The rogue reacted to Pravdameer's name and started for him again. Xareth shot a hand up in warning. &quot;Careful, light one. I will tell you this: we have Orrianna. If you want to see her alive again, and in respectively good health, seek Pravdameer and I in the Lavastorm Mountains. But be wary… you come alone. Try to trick us, and she will die. Quite painfully, I might add.&quot; <br>
<br>
Minz glared death at him. &quot;How DARE you… I will have your head for this Xareth, I swear it. You and Pravdameer both.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The false bard stared at him in mock shock. &quot;Oh? We shall see, light one. I suggest you hurry.&quot; He retreated into the shadows of the forest, chuckling evilly. Minz glared, his eyes promising death. On an impulse, Xareth stopped, still within Minz's sight, and let Silverstarr collapse to the ground. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
He returned to his own self a short while later. His whole body hurt, and fatigue had set into his mind. He needed rest, but that could wait until he reported to Pravdameer. He stood stiffly and stretched. Prav would want to know quickly, so that the trap might be set up before the rogue made his way across the continent to them. <br>
<br>
Xareth set out for where he knew the Priest would be, and looked forward to the fun that lay ahead.<br>

<br>
The damned cats had really taken it out on him. He and Silver could have easily defeated the onslaught of feline ferocity. Worse yet, the four cats that were now focusing all there loving attention on him, stood between him and the door!<br>
<br>
&quot;SILVER!!&quot; He yelled.<br>
<br>
His only answer was a fierce slash of claws across his face.<br>
<br>
Jabbing hard with his harpoon, Minz drove the noxious piece of fur back. Feinting to his right, he drew the cats off balance, forcing them to over extend their slashing attacks. Creating an easy opening for him to dive under. But he hit the earth to hard, twisting his wrist. <br>
<br>
?DAMN!!? He yelled inwardly. 'How in the hell do you expect to roll holding a 5 foot spear!!?? IDDIO . . . ' But the claws in his back cut his self-chastisment short. His training kicked into action automatically. 'ROGUE ESCAPE PLAN NUMBER 324' His practice and study?s were paying off. Without even thinking about it, his mind analyzed the situation and put forth his best and only option.<br>
<br>
Pulling his feet underneath him, he launched himself into a sprint for the exit. Flailing his arms above his head, screaming at the top of his lungs. <br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
============================<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll have your head Xareth!!!&quot; Minz shouted into the woods.<br>
<br>
Feathered wings fluttered, startled at the harsh voice crashing through the serene atmosphere of the Toxx Forrest.<br>
<br>
He willed his legs to move, but the couldn't. He felt weak and leaden. A shock of chill seemed to wrap around him. &quot;Nnnooo,&quot; he whispered. Dropping to his knees. &quot;Please no.&quot; Silver, or Xareth, as she had called herself, was gone. Melting into the woods.<br>
<br>
Looking down her beheld with horror the disembodied finger. Soft and delicate. Slender, belying its . . . her strength. His stomach churned as he imagined it being wrenched from her body. It was no clean cut. Nooo that would have been a mercy. But torn, ripped from her hand. <br>
<br>
Tendons stretched<br>
<br>
Skin torn <br>
<br>
Veins and artteries ripped in two<br>
<br>
Minz shuddered. He'd seen far worse gore. But none had ever shaken him soo deeply. Tentatively he reached for it, shying away form touching the lost digit. Sighing heavily, the rogue placed his harpoon atop the finger, and pried the ring off with his stiletto. Trying, unsuccessfully to leave the fair skin of the lost finger unmarred.<br>
<br>
Holding it in his hands, he relived the moment of his proposal. The were stalking bandits in the Karanas. The moon was high in the sky, and they were resting. Orrianna sat against a tall tree, while he was lying on his side, stretched out on the earth . . .<br>
<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
Nervously, Minz twisted the ring on his pinky with his thumb. It was a small thin band of gold with a fine gem set in it. So small was the ring that it would not pass his second knuckle.<br>
<br>
Nothing too fancy. He had stolen grander rings. No, not too fancy at all.<br>
<br>
This ring he had actually bought.<br>
<br>
It was far too small on even his nimble elven fingers. The ring was clearly meant for the hand of a lady. And he had a particular lady in mind.<br>
<br>
Orri, more than anyone else, had helped him find himself again. Her unrelenting care. She had tended his wounds when they needed it and kicked him in the butt as well. As his feelings grew for her, he could feel the sanguine fury shough away from him. Like a snake shedding its skin.<br>
<br>
There were many hands that pulled him from the deep end of his soul, but few that had touched him so deeply. Whether she knew it. 'Gods I hope that she does know,' Minz thought. They had declared their love for eachother. They had shared their passion, their hurt and their shame. But neither would or could yield. The flame of their hearts pulled them together like nothing he had ever felt. And now they sat here. On his farm, under the night sky.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are so beautiful,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Orri blushed. She was still not completely comfortable with his affections. But she pushed him away no more. Her glares had become less vehement when he called her &quot;Lady.&quot; And she let him help her. All of this brought more joy to his heart then he could put into words. 'Is it too soon?' he thought. 'Am I moving too fast? We are both so young. Not that young though.' He had argued with himself for quite some time now.<br>
<br>
The two sat in silence a while longer. Holding eachothers hands. Watching the breeze chase the clouds across the night sky.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am trying to think of a last name Minz,&quot; Orri said. It was a common practice for denizens of Norrath to take new surnames as the entered adulthood. Not universal, but common enough. Orri stared up at the clouds, lost in her ponderings.<br>
<br>
'HELL!' though Minz. 'Now or never!' &quot;I know a good one,&quot; he said<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Orrianna replied, still lost in thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Elandril,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
The name pulled her out of her musings, and she looked at him quizzically. &quot;Elandril?&quot; she asked, not connecting the name to Minz.<br>
<br>
Scooting closer to her, Minz said simply, &quot;It's my family name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Recognition of what Minz was saying lit Orri's face like the sun rising over the plains. The color drained out of her face, and her eyes grew a bit wider. Minz slipped the glove off his left hand and pulled the slim engagement band free of his pinky. Orri seemed to will speech, but no words fell from her lips. Taking her hand, he put the ring on her slender finger. &quot;Marry me Orrianna, and I'll spend the rest of my days trying to make you happy.&quot;<br>
<br>
He drifted back out of his memories, only to find his face wet with tears. &quot;Lavastrom.&quot; He muttered as he set out to look for the wizards spires and his wife.<br>
<br>

&quot;Orri! I have to give her back the wallet AND the money?&quot;<br>
