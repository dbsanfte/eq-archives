This is the revised and expanded version of the story Anari, Maladwen, Creapiing, Selilya and myself all started writing long ago. To help explain chronology this happened during the time when the Harvest was infected with the Plague of Bertoxxulous, and it ends shortly after the Harvest destroyed the Drachnid Queen in the Crystal Caverns to cure themselves.<br>
<br>
There should be a little more to come soon as well, and I will add that in as we get it done.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy.<br>

<br>
<br>
Vengeance<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Anari<br>
<br>
There was no sun here, even in the forest beyond the cavernous entrance to the city. It was as if the sun - the embodiment of good and light - refused to show itself in the face of such perversion and deviance.  Thus was the life of the Teir`Dal, forever in the dark and the shadows.  Always shunned by the light. <br>
<br>
She had not tread the stone floors of Neriak in many years.  There had been no reason for her to return, no desire to revisit that part of her life.  Yet as she walked past the soldiers that guarded the entrance to the Third Gate, a strange sense of calm washed over her - a feeling that her life had finally come full circle. <br>
<br>
She ran an ebon hand through her platinum hair as she walked, her emerald eyes adjusting to the shifts in magical light with forgotten ease.  With a sigh, she brought her thoughts out of the past and back to the task at hand.  She had not returned to Neriak for a walk down memory lane, but to attain that which she had hungered for since the first moment she had met him. <br>
<br>
Vengeance. <br>
<br>
The Maiden’s Fancy was a house of free flowing alcohol and easy women - some Teir`Dal, some not.  It was the place to be if you wanted a good time, or information.  She knew that the one she sought would be here, partly for the wine and debauchery, but more for the loose tongues and purses of the patrons. <br>
<br>
She pushed the door open, rapidly taking in every face in the room.  A smile crossed her lips when she saw her prey.  In a few strides she was standing beside the young Teir`Dal woman.  She placed a hand on the young one’s shoulder, leaning in so her lips were close to the other’s ear. <br>
<br>
“Forgive the interruption, young S`Therik, but I have an urgent message from your brother Khasirath.”<br>
<br>
The young one turned her head, “Oh, what does he want of me now?” she said with a sly grin, her voice awash with sarcasm. <br>
<br>
“Again, forgive me, but this is not the place.” <br>
<br>
The young one narrowed her emerald eyes a moment, then nodded.  She rose from her seat and followed out into the streets.  In silence they moved to a secluded spot not far from the brothel. “What is this ‘urgent’ message?” <br>
<br>
Anari spun suddenly, her hand balling into a fist the instant before it connected with the young S`Therik’s jaw.  “Really now, Tzanntiel, has the Ebon Mask taught you nothing?”  Grabbing the surprised young woman by the hair she drove her face into the cavern wall.  “I’m quite disappointed.” <br>
<br>
Holding the stunned woman up against the wall, she slowly and methodically searched the young one's body, removing all the weapons she found.  When she was finished, she spun her around so they were eye to eye. <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel could see the hatred in the eyes of her assailant.  “Who are you?” she hissed in anger, ignoring the scrapes oozing blood down her cheek. <br>
<br>
Anari shook her head, striking out once again and slapping the woman hard.  “Questions, questions, questions.  You S`Therik’s and all your god damn questions!&quot;  She slammed her hand against the wall beside Tzanntiel’s head, bringing her face an inch from the woman’s.  “Tell me S`Therik whore child, do you honestly think I came here to answer your questions?” <br>
<br>
“Then what do you want?” Tzanntiel growled as her emerald eyes blazed with hate. <br>
<br>
Anari sneered, wrapping her hand around the woman’s throat.  “That was another question, but it is one I am more than willing to answer.” <br>
<br>
Her free hand moved quickly, removing the dirk from her belt and driving it into Tzanntiel’s stomach. “Your dear brother brutalized me.”<br>
<br>
She withdrew the dirk, only to stab her once again. “He humiliated me.” <br>
<br>
Another thrust of the blade.  “Hell he even killed me!” <br>
<br>
Closely she watched every grimace and silenced every cry of pain with a squeeze of her hand.  She did not flinch as the younger Rogue's nails tore into the flesh of her wrist.  With a wicked smile, she released her hold on the young one, letting her fall to the ground.  Already a pool of blood spread across the stones beneath them. <br>
<br>
She looked down at the rapidly paling Teir`Dal.  “Do you begin to understand child? You are going to be my message to him.”  She knelt down, uncaring of the blood staining the raven-scale of her leggings. <br>
<br>
“You will suffer, though not as I suffered, and you may yet survive this, if you are strong enough.”  She brushed the hair from the woman’s face and lifted a now cold hand into hers. <br>
<br>
“Are you strong enough?” <br>
<br>
In one fluid motion, she sliced her dirk across Tzanntiel’s exposed throat and placed the young woman’s hand over the wound. <br>
<br>
“If you wish to die, all you need to do is let go.  But to survive, that is up to you.  Either way, my message will be delivered.  He wanted me to hate, and so I do.” <br>
<br>
Without a second thought, she stood and walked away.  Without a moment of regret, she made her way out of the maze that was Neriak and into the Nektulos Forest.  She would not return, she knew, nothing could ever bring her back to that accursed place.  She had no need.  She carried the seed of the Teir`Dal now, the essence of what they were - what she now was.  She had been shown the power of hate, and had answered its call. <br>
<br>
As she stepped into the warmth of the sun that shone throughout the Commonlands, her bloodied hand reached toward her face and removed the mask that had created the illusion she had needed.  Her image shimmered, and then melted away to that of a Fier`Dal.  With a smile on her face, Anari Ravensblade headed back to Freeport. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Maladwen<br>
<br>
Applause was heard from behind Anari just as she entered the gates of the city of corruption.  She spun without a second thought, her dirk meeting the man's throat. <br>
<br>
“I'm a messenger from the General, Anari.  I was just applauding your show.  You have become everything he remembers, and more.” <br>
<br>
The young Elf gently removed the dirk from his neck and bowed before her.  She raised a brow at him, having not been pleased that the General was watching her.  The Fier`Dal dressed in simple leather removed something from his shirt.  It was a red box in the shape of a heart.  He handed it to her, and it said something in a tongue she couldn't seem to make out.  “It means, ‘To be Happy on a Such a Joyous Occasion’,” the elf said before disappearing into the shadows. <br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel struggled to her feet, pressing her back against the rough wall for support.  She held one arm pressed over the wounds on her stomach as she tightly clenched her slashed throat with the other hand.  She could feel her whole body trembling and growing colder, her fingers slick with her own life's blood, making it hard to keep her grip. <br>
<br>
She panted raggedly as she tried to focus her vision on the alley ahead of her, foamy blood flecking her lips.  Weakly she staggered down the alley, her legs so cold and weak she feared she would collapse at each step. <br>
<br>
The shifting glow of Neriak's lights dazzled her clouding eyes, confusing her as she limped down the street, growing numb to the desperate pain.  Faces swam through her vision as she stumbled, their eyes turning away in disgust.  In Neriak, no one would help the weak unless they had a vested interest, and usually common blood.  Tzanntiel's pale lips moved silently as she prayed that she might find a House servant out on some business.<br>
<br>
At first her mind was only filled with fear and blind panic.  She knew her House had enemies, but S`Therik's strength had protected her from such overt attacks before.  And this stranger's words had led her to other thoughts; she could not have been Teir`Dal if Khasirath had done those things to her.  Unless she had been a Heretic, Tzann thought.  But the pain made it hard for her to focus on any one thought, her mind jumping from fear to fear, panic stealing her already labored breath. <br>
<br>
She staggered this way and that, trying to find her way to the Lodge of the Dead, which was near the manse of House S`Therik.  But all the streets looked the same, and her weakening heart pounded harder as she thought she surely must be lost.  Darkness closed in tighter as she realized she'd turned into a dead-end alley.  Tears streaming down her cold cheeks, she leaned against the wall to try to catch her bearings. <br>
<br>
In a swoon she closed her eyes, her mind tumbling deeper into the pain as it razed through every nerve of her being.  The fear began to burn away as her anger grew - anger at her own confusion and weakness, anger at the pain itself.  And above all blazed an intense hatred for the woman that had brought it all upon her.  Tzanntiel gasped softly, fresh blood bubbling past her lips as the hatred swelled to permeate her entire being.  For the first time in her life she understood with unmistakable clarity the rapturous snarl she had seen on her father's and brother's faces in battle.  For the first time, the Father's own Hatred touched the girl, and she understood what she had only been paying service to in words for so many years. <br>
<br>
Opening her emerald eyes, Tzanntiel stared at the alley's end, and for a moment the fear almost returned as she thought perhaps she had never left the alley she'd been attacked in.  Perhaps everything she'd seen had just been a confused dream.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Selilya<br>
<br>
The meeting of the Triad had ended well, and Selilya had donned her cloak and was walking back to her cottage.  She nodded at the skeletal servant of House S`Therik as she stepped onto the pathway.  It saluted, holding the gate open for her and her guard to pass. <br>
<br>
The Triad had discussed many issues this night, and Selilya was mulling over the main topics yet again.  The threat of war was very real and training was a concern.  She was thinking of several options, when she heard a loud crash in the alley she was approaching.  Gathering her wits she drew her dagger, then peered into the darkness.  Corporal P`Traz stepped in front of her to ensure her safety and drew his sword.  Selilya could see someone nearby, struggling to stand… <br>
<br>
“What in the name of Innoruuk…” Selilya gasped.  As she and the Corporal approached, the silhouette stumbled to Selilya's feet.  She bent down to turn the female shadow over.  “Tzanntiel! No, no… you hold on,” she whispered to Khasirath's sister. <br>
<br>
“Corporal P`Traz!” she yelled out to her assigned protector.  “Quickly! Give me your cloak, so we can cover this child.  Good.  Now, go get the Thresher and his sister, the Cleric.”  She placed the cloak on the pale, shivering Tzanntiel.  There was so much blood caked on her that Selilya could not imagine how she lived. <br>
<br>
“Don't die on us.  Hang on.  Your brother and sister are coming,” Selilya softly spoke.  “I promise…we'll find the one who did this.  They will pay dearly…very dearly.” <br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Maladwen<br>
<br>
Maladwen smirked at this sight, and left the gates of Neriak unnoticed as usual.  He liked the fact that Anari had done this, chosen such a cruel way to set an example, something he'd done many times in the past.  He left the city with little confrontation. <br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
Anari<br>
<br>
The sun had begun its descent behind the dunes of sand.  Night was fast approaching and the skiff would be arriving soon.  Ignoring the prattle of the gnome that stood before the dock, Anari dipped her wounded hand into the ocean water.  A hiss of pain escaped her lips as the salt water coursed into the open gashes on her wrist, washing the blood away. <br>
<br>
The brat had hurt her more than she had thought.  She could see the tendons beneath her skin move every time she shifted her fingers, the flesh having been torn away.  Leaving her injured hand in the water she reached into her pack and retrieved a roll of bandages.  Not waiting for her hand to dry she began to wrap her wrist. <br>
<br>
A smile crossed her face.  She had done it.  She had beaten the bastard at his own game.  True, he probably wouldn’t morn the loss of his sister should Tzanntiel die, but she had entered his domain and had attacked one close to him.  There would be retribution, of that she was certain, but it would take him some time to narrow down the number of people who hated him. <br>
<br>
The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end a heartbeat before she heard the footsteps on the dock.  Her heart all but stopped at the thought that Khasirath had found her already.  As the shadow of the person blocked the setting sun she instinctively reached for her dirk.  Turning her head she looked up, her eyes going wide in recognition.  “General?  You were the last person I was expecting.” <br>
<br>
A small smirk formed on Maladwen Shadowlurker’s lips, like a child with a secret.  “I’m full of surprises.  Mind if I sit beside you?” <br>
<br>
“Please do.”  She nodded and went back to her bandaging. <br>
<br>
He watched her as he sat, his feet dangling over the side of the dock.  “What happened?” <br>
<br>
She chuckled as she tied off the ends of the bandage with her teeth and free hand.  “Come now, General, no games.  I spoke to your messenger and know that you have been watching me.” <br>
<br>
“Aye, that I have.  That was quite a show you put on for me back in Neriak.  What was that all about Anari?  I've rarely seen you act with such… ferocity.” <br>
<br>
She slipped her hand back into her scaled glove, an uncommon hatred glowing in her eyes.  “A little payback is all, and it wasn’t for you.  It was something that’s been coming for a long time.” <br>
<br>
He raised a brow, noticing the look in her eyes.  “He must have done something awful.” <br>
<br>
She shook her head.  “No, it wasn’t awful. It was worse than that.”  She turned to face him.  “Why should you care?  Last time we spoke you made it perfectly clear that you wanted nothing to do with me.  Why the change?” <br>
<br>
“I feel it is time to renew friendships.  Anari, you still have a strong place in my heart.  I was angered, and I felt betrayed, two things that don't mix easily with me.  But I'm sure you're happy now, you have someone you care about...  The only thing I see wrong is that you have the need to take revenge on someone.” <br>
<br>
Anari stared at him, astonished.  “Happy?”  She chuckled.  “My life is anything but happy, General.  And as for that someone you mentioned - he was a mistake.  Hurting you was a mistake.” <br>
<br>
He looked at her sadly.  “Anari, I…”<br>
<br>
The blabbering gnome talking about how the ship was coming interrupted him.  He got to his feet, offering her his hand to help her up. <br>
<br>
She took his hand in hers and rose.  He pulled her onto the skiff, only to catch her as her foot slipped on the wet wood and she fell into his arms.  She swallowed the lump that suddenly formed in her throat.  “Are you going to Velious, General?” <br>
<br>
He smiled at her.  “Aye, I am.” <br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Khasirath<br>
<br>
Khasirath pounded down the streets of Neriak, four House soldiers following behind with the young Priestess Vhalshae in their midst.  The Thresher's eyes blazed with deadly fury, and most who saw him coming stepped quickly out of his way.  Any who did not were roughly shouldered aside.  He did not slow a bit until he came to the place where the Winnower knelt beside a prone figure draped in a bloody cloak.  His escort had fallen behind, unable to match his breakneck speed or his intimate knowledge of the twisting passages of the Third Gate. <br>
<br>
Khasirath dropped heavily to his knees beside the Winnower, his face paling as he looked at his sister's horrible wounds.  “Innoruuk, let her survive this,” he muttered as he pulled off his gauntlets to cup her cold cheek in his palm, trying to rouse her.  “Tzann, I'm here.  Vhalshae is too.  It's alright now, I will not let you go.” <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel's eyes fluttered open a moment, her pale lips moving without sound.  Khasirath couldn't even tell is she could see him.  He saw her trembling hand clutched at her throat, the blood sluggishly oozing from between her fingers.  He laid his hand over hers, helping her hold the wound as he reached deep within his own hatred. <br>
<br>
&quot;My life to yours, sister,&quot; he whispered as he let his own life force and hate flow into her, and the hideous slash began to close. <br>
<br>
Vhalshae had reached them at last, and she knelt across from Khasirath, taking Tzanntiel's free hand into her own.  Softly she began to chant in prayer, and her own powers began to strengthen Tzanntiel, healing her other wounds. <br>
<br>
Selilya continued to stroke the young Rogue's hair as Khasirath and Vhalshae poured their power and life into their sister.  The worry faded from the Winnower's brow as the color returned to Tzanntiel's cheeks and her eyes opened, clearly focusing on her brother's face. <br>
<br>
“Khas,” she whispered, her voice weak, but full of relief. <br>
<br>
“Who did this to you?” he asked, stroking her cheek gently with his fingers. <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel frowned, still struggling with the pain and the powerful hate she felt, “I don't know... she did not tell me her name.  She said it was a message to you.  She said you had brutalized her and humiliated her and killed her.  She was a Rogue; I recognized her Ravenscale armour.  And she looked Teir`Dal.  But you would not do those things to one of our people, would you?”  Her eyes searched her brother's face in confusion. <br>
<br>
Khasirath growled deeply as it all came clear.  “Ravensblade,” he said.  “She is not Teir`Dal, Tzann.  She is Fier`Dal, and she will pay in blood for what she has done to you, I swear it.” <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded a little, trying to sit up.  She gasped in pain, and Khasirath gently pushed her back down.  For once she did not fight him, and she gave Vhalshae's hand a gentle squeeze of thanks.  The young Priestess looked drained from drawing so much of herself into the healing. <br>
<br>
Khasirath looked up at Selilya, “Thank you for helping my sister, Winnower.  I owe you a great deal for that.” <br>
<br>
Selilya smiled, waving a hand dismissively,  “We of the Harvest are family as surely as you S`Therik's are family.  You do not owe me anything.” <br>
<br>
Khasirath bowed his head in thanks, a thin smile on his lips, though Selilya could see the dangerous rage burning in his violet eyes. <br>
<br>
“And Thresher, if you need any help with this Ravensblade, you need only call upon the Harvest.  The enemy of one is the enemy of us all,” she added. <br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded, though he looked reluctant.  “Thank you Winnower.  I need only find her, and then I will end it myself.  This matter has become very personal.” <br>
<br>
Selilya nodded in understanding. <br>
<br>
Khasirath gathered his gauntlets up and tucked them under his belt, then scooped Tzanntiel up carefully to carry her home.  Vhalshae walked behind him, slipping her hands into the sleeves of her robes.  Silently the four soldiers fell into step around them. <br>
<br>
Over his shoulder Khasirath said, “I will have the cloak cleaned and returned to you on the morrow.  Thank you again, Winnower.” <br>
<br>
As they walked towards House S`Therik, Tzanntiel looked up at Khasirath,  “This Ravensblade... she also said you wanted her to hate, and that she does.” <br>
<br>
Khasirath sighed softly, “Tzann, she may have learned to hate, as I wanted, but she still has Bristlebane's taint of cowardice and dishonor.  It was cowardly to harm you when it is me she wants.  I will be sure she learns that last lesson before she dies.”<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Creapiing<br>
<br>
The darkness of her office emanated out into her apprentice’s room.  Waves of Hate and rage could be felt from within and as she walked in to begin her long day of papers and reports, her apprentice made a single gesture, indicating that someone awaited her inside.  Very few citizens had the ability or status to await her in her offices and the news that awaited Creapiing must be important.  Once again, she would be too busy to sneak out for a little fishing and she sighed so softly that no person could hear. <br>
<br>
“Khasirath! What news has brought you here?”<br>
<br>
The Thresher’s face was twisted with a hate that Creapiing saw rarely and the sheer strength of his presence was nearly overwhelming as he used the Father’s gift.  Creapiing’s office was blacker than the charred remains of fire and deep shadow covered Khasirath’s face. <br>
<br>
“House S`Therik was attacked.  More of a personal message to me I believe.  Reaper, I ask your leave from Neriak for a short time.” <br>
<br>
Creapiing’s face could not hide the concern she held, and in a rare moment of softness she said, “Only tell me how I can aid you and I will be there for you Khasirath.”<br>
<br>
Her hand strayed as she briefly brushed the Thresher’s shoulder.  “Personal message or not, we are a family, and a strike on House S`Therik is the same as a strike to my own heart.  The Father’s hate this day has made you strong, but the rage you feel will make you blind.  I plead with you to take me with you in this.”<br>
<br>

<br>
Anari<br>
<br>
The skiff never stayed for long, a few minutes at most, and then by some unknown magic it would start its journey to an island in the Iceclad Ocean.  Today was no different, and Anari was grateful that she and Maladwen were the only ones making the journey.  At first they traveled in silence, an unanswered tenseness filling the air between them.  As the skiff moved further away from the shores of the Northern Desert of Ro, the waters became more active, and soon the land was no longer in sight. <br>
<br>
She felt an arm snake around her waist, pulling her into an embrace.  Smiling she turned in the hold, wrapping her arms around his neck.  “Hello my husband.” <br>
<br>
He kissed her then, his passion evident in every passing second.  After a moment their lips separated and he smiled.  “Hello my love.”  She turned once again, his arms never releasing her, and looked out at the moving water.  With a contented sigh she leaned her head against his chest. <br>
<br>
Maladwen closed his eyes as he rested his chin on her shoulder.  “Do you think anyone was watching us?” <br>
<br>
She shrugged.  “I’ve felt eyes on me since before I even entered Neriak.  I haven’t felt them since I left Freeport, but I can’t take the chance.” <br>
<br>
“Well I hope they bought that little performance.  I’m finding it hard to keep my hands off you when we’re together.”  He sighed and nuzzled the nape of her neck.  “How much longer must we sneak around like this?” <br>
<br>
Reaching up she wove her fingers into his hair.  “We agreed that we would keep our marriage secret until after I have dealt with Khasirath.” <br>
<br>
He growled at the mention of that name.  “I hate that he has this much control over our life.  I want to tell the world that we have reunited and wed.” <br>
<br>
“Patience love.”  She shifted her head to look up at him.  “If I know S`Therik, he will want payback for what I did to his sister.  It won’t be much longer before I face him again.” <br>
<br>
“Before we face him.”  He caressed her face with the back of his hand.  “I’m not going to let you confront him alone, not after what he did to you.” <br>
<br>
She took his hand in hers and held it to her lips.  “I still don’t think that you getting involved is a good idea.  With your position in Kelethin you don’t need an enemy like the Thresher of Violent Harvest.” <br>
<br>
“Ana, I already am an enemy of Violent Harvest.  You know that.” <br>
<br>
She shook her head.  “Enemy of a guild is one thing.  Enemy of Khasirath S`Therik is different, trust me on this my love.” <br>
<br>
He kissed her forehead.  “If it would keep you safe, I would make an enemy of the gods.” <br>
<br>
She looked up at him again.  “That is a little unnecessary.” <br>
<br>
The boat lurched to a stop, almost sending the unprepared couple into the water.  Hand in hand they hurried past the giggling gnome to the other side of the island.  The Icebreaker was just preparing to leave the docks the same moment they arrived and they quickly made their way up the boarding plank. <br>
<br>
There were a handful of other people aboard and with a sly smile Maladwen led her to a secluded area at the back of the ship.  As the boat began its journey he took her in his arms once more.  “So how long will you let us be together this time?” <br>
<br>
A playful look filled her eyes and she lightly ran her finger down his arm.  “Well that depends.” <br>
<br>
“On?” he prompted when she didn’t elaborate. <br>
<br>
She kissed the tip of his nose.  “On how long can you stay?” <br>
<br>
He chuckled.  “Oh a very, very long time.” <br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Khasirath<br>
<br>
Khasirath sighed deeply as he raked his fingers back through his long hair in frustration.  “My Reaper, I am deeply honored that you wish to accompany me.  But is it not better that you remain with the Harvest, lest one of our enemies attack while I am away?” <br>
<br>
Creapiing smirked wryly, “Khasirath, you know as well as I that the whole of the Harvest is prepared to defend against any fools who might strike against us.” <br>
<br>
Her expression darkened with worry as she continued, “And I truly fear your rage against this woman could lead you to doom.  You should not go alone lest she lead you into a trap.  From her actions it is clear that she has no honor, and she may be clever enough to use your rage against you.” <br>
<br>
Khasirath lowered his head, looking down at the floor.  Within he struggled to rein in the rage enough to fully consider the Reaper's words.  As he realized how difficult it was, it gave him pause.  Always before he had been the master of his hatred, in control of that divine gift.  Now it was ruling him, and he knew that was the first step of the Path of Death.  Perhaps it was the Plague of Bertoxxulous, he thought.  He could feel the fever burning within, though the rage often drowned it out.  He had seen how it had already affected the minds of some Harvesters. <br>
<br>
He shook his head as he looked up at the Reaper without lifting his head, and the deep shadows shrouded his face, leaving his eyes to shine violet-red from the darkness.  “I think you are right, Creapiing.  I may be losing control.”<br>
<br>
A long silence stretched between them as each watched the other, lost in thought.  The shadows grew darker, encompassing more of the already dim office. <br>
<br>
Finally he stood, the uncertainty and rage having built beyond his control, making it impossible to sit still.  Pacing slowly back and forth he watched the Reaper.  “I truly cannot leave until the Drachnid Queen is destroyed at any rate.  This curse may bring us all down before I can answer this honorless attack on my sister.  And once the Queen is dead, and the Harvest restored by her blood, I am sure they can stand for a time without the two of us.” <br>
<br>
Creapiing allowed a small smile to touch her lips as she watched him, noting the agitation and rage still just below the surface of every motion. <br>
<br>
“I already have the spies of House S`Therik looking for Anari Ravensblade.  I am sure that they will have information for me soon as to where she has run.  When the Drachnid Queen is dead and the Harvest is cured, we shall go together to hunt her down,” Khasirath concluded. <br>
<br>
He stepped closer to Creapiing, his violet eyes meeting intensely with her own.  “My Reaper, this battle between me and Anari must be an honor duel, though she has no honor.  I must ask you to let Innoruuk decide the outcome.  If treachery comes from her friends, you may intervene, but if I can face her alone, then I must face her alone, without your sword and hate to aid me.  Your presence shall be more than enough to keep me focused.” <br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Creapiing<br>
<br>
Creapiing watched the Thresher pace about her office.  His inner rage would not let him stand still, and his frustration was mounting with the wait.  They both knew that he could not pursue Anari until the Drachnid Queen was slain and the minions of Innoruuk were saved from the plague.  A small smile could not help touching her lips as she thought of the Thresher being out of control.  Somehow seeing him unsettled and vulnerable strengthened the bond between them. <br>
<br>
“Khasirath, you are my Brother within the Harvest, you are my friend, and you are a capable leader on whom we all depend.  For all of these reasons I WILL travel with you.  No one knows better than I the rules of an honor duel and no one knows less than the one you seek.  I will ensure that this duel is fought fairly or those who wish to breach these rules will die by my blade.  There is no one better to take with you than me; my training as a Rogue will allow me to see the traps before you stumble into them.  And I must admit, I have longed to further explore the icy land.”<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Maladwen<br>
<br>
The boat rocked and shook, while the loud clanging of the rudder was barely heard.  Maladwen had his love in his arms and that was all he needed.  They kissed gently and smiled at one another.  She looked into his eyes, staring dreamily. <br>
<br>
“So what brings you to Velious, Mally?” Anari asked with a smirk on her face. <br>
<br>
“Why, you of course love,” he replied.  The young General had already set out his pillow for them to sit on, and wrapped his warm blanket around them.  Despite the many times he's been to Velious, Shadowlurker still could not stand the cold. <br>
<br>
The entire trip on the boat was spent talking of their goals, hopes, dreams, and happiness together.  But before no time at all, the Icebreaker came to a stop, jerking the secret couple forward.  They rose grumpily, and Maladwen packed his pillow and blanket back up.  He then stepped off the Icebreaker, and inhaled the fresh frozen sea air of the Iceclad Ocean. <br>
<br>
“Do you know where the Tower of Frozen Shadow is Anari?” he asked her smirking.  She looked at him. <br>
<br>
“I've passed it on my travels,” she replied questioningly. <br>
<br>
“Good, I'll race you to it,” Maladwen flashed her a smile.  She giggled. <br>
<br>
“Ok Mally, but first you have to fasten up your left boot,” Anari told him.  He looked down to see what she was talking about, and with that, Anari took off. <br>
<br>
“CHEATER!” he yelled playfully and chased after her.  She ran straight into the woods and towards the flat topped icebergs.  Maladwen soon caught up, but she jumped onto the large slippery chunks of ice.  Anari jumped from iceberg to iceberg toward the other side. <br>
<br>
Her secret lover had another plan.  He came to the large cliff and looked down, enjoying the cool breeze across his face.  Without a second thought, the Fier`Dal leapt from the icy cliff to the freezing water below.  With a large splash, he fell deep into the water.  With his strong rogue muscles, he began the swim.<br>
<br>
Being a master swimmer he outswam the young beautiful Fier`Dal on the icebergs.  Maladwen finally found the shore, and pulled himself into the snow.  He was now dripping and freezing cold. <br>
<br>
Shadowlurker looked back at his opponent in time to see her slip and fall on her butt.  He laughed and walked over to her. <br>
<br>
“No fair!” she yelled at him, giggling uncontrollably.  Maladwen sighed, smiling and offered her his hand.  She took it, and pulled him onto the slippery ice. <br>
<br>
“Sucker!” Anari exclaimed, continuing to run.  She looked back and saw Maladwen rising to his feet laughing and running toward her.  She held her arms out to him, but instead of embracing her, he tackled her to the ground.  They laughed hysterically, and stood in each other's arms.  The General was freezing and shivering in her arms. <br>
<br>
“I'm so cold,” he said to her, his teeth clattering uncontrollably. <br>
<br>
“Well that's what you get for swimming in icy water silly!  C'mon let's go to Thurgadin and get you out of those wet clothes,” she said, kissing him lightly. <br>
<br>
The two walked past the Iceclad, past the Eastern Wastelands, and through the lost Great Divide, laughing and talking all the while about their happiness and their future together. <br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Anari<br>
<br>
Dawn came.  Though without any windows, Anari wasn’t certain if that were true at first.  But the noises echoing through the caverns of the city of Thurgadin decreed the morning had come.  She heard footsteps outside the door to the room, and when she opened her eyes she saw a shadow through the crack between the floor and the bottom of the door.  Instinctively her hand reached for her dagger that lay hidden beneath her pillow, then relaxed when she saw two envelopes slide beneath the door and the shadow move on. <br>
<br>
Smiling at herself, she started to rise when an arm fell across her stomach, pulling her back into bed.  Maladwen lifted himself onto one elbow and smiled down at his wife.  “Now just where do you think you’re going?” <br>
<br>
She chuckled and pointed toward the door.  “We have messages this morning.” <br>
<br>
“They can wait,” he craned his neck and pressed his lips against hers. <br>
<br>
Still chuckling beneath his kiss, she placed her hand on his chest and gently pushed him away from her.  “They may be important love. We can’t ignore them.” <br>
<br>
Snarling playfully in protest he rolled out of the bed and scooped the letters from the floor.  He looked at them briefly then tossed one to her.  “From the Shadows.” <br>
<br>
She noted the seal of her guild in the wax and nodded.  “And yours?” <br>
<br>
He slipped his finger beneath the unmarked wax and broke the seal.  Quickly scanning the contents he answered, “Rynehart.” <br>
<br>
Breaking the seal on her letter, she unfolded the delicate paper and began to read.  ‘Mistress Ana, news has come to us from our sources in Neriak that Violent Harvest has entered Velious in search of the cure for the plague that sickens them.  S`Therik is with them, and we fear that he may know that you too are in Velious.  I have sent this missive through magical means, and Mythrazz journeys to you as you read this to escort you back to the Hall.  For your own safety and the security of the guild I implore you to return with him.  He should arrive before midday.  ~High Lord Huzyur.’ <br>
<br>
“Damn!” Maladwen growled. <br>
<br>
She looked up at him, her hand crumpling her letter into a ball.  “What’s wrong love?” <br>
<br>
“The Dragoons are massing, moving in on Kelethin.  I’m being called back to organize the defenses.”<br>
<br>
She smiled reassuringly.  “We knew this was going to happen sooner or later, that one of us would be called away.” <br>
<br>
“What about yours?  Bad news?” <br>
<br>
She shook her head.  “Just this weeks report from Huzyur.  Nothing to worry about.”  She sat up, pulling the blankets around her as he quickly gathered his things and donned his armor.  “How long will you be gone?” <br>
<br>
“I don’t know.  There is a wizard waiting at the spires just outside the city to take me back to the Faydark.  Apparently the attack could come at any moment now.”  He looked to his wife, a sullen look on his face.  “Promise me you’ll stay here until I get back.” <br>
<br>
“Don’t be silly love,” she muttered, trying to smile.<br>
<br>
“Promise me Ana!”  He knelt on the bed before her.  “I can’t fight them worrying about you.  I need to know that you will be safe.  Promise me you won’t leave Thurgadin.” <br>
<br>
She held him to her, her face grim as she realized what she was about to do.  “I promise.”  Forcing a smile, she kissed the top of his head.  “Now go, I hate long good-byes.” <br>
<br>
He nodded, and finished gathering his things.  With one last quick kiss, he was out the door.  For a few minutes, she just sat there watching the door.  Her mind raced as she tried to figure out the best course of action.  If she stayed in Thurgadin, it would only be a matter of time before S`Therik found her.  She had to keep on the move. <br>
<br>
Tossing the blankets aside, she leapt out of the bed and dressed.  She slid her obsidian shard into her boot, her dirk she hooked into its wrist sheath beneath her sleeve.  Opening her pack, she examined its contents.  Satisfied that she had everything she would need for survival in the frozen land she shouldered the pack.  Reaching beneath the pillow she had slept on she retrieved the stiletto and clipped it to her belt.  She grabbed her harpoon in hand as she ran out the door.  She had to get out of Thurgadin before Mythrazz arrived. <br>
<br>
As she hurried down the stairs to the common room, she lifted her guild medallion from around her neck and slid the ring signifying her as Dark Lady of Silent Shadows from her finger.  She nodded to the desk clerk, and asked for a box.  While the dwarf searched for one, she quickly penned a letter for Maladwen.  When the clerk returned with the box she dropped the jewelry inside. <br>
<br>
“There is an Iksar on his way here.  When he asks for me, give him this.”  She handed the box back then gave him the letter.  “The letter is to go to General Shadowlurker when he returns.  Is that understood?” <br>
<br>
Before the dwarf even answered she was racing out the Inn and out of the tunnels of Thurgadin. <br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Maladwen<br>
<br>
He was considering many things at that moment.  He didn't know what to do, they had attacked so suddenly... without warning!  Shadowlurker's footsteps rang out as he ran across the small bridge in Thurgadin, then the large one where he leapt over the slick ice, as he hated walking on it. <br>
<br>
The blasted waterfall was splashing in front of him and the two Dwarven guards nodded as he stepped out into the freezing air.  “Thank the gods I got myself a polar bear cloak!” he thought to himself and began running, squeezing the cloak around him to keep warm. <br>
<br>
Maladwen was in a great panic and didn't know what to do.  The Dragoons were responding so quickly, and he had to leave his wife in Thurgadin.  Everything was wrong, wrong, wrong!! <br>
<br>
As he ran, he heard a roar, and growling.  His thoughts racing he spun and saw an Ancient Wurm looking down and snarling at him.  With a gulp, he drew his Ykesha Sword and his Tombcarver.  The thing brought down one mighty claw that he caught it in a parry with his Ykeshan Blade.  Futilely, he stabbed the thing's leg, putting all his strength into holding back the claw so it would not crush him alive.  The beast of Veeshan snaked its neck down and attempted to snap its jaws at him.  Maladwen jumped out of the way and stuck it in the neck with his tiny dagger, then let go of its claw and slit some scales off of its side. <br>
<br>
Very angrily, the Ancient Wurm spun its tail at the young General, and he took the whip to the face, sending him staggering backward.  “There is no way I can win this fight,” he thought to himself and turned, starting to run.  The Wurm barreled over the giant mounds of snow so it could keep up with the Elf.  It wasn't about to let its lunch get away.  Through the blood dripping into his eyes, Maladwen could see the spires where he was to meet Tonker the Wizard.  Maladwen struggled to keep his strength up as he ran.  He knew that if he stopped it would be his death. <br>
<br>
Continuing the pursuit the Wurm howled in agitation.  Unnerved Maladwen could swear the spires grew further away with every racing step.  Suddenly, he heard war cries.  Wiping the blood from his eyes, he looked to see what was happening.  Sure enough, though he never thought he'd say it, Giants were saving the day.  They cursed and charged at the little &quot;would-be dragon&quot; and began their assault.  With a slash to the throat and bash to the back, they killed it and began dragging it back to Kael Drakkel, so they could fry and eat their kill.  The Elven General let out a sigh of relief, and limped over to the spires. <br>
<br>
“Hail General!” young Tonker said cheerfully.  The General was in no mood to hail back, considering his situation. <br>
<br>
“Ready to go sir?” asked the little gnome.  Maladwen nodded, resting his hand on the little man’s shoulder.  With the crackling of blue lights, they appeared in Greater Faydark, but instead of running towards Kelethin, Maladwen ran towards Butcherblock. <br>
<br>
“Sir what are you doing?  The Dragoons are going to be attacking KELETHIN!” the little gnome shouted anxiously. <br>
<br>
“Don't worry Tonker.  I'm getting a horse!” he yelled and ran over to the Butcherblock Mountains.  Fear, hate, anger, sweat, it all was one thing now.<br>
<br>
And S'Rhenvoux....  S’Rhenvoux would finally die. <br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Khasirath<br>
<br>
Over the icy land and through the crystallized tree branches the wind howled with two voices -- one was a deep moaning growl, the other a high shrieking wail, as if two murderous titans of air battled for dominance, tossing the thick snow in drifts and spirals, obscuring any trails land-borne creatures might try to create.<br>
<br>
Deep within the storm, shrouded in the shadows of the Dead walked two Knights of Innoruuk, their dark cloaks mantled around them and their skull shaped helms bowed into the winds as they stalked along on a trail neither could see, but one could feel in his blood.  Side by side they traveled, well outfitted for the cold and ice with spikes strapped to their mail boots and thick mammoth-wool padding under their armour.  Their packs were light, just the barest necessities for the arduous journey.<br>
<br>
“This is a cursed land, Reaper.  The environment itself is a deadly foe, and three powerful forces vie for supremacy in an ages-long war, each quick to name any new race the friend of their enemy.  I cannot fathom why Ravensblade would run here.  Did she think I would be unwilling to pursue her?  Or does she hope some anonymous death will find her before I do?”<br>
<br>
Creapiing favored her companion with a small smile, shaking her head. “I do not know.  Perhaps when we find her you should ask,” she joked.<br>
<br>
Khasirath chuckled softly, pausing to scan the area for threats.  The blinding snow made it all but pointless, but caution and habit made him try anyway.<br>
<br>
House S`Therik's spies had reported seeing Anari and Maladwen entering the citadel of the stunted Ice Dwarves.  The report had reached the Thresher as the Harvest had emerged victorious and revitalized by the blood of the Drachnid Queen of the Crystal Caverns.  The Reaper had been one of the first affected by the curse, and she had been too ill to join the hunt.  True to his word Khasirath had traveled back to Neriak with the other hunters, helping to bring the vials of blood to cure her and all the others.<br>
<br>
While Creapiing regained her strength he had waited, reviewing the scrolls he had prepared when he had broken Anari.  They detailed much of her life -- her friends, her foes, the brightest and darkest days of her life.  He also read the slim journal book filled with notes on all he and Kvariya had done to Anari in the Arena, including a sketch of the brand he had marked her with before ritualistically slaying her in Innoruuk's name.<br>
<br>
When the Reaper was able to travel they set off for Velious, shortening the trip considerably by arriving in the Iceclad Ocean by magic.  As they walked through the icy wastes he told her everything he knew, everything he had done, so that she might know all that he knew of their prey.  In her turn, Creapiing told him about her early training as a Rogue, and the sort of tricks and treachery he might expect in the fight to come.<br>
<br>
Considering Anari's lead and the vastness of the territory Khasirath had to use his instinct to guide him.  From all he had done to Anari by drawing her life force into himself over and over, and forcing his own life into her, he had unintentionally established a mystical link between the two of them.  When he stilled his mind and focused inwards on his hate and on her, he could feel that link and cast his senses outwards to detect her general direction.  He hoped that when she thought of him and what he had done to her that she could feel that seed of him, and his hate, within her.<br>
<br>
As the night fell the winds grew even more biting and chill, and the two Knights were forced to make camp for their own survival.  Creapiing picked a site on a frozen river, where the flat ice plain made approach by stealth nearly impossible, and where large threats such as dragons or giants might be unable to walk lest they plunge through the ice.  Khasirath helped her cut a hole through the ice so she might try fishing in the frigid dark waters.<br>
<br>
They worked together setting up the low tent, covering it with a textured white tarp and snow until it looked like little more than a snowdrift.  Rather than a fire, Khasirath set up his portable spit for heat and cooking, as it raised the flame off of the ice and could be quickly snuffed and hidden by the lid.  They removed only what they absolutely needed to from their packs, so that they would be able to grab everything up and go at a moment's notice.  Their weapons stayed close by their hands.<br>
<br>
Once the camp was prepared they sat together beside the hole in the ice, the spit warming them marginally and the tent breaking the wind.  Creapiing brought out a small kit full of hooks and threads and bits of feathers and insect wings and began to tie flies for their fishing.<br>
<br>
“Khasirath, the wind is blowing my silk threads everywhere.  I can't tie these flies for the life of me!” Creapiing sighed.<br>
<br>
He pulled his gaze from the horizon where he could feel Anari's presence in the distance.  As he saw the difficulty Creapiing was having he chuckled softly, “Perhaps you should try tying them inside the tent?”  He plucked a small strand of thread from the tip of her finger where it was about to make good its escape.  “I can't see how you can do that to begin with, it's all so small.  Do they really work better than grubs?”<br>
<br>
“The grubs from the Ambassador all froze on the way in.”  She reached into a pouch and handed the lot of them to the Thresher.  “Maybe you can add them to tonight's meal.  This treble screeching fly is the only hook big enough to land the monstrous fish in this land.  Stand beside me, it will block the wind and I will be able to show you how to tie them at the same time.”<br>
<br>
She dipped the Thresher's fingers into the jar of kobold fat she kept for her armor.  “This will help keep the threads pliable enough to tie the bat fur to the hook.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath watched over the Reaper's shoulder with a curious smile, trying hard to follow her directions.  The little bits of fur and thread fought against his attempts to attach them to the hook.  “This is nothing like fletching my arrows.  I fear I am wasting your supplies,” he chuckled.<br>
<br>
Creapiing noticed a bit of blood on the Thresher's finger where the hook has snagged him.  With a chuckle she said, “They will not bite if you leave your scent so strongly upon the hook.” Reaching up she took hold of Khasirath's hand, licking the blood from his finger.  “I wasted a day’s worth of supplies my first try too.  See?  Like this?” she held the fly up in the weak light for him to study.  “After you manage to learn the intricacies of tying the flies, I will teach you the best way to break the necks of the fish you catch.”<br>
<br>
He watched her as she tended to the tiny wound, and then took a better look at the carefully tied fly the Reaper had just finished.  It was a marvel of fairy-like wings concealing the murderous hook.  “You are either making it look too easy, or I am looking like a fool,” he jested, laughing at his own lack of skill.<br>
<br>
Creapiing looked up into the dark eyes of the Thresher, “In truth Khasirath, that blood trick works rather well with the piranhas in Nektulos, but very few fish are as tasteful as the ones in our shadowed wood.   This place of light... it wears on me.”<br>
<br>
He nodded thoughtfully, turning to scan the shimmering frozen river.  “Indeed, my Reaper.  Even the night is no comfort with the biting winds and the ice reflecting the moonlight so painfully.  I shall be most grateful to return to Neriak to thaw myself once Anari is dead.”<br>
<br>
Creapiing followed his gaze a moment, then looked back at him with a smile, “I must say Khasirath, I have not been without my slave Kurmudgin tasting my food for so long that I can't remember when I have not gotten cold, half-eaten portions for my dinner.  To have you here, cooking for me, I shall grow weak and complacent.  Another good reason to finish this quickly.”  She laid a carefully tied fly next to the last one.<br>
<br>
He grinned back at her, shaking his head, “Weak and complacent?  I cannot picture it.  Though I am very glad you've been enjoying my cooking.  It is simple fare, but I try to make it flavorful.”  He picked up another bit of bat fur, trying to pin it onto the hook long enough to get the thread bound around it.<br>
<br>
“Khasirath, try this.”  Creapiing reached over and gently rubbed more kobold fat onto his hand.  “Now knot it at the end just so, and you will catch the biggest fish this day.”<br>
<br>
He nodded and grinned at the warmth of her hand and the slickness of the grease.  The trick worked and he was able to finish the fly well enough to call it useable, though it was not to his eye anywhere near as well made as the Reaper's.  “Indeed, we shall see.  It's been some time since I've found time to fish.  Shamefully I've been buying fish in Oggok to make fish rolls for my travels.”<br>
<br>
“You should instruct your slaves to catch them for you.  Or have you kept them too busy with other duties?” she asked, looking at the Thresher inquiringly.<br>
<br>
He looked into her eyes, struck as always by the similarity in color to his own.  “They have many other duties that keep them busy.  And having them follow me around fishing would be a bother.  I have enough trouble getting some of my servants to leave me a moment's privacy.”<br>
<br>
She smiled slyly, “I am sure they rise to your satisfaction Khasirath.”  Motioning toward the poles she added, “Let us catch a fish.”<br>
<br>
He scooped up the poles, handing one to the Reaper before he fixed his new lure to the end of his line.  “Indeed they do, my Reaper.  The servants of S`Therik are very loyal and very well trained.  None has ever failed to meet my needs.”  He settled back down next to her, casting his line down through the ice into the darkness of the water.<br>
<br>
“Khasirath?” Creapiing said, her voice unusually soft, “Do they meet all of your needs?  Are your slaves and lovers enough for you?”<br>
<br>
He turned his head to again study her eyes, tilting his head just a bit in thought.  “They meet the immediate needs of the flesh, I imagine, my Reaper.  But I'll admit sometimes it seems not to be enough.  Perhaps I simply grow restless...” he let the thought trail off, unwilling to speak the rest aloud just yet.<br>
<br>
Creapiing laughed, “You have a fish on your line Thresher.  Best pull it in and break its neck quickly.”<br>
<br>
He felt his face flush as he realized his thoughts had wandered away with him.  With practiced efficiency he drew in the line and his struggling catch, hauling the sleek and darkly speckled salmon onto the ice away from the hole to grab it quickly, snapping its neck with both hands.<br>
<br>
Creapiing gasped at the size of the fish.  “Like I said, you would get the biggest fish!  Why is it that the worst flies catch the biggest fish?  Ugly flies and big fish, light and dark, love and hate -- the great mysterious connections of Innoruuk,” she mused aloud.<br>
<br>
Khasirath glanced back at her with a bemused smile as he pried the hook back out of the fish's lip.  “I never stopped to see the Father's Will in fishing, my Reaper.  But you make an interesting argument.”<br>
<br>
He drew a slim blade and quickly gutted and filleted the salmon, turning to his smoldering spit to pick out some cleaned bat wings he'd had warming there.  After adding some seasonings from a small pouch he wrapped the fillets and set the bundles over the fire to cook.<br>
<br>
As he tended to their dinner Creapiing spoke as she packed up the poles, “Thresher, I have never properly thanked you for saving my life on my last fishing trip.  Allow me to now.”  She picked out a very unique fishing fly and moved toward Khasirath as he stood up from his cooking.  Standing nearly his height, and looking into his eyes, she moved closer until a fine silk thread would barely slip between the two of them, slowly raised her arms and hooked the fly onto a small piece of leather adorning his breast plate.  “Perhaps this will bring you luck.”<br>
<br>
He could feel the flush returning to his cheeks at her nearness. Looking into her eyes then down at the beautiful token he said, “You are most welcome, Creapiing. I could not have done any differently, even if it had cost my own life.  I had to see you safe.”  He reached up to touch the soft fluff adorning the hook of the fly.  “Beauty that conceals a deadly blade.  I shall always think of you when I see it.” he said with a soft yet wolfish grin.<br>
<br>
A hidden smile crossed Creapiing's face at noticing the flush upon Khasirath's cheeks.  “This fly will help you to remember to use your hate and not your rage against Anari when we catch her.  Let us eat and rest so that she will feel your blade all the sooner.”<br>
<br>
He nodded thoughtfully as he watched her return to the fishing tackle, his mind returning to the hunt. <br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
As the two Knights broke their camp they watched the terrain with keen violet eyes.  Suddenly they both paused, sensing something approaching.  Without a word they turned back-to-back, weapons ready as they looked for the source of their alarm.  Khasirath spotted it first - a flash of ebon black cutting through the biting wind and swirling snow, its wings beating powerfully as it neared its targets.  With a throaty cawing it stooped downwards as the Thresher raised his arm, and the bird landed easily on the proffered perch, flipping its wings back into place.  The raven's dark and familiar eyes darted from the Thresher to the Reaper and back as it let out a growling 'prr-uck!' of urgency.<br>
<br>
Creapiing stepped closer and swiftly removed the message tube from above the raven's talon.  The bird ruffled its feathers against the wind, darting its head from side to side as it watched the two Teir`Dal and the frozen plain around them.  Creapiing read the note and said, “Raveneye reports that Maladwen left Thurgadin and was teleported away.  Anari left the city alone a short time later, less than an hour ago.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded once, looking deeply into the raven's eyes.  “This is good news, indeed.  Thank you for your help.  Now return to your master.”<br>
<br>
He dropped his arm down a little then thrust it upwards in the same motion, casting the raven back to the winds.  The large bird circled them twice then soared off through the storm and the slowly brightening morn.<br>
<br>
Khasirath turned towards Creapiing, a feral grin on his thin lips.  “It seems that she is alone now.  Perhaps she thinks she can elude me this way, but it will not affect my tracking.  We will remain cautious of treachery; her friends are very resourceful when it comes to finding her.”<br>
<br>
Creapiing nodded, studying Khasirath's face.  “Indeed. I shall not let anything or anyone dishonor your duel.  But you must remember: Hate, not rage, must guide you.  Otherwise even in victory you shall be lost.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath frowned as he nodded, his hatred surging against his control as he sensed the nearness of his prey.  Swiftly he helped pack the last of the gear and turned a slow circle, gauging his path with inner sight.  When they'd set up camp they had been moving towards Thurgadin, but now he felt that Anari had doubled them back, headed towards the great bridge of ice and the harbor beyond.  With a growl he pulled a potion flask from his pouch.<br>
<br>
“Drink this my Reaper.  She has circled us and we shall need our best speed to keep her from reaching the Icebreaker.”<br>
<br>
Creapiing drank from the flask and handed it back.  Khasirath tossed back his draught of the wolf’s blood potion with a sneer, disliking the taste.  He stuffed the flask back into his pouch as they both shrouded themselves in shadow and loped off over the frozen ground.  The chill winds whipped them mercilessly, but Khasirath's hate burned so hot that he did not feel the cold.<br>
<br>
“Soon,” he thought, “Soon it shall be done.  This time I shall take her heart for Innoruuk as well as her soul.”<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Anari<br>
<br>
She had promised that she would stay.  Yet she broke that promise the second she stepped past the falls hiding the entrance to Thurgadin.  There was no way she was going to stay in one place when she knew it would only be a matter of time before the hunt for her began.  Securing her harpoon to her back, she cinched the Ravenscale cloak around her to keep out the chill, and headed out into the cold of Velious.  This is where S`Therik thought she was, she had to change that.  Kunark was as good a place as any for her to wait until she was ready to finish the game.  Besides, it was warm. <br>
<br>
She chuckled at the thought of him searching Velious only to have one of his spies tell him she was no longer there.  She would make him run from one end of the world to the other, letting his hate build with every step.  Growing with the knowledge that he must wait to avenge the indignity done to his sister, the assault against the pride of his House.  Sooner or later the strength it took to control the power of his hate would wane and that is when she would come for him.  When his rage blinds him he will fall to her as she fell to him.  Then, and only then, could he begin to know a fraction of the humiliation she had known at his hand.<br>
<br>
A psychotic smile formed on her lips at the thought of mounting his head above the mantle in the Shadowed Hall.<br>
<br>
She stopped.<br>
<br>
There were no more Shadows, at least not for her.  She had abandoned them.  Had given up everything she had ever held dear for her vengeance. <br>
<br>
She stood on the bridge that linked the Eastern Wastes to the Iceclad Ocean.  She had walked most of the way to the docks without even realizing she had done so.  “Bristlebane, what have you let me become?” <br>
<br>
Walking to the waist high ledge, she leaned her hand on the ice and stared out over the water at the rising sun.  So much had happened in the last - oh how many years?  Things had blurred together since she had first been rescued from S`Therik.  Her life had been one hunt after the other, trying to regain her strength and to become stronger.  He was always so much better than she; she had seen that while she watched him in the Arena.  The discipline he held over his own body was something she could only dream of attaining.  She had allowed the hate he had planted to grow and fester and control her, until it was the only emotion she truly felt.  Even her love was tainted.  How she adored Maladwen, but she saw now that her obsession with S`Therik was only going to lead to disaster. <br>
<br>
She sighed and looked down at the simple silver ring Maladwen had given her when they were married.   “How glad I am that you are not here, Mally.  The time has come to ends this, and I would not see you hurt for anything.”<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes, praying for the first time in many years.  Maladwen was going to be facing his greatest enemy, the source of his hate - perhaps at this very moment.  She prayed with all her heart and soul that if Bristlebane were to call one of them to Him, He would call her. <br>
<br>
With another sigh, she turned to head back to Thurgadin where she would await S`Therik.  But as she turned a dark shadow coalesced from the swirling snow, revealing the Knight as he stood a bare pace before her, his Indigo Saber’s point raised towards her throat, its sapphire pommel stone glowing balefully.  From within his ruddy helm his eyes glowed with his hate, the waves of it all but visible.  For the span of a single heartbeat, knowing the power of the man before her, she couldn’t help but wonder what life would have been like if she had made this one an ally instead of an enemy.  The heartbeat passed, and she sneered. <br>
<br>
His grin was feral as he watched her.  “You still pray to that fool Anari?  I thought I'd taught you the futility of that.  Indeed it seems you have forgotten many of my lessons.” <br>
<br>
“And I thought you would have come before now, S`Therik.  Ah well, the invitation I sent did not mention a place or time, now did it?” <br>
<br>
He growled as he spoke, “Is that what you call that cowardly attack on my sister?  An invitation?” <br>
<br>
“I needed something to capture your undivided attention.”  She leaned back against the ledge, folding her arms across her chest.  One hand, hidden beneath her other arm, slid into one of the many hidden pockets within the cloak.  “I believe it worked, don’t you?” <br>
<br>
A movement behind Khasirath caught her eye and she saw Creapiing, the Reaper of the Harvest.  She nodded toward the woman.  “Two against one, and here I thought you were an honorable bastard.” <br>
<br>
“You have no honor, and so you do not understand such things.  I will explain it simply, so that you might know.  This fight is for you and me alone.  The Reaper is here only to witness it, and to ensure that no one interferes. Should one of your friends try to stop me, or help you, they will die by her blade.  I hope it is clear to you now.”  He stepped back lowering the tip of his saber, and reached up with his shield hand to unclasp his traveling cloak, letting it pool like a shadow around his boots.<br>
<br>
“This ends now,” he growled deeply.<br>
<br>
She laughed at him, though inside she began to realize there was only one chance for her.  He would not show her mercy, would not spare her even if she swore herself to Innoruuk and all he believed.  He would kill her for what she did to Tzanntiel.  She had only one chance.  She had to win.  “I couldn’t agree with you more.” <br>
<br>
She jerked her arms away from her chest, throwing a handful of the dust from the pocket into his eyes while releasing her dirk from its hidden sheath.  He clawed at his eyes, trying to rid himself of the blinding powder. <br>
<br>
Catching the handle of his blade in her hand she ducked beneath his sword. As she passed beside him, she drove the dirk through the seam of his armor, piercing the flesh of his side.  Dropping into a roll she undid the clasp of her cloak and pulled the harpoon from her back. As she stood she unhooked the stiletto from her belt.  Her cloak fell around her feet, and she supported the shaft of the harpoon against her underarm. <br>
<br>
Khasirath spun to face her as his vision cleared, though his eyes were red from the powder.  He pulled the dirk from his side with a snarl. <br>
<br>
“A gift,” Anari taunted as she shifted her weight to the balls of her feet.  “I thought you would appreciate the blade that gutted your precious Tzanntiel.  A memento of how I got to your family, and a reminder that I can do it again!” <br>
<br>
His violet eyes blazed crimson as his hatred flared, “First blood dishonorably won, Rogue.  But this fight shall not end until you are dead.”  He lifted the slim blade to his lips, and licked his own blood from it as he let out a purring growl, his eyes pinning hers.  Almost carelessly he tossed the dirk aside so that it spun to land at Creapiing's feet. <br>
<br>
Her stiletto snapped in, the harpoon jabbing in the other way.  Anari repeated the routine, then a third time, each movement countered precisely by Khasirath’s own blade or shield.  Each strike was perfectly aimed, and each parry intercepted the attacking weapons perfectly.  Neither Anari nor Khasirath, locked through their staring eyes into mental combat, watched their hands through the physical movements.  Neither one blinked - not when the breeze of Khasirath’s high slice moved the hair atop the rouges head, not when Anari’s harpoon thrust came to a parried stop a hairsbreadth from Khasirath’s eye. <br>
<br>
The movements of their bodies began to catch the blur of hands and weapons.  Anari dipped a shoulder, stiletto lashing out straight ahead; Khasirath spun a complete circle, parrying behind his back as he flitted out of reach. <br>
<br>
A slight growl escaped S`Therik’s lips, his eyes flashing in the early dawn light. <br>
<br>
Anari laughed at him, stiletto and harpoon working furiously to keep his weapon at bay.  “Give in to the hate,” she teased.  “Let go of your discipline and let this be ended!” <br>
<br>
She didn’t understand… that was exactly the point. <br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Khasirath <br>
<br>
Khasirath's hatred rose, burning through the air, driving the chill from his body. He spun and dodged, looking for the opportunity to strike, pressing Anari hard with furious blows of saber and shield. The stinging in his eyes and the taste of his own blood heightened his every sense, sharpening the lust for slaughter within him. <br>
<br>
Focused on the dance of death he held in his mind the image of Tzanntiel bleeding out her life in the street. <br>
<br>
Growling he slammed Anari back with his shield, driving her further back with a wide sweep of his saber. At the same time he began a hissing chant, drawing his power and hate into the incantation and releasing it upon Anari as she charged back into him. Her harpoon slid above the edge of his shield to pierce into his shoulder as the morning shadows congealed around her, slowing her step and constricting her legs painfully. Her surprised wince brought a wolfish grin to his thin lips. <br>
<br>
Pain did not exist for him. Nothing could distract him from the ginger-haired elf he fought. He kept her in front of him at all costs; he could not allow her the advantage of a strike at his back. With the Darkness engulfing her it was a simple matter. She could not rely on her agility as she normally would. <br>
<br>
Again and again they circled and clashed, each testing and pushing the other. She was fast, but her weapons were too light to easily breach his armour. He was more skilled, but it was hard to land blows upon her nimble form. Still their attacks found each other’s flesh often enough, and each strike that landed drove his frenzy higher. <br>
<br>
She backed away to try and circle him, and he took the opportunity to draw another spell, centering and focusing the hatred of his gift he hurled the enchantment upon her with a snarl. Almost instantly her face grew deeply flushed and she flinched in pain as her blood began to boil within her. <br>
<br>
She closed in fast, the fear of his magic apparent in her eyes. Her paired weapons rained in upon him, trying to keep him too distracted to cast again. The challenge of it was too delicious. Seeking the space between her strikes he all but whispered the short chant, rewarded at once by the reddish glow surrounding them both. He saw her arms tremble as her strength was sapped, and felt the power of it rush into his own body, driving the beginnings of fatigue from him. <br>
<br>
She darted back away to find a new angle, her breathing ragged. His eyes narrowed as he took her measure, delighting in the failings he sensed. <br>
<br>
“Ye are weak,” he hissed through his teeth. “I don’t think you’ve learned to hate at all.” <br>
<br>
Through her pain he saw her green eyes glitter as she bit back, “I’ll take that as a compliment!” <br>
<br>
A growl tore from his throat as he rushed her with ferocious attacks, driving her backwards across the bridge. <br>
<br>
Deftly she slipped to his flank, her harpoon whistling as it bit deeply into his ribs through the lighter chain under his arm. Twisting around to pull free of the barbed spear he hacked down across her arm with his saber, nearly breaking her grip on the shaft. <br>
<br>
She cried out from the pain, trying to retreat again. This time he didn’t allow her the luxury, pressing close despite the aching of his ribs. <br>
<br>
“You will wish you had learned better, Ravensblade,” he growled as he parried a thrust of her harpoon, flicking his saber around it to strike back in a riposte. The sensation of the Imbued blade tearing through the mail across her stomach brought a sudden cruel laugh from him. <br>
<br>
&quot;The only thing I wish is that I had stayed to watch her die!&quot; she spat back, stabbing at his face with her stiletto. He jerked his head back, but the slim blade still caught him, carving a deep line across his jaw. <br>
<br>
Breaking away he went into another flurry of attacks with his saber, bashing her back with his shield when she tried to close in again. Their blades rang and hissed against each other, shattering the stillness of the morning. <br>
<br>
“But you failed, Anari! Tzanntiel yet lives. And you helped her grow even stronger,” he taunted as they battled. “You have enflamed divine hate in her heart!” <br>
<br>
Anari drove into him with desperate strength, her harpoon and stiletto a whirling blur of death before her. Khasirath slid back into a defensive posture, his body well behind his shield as he endured the assault. Deep within himself he sought the very depths of his hate, and the link through it to his God. <br>
<br>
An inhuman roar burst from him as he smashed his shield into Anari, knocking her back and off balance. His hands became wrapped in a writhing black aura as Innoruuk’s own power burst through him. He could feel the Father’s dark presence in his mind, guiding and controlling him as he thrust his hands into Anari’s chest. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk’s power crackled sickeningly as it was unleashed, throwing Anari back across the ice as her entire body writhed from the unbearable pain. Khasirath shuddered deeply from the sensation of his God using him as a living conduit for His power.<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Anari<br>
<br>
It took every ounce of strength Anari could summon to keep from losing consciousness. The pain lanced through every fiber of her being at Khasirath’s touch. Her legs threatened to buckle beneath her, yet she somehow managed to stay on her feet. Taking a staggering step back she looked at the dark Knight. She could see the rage within his eyes, the ferocity in which they shone, but he would not lose control. She had underestimated him and she was going to pay for that mistake with her life. <br>
<br>
But by the gods, she would make him bleed! <br>
<br>
With a sudden renewed vigor, she stepped closer toward the drow. She snapped her head to the side as he attempted to remove it with his sword. The tip of the saber cut deeply into her cheek, blood immediately oozing down her face. She darted under his shield arm, stabbing the back of his knee with her blade. Very little damage was done, his armor too thick for her stiletto to penetrate well. Before she could turn he slammed his shield back, knocking the wind from her lungs and sending her stumbling forward against the ledge of the bridge. Her stiletto skittered from her hand and over the edge. Gasping to regain her breath she heard Khasirath chanting in a dark, low voice. As she spun to face him she could see the arcane glow around his hands rushing towards her, and she gasped as pain pulled at her heart. She could almost see the glow of her life force flying back into Khasirath, that feral grin of his widening as he drew it in with a sharp breath. <br>
<br>
Grasping her harpoon in both hands, she brought the shaft of the weapon up to block against his relentless charge. She was on the defensive, her back pressed against the edge of the bridge. Every muscle of her body screamed as she somehow managed to block attack after attack. She had only one route to go. <br>
<br>
Leaping onto the ledge of the bridge she narrowly avoided another swing of his sword. Precariously standing on the icy ledge she spun her harpoon around, its jagged tip pushing away a jab of his blade. <br>
<br>
And then she saw it - a trickle of dark blood from his lips. Her sudden confusion left her open. His saber took the chance, cleaving through the wooden staff of her harpoon. Realization struck her the same instant his blade drove into her thigh. Dropping her useless weapon she grabbed his arms, pulling him closer. <br>
<br>
&quot;Can you feel it?&quot; she hissed with a devilish chuckle. &quot;Can you feel yourself dying?&quot; <br>
<br>
Khasirath took a step back, jerking the blade from her leg. His eyes narrowed in defiance and confusion. She cried out in pain as the sudden flow of blood spurted from the wound in the rhythm of her racing heart. She fell to her knee, placing a hand over the gash. The white ice of the ledge became slippery from her blood. <br>
<br>
She watched him wipe his own blood from his lips. &quot;The poison on the blade would have weakened your muscles and slowed your attacks if you had let it work through your blood stream. But you licked the blade! Ingested, even I don’t know how painfully you will die.&quot; <br>
<br>
Khasirath took another uncertain step back, his eyes flicking towards Creapiing for a brief second. Anari heard the creaking of the leather wrapped around the hilt of his saber as his fist tightened reflexively. She actually had him off-guard. In his inscrutable violet eyes something unpleasant writhed, something that seemed to disturb him greatly. Was it fear? <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he growled, shaking his head. <br>
<br>
She reached into her boot and pulled out her last dagger, its hilt slick with her blood. &quot;Perhaps after you’re dead, I will finish what I started with Tzanntiel. No, that was too easy. Maybe I’ll use some of the techniques I learned from you and Kvariya on the little cleric. Vhalshae I believe her name was-&quot; <br>
<br>
She had gone too far. <br>
<br>
What little control S`Therik had left over his hate was gone and with a bestial scream he closed the distance between them and drove his sword into her chest. The indigo blade shattered through her ribs, her vital organs, only to pierce through her back. <br>
<br>
Her dagger fell from her hand. <br>
<br>
Her weight shifted, her foot slipping on the icy ledge. Instinctively her hand reached out, grasping onto Khasirath’s wrist as she began to fall. For a moment she hung there, suspended dangerously over the edge of the bridge. <br>
<br>
Gravity won. <br>
<br>
She tumbled over the edge, dragging the Teir`Dal with her. <br>
<br>
The wind whistled in her ears, her fading vision focused on S`Therik’s face. She felt a sudden jarring as she broke through the ice, then the deep chill cascading over her. Her eyes closed and she welcomed the darkness.<br>

That was all she needed to read his intent.  Khasirath had never bested Creapiing despite his superior training, simply because Creapiing could so easily read his thoughts.  She hoped that Khasirath could read her assessment of the situation--dubious.  <br>
<br>
This frigid bridge where Khasirath and Anari had danced was now sprayed with bloody streaks.  Weapons, bits of cloth, and blood we tossed about haphazardly.  The fight itself had been legendary in quality, and Creapiing felt honored that she had been able to witness such a display.  She had not interfered, but she also ensured that no other interfered.<br>
<br>
Quick as a cat, Anari danced around Khasirath, cutting him here and there.  Viciously, Khasirath battled Anari looking for the one perfect opening to end this all.  Then, with a single look to Creapiing, they both plunged off the bridge in a tangled mass.<br>
<br>
Creapiing raced to the edge in time to see Khasirath hitting at Anari as they plunged into the ice covered river.  The cracking of the ice gave off a sound that was almost inaudible against the sound of every one of Anaris bones breaking as she hit the ice first.  Creapiing wasnt sure whether the screams she heard were only in her mind.  She raced across the ice and grabbed Khasiraths cloak.  <br>
<br>
Her feet scrabbled for traction.  Khasiraths dead weight was pulling her toward the opening.  Creapiing fell to the ice, hoping that the length of her body against the ice would give her enough footing to pull Khasirath out.  Visions of his smiling face in her office, of the way he blushed, of the strength of his presence passed through her mind.  Tensing every muscle, Creapiing pulled steadily and with all her strength to draw Khasirath out onto the ice.<br>
<br>
Odd splotches of green stood out on his normally Bluish skin.  Poison.  The freezing water had highlighted every bit of poison.  Creapiing dipped her hands into the frigid water and retrieved a handful of ice chips.  Quickly she placed the ice on each poisoned wound, and placed a large chunk in his mouth. <br>
<br>
Then, with a loud prayer to Innoruuk, Creapiing began the slow and painful process of transferring her health to the fading body of Khasirath.  Again and again the two of them were surrounded by a red glow as she prayed, chanted and cast her feeble magic to save Khasiraths life.  Finally exhausted, she slumped across his body on the frozen river. <p>Creapiing V'Etch<BR>
