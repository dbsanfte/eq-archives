Enjoy. - A.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Artillius was found sitting calmly on the floor in the sub-basement of Khasirath's estate. He made no motions as several Teir'Dal approached him. They raised his arms up to gain better access to the shackles binding his wrists together, and chaining him to the wall. One used a long handled device to drive the pin from the shackles, releasing Artillius. The others were on guard, but there was no need, Artillius did not resist or make any aggressive actions. He was given a simple leather harness and loincloth. Then he was led out of the basement and into the courtyard.<br>
<br>
Several Teir'Dal soldiers were already practicing their combat skills, some used wooden weapons and pads, while others wore armor and wielded steel. Khasirath was in the courtyard. He currently had three Teir'Dal warriors circling around him in mock combat. He halted his practice when he saw that the Human was finally brought up. Khasirath took a long look at the Human. He was tall for a Human, and had broad shoulders, but his ribs showed through his chest and his legs were skinny. He looked too old to begin a career as a fighter. Training should begin while you are still a boy; this Human was showing signs of age. Creases showed around the eyes and his black hair had a little gray peppering his temples. It was difficult to judge his age. Khasirath suspected he was not quite as old as he appeared. It looked more like he has been heavily weathered. His hair was long and ungroomed. He had numerous scars all over his body. Some were superficial while others appeared to have been caused by serious injury. The bulk of his scars were in crisscrossed lines on his back. The Human was certainly well acquainted with the whip. His eyes were curious. They were gray, but they didn't seem to focus on anything in particular. They were glazed over, giving them a sheen that made them look almost silver. Artillius had probably served as a soldier somewhere, or perhaps he had been a mercenary. He might learn quickly, but Khasirath had his doubts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Provide the Human a practice sword,&quot; ordered the Reaper. &quot;Tolleck, square off against him. I wish to see where his skills are, but don't hurt him too badly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolleck chuckled and acknowledged Khasirath's orders. &quot;I shall do my best milord, but Humans are so fragile it will be difficult.&quot; The others in the courtyard laughed and began to form a circle around Tolleck and Artillius to better observe the match. A servant brought Artillius a wooden sword and placed it in his hand. Artillius let it hang from his arm with its tip dragging on the ground. Tolleck still wore his black chain mail and his skull shaped steel helm, but he replaced his long sword with a wooden one to match Artillius's.<br>
<br>
Artillius started blankly as Tolleck approached him. Tolleck was quick to attack and easily struck Artillius on his left shoulder. Artillius gave a grunt, but made no move to defend himself. Tolleck attacked again and jabbed the Human in the abdomen. Artillius doubled over, then Tolleck rapped him across the back sending the Human face down into the ground.<br>
<br>
Tolleck stepped away from the fight to address the on-lookers. &quot;This is too easy. Cannot you provide me with a Human worthy of my skill?&quot; The crowd laughed at his comments, and followed with a variety of insults against Humans. A few teased Tolleck as well, which brought on even heartier laughter. &quot;This is no harder then slaying a practice dummy, but it is slightly more entertaining.&quot; The crowd continued with their jests and laughter. Artillius was still on the ground, but he had recovered to his hands and knees. He was beginning to stand up when Tolleck said, &quot;I'm not done talking yet, Human.&quot; Then he swung his sword in a flamboyant move, slapping Artillius in his face, cutting his cheek and sending him back to the ground. The crowd cheered Tolleck. &quot;Must I continue this Lord Khasirath? This exhibition is clearly one-sided.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, continue the bout. I still wish to observe more,&quot; said Khasirath. &quot;Someone help the human to his feet.&quot; Two Teir'Dal went to Artillius and roughly pulled him up. Then one of them guided his arms so that his sword was in the ready position and pointed at Tolleck.<br>
<br>
Tolleck advanced on Artillius again. He beat his weapon to the side and cracked the Human on top of his head. Then Tolleck swung hard into Artillius's side. The human grimaced with the pain and lowered his weapon. Tolleck followed with a thrust to his chest, sending Artillius sprawling onto his back. Tolleck paused while Artillius was assisted to his feet. Then he began his onslaught of repeatedly beating the Human with his weapon. Tolleck shouted at him while attacking. &quot;Why do you not fight, Human? Defend yourself!&quot; The crowd began to &quot;boo&quot; Artillius for not fighting back.<br>
<br>
The Reaper shouted at the Human, &quot;Artillius defend yourself!&quot; Artillius looked towards Khasirath before receiving another blow to the head. &quot;Fight back!&quot; shouted the Reaper again. Then Khasirath shouted in the human tongue, &quot;I order you to fight!&quot; Artillius’s sword arm came to life. He sidestepped the next attack causing Tolleck to miss. The crowd cheered. Tolleck attacked again and Artillius swung his sword in a wide arc, catching his opponent's weapon and deflecting it harmlessly away. Then with both hands on the hilt, Artillius swung into the side of Tolleck's head. His wooden blade splintered and broke apart with the force. Tolleck nearly fell over side-ways, but he recovered and attacked the human with a new determination. Artillius only had the jagged stub of his weapon left, but he rushed in to meet Tolleck's attack. Artillius reached out with his left arm and grabbed Tolleck's wrist as the Teir'Dal swung down. Then Artillius stepped even closer to Tolleck and pivoted, pulling on Tolleck's arm and using Tolleck's own force to roll him across his body, flipping him onto his back. Tolleck’s armor made a loud crash as he hit the ground. Tolleck was dazed as Artillius quickly got on top of him and began rapidly stabbing him with the remnants of his weapon. Tolleck's chain mail withstood the stabs, but a few hits managed to land at the base of his neck, where his helm and tunic left a small vulnerability. The crowd was stunned at the sudden turn of events, but when they saw blood flinging from Artillius’s weapon they descended upon him.<br>
<br>
The crowded might have torn Artillius apart if Khasirath had not intervened. The Reaper ordered them to pull the Human off of Tolleck and to take him back to the sub-basement. A Cleric tended to Tolleck's wounds. The Cleric said they were not overly serious and he would recover in a few days. Khasirath ordered everyone to resume their practice, but he excused himself to see to other duties and to ponder what was happening.<br>

Hate to be a nit picker, but for the record, this is taking place in House S`Therik, which is a very private place. Shaede had asked if she could be visiting, but its unlikely others would have seen this. Of course, Artillius was at our meeting, so some of you may have seen him there.<br>
