Try talking to an officer about the situation like an adult.  If your not satisfied with the result, then go on with your idol threats of &quot;war&quot;.  If you were ks'ed something will be done about it. If you were kiting Lodi around without a group strong enough to kill the turtle, then there is agruement.  DD and IV have had a working relationship in the past, there is no reason to disrupt it over this spawn.  If you have logs, i suggest you send them by email to one of our leaders IE Morkenlar or Backalley.  There is a civil way to go about this, starting shit on p.com is not the way to do it.<br>

<br>
I would like to settle this here and now.<br>
<br>
There are 2 sides to every story and I think that nobody is at fault, but something should be said for both sides.<br>
<br>
It was mentioned that IV was in another zone, twink came up, saw lodi, told IV, IV came, saw nobody had it, conquered.  That in my books would have been fine.<br>
<br>
However, if that is exactly what happened, why is there an issue?  Well truth is that Raedon's group, which included me, Laszlo, was on the scene about 45 mins before IV.  Here is what happened.  Keep in mind that I am not upset.  It is just a game to me and there are many other days that will come that I can get phat loot.  It is the fun that I have in the game that brings me back every day.<br>
<br>
From my point of view, this is what happened:<br>
<br>
After having the Castle trained on the zone in Velks, causing massive death, I built a team for the tents.  It included a cleric, monk, war, chanter, shammy, and the last one was a druid i think.  We cleaned out the tents fast and then our shammy died.  Next thing I heard from shammy was that Lodi was up.  I assume he was bound in IC.  So we took a vote and we went over to IC.  When we got there, the chanter decided to bail.  That was a problem for us.  We went over to the puppy camp and did a camp check.  Nobody claimed Lodi, so we did.  For the next 30 to 45 mins, we searched for a Chanter or another shammy and meanwhile, we were casting Malo on Lodi so that he was slower and wouldnt hurt us till the extra class got there.  That makes sense and anyone would do that.  What happened next was that we found a shammy.  He was bound in Nexus.  He got a port over to IC just before IV showed up.  He ran over to the puppy camp and we said OK we are ready, start bringing Lodi over.  That is when IV popped in the zone.  My group pleaded with IV and said that we have been Malo'ing him for a bit now and we were 1 min from engaging to kill.  In fact, Lodi died about 50 feet from the puppy camp where our group was.  My group was Really mad and we saw this as a KS, which by definition from the rule books published with EQ, it was a KS.  By that time we had been there for 45 mins and were 1 min from engaging, but had been keeping him occupied, which DOES mean that Lodi was ours.  As for the dead Shammy, that is becuase he got summoned cuz of an IV arrow.<br>
<br>
Since I was upset at this, as would any person be upset in my position, I decided to try to loot Lodi myself and try to get some loot.  I felt that since we were on scene 45 mins before IV that it was our loot and that anything IV took was stolen.  I didn't expect to be able to loot anything, but I managed to get a part of a map, and a ring.  I felt that that was justified, IV got 2 pieces, my group got 2 pieces.  All is fair, lets go home.<br>
<br>
However, both sides wanted it all so, this started out.<br>
<br>
My group should get all the loot cuz we were KS'ed, but IV should get it all because they did more damage.  I agree with both sides on this.<br>
<br>
As for the loot, I was by the puppy camp, and I went LD for 3 hours.  This is becuase Rogers Cable is doing maintainance on the area and I can't get on.  As I type this, my modem is flashing.  They keep saying they will be done in 1 hour.... ya right.  When I got back, the loot was gone from me.  It is my understanding that IV got it.  To me, I say... O well, maybe next time.  To others.... maybe not.<br>
<br>
I would like to say in IV's eyes, they did nothing wrong.  It looked from their point of view that nothing was started, so they took Lodi down (despite the tonnes of shouts in zone that Lodi is camped by us... I can't figure out why they kept going).  But they took down Lodi very nicely.  In my groups eyes, we know the entire story that happened before IV was on the scene and to us, IV KS'ed us.<br>
<br>
I would like to take this time to appologize formally to IV for ninja looting Lodizal.  I was upset at what I perceived as a KS attempt by a guild that has been known to take what they want.  To tell you the truth, if I was on your end and in a guild like yours, and had the power to demolish any mob I like, I would do it too.  However, I would still look at the people that I am hurting in the meantime.  If we took half and you took half of the loot, I think we would have been content on both sides.  Maybe it is just me.<br>
<br>
I would like, as well, to ask that my name be cleared from the aggro list that many in IV have me on because of this issue.  I will try to make sure that I do not put myself in a situation like this again.  I sincerely appologize for any frustration I may have caused you.<br>
<br>
Although I do not agree entirely with the decision made by the GM, I would like to congratulate IV on getting some phat loot.  Whoever got it, I hope that you get some great use out of them.<br>
<br>
To my group, I am sorry that I went LD.  I must have seemed that I just left with the loot, but I swear I did not.  I just did a LD.  I took a picture of the people in the group before I did, so I knew your names and I would have split the loot one way or another.  The map would have been MQ'ed and the ring randomed.<br>
<br>
I hope that this report is as detailed as possible and shows that each side had a point of view, but each side as well missed something about the other side.  We missed that IV thought that nobody had touched him, and IV missed that we had touched him and had been there for like 45 mins.<br>
<br>
I look forward to a response to this post and I hope that it says something along the lines of: &quot;Ok Laszlo, shut up now, we get the point, you are free to go.  Don't ninja us again.  Buh bye.&quot;<br>
