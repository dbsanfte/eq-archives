Meeting the Winnower<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The room Selilya has designated to meet Xosha in was functional, and just on the poorer side of uncomfortable. Selilya sat in a tall wooden chair, the back reaching past her head as she sat. The chair had no cushions and seemed even un sanded and rough to Xosha's appraisal. The table she sat before was much the same, though not roughy so much now as uneven. The surface of the table waving and bucking to knots in the wood. <br>
<br>
There was two other pieces of furniture in the room, the short stool that sat opposite Selilya, clearly for Xosha to sit on (also clear was the the stool had been made shorter than the Winnower's chair for a reason, if Xosha sat in it, her knees would bend up to her chest, and she would be sitting mucyh lower than the other woman, giving Xosha's questionner a much more powerful seating during the meeting), and a candelabra directly behind Selilya, creating a dark shadow over her face, the dramatic effect surprised even Xosha. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good of you to come, young assassin.&quot; Selilya spoke not in words it seemed, but rather the sound of her speach seemed intoned as bells ringing and echoing. <br>
<br>
Xosha sighed, she seemed to always be called young, or child, it was a throw over from her apprenticeship. As tradition stated, the teacher, despite age, would always be the senior of the two, and to show the differentiation from teacher and student (and Xo suspected, also to keep the apprentice from getting a full head) the student was always referred to in reflection to this. Child or young one, even analgies like sapling and spark were common. Sadly, before Xosha could take an apprentice of her own, her Il-Haress had passed, and Xo feared that without her master's example, the term would stick. <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Winnower, that is how they call you?&quot; Xosha asked slyly. Selilya nodded, the expression on her face hidden by shadow. &quot;more than a few people tell me that your group is a powerful force in the taking of the lands for Innoruuk.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then am I to understand that you study our group?&quot; Selilya sounded light and easy with these words, they trickled in the room as fairy bells and tinkling pixie charms. <br>
<br>
Xosha grinned. &quot;I have watched a few, even gotten my hands on a copy of your.... constitution... shall we call it?&quot; Xosha gambled here. To admit to having access to private goods of the guild is might anger this leader, but also it seemed necessary for Xo to make a point, especially since she had certain aims in this guild all ready, and needed to show at least some of her abilities right off. <br>
<br>
Luck was with Xo, for Selilya chuckled, her bell like tone going deep now and powerful. &quot;I would expect nothing less of one with your past, I also have heard some of your history. Killed two teachers at the Ebon Mask, apprenticed quickly out of that thieves school in the very moment you were to be executed...&quot; <br>
<br>
Very well, thought Xo, I have shown you that I am wise in the mention of your guild charter, and you have shown that I am weak, with example of my capture and need for salvation... back to square one... <br>
<br>
&quot;Winnower, this would go nowhere if we continued to parlay gently and size eachother up with verbal hooks and catches. To see this 'child' for what she is, you will need to see her in action, I take it that for membership there is some grand quest I must accomplish for you?&quot; <br>
<br>
Selilya turned her head just slightly to the side, her left eye now being visible in the light of the candle, Xosha saw her amusment therein. &quot;Is there not always?&quot; <br>
<br>
Xosha smiled, now we were getting somewhere. Perhaps you don't see it yet Winnower, but THIS assassin will be the strongest ally you have ever gained. And I think I may gain something from you, if my instincts on the posibilites of your people are near correct. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well then Winnower, what can I do for you?&quot; <br>

Re: Meeting the Winnower<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Selilya had mentioned to Naedra, her assistant, that she would be in the research room upstairs reviewing more pieces of scrolls that had been discovered in her last trip to Permafrost. She went to the unfinished room from time to time when members of the Harvest would return to the grange for rest, refreshment, and reporting to superiors. Her office was not far from the main hall, and although the din of voices usually didn't bother her, there were still some moments when concentration was harder to maintain. This would result in a retreat to the study upstairs. <br>
<br>
Before long, Naedra escorted the rogue, Xosha, to the study. Selilya had heard her name mentioned by several of her peers and was quite pleased this one had sought out the Violent Harvest. With the impending wars ahead, having one with the gift of evasion and stealth would be most valuable. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good of you to come, young assassin,&quot; Selilya smiled. She knew that the next few moments of conversation would consist of the usual posturing and sizing up. That didn't bother Selilya...she was used to it. Her role as part zealot and part diplomat gave her many opportunities to indulge in this exercise. <br>
<br>
Eventually the matter of the entrance requirements to the grange was discussed. Xosha had done her research well and knew of the &quot;quest&quot; to be completed before she would earn her membership in the order. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well then Winnower, what can I do for you?&quot; Xosha inquired. <br>
<br>
Selilya sat back and smiled at Xosha. She had already been thinking of a challenge for the rogue...a measure of her abilities. A highly skilled assassin should be able to go practically anywhere at anytime to accomplish a mission. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is an Erudite witch named Maugarim who has taken an icon needed by our clerics. The reports I have heard indicate she may have fled to Kerra Island. I want you to track her down, Xosha. Hunt her down and punish her for her actions. Our clerics are far to important to be treated this way. Now, I'd like you to take at least one travelling companion...more if you wish...from our order. Show them this missive, so they will have no doubt that your &quot;trip&quot; has been commissioned by me. Good hunting, young assassin. From all I've been told about you, you should have no trouble.&quot; <br>
<br>
Selilya arose from her chair and handed Xosha a scroll closed with the Winnower's seal. As she began to walk by, she placed her hand on Xosha's shoulder. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your mentor was something special, Xosha. We, as the Chosen race, mourn her passing. She believed in you, I know. I, too, expect great things from you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Selilya walked out into the hall, leaving the young assassin to her thoughts. <br>
