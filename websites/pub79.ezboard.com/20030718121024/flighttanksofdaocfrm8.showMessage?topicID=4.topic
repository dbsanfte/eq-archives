 <br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br>
<br>
- The Shaman level 50 armor has been replaced with a more suitable graphic.<br>
<br>
- Enemy players should now longer be able to take control of siege equipment through a door.<br>
<br>
- If you're in combat mode and you sit down, you'll now exit out of combat mode.<br>
<br>
- Heals will now &quot;heal&quot; mez, even when the person being healed is at full health.<br>
<br>
- Really large experience awards should no longer print as negative numbers (even though the proper amount of experience as being awarded).<br>
<br>
- High-level poisons are now stripped from a weapon that is used by a lower level player. Previously the poison would not &quot;fire&quot;, and the poison would stay on the weapon indefinitely.<br>
<br>
- Chat groups will now support up to 50 players.<br>
<br>
- [/gc who alliance] will now show you everyone in the alliance, not just players in your guild.<br>
<br>
- Keep Lords and Guards will no longer warp to the roofs of keeps when fighting enemies.<br>
<br>
- You can no longer use charged items directly out of your inventory.<br>
<br>
- You can no longer &quot;pull&quot; players via resurrection behind boundary walls or other illegal locations.<br>
<br>
- Pets will no longer attack mesmerized enemies if the pet is in defensive mode. If he is set to aggressive, he will still attack mezzed enemies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
REALM ABILITIES NOTES <br>
<br>
- A bug was fixed that was causing a number of active realm abilities to be mismatched and perform incorrect functions or no function at all.<br>
<br>
- Mastery of Stealth now has 3 levels and each level adds 5% movement speed while stealthed.<br>
<br>
- Augmented Stats not showing up and Mastery of Water not boosting swim speed are known issues and will be fixed shortly.<br>
<br>
- Wild Arcana's description reads: &quot;A percent to critical for up to double effect with duration-based magic.&quot; This should read: &quot;A percent to critical for up to double effect for damage-over-time, stat debuffs, resistance debuffs, snares and disease spells.&quot; Mesmerize, stun and root spells are not affected.<br>
<br>
- Mastery of the Arcane's description reads: &quot;Additional effectiveness of duration-based spells.&quot; This should read: &quot;A percent bonus to the values of buff spells, including stat, regeneration, resistance, damage add/shield, haste, and absorption spells.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
- The Rain line of realm abilities have had their base damage reduced, and add 2 dps per level in the ability. In general these types of abilities add 5% per level for the duration.<br>
<br>
- Purge and Group Purge work while mesmerized now.<br>
<br>
- Siege Bolt should be doing much more damage. We will still look at whether or not the new damage is where it needs to be, given the reuse timer and other factors.<br>
<br>
- The Juggernaut pet is faster, bigger, and actually named something now. It was erroneously being summoned at L50 no matter what the level of the caster was, however; this has been corrected. It is supposed to be a 100% pet.<br>
<br>
- Made a change to skill checks that may affect a few spells that were checking &quot;skill 0&quot; to improve the offensive skill associated with the spell. This should increase their effectiveness. Volcanic Pillar is one example.<br>
<br>
- Volcanic Pillar has been changed to a direct damage spell, instead of a bolt. The damage of the spell wasn't changed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AUDIO NOTES<br>
<br>
This version of Camelot has the first version of our new ambient sound system. You'll notice while running around that you won't hear so much dead silence. This version is just the first step in the changes, though - so all you'll hear are non-interactive sounds such as birds, animals, wind, etc. All zones have had this sound upgrade, which includes both new day and night sounds. <br>
<br>
Pendragon testers need to give us feedback on how intrusive the sounds are: if they are too loud/too soft, the right sounds for the area, you hear streams when you are near them, you don't hear streams where there is no water, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES<br>
<br>
Trade Skills: all craft trainers will now give additional information to players just prior to joining a crafting guild. Information details what the player will be creating and how well the player can craft within the other crafting skills.<br>
<br>
Midgard Quests: We have added two repeatable quests, similar to the Soul Gem and Fell Tooth Albion-based quests. These Midgard quests begin in Uppland, and there is a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete them.<br>
<br>
Albion Quests: Remember, in our next patch, we will be adding a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete the following quests: &quot;Soul Gem&quot; and &quot;Fell Tooth Bounty.&quot; If you want to guarantee that you can turn in any items you might have been saving for these quests, you should turn them in before the next patch.<br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests: We have added two repeatable quests, similar to the Soul Gem and Fell Tooth Albion-based quests. These Hibernian quests begin in or near Mt. Collory, and there is a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete them.<br>
<br>
Hibernia Monster Encounters: Hibernia, Cliffs of Moher: The Koalinth Sentinels guarding Koalinth Caverns taken new sentry posts away from the exit of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES<br>
<br>
- Several common loot objects are now stackable that previously weren't. This includes necklaces, collars, chains, bracelets, bracers, armbands, bottles, different kinds of dust, essences, pins, and a few other assorted small items.<br>
<br>
- Salvage values based on the value of the object have been set on existing dropped armor and weapons.<br>
<br>
- Removed &quot;phantom proc&quot; from the Worn Dark Guardian Sword.<br>
<br>
- The stat bonuses on the Granny's Shawl were tuned to be more level appropriate.<br>
<br>
- Salvage values based on the value of the object has been set on existing<br>
quest armor and weapons.<br>
<br>
- The Cloak of Night can now take emblems.<br>
<br>
- The Emerald-beaded strand now has the correct icon.<br>
<br>
- The level 50 Infiltrator, and Friar quest armor should now show properly. Previously they had missing graphics<br>
 <br>
In addition to the already posted 150C notes:<br>
<br>
AMBIENT SOUNDS<br>
<br>
- All ambient sounds have been slightly increased in volume. Other minor tweaks made.<br>
<br>
<br>
REALM POINT ABILITIES STRIPPED<br>
<br>
- Realm abilities from each character have been stripped, and the realm training points added back so continued testing of abilities can be performed.<br>
