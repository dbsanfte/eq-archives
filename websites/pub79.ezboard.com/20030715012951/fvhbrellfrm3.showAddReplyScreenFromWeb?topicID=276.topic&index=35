Part 22.</span><hr size=1> Tzann returned to Shadow Haven quickly the next day.  She kept the surprisingly heavy jar of unguent that Yaoi had prepared in her belt pouch, close at hand.  She stopped in at her apartment, and found Shaede was there, reading through some books in the small living room.<br>
<br>
“I have not been able to find anything about that Erudite you wanted me to research,” Shaede said, looking rather crestfallen.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled as she walked over to the Mage.  She bent down and brushed her lips across Shaede’s cheek gently, “It’s alright, pet.  I’ve had a breakthrough.  I don’t think I will be needing that information anymore.”<br>
<br>
Shaede smiled brightly, caressing Tzann’s cheek with one hand.  “I’m so relieved.  I was so worried.”<br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled softly.  “Never worry, Shaede.  This will turn out just fine.  I know it will.”<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded, and then looked up, “Oh, there are some scrolls for you in the desk.  I don’t know who they are from.”<br>
<br>
Still smiling, Tzann wandered to the desk, and found a small stack of sealed letters and rolled parchments.  A number of them she recognized easily.  The fine papers and inks were from Qeynos, and the writing on their fronts was in Kassy’s elegant script.  Tzann pulled them aside and slipped them into a drawer with a number of similar ones, some opened, but most not.  Each one had been about the same, asking for news, offering to help again and again.  Tzanntiel wasn’t willing to share her news, and she was even less ready to ask for more help from the Enchantress.  Tzann had replied a few times to the earlier ones, saying that things were going well, and making vague promises to ask for help if she needed to.  Since these had obviously not reassured Kassy, or helped her settle down, Tzann had pretty much stopped sending the replies so often.  She made sure to send one at least once a week now, just to show her that she was still around, in the hopes she wouldn’t try anything desperate.<br>
<br>
There were three letters from some of Tzanntiel’s other contacts, keeping her up to date that they were still searching.  None had found anything worthy of note though.  Tzann thought for a moment to reply to them, and tell them that she didn’t need the help anymore, but she decided to remain cautious.  Until Khas was awake, she couldn’t be so certain that she did have the cure.  Should it fail, she would need them working hard.<br>
<br>
The last scroll was on a darker parchment.  Tzanntiel recognized the work of Neriak’s paper millers.  Her name was neatly scribed in pure black ink on the outside of the scroll, and black wax sealed it shut.  The imprint of the seal was a bit smeared, but she was able to recognize a few designs common to members of the Lodge of the Dead.  Slightly uneasy, Tzann used a knife from her writing table to slice off the seal and unrolled the scroll to read it.<br>
<br>
Dark Greetings to you, Tzanntiel Bloodthorne of House S`Therik,<br>
<br>
My name is Elentrae, and I write this missive at the request of my Masters at the Lodge of the Dead.  I am the youngest child of House D`Sreth, though I serve not that House, but another.  I am a Knight in training, and I have been instructed to offer my services to you so as to help you in your quest in any way that I might.  I do not know what your mission may be, but my Masters at the Lodge imply that it may be important to them.<br>
<br>
I am your to command, and I await your instructions.<br>
Elentrae<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel read the letter over again, frowning.  What did the Lodge know of her quest?  And why would they send her help?  Admittedly, Khasirath was a powerful member of the Lodge, but they were not known for their helpfulness.  Knights were supposed to be self-sufficient; those that were not were culled to strengthen the whole of the Guild.  How did they know what she was trying to do?  She knew Vhalshae would not have mentioned House matters to anyone.  And none of the others she had sought for help in gathering information would have gone to them, or known enough to put together her plans.<br>
<br>
She folded the parchment up tightly and slipped it into one of the hidden pockets in her cloak.  She would have to contact the young Knight soon, she did not want to anger the Lodge of the Dead by ignoring their offer.  The Lodge held a lot of power in Neriak, just a step behind the Spires of Innoruuk who spoke for the Father.  They were the elite Knights and Necromancers of Hate, the guardians of the Church, and the elite fighters in the Wars of the Empire.<br>
<br>
Turning back to Shaede, Tzanntiel smiled again, hiding any signs of worry.  “Thanks for letting me know about the letters,” she said.<br>
<br>
Shaede lowered her eyes, “Good news, I hope.”<br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled and nodded, “Good enough for my tastes.”  She sighed softly, “I wish I could stay longer, but I have to go out again.  I just wanted to stop in and make sure you were ok.”<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded, still looking down at her lap, “I’m fine.  And I’m glad I saw you, even if only for a little bit.”<br>
<br>
Tzann walked over to Shaede’s chair, and knelt in front of her to lean forward and hug her tightly.  “This will all be done with soon, pet.  It will be better then.”<br>
<br>
Shaede hugged Tzann back tightly as Tzann stroked her hair.  “I know.  I am praying that it will be.”<br>
<br>
Smiling, Tzann leaned up and kissed Shaede gently on the lips.  “I’ll see you again soon, beautiful.  I promise.”<br>
<br>
Shaede smiled softly as Tzanntiel stood back up and walked out the door.  Tzann paused to blow her a kiss before she was gone.<br>
<br>
Staying to the shadows of the crowd, Tzann passed through the city to Echo Caverns, and the entrance to the sewer tunnels.  She made her way through the maze to the tunnel where she had hidden her brother carefully.  Swiftly she checked and disabled each of the traps she had set, and was somewhat relieved to see that none had been tripped or tampered with as far as she could tell.<br>
<br>
In the small chamber, Khasirath lay wrapped in the blankets and furs; the chest that had hidden him was pushed up against the wall where she had left it.  Tzann knelt beside him, looking down into her brother’s face.  Gently she pushed aside the blankets, and ran her hands over his chest.  He still felt so cold, though the underground tunnels in the heart of Luclin were fairly warm.  She could feel his ribs through his dry pale skin.  She sighed as she lifted one of his wrists, and turned it over to check his wounds.  They were fairly well healed now, the swollen puncture scars standing out next to the thin parallel lines from his rituals.  Tzann ran her fingers over the scars, feeling the bumps and wrinkles.  Her fingers slid slowly up Khas’ arm, tracing the faded red patterns that covered it.<br>
<br>
Tzann laid Khas’ arm across his chest and sat back.  She looked down at her own unscarred wrists.  A sudden sensation of loss surrounded her.  She had never been through those rituals.  The Harvest was gone before she could take her Binding, though she had completed her Culling quest.  All the others considered her a true Harvester, one of the Paragons now.  But she wondered what she had missed by not drinking from the Bloodstone Chalice.<br>
<br>
Tearing herself from her morose thoughts, Tzann pulled the jar from her belt pouch.  She cradled it between her palms as she prayed silently for a moment to the Father.  With her belt knife she carefully broke the wax seal Yaoi had put around the ceramic lid, and pried it off.  The unguent was silvery-grey, and seemed to gleam even in the darkness.  Leaning closer to Khas she dipped her fingers into the pasty cream, and began to apply it to the collar.  She spread it evenly over the rune-carved metal, using both hands as she lifted his head enough to cover the back as well.  Her fingers began to tingle, going numb and she rubbed the potion over the collar.<br>
<br>
Tzann held her breath as she added the last bit of potion to the collar, running her fingers over it one more time to be sure every bit of it was covered.  Her eyes were wide, every muscle tensed, waiting for some response, some light or noise or magical energies to show that it was working.  She almost jumped when she heard a soft crack, like someone stepping on an egg.  A thin straight seam opened on the front of the collar, right along Khasirath’s windpipe.<br>
<br>
Tzann grabbed the two sides of the collar swiftly, as if she was catching a snake.  She held them apart as she lifted Khasirath’s head, and jerked the collar away.  Without looking at it, she tossed it to the far side of the small chamber, where it clattered dully against the stone.  She put a hand to Khas’ throat; two rings of abrasions from the top and bottom of the collar ringed his neck, and his skin where it had been covered was so pale it was almost the color of frost.<br>
<br>
Gently rubbing his throat, Tzann leaned closer, whispering, “Khas, can you hear me?  Please open your eyes…”<br>
<br>
She felt his neck tighten as he drew in a breath, still slow, but deeper than she’d seen since she had found him.  Suddenly his body jerked, a spasm that startled her, though she did not move away.  His hands lifted feebly towards her, then dropped back to the floor as he hissed softly in pain.<br>
<br>
Tzann placed her hands on his chest, feeling the beat of his heart through his skin.  It was still slow, still weak, but far more regular.  His head rolled side to side slowly, and he tried to open his eyes, only to close them again immediately.<br>
<br>
“I’m here Khas, you’re somewhere safe,” Tzann whispered.<br>
<br>
Khas’ lips moved weakly, but he wasn’t able to speak.  Keeping one hand on his chest, Tzann pulled a water skin from her pack.  With her fingers she rubbed some water across his dry lips, then she shifted around to pillow his head and shoulders on her lap.  Carefully she brought the water skin to his lips.  “Try to drink,” she said softly as she began to tip it, dribbling a few drops of water into his mouth.<br>
<br>
He had some trouble swallowing at first, but it became easier.  She stopped after he drank almost a third of the skin.  He licked his lips slowly, drawing another slow breath.<br>
<br>
“Tzann…” he whispered, his voice so rough it was a raspy growl.<br>
<br>
“Yes brother.  It is me, I am here to help you regain your strength,” Tzann said, running a hand across his brow gently.  She could feel him trembling.  She reached down and pulled the blankets up tighter around him.<br>
<br>
“So weak,” he gasped slowly, every word a struggle.  “What happened?”<br>
<br>
Tzann sighed softly, smoothing his hair, “You were betrayed, abducted, hidden away for a long time under magical bonds.  But you are free now.  You will recover your strength, and I will help you find the ones who betrayed you.”<br>
<br>
He was still for a long moment, but Tzann could see him slowly coiling and uncoiling his fists.  His face was calm, though Tzann imagined in his weakened condition even such small motions must be causing him great pain.<br>
<br>
“The Harvest, our House?” he asked, almost a demand.<br>
<br>
“We will talk about them once you are well, Khasirath.  We must focus on one thing at a time.”<br>
<br>
He let out a frustrated growl, opening his eyes to look up at her.  His silvery eyes watered in pain, though he stubbornly would not close them.  Tzann frowned with worry as she looked down into his eyes, and she laid a hand on his cheek.<br>
<br>
“Do you think you are strong enough to recall some spells and work some magic, brother?”<br>
<br>
He frowned, letting his eyes close again.  He drew a deep breath and finally said, “I think I can.”<br>
<br>
Tzann nodded, “Good.  I want you to take some of my life, Khas.  I will go find you some better prey as soon as I am sure you are well enough to leave alone.”<br>
<br>
He laid still a long while, and Tzann was worried he may have fallen back into a kind of sleep.  But slowly his eyes opened again.  “Are you ready?” he whispered.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” she replied, sitting very still.<br>
<br>
Khas began to mutter softly, unnatural words coming slowly back to his memory.  An angry glow surrounded them both for a moment as Tzann felt herself weaken a bit.  Khas drew in a deep breath, seeming stronger.<br>
<br>
“Again,” Tzann urged.<br>
<br>
It took some time for him to be able to focus the spell again, but Tzann was patient.  She had him repeat the spell a number of times, until she felt he was strong enough.  Her body ached dully, but she ignored it.<br>
<br>
He reached up and grasped her hand, and Tzann smiled.  He still trembled, but his grip was firm.  She could almost swear some color had returned to his face, though he was still terribly pale.<br>
<br>
“You will be safe here, Khas.  I will go find you something else to drain for energy, and I will return as swiftly as I can.”<br>
<br>
He nodded, letting his eyes close again.  Tzann leaned down and gently kissed his forehead.  Carefully she moved away, putting a rolled up blanket beneath his head to cushion it.<br>
<br>
As she stood, Khas opened his eyes again, “Where are my weapons, my armour?”<br>
<br>
“They are not far, but they are in need of repair.  I will see to it, and bring them to you soon.”<br>
<br>
He sighed deeply, and closed his eyes.  “Very well.”<br>
<br>
Tzann paused, and knelt down to look through her pack.  Near the bottom she found one of her spare blades, a finely crafted short sword.  She walked back to Khas and laid the sheathed sword across his chest.  “In case you need it,” she whispered softly, smiling.<br>
<br>
He placed a hand on the sword’s hilt, gripping it tightly.  He nodded, “Thank you, Tzann.”<br>
<br>
Tzann backed towards the tunnel slowly, watching him.  She didn’t want to leave, but she knew she had to get things to help him recover.  That simple thank you had held a lot of unspoken feeling.  She knew he meant far more than a simple thanks for the blade.<br>
<br>
 She stopped a moment, and grabbed the collar from the floor.  She put it into her pack and closed it up.  Finally she turned and walked into the tunnel, carefully setting the traps as she went.  She would have to hurry, she had a lot to do and she wanted to be back with Khasirath within the hour.<br>
