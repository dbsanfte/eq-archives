<br>
Conflicts with the Teir'Dal have been on the rise in recent times. They have been growing more bold and threaten all that is benevolent. It is disturbing that they poison themselves with their beliefs in Innoruuk, but even more disturbing is they have taken up the practice of spreading their beliefs beyond their dark city.<br>
<br>
I have seen Barbarians, Halflings, and Humans bow before them. It is sickening that the Teir'Dal can corrupt the minds of others, for no sane being would willingly become one of their slaves. I had an opportunity to speak briefly with a Barbarian while attempting to rescue her. She proclaimed her alliegence to a sect of Teir'Dal known as the Violent Harvest. She refused to leave and called the guards upon me. I made a hasty exit and escaped, after a lengthy chase. I cannot forget the look in her eyes. At first she was cold, as if she had no soul, however, when she called for the guards, her voice was enraged but her eyes were sad. Despite her proclamation I am not convinced that she is there by her own will.<br>
<br>
Most Teir'Dal will never walk in the light, but there are hope for some. A few have proven themselves to possess good intentions. I believe that it is the doctrinal and oppresive upbringing that clouds their minds. It may yet be possible to save many Teil'Dal before they are irrevocably commited to a life of anguish.<br>
<br>
On the 19th of January I intend to lead a band of faithful follows into the Nektulos Forest. We will make our way to a fallen tree where younger Teir'Dal hunt and preach to them the benefits of the light. We will offer our blessings and try to save as many as we can. Should we find amongst them those who are not Teir'dal, then we shall double our efforts to restore logic to their minds and hope to their hearts.<br>
<br>
Many of those we encounter will not listen and some may become angry, and even call for the guards. We will come in peace, but we must be prepared to face a potential conflict. It is vital that the bridge spanning the Nerrius river remains passable for us, in case we are forced to withdrawl from the forest. A group of volunteers will maintain watch over the bridge to ensure our safe passage.<br>
<br>
It is known that Solus embraces the light, and as such you are invited to partake in this righteous cause. I understand that there are many important events to undergo in Norrath, but your help in this matter would be appreciated. For it is our duty to save those who are confused and repressed; we must act on their behalf before they condemn themselves to their dark fate.<br>
<br>
I await your reply with eagerness. May you all enjoy Erollisi's embrace.<br>

OOC: The Violent Harvest is invited and encouraged to attend this event. It is my hope that you will offer good debate and other roleplaying. However, I have no intention of starting a guildwar or dueling, this event was scheduled primarily to offer an opportunity to meet each other and have some fun. We shall be in Nektulos for most of the afternoon of Saturday, January 19th PST. Hope to see you there.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udaiunusdarkenvalor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daiunus Darkenvalor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/14/02 10:55:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A spy (I'm sure you've got some) has acquired a letter..</span><hr size=1> One of Daiunus's disciples entered the room, short of breath, but with a look of ultimate satisfaction upon his young face.  <br>
&quot; Speak boy, why do you have that foolish grin upon your face?&quot; Daiunus looked to the young boy, wondering if this one had lost his mind, to enter the Thresher's warroom in such a fit.<br>
&quot; My Thresher, I bring you a letter that I think you may find interesting,&quot;  The boy answered, the smile slowly leaving his face, realizing the consequences if the Thresher was not amused.  Daiunus motioned to the boy to come closer, and snatching it from the young Tier'dal's hand, he began to peruse the letter quickly.<br>
&quot; Abatteur, you have done well, this news should be investigated.  Make sure that we have some of the Chosen at this little gathering that this Lightborne fool has decided to hold within our Forest... and... fetch me Payle.. I think I must have words with her on this....&quot;<br>
The boy quickly rushed out of the room to deliver the news to the messengers of the Harvest, so that all the Chosen may come to protect their forest.<br>

He stopped suddenly and looked at seemingly empty air as if listening to something unheard by passersby.<br>
&quot;What's that you say, Atoxus? They wouldn't dare...I cannot believe you...No I would not call you a liar...yes yes, I understand.&quot;<br>
The young Prophet slowly takes on a decidedly sadistic smile and begins a soft laugh.<br>
&quot;Indeed - the fools think they can 'save' The Father's chosen from the path of his Harvest. They will soon learn the folly of their ways, and the Father permitting I look forward to showing just how flawed their logic will be. Their paltry beliefs will melt away in the bonfires of True Hatred. Indeed...&quot;<br>
Pravdameer now begins to raise his voice gathering looks and whispers from passersby as he continues to walk the caverns.<br>
&quot;I say to you the Father's time is close at hand - the time is coming when his Harvest shall sweep across the lands and prepare the path for his return to the lands of Norrath and his Chosen children shall follow into their rightful place as the true leaders of the lands...&quot;<br>
The young prophet continues to rant and rave in a fanatical frenzy as some passersby seem to move a little faster, while others stop and listen. Before too long, he has a crowd about him as he preaches of the Father's return. Yes, the young priest had returned from the Father's plane, and there was much work still to be done. He would be there, the Father permitting...he would be there with proverbial bells on.<br>
<br>
*ooc* Assuming I can get my system working properly and not crashing, and assuming I can keep my day free on Saturday, I will most assuredly be there - I look forward to what sounds like grand RP. Think I'll crosspost this to whatever thread Solus most likely has up on this. <p>Pravdameer Pravdamorte<br>

The savage towered over everyone in the street.  &quot;Where have I seen that face before?&quot;...<br>

A young Tier'Dal bursting forth from the Grange at nothing short of a dead sprint roused Rhys from here remembrances, her conflict.  After nearly bowling over a pedestrian, the young lad settled into a casual pace moving up the street.  To most, nothing would have seemed out of the ordinary.  To Rhysati's distrusting eye, something was afoot.  &quot;The Harvest doesn't send Tier'Dal rushing out of the Grange for nothing.&quot;  <br>

A few moments of observation and Rhys realized the lad was following someone....Who?....The woman, yes...the savage woman.  What was her name?...Payle?...yes.  He's following Payle.   &quot;Hmmm...I think I shall see where this leads...for awhile at least&quot;<br>

A scarce few listened to our words but were quickly overshadowed by General Zirrix. He clearly demonstrated that he remained in control of the woods surrounding Neriak. Teir'Dal would grovel before him and make excuses for their being there, most of which blamed me. As resolved as ever, I continued to preach the benefits of the light, I even recited the thirty rules of courtly love, but few would listen with the general looming over them. I fear that the Teir'Dal are quite determined to remain shrouded in darkness, at least as long as their leaders remain in power. It is a shame, for many that could be saved will certainly fall to the sword. So be it, we did try to save them peaceably in earnest first. We cannot be held responsible if Innoruuk grips them too tight. I keep thinking of that old Human proverb, &quot;Feel no guilt, ye who wields thy blade in the name of Erollisi Marr.&quot; The time for war has not yet come, but I will make sure preparations are underway.<br>
<br>
Even though it seems that the Teir'Dal are to be condemed, I will still try to save the non-Teir'Dal who have fallen under Innoruuk's curse. There is one Barbarian in particular that I will pay attention to. I believe she calls herself Payle. Last time I heard from her she was making explicit threats against me, howsoever, she still listens to what I say. She is defiant for now, but there is hope for her. In time she may yet be saved.<br>
