There was a Propet named Sarex who fortold that one day the evil that has been brewing up for the last 10 centuries was going to be unleashed on Norrath. <br>
<br>
It was a normal day for Rushemall as he stroled down the street/path/dirt road to meet a couple of guildies. Cromondas, Kenshu, Ravendust, and Ravenii were waiting for him so they could go to Old Selibs and kick some Froglok @$$. As he aproached his friends he noticed the woods grow darker and quiter around him. Rushemall quickly mems santuary and casts it. He notices nothing unusual. All of a sudden an object aproachs him from the right. SWIFT! Ravendust arrow took of his hat and pined it to the tree. Ravendust hops out of the bushes and greats his old friend. Raven SoW's them both and they head toward the group. <br>
<br>
When they get there the rest of the group greats them and they start buffing up. Kenshu jumps to attention, &quot;Someone is here.... I can Sense them&quot; A goast type figure walks out of the woods and greats the travels (Us). &quot;It is the Prophet Sarex!&quot; Stated Ravenii. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have searched from sea to sea for my Champions, You shal be them&quot; Say Prophet Sarex.<br>
<br>
&quot;Champions.... Champions of What?&quot; I ask<br>
<br>
&quot;You are who i have selected to defeat the prime evils, but you shal not be able to do it alone. Thats why i have rounded up more people just like you. I would like you to meet Jezeran.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ravenii perks up (to himself) &quot;Wow a female Pally&quot;<br>
Cromondas thinks the same.<br>
<br>
&quot;And also i would like you to meet Minute&quot; <br>
<br>
Cromondas Stops Sarex &quot;Woah Woah Woah.. you expect me to go on a quest with a Gnome?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We must all face our fears of Gnomes but they are cute if you get to know them&quot; States Sarex &quot;Now go!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Err ummm where to mister profet sir&quot; asks Rushemall<br>
<br>
&quot;O i forgot to tell you where to go /bonk self. You shal go to the Plane of Fear and defeate the prime evils that have been gathing there powers for the past 10 centuries&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Rushemall Ravenii Ravendust Cromondas Kenshu Jezeran and Minute set off for the Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
As they follow the map Serax Gave them it leads them to a cave.<br>
<br>
Jezeran's says &quot;I am cold&quot;<br>
<br>
Ravenii and Cromondas quickly give up their coat to her (hehe jk)<br>
<br>
As they enter the Cave Ravendust quickly pulls up track to see if any enemys are near by. He senses nothing on track.<br>
<br>
Minute says &quot;Ahh a cave!! Home sweet home&quot;<br>
<br>
He rushes into the cave. Cromondas say &quot;Minute NO!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
It was too late Minute had set off the trap. Specturs sround the group. <br>
<br>
Minute Quickly Mezzes them all. &quot;See i have it under control P&quot;<br>
<br>
Ravendust &quot;The Mez wont last long lets go!&quot;<br>
<br>
The group of 7 seven rush into the cave darting around corners and jumping over pits. They see the fire gate.<br>
<br>
Mintue &quot;GO GO GO MEZ BROKE GO GO!&quot;<br>
<br>
As spectures become un mezed they charge into the cave after them.<br>
<br>
Cromondas &quot;WE MUST REACH THE FIRE GATE GO GO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rushemall trips and Cromondas quickly picks him up and carries him. &quot;We dont have time for your short legs Rush&quot; says Cromondas.<br>
<br>
Jezeran is the first into the fire gate and then followes Kenshu Ravenii and Ravendust.<br>
<br>
Minute casts a final mez on the spectues so that Cromondas and Rushemall can make it in.<br>
<br>
<br>
ZONE LOADING PLEASE WAIT!<br>
<br>
<br>
As they enter the Plane of Fear they look around amaised by the conditons of the place they had to fight in.<br>
<br>
Ravenii runs back to the group. &quot;TRAIN&quot;<br>
<br>
A Mass of spiders engulfs the group.<br>
<br>
Cromondas pulls out his sword and starts hacking at the spiders as well as Kenshu Jezeran Ravenii and Ravendust.<br>
<br>
Minute is runing in a circle &quot;ONE ON THE CHANTER GET IT OFF GET IT OFF&quot;<br>
<br>
Rushemall Quickly heals Minute and Cromondas gets the mobs of de chanter.<br>
<br>
As they kill off the last spider. Kenshu quickly looks into the map. He points at the Castle with the fire stuff around it. Thats where we need to go.<br>
<br>
They aproach the castle with caution and enter the front gate. They search the castle and enter a big empty room. The door shuts behind them. <br>
<br>
Rallos Zek Spawns in the Room. &quot;Who dare inturupt my sluber!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cromondas Speaks for the group &quot;We are The Fellowship of Valor, Champions of Sarex sent here to rid you from this world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha.. We will see about that&quot; Rallos Zek eyes glow as he cast upon Cromondas.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rushemall quickly heals Cromondas to full hp.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sholdnt have done that! CHARGE!&quot;<br>
<br>
The group of 7 Charge the Prime Evil and face him head on.<br>
<br>
As Rallos reaches half life he cast a life tap on Ravendust then slashes him with his blade and Kills Ravendust.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can not be defeated that easy&quot; <br>
<br>
Rallos Backhands Minute into the wall for 3000pts of damge killing him<br>
<br>
Then he goes on a Rampage and kills Both Jezeran and Ravenii.<br>
<br>
Kenshu still doing mass damage lays a critical blow on Rallos.<br>
<br>
Rallos faces and Kenshu and cast Death Touch apon him witch brings him to his knees. Then slashes his head off.<br>
<br>
With only Rushemall and Cromondas left Rallos turns on Cromondas. <br>
<br>
As Cromondas reaches low life Rushemall casts a Complete Heal on him.<br>
<br>
Rallos Faces and turns Rushemall and Casts a DD spell witch throws him up agains a wall of spikes killing him.<br>
<br>
NOOOOOOOOO! Cromondas steps back and becomes Enraged. His Blade Starts glowing brighter and brighter.<br>
<br>
Rallos &quot;Ponders at Cromondas? What is he doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cromondas you killed Guild, you killed my friends, Now i Shall kill you.<br>
<br>
He Charges Rallos. Rallos swings at Cromondas and he doges. Again he swings and Blocked. Cromondas Takes his sword and Drives it into Rallos Zek's Heart.<br>
<br>
Rallos Steps Back. &quot;This is not possible. Defeaten by a mear mortal! AHHHHHHHHH!&quot; He blows up into a million pieces.<br>
<br>
Cromondas Runs over to his group. <br>
<br>
Picks up there bodys and one by one caries them out of Fear and into Ferrot. <br>
<br>
He sets up a fire and places each body on the flames.<br>
<br>
&quot;Each one of you has sacrifed your lives for the greater good. Shal Tunar Bless your Souls and Guide you to a Greater place&quot;<br>
