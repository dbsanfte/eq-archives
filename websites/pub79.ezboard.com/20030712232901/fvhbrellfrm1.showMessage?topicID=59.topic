Ok, this story to the best of my research is from EQ Beta. And since it directly refutes much of the published lore in post-release EQ (ie, the history in the manuals) I tend to ignore it.<br>
<br>
Of course a sub-cult could always believe it to be truth... So is the way of religion. <br>

Of further interest, the now famous &quot;red wine quest&quot; makes reference to an ancient god named &quot;Dal&quot; who was the original God of the elves (or at least the Teir'Dal)<br>
<br>
Now it doesn't take a brain surgeon to surmise that Teir'Dal, Koada'Dal (yes, some of the high elves are called Koada'Vie, I think only the nobles are referred to as Koada'Vie though), Feir'Dal are in some way related to this god. There is nothing else I've found about this though. <br>

The Feir'Dal were created by Tunare. Innoruuk stole the Feir'Dal King and Queen and tortured them in the Plane of Hate for something like 100 years before turning them into the first Teir'Dal, and placed them in Norrath to propogate.<br>
<br>
I have never seen an explination for the Koada'Dal, but my personal guess is that Tunare created them to lead the Elven Races after the King and Queen were stolen. (If someone can find official references to the truth I'd love to see them.)<br>
[ Edit: Koada'Vie indeed refers to the noble bloodline of the Koada'Dal. ]<br>
<br>
I can't find the quest text right now, but I might look it up in game on the Red Wine. Lokar is of course the Scribe of Innoruuk. When asked about the Scribes of Dal he will demand red wine and then a 70gp tithe. After that he'll reveal his sister is one. (Marenkor To`Biath, the bamaid downstairs in the Blind Fish.) For betraying her secret she wants Lokar's head. I've never done that part of the quest since I would not want to kill Innoruuk's Scribe. (Maybe he doesn't give bad faction, but for RP I simply won't do it.)<br>
<br>
I do not think anything in the text refers to Dal as a god... I think it is simply the word for Elf in the three languages (which are probably related languages, all things considered.) Besides, VI would have used Dal as a server name by now if it was a God. They keep adding gods to the Pantheon simply because they need more servers. *chuckles* Ok, not the best arguement, but it makes some sense. <br>

 Yes, good thoughts, all of them.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, you don't take negative faction to Innoruuk, but the Dark Bargainers (shopkeepers) will goto dubious from ally (so I've heard) It's a HUGE faction hit.<br>
<br>
Although all you need to do to get it back is buy more red wine and wait for him to repop. :P <br>

 While I understand the interest in the published history of Norrath - as in the existing mode of hsitory - the historian in me ponders what revisionist history would be created by a race so widely persecuted and misunderstood. And yes, this is from the Beta Test.<br>

As to revisionist history, Khas has a personal one.<br>
He accepts most of what I related, but refuses to believe that the King and Queen were once Feir'Dal. He believes Innoruuk did take and torture the Feir'Dal King and Queen, then destroyed them. He then created the Teir'Dal from His own Self, or simply His Will, not the cast-offs of some lesser godling.<br>
<br>
The semblance to Tunare's Elves was purposeful, as a slap in her face, but the Teir'Dal are perfected. (Look at our vision for proof of this: Ultravision is far superior to Infravision.) <br>

 I was thinking a little differently. I was thinking that all elves were once neither as dark as we, nor as the Feir Dal. IN revisionist thought, I would guess that we would consider all elves having been like us, and the pale elves having grown all pasty and gishy form soft living and being beholden to the Harlot of Norrath, err, the Queen of Lies, err, Tunare.<br>
<br>
I would think that what the Faeir Dal called torture, we would call forging into new strength. I still refuse to believe that Teir Dal are evil, and this alternate history lends some credence to that notion. We may once have been peaceful - perhaps even bucolic. Rebellion and blasphemy by those cursed to become pale and putrid wastlings have made us hard, and our fewer numbers have forced us to take the approaches of guerilla tactics and machiavellian attitudes.<br>
<br>
Lol, just a thought. I will ponder this more over the weeks to come ).<br>

 As you wish. As I said I can see it being completely reasonable that some would believe this. Look at how many people iRL believe completely wacked out revisionist histories. Just debating for the fun of it, I'd never tell someone that there's one RIGHT way to RP. That's just silly. <br>

 Oh, this would also be a perfect opportunity for me to promote one of my favorite web sites:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://firstborn.eqhq.com/">firstborn.eqhq.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is the Library of the Firstborn. A beautifuly well designed and thought out look at the religion of Innoruuk and the History and Life of the Teir'Dal. While I do not use every last bit of their info in character, Khasirath does lean heavily of their look at the Faith of the Father.<br>
<br>
This is not a Guild in and of itself, it's sort of an on-line Church. Sadly the creators have drifted away, and the message boards are very quiet these days, but it has tons of information. Khasirath is in fact a member of the Inner Church there. (I was luckily able to contact the creator right before he drifted away completely.)<br>
<br>
I strongly encorage anyone who wants to add a little more depth to their IC roleplay in reguards to their faith to check out this site. <br>

 A note:<br>
<br>
I did some poking around last night regarding the creation of the Teir'Dal. It does indeed look like Verant is sticking with the kidnapped king and queen story and not the betrayed loyalists. However, I did note that the stories all mentioned that the &quot;Elven King and Queen&quot; were taken. Not the Feir'Dal or the Koada'Dal.<br>
<br>
This does seem to make a bit of sense. There is evidence that the Koada'Dal and Feir'Dal at least at one time saw themselves as one people. Only eons of time have seperated them into different sub-races. And even now, they see themselves as one race, all Children of Tunare. Of course politics have gotten in the way of much of that. <br>

 hehe, I personally REALLY like the war of the broken crown, and I will have to find a way to blend the two stories. If you think about it, it is like all history. Two histories were made, both right, but also both wrong. Neither entirely right as they deny each other, but are actually blended. I will stick to the war of the broken crown, while mixing that with what is read in the manual. This cannot be considered some evil sub religion, as it is just what can be tought. It is what Velil teaches his slaves, his soldiers, it is what I tought Anari, it is what I tought my RL ex (hehe). <br>

 I never said an evil subreligion. I merely said a cult. In my mind the definition of that is a (usually) small group who believes a radically different thing that the mainstream of society.<br>
<br>
Here's the Merriam-Webster look at it:<br>
cult (noun)<br>
3 : a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also : its body of adherents<br>
5 a : great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or work (as a film or book); especially : such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad<br>
<br>
So, while Merriam-Webster does call cults unorthodox or faddish, it says nothing of such things being outright bad or 'evil.'<br>
<br>
Most of the people (NPCs obviously and PCs) in Norrath will believe the history as presented in the manuals. Therefore this would be our 'mainstream' history/religion. I have known many people who believe Karana is a female deity, despite the use of the male gender-specific pronouns in the books, therefore these people would be a cult. Another cult would be those people of any race who believe in the War of the Broken Crown.<br>
<br>
Not all cults are evil, my friend. Don't let propoganda cloud your mind iRL. My own RL religion would be called a cult by many, so I guess I do take a sort of strong arguing stance on this one. No offense taken or meant. <br>

 Slay the cultist he's EVIL I tell ya!  <br>
<br>
Besides, as I've always said, evil is a state of mind. Evil isn't going out and murdering and raping and pillaging. Evil is anybody/thing that has a view that is radically different than mine.<br>
<br>
Dark elves are considered an &quot;evil&quot; race because they have views that are radically different than our own &quot;real life&quot; values. I seriously doubt they think of themselves as evil.<br>
<br>
Take a real life example. Many view Timothy McVeigh as &quot;evil&quot; for what he did. Yet he doesn't see himself in this way. Hitler was almost inarguably evil (whether he was insane or not is debatable). I'm quite certain he didn't see himself as evil though. Nor did the SS officers that commited all those atrocities. They saw themselves as having a sacred duty, and despite all odds went about carrying out that duty.<br>
<br>
(Please, before ANYBODY even STARTS with me....I do NOT advocate what ANY of those people did in their lives. I'm proving a point. I am not some sick maniacal person who thinks that children should be tortured or races should be killed, or buildings blown up. I repeat...I am AGAINST all of those things)  <br>
