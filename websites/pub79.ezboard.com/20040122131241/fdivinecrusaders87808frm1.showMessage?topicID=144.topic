<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some of you know me and some of you do not, but I feel that it is time for me to voice my opinion. I have spent countless hours playing EQ just sitting quietly in the background listening to the conversation and I have to say, I think DC is currently in peril of collapse. We need someone to inject that life saving breath into the guild, and hopefully it will be soon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this point I offer a challenge to all officers of DC, “Make the Guild fun to be a member of Again”. As it stands now we do very few things that would involve the entire guild and encourage participation. You as officers need to come up with a monthly schedule of events that occur in random zones and at different times to accommodate all levels and play times. These events could be used to level lower level members, obtain a wanted item, give pointers and strategy, or just the fun of wiping a lower level zone. Now this would mean that a few officers would get stuck in a zone that they have not even thought about for 20+ levels, but the help and pointers that are provided should encourage participation and teamwork within the guild. Along with these events there should be at least two in game guild meetings each month and a condition of maintaining your membership in the guild would be mandatory participation in at least one of the meetings each month.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After looking through Guild Magic, and this by all means does not give an accurate picture of the true guild, I find that we have a potential to have at least double the number of 50+ characters that we currently have. This is only using the main characters that are listed on Guild Magic, when you figure in all of the alts and unlisted characters the possibilities grow substantially. The number of main’s listed as of 9/11/02 would be 33 with an average level of 41, that would be just about where I fall as far as level goes. Now I know that my personal goal is to get to at least 46 by Planes of Power, but I would also like to hit the 50+ mark were I feel I can be a greater use to the guild. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The culmination of what I am saying is “United we stand Divided we fall” and from what I have seen in game and read on the board we a falling at an ever increasing rate. We have high levels leaving, low levels leaving, mid levels leaving, hell everyone is thinking of leaving. The point being in a guild is to be able to get together with friends and have fun the perk is sometimes you get good loot. A perfect example of what I have been saying would be an adventure last weekend involving Chiptooth, Statictooth, Wildbeartooth, Tiggress, and myself. All of the group are RL friends, all of us started EQ at around the same time, and we all came to DC at around the same time. All of this being said, we had however not done anything as a group for a long time, and after a short discussion we had all agreed to go to Sol B even though some of the group would not be getting XP. After a while we moved to Sol A trying to obtain a pair of Impskin Gloves, but it never happened. Even though a couple people died and lost xp we all had a good time and I personally went to two zones I had previously not been to. This short adventure made me feel better about EQ, the people I play with, and the guild that I am in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now some if not all of you will or are saying who are you and what gives you the right to criticize the workings of the guild. First and foremost I am a member of DC so that in and of itself gives me the right to criticize and questions everything that happens with the guild. I would however also be one of the people that has lead to the guild making it to the current state it is in. I have done this by setting back and not participating in the various events that have happened in the guild. That is were you as leaders of the guild come into play, you have to make me and all others want to remain in and participate in the guild by arranging the aforementioned events and requiring participation. At first this is going to be a very painstaking task but once we have reestablished ourselves as a guild that is fun and event filled, people will come back and they will bring with them friends.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is now crunch time, Do or Die. The things that happen over the next few weeks will set the fate of DC forever. We have to remember membership in the guild should be a privilege not a right, step up or get out. “That is all I have to Say about that”, it is now up to you as leaders to make us the great guild I know we really are, please choose your next moves wisely…<br>

I for one feel this exact way, we as officers need to get the ball rolling and away from this stand still we have been in, or *wont even think it*  we will be lost. I have considered leaving myself, and I CANT DO IT!!!! I love this family I have met in Divine Crusaders and I am one of its Ladies.. I shall forever be, no matter what happens.. I want nothing but to see us rise out of this fog and get some sun shining down on all of us, and be the guild I know and love.. Lets put 100 percent into this guys, it is our home, our foundation for what we beleive in and stand for, WE all are Divine and WE all are Crusaders, WE can do this.. <br>
I love you all and would break my heart terribly if we dont or cant get through this bad weather.. <br>

First, I and most, if not all, of the officers have tried to organize events, time and time again, only to have minimal outcome, if anyone shows up at all. The reason for this is that only a small percentage of our members visits the boards, making it very difficult to get information out to the guildmembers. While the guild MOTD works well in theory, it has its limitations, as there's only so much information that can get put up, and it almost constantly gets overwritten.<br>
Second, I don't beleive that it should fall to just the officers to 'get the ball rolling'. DC is a guild with full participation, or should be, meaning that if you want to raid somewhere, or hold an event, and you're not an officer, YOU CAN. If you need a hand organizing it, then come to the officers, and we'll help out. Placing all of the responsibility for organizing events on the officers is unfair, both to the officers, and the other members of DC. <br>
If we're to climb out of the hole that we seem to be in, then it has to be a group effort. It's going to be an uphill battle, and, unless things have changed in the time that I've been gone, most of the guildmembers won't even read this post because THEY DON'T EVEN COME HERE! That's where our biggest problem lies. In order to get the information to the guild, the gulid must come to the information. It's as simple as that. Guildmembers don't read the boards, so very few people show up for guild events. This has frustrated many of the officers to the point of starting to give up. Any event i've held, has started as a post in the messageboard, and ended up either being a noshow, or only minimal outcome, because i happened to mention it when the event was supposed to start, and there were a few people on that could come.<br>
<br>
I know, i seem to be repeating myself a little bit, but something must be done to get the rest of DC to read and POST on the boards.<br>

<br>
I would like to expand on a few points I feel are of the upmost importance. I think a couple other things from the officer section need to be transfered to here also so here it goes....<br>
<br>
1: Reruting. I think some of the officers have been a little scared after the inceidents with Smahinn and have opted to almost discourage recruiting. This was not intentional but I know I started being very leary of the process and would never for any reason invite without a sponsor.....<br>
<br>
     1 way to fix this is to invite one of our lower level (no high MAIN) members to become an officer. This will give us the much needed presence at the lower level that we need. I would also like to have at least 1 day a month each officer spend hanging with some of lower levels as a buff station or guard, poorter what ever yoru class brings. This will do a lot things that as officers we have discussed for a while and this one thing could help start a &quot;mending&quot; process of the guild. I can tell you that the majority of the people you see in the 50 area of DC are from 1 person... Dougy! and were all found in our early 30's late 20's and mostly in SOUTH KARANA!!!!! We need someone willing to get to know people and to be an Ambasador on the low level scene for DC....<br>
<br>
2: Officer participation. Taklinn said part of this the best and I dont want to beat a dead horse but I do want to add something. For you lower level people that have never made it to the high end game...... <br>
You may never know the pain and sweat that goes in to every action.... <br>
To be able to lose 3 days worth of work in 5 min on a simple run through a zone. A blue at 30 is minoote compared to a blue at 52 or 53 or 54.... <br>
When you reach the level that an EPIC! weapon is attainable you will want it too.... <br>
and when you get to the point that it takes 60 min just to get to the zone you can get XP at only to find that 2 hours later you fianlly get a group you too will miss some guild say and some tells..... ( that was for the toothclan that says I ignore them :-(....<br>
and finally when you get to where you are known and people like you and your raiding style and send you a tell that they NEED you for a crazy raid you too will go and you too will get stuck deep in some hole in norrath with mobs surrounding you and then that will be the time the guild needs you and you will miss the call and feel horrible and hope that the guild understands....<br>
<br>
    My point is when I was coming up I never saw Taklinn. I knew he was a good guy from talking to him but I didnt know he was a dwarf until i was 44. I was in the guild at level 25 and for 15 levels I never actually saw taklinn. that doesnt mean that taklinn wasnt working his ass for the guild but it does mean that we never crossed paths for a while until I was able to start joining him on his adventures. It is a fact of life and every officer and high level member of DC went through it BUT&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
    As officers of DC it is our job to be available sometimes. It is our job to spend time making the GUILD stronger not just ourselves. It is our job to support our members and if that means missing a raid to do it well dont say yes when the littler box pops on the screen.... <br>
<br>
    As members of DC you have the same responsibilties of kindness towards others and wearing the DC tag well as the officers. However you also have the responsibility to support us also. Sometimes that means showing up when we call a event and sometimes that means taking on a leadership role and organizing 1 yourselves. <br>
<br>
that last section is kinda hard to understand. I do FULLY believe that this issue is the fault of the officers and leaders of DC. dont take it the wrong way i just need to know that someone actually put here what it feels like to be the highest levels in a guild, just becasue im 52 doesnt mean the adventure is over and im tierd of being a wizard... on the contrary anything else is a complete let down to me....I am Chiptooth <br>
<br>
NOTE: SEE RRAWRR FOR MY THEORY ON MAINS AND HOW YOUR MAIN IS YOUR MAIN FOR A REASON... *wink...<br>
<br>
3: Meetings. This has been thrown around by the officers for a while we started having officer meetings. We thought that was enough. We were wrong. It is time for everyone to make there voice heard to all. For everyone to step up and be a part of the future of DC or ride the wave we create ot et off it PERIOD. It is my opinion that meetings should be mandatory and that the guild Leader be it Myself Dark Bigi Rrawrr Roarry Syn or any one else that has been nominated will have a responsibility to deal with anyone that does not feel that participating in these meeting is important. <br>
<br>
    There are several options for this and I will be discussing these options with the officers. Nothing is to big of a download and anyting can be used in this age of technology. It might be in game, it might be MSN messenger. Options are there we will need to decide on one. If it is ingame I think it will need to be done in 1 zone that is easily acessible by all and ports will have to be done. this needs to be taken seriously..... <br>
<br>
4: High levels leaving DC. I do not in any way think that Saladim, Deshaed or Trackerwolff left for &quot;greener pasteures&quot;. this has been thrown around for all them by different peolple and I truely believe that regardless of where they end up there intention was not to desert us.... However all 3 were officers of this guild and that unfortunetly will not due... It is my opinion that anyone not willing to sign on the dotted line so to speak and stay with us should give up their shield as an officer now before more hurt is done. (that may be a little bit out of my place to say but it is how I feel and that doesnt mean that I will hold it against you but we need to know who is goign to be here 3 months from now and who isnt)....<br>
<br>
    There is no way to fix this. Only power strength and a precense on the high level scene will keep most from leaving. We do  not provide that and this is the reason we have a hard time keping our high level members. At some point they spend more time not doing anything productive and then they have no choice but to move on to a better place to grow (not necesarliy a better place). The high level members of DC have been attempting to change this. We are  few in numbers and as the story goes we dwindle by the day..  We are doing our best though, please forgive us if we spend a little too much time trying to keep our high level friends from falling in the uber hole and only seeing them on a different tag and being drug away by the manaburnign wizzies to stand in front of gornaire till manaburn finishes him off.....<br>
<br>
5: Official discontinuation of bid to join the TGA. This may upset the rest of the officers we spent a long time talking this over and even longer time vieing for a possition in the race while on raids for other people for the past 7 weeks or so. But I think it is now completly apparent that this is destrying DC. If we were getting in to the TGA we would be in it already and then what? With the requirment for attendance I think they have and the posssibility that we could oursleves request help from them and make our own targets what then for the rest of DC. The TGA at this time will only hurt DC. I think its time to think about the family we have and not the friends we would like to have.....<br>
<br>
6: People need to be on the message boards.<br>
<br>
What can I say the horse is beat to death on this already and i am goin to kick it one more time. I am open for suggestions on this.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all I hope everyone takes from this.........<br>
 <br>
That being a high level in DC is work most of the time. <br>
We made a decision to join TGA that I think has spurred some of the crtisizm that we are getting from with in. <br>
We as officers of DC have abandoned our posts at times. <br>
The members of DC have a responsibility to be strong in our absence. <br>
We need to rebuild from within.<br>
We need to choose a low level and possibly reinstate Taklinn as a high level ambasador for the guild.<br>
We need to comunicate on a regular basis and a standard for attendence to these meetings must be made.<br>
<br>
I hope I am still in the good graces of the Guild I call family<br>

OK, since I just read all these posts, let me open my mouth so that I may insert a large...foot (bet you all thought of something else you cheeky monkeys hehe).<br>
Im going by memory here so bear with me:<br>
<br>
1.) ok I dont play much, and when I do, usually I say hi to the guild, insult Biggie, and go on doing my own thing, but watching the guild chat all the while, making rude comments, and asking questions when I come accross stuff I dont know (which is pretty much everything - how am I supposed to jump to allakazham's or eqatlas when Im in the middle of a group?) - now the point is that from watching the guild chats, I dont get the feleing of a guild that is breaking apart, in fact apart from those who have departed, I get the feeling that this is a fine guild, and a great one to be a memeber of - other people I'm grouped with have told me the very same on occasion, so we cant be going all that wrong if other peeps think we're a great guild can we?  So maybe its just due to my limited exposure, but I dont see evidence of a guild breaking apart, just a little quiet in the guildchat somedays, then again most times I dont have anything to say either.<br>
<br>
2.) Lets see...events?  Well I dont play much these days - sometimes I'm busy, sometimes I'm not and wanna do other things, and sometimes I'm going to see great movies like Goldmember!!!!! Laughed my ass off!!<br>
having sad that, last night I wound up in Crystal Caverns with Ebern and Prydestalker, I dont think we did anything but die while we were there and then the servers booted us, but its was nice to die with fellow guild memebers - and Syn was nice enough to use her alt to res us, kudos to Pryde and Chiptooth for making sure I got there, and Ebern for porting me back when we had had enough.  Not quite an event but fun nonetheless.<br>
<br>
3.) More events, well we were gonna have one last Sunday, then I got booted, and then I noticed the time, and I got one of those 0800-1600 jobs =op, so there we are.  Someday I'll make an event - but could we make more events for mid 30s maybe?  OK if I have to plan one I will, but dont hold your breath for a date, as I told the last bank collections agent when asked why I hadnt made a payment - I'm colossally lazy<br>
<br>
4.) Meetings?  Mandatory attendance? Ok I like to play, but as Mooseie's rule of the guild states this is a game and we are here to have fun.  To me fun isnt meetings and attendance records, I can go to work and get paid for that @#%$.  Well, thats my first knee-jerk reactionary opinion anyway.  I think proving ourselves as the best damn guild this side of Bespin, will do more for attendance than making sure everyone plays x number of times per week, or however it would be tracked - that hard part to that is of course, promoting the guild and having some fun.<br>
<br>
5.) reading this page, yup guilty - I came here to vote for new guild leader, I wont say who since I will support whomever wins, thats just the faith I have in the DC, the last time I was here, I cant remember, it was a while ago.  So I am pledging to try and making it to this site a least once a week -and I now challenge the rest of you to do the same.<br>
<br>
6.)(boy doesnt she ever shut up?) ok well at least Im not insulting Biggie...yet =o)<br>
I think this was the summary part: DC GOOD!!, other guilds BAD!!they're BAD!!<br>
well in all seriousness, I personally dont see a crisis, I see a guild that is the envy of other players, I have been told about what a great guild it is by other players.  I see lots of people willing to help other members ( I try to do what I can, but I know I've a long way to go for sainthood hehe).  Most of all I see people having FUN, and I try to join in, even if it is just tastless humour in guildchat - lets not lose sight of the real goal of this monstrousity that Verant created, and that Sony is now raking in vast sums of cash through monthly subscriptions, is to have fun, meet and play with other people on the 'net, and have fun (yes I know I said it twice)<br>
<br>
P.S. Thanks and big sloppy kisses to Dougy for bringing me in to the best guild ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

With the exception of the high levels having a tendency of leaving I believe as you do. However there is some desent somewhere in the ranks and I believe we have to do everything to elliminate that before we continue to try to climb to a higher level of game as a guild. I would love to bring you with us and I think that is the part we have been forgetting. Most of us toiled alone the majority of the time we were in our 30's and 40's alona and frankly that is how I made so many friends along the way. However DC was always where I wanted to hang my hat and I did have visits from our high levels along the way. I think if we can just start taking care of things at home a little bit then we can keep the great image that we have with other guilds and other players. If we can do a better job of being there for our lower level friends such as yourself then we will only be stronger on the high end game and will make our mark as we always have as being the best guild in Norrath...<br>
<br>
The mandatory meetings I think coould be done in a way that will accomodte everyone. As you said you dont have a lot of time to play and as a casual player you seem content with your place in DC. However even you need a voice and the message board combined with even semiregular attendence of a guild meeting/FREE FOR ALL in the arena would help you voice your feelings even if its jsut to say &quot;sorry i missed that raid I was thinking we could try (insert zone name here) next weekend when I have some more time to play&quot;. We may never go to that zone of our own accord and a meeting will give us the chance to mark it down on a &quot;to do&quot; list and maybe next time your on and a pick up raid starts we can make your dreams come true!<br>
<br>
With the nominations and votiong on a new guild leader taking place over the next week or so lets keep in mind that we claim to be a family and sometimes its easy to have people lost in the shuffle. I think its important to remember that noone in the Divine Crusaders is too low to join for an afternoon and take out and show them what they have to look forward to and help them get there a little quicker. We only have 3 druids high enough for powerleveling but a nice set of buffs or even just a port to a new place to hunt will keep people proud of the tag they wear. I for one know that I have failed as a member and as an officer in this area and would love to make this a regular thing in my weekly activities. As a wizard I may only be able to offer a little protection and some moral support but I can always bring an alt over to play join in if nothing else. (Ask around I am not afraid of going down in a hail of sword procs and spell casting lol)<br>
<br>
We will be fine and I for one am excited to be a part of DC as I always have been. Only thing that would make me happier is bringing the 3 crusaders we have lost recently back home.....<br>

The fact is that some those who left were officers and any time officers leave a guild it is a cause for reflection. Any officer who leaves with any officer tagged alt shouldn't be given that officer status again when they return. Being an officer does and should carry a responsibility to the guild as a whole. I have two officer tagged characters in DC (Rrawrr and Komonx) and they will be in DC forever.<br>
<br>
DC isn't falling apart. Maybe from the perspective of a few who were closest to those who left it seems that way but we remain very strong. Losing those without that love and desire to build DC as a guild in the long run only strengthens us. GAINING more who will love an desire to build DC as a guild will strengthen us even more.<br>
<br>
Officers with alts in other guilds. The only reason an officer should have ANY character in another guild is if they have a husband or wife in that guild. I can't think of any other reason that someone would want to be in another guild besides that reason. If DC is truly your focus as an officer AND you truly love DC then all your characters should be here except the ones that you leave in another guild to play with your spouse.<br>
<br>
Meetings. Meetings should be mandatory for officers, and highly suggested to members. Meetings should be held once a week in a quiet tame place. I vote Tox or Echo Caverns (yes there is a tame place there behind the secret rock). Both are easy to get to and relatively safe.<br>
<br>
Membership drive. Yes we should have one of these but we want quality not quantity. The sponsor method works and without a sponsor people shouldn't be tagged. Sponsors should notify an officer whenever someone they sponsored leaves. No guild is immune completely from transience and if a sponsored member leaves or is detagged later these things happen and are part of a normal evolution of a guild.<br>
<br>
TGA. The TGA is a GOOD idea and their acceptance process takes months. This is because like DC with members, they also look for quality over quantity. TGA's added firepower and commaraderie would benefit DC every bit as much as DC would benefit it. Biggbizz has been raiding with them for some time and I would like him to be the head ambassador to it. TGA is a friendly lot who fights well together. DC needs this.<br>
Biggbizz and myself and several others are willing to do the mandated meetings etc in order to interface with our guild.<br>
TGA does NOT interfere with the inner workings of the respective guilds that make up their membership and in fact this is part of the theory behind their charter. It exists so that their member guilds can have the best of both worlds, the closeness of the family of a small guild, with the firepower of an uber guild. We are probablly still weeks from acceptance anyway and I am sure DC is being examined as a member.<br>
<br>
Participation. I hear from some in DC from time to time what will DC do as far as equipmend and helping people PL? DC is NOT a guild that is here for that and if you get equipment or get PL'd it is because someone has personally found you worthy of that. If DC lowers their tagging standards and starts becoming a guild where the members are there not because they love DC but because of what they can milk out of it without putting anything back in then THAT is when we will die as a guild. If I ever see a DC member begging or being dishonorable I will detag them myself. I am PROUD of our guild and all those I have sponsored as members. If you plant an oak an oak grows and spawns more oaks. if you plant a weed a weed grows and spawns more weeds. DC's policy is and should be to kill the weeds fast (as I did with Smashin) before they get out of control and pollute the forrest. At the same time we should nurture our oaks.<br>
<br>
EZ board. Guildmagic and EZ board should at some point be mandated. Guildmagic will then become our official roster. Those unwilling to register on Guildmagic should be given a warning to do it, then 2 more warnings in a set amount of time then detagged if they still won't do it. At least one post should be made by all members on our ez board to prove that they have the web address and an account to voice issues and opinions and schedule raids, or request assasinations of an NPC. This guild can't be built on quicksand.<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to DC building as a guild past this chaotic stage that just came out of the blue with the exidus of Deshaed, Tracker, Misy, Pett and others. Nothing proves loyalty better than time.<br>

I hope I do not piss anyone off (seems to be in my nature) but I am not holding back this time.........<br>
<br>
1) TGA, I will continue to embassodor this. As Rrawrr said, It gives smaller family like guilds the fire power of a uberguild. I moniter there channel all the time I am on, I will keep people informed of stuff as it arrises. They have no manitory raids, playing with them ect ect. Just a bunch of guilds that will help each other out if they need it. I will do all the work on this, no one else needs to worry about it.<br>
<br>
2) Raids, Officers while are encouraged to do this, are not made to do this. If you are not a officer and you would like to go raid say L Guk, ask in guild chat..you will be surprised how many people will join ya. I personally offer myself to guild each time I log in, wether it to raid, port people around, exp grind, quest, whatever. This will help us starting to get together more, and for everyone to get to know each other a lil better Get a bunch of lvl 20 and EXP grind in oasis together, what better way to meet fellow DC then to spend time with them. What if no officers are on ATM (rare yes but it happens), DC shuts down? While officers assume more responsibility on holding these, organizing ect, you as a guild member are required to carry your weight as well. If I here 1 more person whine that DC dosent get togehter anymore, and repeatly does not join us on events, talk in guild chat, stays on Annomus and reads from shadows, ect ect ect. They will be considered dead weight and droped. Now this dosent mean you have to raid with us all the time, if ever. Or you have to plan raids yourself. Just dont bitch we dont do anything and then dont contribute in any way. I personally have alot of raids planed for future, and would love people to do the same.<br>
<br>
3) Guild bank, and message boards. Will be HIGHLY encouraged to use, but hey, it is just a game, we cant force people to post here (much as Id like to). However saying that. NO ONE will be able to get anything out of guild bank unless they do post here, i dont care if you come here 1 a week, just try to come here sometimes. And offical posted raids (meaning no spur of moment, in game planed raids, which you also be seeing more of, LOL, trust me). People who posted intentions here will get pref treatment.<br>
<br>
Now for other topics discussed here..... I am WAY to hot headed to place posts here. I will surelly piss people off, and will keep it to my self. I am PISSED at certian former DC members for leaving. Not all of them, but some for sure.<br>
<br>
What DC needs is a heading to move towards so here it is. Short, sweet and simple.<br>
<br>
-We need a strong leader to head up DC, Had it, but will see if we do when the votes are in, but all that are nominated will surely be so ill say we do, but only time will tell in the end.  <br>
<br>
-Strong officer core to help him or her run it..got it.<br>
<br>
-Direction, 1) to join TGA...in works. 2) Get a strong group of people who love DC, and will stay in it thick or thin. No matter what lvl they are. Well, seems all the people using DC as a stepping stone are gone now, so we have that. Lets get this core of people we have together, get the link strong bond betwen us all, and add to it via invites and such.<br>
<br>
-Purpose. Hey its simple, we all play EQ cause its a fun game to play. So lets make it that way. You all will see that soon.<br>
<br>
I am a man of action, not words, I suck at wording stuff like this (as you can plainly see) I cant always get what I mean on paper. I will be doing alot in actions starting tonight. I hope you all join me in getting DC back to where it was, and where it should be.<br>
<br>
REMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It takes a good ass kicking to learn how to fight. We got the ass kicking, complimates of a certian few people. Not lets stand back up, lick our wounds, and get back to fighting through EQ.<br>

I felt the need to say a few things. Some may feel I have no right to do so presently, but unless I'm told no to, I'll post from time to time.<br>
First of all, Since I made the post about my desision to leave DC, I've only been on EQ a few times, and that was just to leave Tracker set up as a trader.  My schedule is tighter then it was a month ago.  Fortunatly, I'm getting more hours at work. I almost had to get a second job.<br>
Second, I regret accepting the position of officer then leaving. It was not planed.  If I didn't hide things from myself, I might have seen it coming.  Things build up till it hit me suddenly.  I apologize for letting the guild down in that respect.  <br>
Now, do not read further if you don't want to get upset.  This is not an apology for what I'm about to say, it's just a warning.  It is how I saw things before I left.  I usually try  not to say things that will make people upset, but I believe it was the Oakridge Boys who sung something like &quot;Sometimes it never hurts to hurt sometimes&quot;.<br>
Which brings me to another song I like by Chad Brock called &quot;Lightningdoes the work&quot;.  The first sentence describes the whole messege of the song. &quot;You know nothings getting done, when talking's all you hear&quot;.  I can see many of you know saying oh my god, I can't believe he said that.  But it's the truth.  I've seen to many post saying DC needs to have a raid or the DC needs to have some events. It's good to say what is needed but better to plan it.  There are whiners in the guild complaining about DC never haveing events, but what are they doing about it.  Complaining or making suggestions. Never planing.  And saying &quot;Let's raid Kael tommorrow&quot; isn't planning.  Puting soming on MOTD a few days ahead of time isn't planning. Most people need at leas a week or more to set their schedule. I've seen only 2 events that were planned over a week ahead of time to give people time to make plans. One was the raid on Sep 4 the other could be found here  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm2.showMessage?topicID=24.topic">pub79.ezboard.com/fdivine...D=24.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  <br>
All the other post for events were not planed events that people could make planes for. <br>
That link shows another problem.  With all the complaints about nothing ever happening, I thought people would jump at the chance to do something other then the exp grind or camping.  Maybe I should have spamed the guild constantly to come look at the boards for info on the gnomeathon instead of just anouncing it about every other day. At least 2 of those times there where over 14 guild members on, and the web address to the board was given out.  If you look at that thread, only 2 people showed any interest.  There was just as much (or little) interest from those online.  I guess it's not enough to just plan something. You have to drag people there as well.  It's a shame to,  I wasted the 5kpp I had saved for the prize on trade skills, and threw away my 10 pages of notes on other events I was hoping to get started.<br>
That brings me to the next subject.  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm2.showMessage?topicID=25.topic">pub79.ezboard.com/fdivine...D=25.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Take a look at that thread. Can you see a problem.  Not one responce.  This was another item I mentioned in guild chat. It's nice to have the information that guildmagic provides (for those that registered), but how can one plan when one doesn't have a good idea about times people can play.  I know and understand some have no set times, but not even one responce?<br>
I also offered the use of my yahoo account calander for events. I just needed those officer who wanted to use it to get a free yahoo account and e-mail me thier user name so I could set them up to use it.  Again, not one responce.<br>
Don't you think this is enough to discorage a person?<br>
Then I hear of the attempt to join TGA.  This is a great idea for the future of DC ...... but that should be a goal in the future of DC.  DC is not ready.  My opinion is that some, who are pushing for membership in TGA, are impatient to get certain things.  How would TGA see DC? The first question they would ask themselves is &quot;What could DC provide, that TGA can't get from another guild, when DC can't even get their own people organized&quot;?  <br>
DC must decide something.  Does it want to be a family type guild, in which guildies are there for each other when support is needed, or does it want to be a raiding guild.  I family type guild is more for individuals that want to be a part of something larger, but still go thier own way.  A raiding guild is for those that want phat loot and lvl 60 quickly (lvl 65 in PoP).  DC can even be a combanation of the two, but there has to be guidelines set if that is what is wanted.<br>
There is more that I could and probably should say, but it's late, I just got of work and I have to work tommorow.  <br>
Just 2 more things.  As thing stood when I left the guild, I would have voted for either Chiptooth or Synamonn. My reasons will stay with me. <br>
There might be some that read this and get really mad at me, call me names and think I'm a hypocrite among other things.  On my behalf I will say this.  Let my actions, personality and behavior during the time you've known me, be the bases by which I am judged by you, not heated thoughts because I dared to speak what I see and how I feel.<br>

They all should be heard from DC members and former DC members and they all should be takin in consideration to make us a stronger Guild than we already are.  <br>

However there isnt a whole lot to be done. Your gnomeathon was a bust which was sad. Roary had a raid planned yesterday that I had to miss and it was on the board and in tells and guild say. I logged on just to appologise to him for not being able to come then I took my family out. <br>
<br>
I hear what you are saying. I guess it will do no good getting upset again but I hear you and will try to get it turned around. You would poop your britches if you saw us this week. Bigi and I have both had a mid level nights to which each of us have joined the others. I was apart of 2 awesome DC raids/groups in sol b and then in sol a also. We also went to l guk. I think you had some good ideas and I think when you come back you will be happy. The TGA thing will not go away, but we can do a better job makign DC first instead of a backseet to the TGA membership. Anyway Tracker hope to see you in game soon and hope you come back home to DC regardless of your RL schedule...<br>

Here is a link to my wedding invites and NOBODY posted to that although many did come :-)<br>

I brought up the idea of guild alliances and first informed the DC membership about the existance of the TGA in officer guild chat. Around the same time I posted a thread regarding open discussion of guild direction and titled as such.<br>

all who posted to that were Raccona, Chip, Iwan, Syn and Gaea as you can see. <br>
The problem is people are either not going to the boards or are sitting back to see what way the guild goes and are pulling their characters out or putting them back in based on perception without interaction. As an officer you had that opportunity to help us build and define this guild direction but for whatever reasons you chose to leave as have others. The problem of an undefined direction has been going on in DC at LEAST since last April as I alluded to in my post in this thread reply to Syn -<br>

I for one will be saddened to see many that I have grown up with in DC leave and go one with what they feel they should do.. *snifs* I personally have talked to a few about my standing in DC as well, and just opening that closed door I did feel better, but yet things just seemed to be closing in, so to speak. I love my guild and when ppl ask why I chose this one, I tell them all that you all made me feel comfortable and we all talked to one another all the time.. thats one reason someone close to me left his guild to join ours.. Because noone did anything together and no one talked.. Now since he is here in DC, I am saddened to say that we are beginning to be just as his old guild was.. Distant... =( *sighs* <br>
I for one have a guildie or 2, to nominate for the higher ranks, but I feel we should all be apart of whats going on and each have our own say in matters pertaining to DC.. I know I have closed up and dont talk as much to you all as I was or have been, reasoning behind this was maaking distance to leave i guess... Not real sure... I dont want to close this door for I would MISS you all extremely.. So slowly but surely I am hanging... *cries* <br>
* please say whats on your mind Synn * sheash :P..<br>
Well thanks alot I feel better now too =)...<br>
<br>
Love you all.. ((((hugs to you all)))) I will miss those that are leaving and those thaat have already left.. *snifs* <br>
Synn... <br>

My post -<br>
Aww *hugs Syn* hang in there. The guild is only being restructured so maybe some are a little out of it lately. I haven't seen you or Kira on much lately but Pawz is STILL parked at the Ferrott/Rathe zone where he camped last time hunting with you two. Once our leaders redefine the structure and either re-ratify, revise, or create a new charter then we can have something solid to build a strong guild. Till then list your characters on www.guildmagic.com so that we can get some idea of the demographics of what our guild is made of. Knowing that we can plan raids that most could come to. Sorry if I've been quiet lately but I've been working hard all week on tailoring (mostly hq cat pelt farming) and in a week have only gone from 88 to 92 :-( . That and the Coldain Prayer shawl quest that has been clogging my bank with quest items that with the help of Trackerwolf,Deshaed,Gaea,Biz,Iwan and others I finally got the fourth shawl. I love hunting with everyone in DC and have 6 characters of all ranges in it. There is no reason for us to be distant as a guild but there isn't a lot we can build on till they get the officer structure resolved so we all know the intended direction to make decisions. I've been trying to get an officer to tag Kwurlon (yes its Cwerlons alt) a lev 6 Shammy Iksar in Cabilas area for about 4 days now.<br>
<br>
DC will go in a direction when the membership clearly states on the record what they believe that direction should be. And precious few have found it worth their while to state that on the threads. I wish you had opened this for debate and helped us build this into a solid direction as we are a solid guild. I would sponsor you coming back to DC as I believe you a person of honor who's heart is in the right place but in my opinion if an officer detags the officer powered character then that character should no longer be an officer upon retagging. Officership carries with it a responsibility that not everyone is up to committing themself to. Thats not bad or good it just is a fact.<br>
<br>
I would really like to see DC build into a strong guild with the best of both worlds of a family type guild and yet able to take down the bigger targets in the game. Any long journey starts with a single step. I will post my ideas of what these steps will be shortly after we elect whoever out fearless leader will be to succeed Sprucie. Till then we remain in flux and the loyal will stay and the indecicive will go. Eventually time will weed out who is who. We have within our ranks the seeds of something really great. Those who were without the patience to build it are missed. <br>

Checking at least once a day to post the new events in general and raid channels to it i believe that having an easy to follow calandar would help attendance and keep people checking the website as well. I have planned many events and posted some to the boards but often found a lack of respondse like trackerwolfs and sometimes when i came to check the boards i would look at posts that i had missed because i hadnt been to the boards in time to see them prior to the event date. <br>
    I have often planned spur of the moment raids due to not being asked or not finding  a group and often these raids would change location because of something or other and there have been times i have been told off rather soundly for CR and things i had no control over and often when this happens i end up crying in RL due to the fact that i tend to be oversensitive. I love the guild enough that i keep coming back even when I log during the night swearing im going to quit EQ I wait and i think through or i talk to people I trust and pull through and i stay. Some of these are when i have been grouped and unable to come rez someone far from where i am, I try to always make it there and have been known to leave groups due to this. It has cost me sometimes and im usually happy to do it. Sometimes tho i need time to wind down and just play just as the other officers do I always try to include anyone that shows an interest tho it doesnt always work.<br>
     This guild is and always will be my home, I have been in it longer than almost everyone else here, I will be as availible as i can be. As always if i log on and something is planned feel free to ask me to join in, I will be happy to help.<br>
<br>
This turned into a bit of a rant and it wasnt meant to. I had typed quite a bit of other stuff but the post didnt go thru so had to repost and i forgot alot of stuff between times.<br>
<br>
Does it hurt?<br>
Yes lady can you help?<br>
I will <br>
How can i repay you?<br>
Pass it on the to next person that needs.<br>
And dont forget me friend.<br>
