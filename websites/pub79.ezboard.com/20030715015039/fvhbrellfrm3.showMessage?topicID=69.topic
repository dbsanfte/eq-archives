Fun with Goblins *RP*<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The pack of goblins howled with glee and delight as they chased the solitary Teir'Dal out of the gates of their fortress and into the woods. Running hard, the spittle flying from the corners of his mouth, the largest goblin was gaining on the dark elf faster than the others.<br>
<br>
&quot;Foolish thing, imagine casting a spell on me in the middle of my own camp!&quot;, thought Grachnist, lord of the goblins of Warsliks Woods. &quot;No one escapes the wrath of Grachnist the Destroyer!&quot;, he shouted to the small figure fleeing before him. <br>
<br>
Then suddenly Grachnist was upon the Teir'Dal. Claws raking outwards, he threw all his weight forward and slashed the dark elf savagely across the back. Stunned, the intruder stopped in his tracks, then fell over, dead from a single blow from the mighty Grachnist.<br>
<br>
Immensely pleased with himself for having killed the intruder without the assistance of his horde, Grachnist turned on them as they finally caught up to him and the still form of the Teir'Dal. He cut loose on his unsuspecting troops.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fools! You're all slower than fat giants! My grandmother could outrun you all you sorry lot of dungheads!&quot;<br>
With a sweeping gesture Grachnist indicated the now defeated enemy at his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look what I have done! With no help form you I might add!&quot; He raised his fists, showing off the pair of gloves he wore proudly. These gloves he had made from the hide of an Iksar he had killed, there was nothing like them in the whole of Warsliks Woods, and he, Grachnist the Destroyer, owned them.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is why I, Grachnist the Destroyer, am leader, and you are all pathetic nothings! Run! Run back to your huts now fools and show me how fast you can move when Grachnist the Destroyer is nipping at your heels dogs!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Grachnist let out a savage sound that was part-warcry and part-primal howl, snarling at his troops. They fled in panic back towards the fortress.<br>
<br>
Grachnist turned back to the body, admiring his own skill and prowess while muttering to himself about the incompetence of his soldiers. Giving the body one last savage kick, he turned and started back down the road to his home.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's no way to treat a fallen foe&quot;, a voice behind Grachnist said softly. Grachnist felt the hairs on the back of his scaly green neck rise. The voice was like the whisper of leaves blowing against the bones of his ancestors in the burial pits outside the fortress. It was cold and menacing, and totally without fear. &quot;Time for you to learn some honor mighty Grachnist the Destroyer&quot;, the voice intoned, dripping with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
Grachnist turned to see the dark elf risen from death, pale green eyes alight with an inner fire, no sign of death or injury upon it's body. The Teir'Dal had a wicked looking axe held in both hands, and raised it in mock salute. Grachnist suddenly wished very much that he had not sent his troops back to the fortress in such a hurry.<br>
<br>
The dark elf said something in a language Grachnist did not understand, and suddenly the goblin felt his own blood begin to heat in his veins. Howling in pain, Grachnist flung himself at the vile dark elf and screamed out, &quot;I will kill you dead for sure this time filthy thing! You die again now!&quot;<br>
<br>
The wicked axe raised and lowered, seemingly alive in it's master's hands. Wounds appeared on the goblin's body as if by magic, all the while his blood boiled and his sight grew dimmer. In only moments, Grachnist realized he was beaten, and he turned to run back to his fortress. His legs were so heavy! He was having trouble making out the shape of the fortress now, it was so dark. Then suddenly he was on the ground, feeling the cold from the hard earth seep into his body, into his very bones. So cold, so cold. As he struggled against the blackness enveloping him he felt the dark elf tugging at the gloves he was so proud of. He wanted to speak, to beg the foul creature not to take his gloves, but darkness closed in, and he could not move his lips to make the words.  As his spirit left his body, Grachnist heard the Teir'Dal speak one final time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk demands your soul Grachnist&quot;, the dark elf whispered, &quot;but I think I'll take these gloves for myself. When you see The Father, tell him his faithful servant Raveneye bids him hello…..&quot; <br>
<br>

Nospiratus read the scroll again, laughing with dark delight at the recorded events. Grachnist had learned the lesson of Hate all too well it seemed - Hate is the wellspring of power, and where Hate stands firm, death imposes no barrier. The knight had shown his mastery of the gifts of the Prince of Hate. He would bear watching...<br>
