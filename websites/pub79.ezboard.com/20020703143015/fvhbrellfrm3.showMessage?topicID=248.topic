<br>
*********************************************<br>
Tzlar followed the rest of his guild members into the sewers of Quynos. It was demeaning, that a War Wizard of the Empire and Chancellor of the Imperial Council should have to skulk about in the drainage system like a common thief. But, this city was the home of the long dead Human Paladin Antonius Bayle, and there were many traps and spells to detect those of the Darkness with it’s walls. So the group of Teir’dal traveled through the maze of damp, underground corridors, until they eventually found the route to the surface. Tzlar would not even have come on this trip, except that he had a hidden matter of the Tower of the Spurned to attend to. Once on the surface, the Harvest did scout the city, to learn what it needed to know for future endeavors. After some time, and the extermination of several wandering sentries, the Harvest found itself by the docks. As they discussed their further plans, Tzlar judged his place in the city, and his vicinity to where he needed to be. He needed to draw the attention of one particular member of the Wizard’s guild. While he engaged her, the other agents of the Tower would be able to obtain their objective. But first Tzlar needed to draw off the guardian of the object. Then, as if Solusek Ro himself had intervened on his behalf, the Wizardress appeared at the docks.<br>
<br>
Her eyes narrowing in anger she said, “We knew one of you would come to steal the Artifact, knew it was a matter of time. Now Dark One you shall pay for your evil folly”. Tzlar merely snorted in disgust and stood straight in arrogant defiance. Tzlar knew she was more powerful then him, knew he faced her on her home ground. As the other members of the Harvest rallied to the attack, Tzlar knew it was hopeless, knew they would all be defeated. He felt no guilt or sorrow for the sacrifice of his fellow guild members though. This was a matter of the Arcane, and for the Art all were expendable, even those who were his closest allies. Besides, it was their honor to die in the service of the Empire, whether they wanted to or not. He need not win this battle, only survive for a long enough time. Drawing a small enchanted glass rod from one of the many pockets of his robe, Tzlar spoke the magical trigger and snapped the rod in half. Thus, had the signal been given to those hidden nearby. As the battle raged, the members of the Violent Harvest fell to the tremendous magics of the female Wizard. True to their honor, they did not flinch or run, but stood and fought till their tragic end. At last, only Tzlar and the Wizardress stood facing each other. They both cast their spells and, as Tzlar was struck down, the last thing he heard was a magical voice in his head saying one word…”Success”. Thus, while the guardian was off slaying her enemy, did her enemy achieve victory over her and all the other sub-races of Norrath.   <br>

Well slight hitch. Vresk had been unable to assist them. They where however, lucky enough to enlist Daiunus' aid in his steed. As one they moved quietly through the sewers. <br>
And where nearly lost, until Nospiratus had recalled an out. Up near the bank they had surfaced. Cloaked in shadows they had moved and scouted the surrounding areas for the best possible place to hold their small ambush. <br>
This was not a full scale, annihilate the enemy, raid. This was mearly a testing. The Qeynites proved to be well fortified and battle ready. They did not find it an easy task to slay the few guards they came across as they made their way to the docks. But in time those guards did fall. So it was proved Qeynos was not invincible. <br>
None there where aware of the ulterior motives of the wizard. So where at shock when the human Wizardress came down upon them with all the wrath of her god. They stood back to back fighting off her and her minions. <br>
&quot;Get to safety!&quot; Kat snarled at Nospiratus, knowing if he fell they would have no chance of living past this day. Of returning to their homes. As the group worked as one to distract the Wizardress Nospiratus slipped into shadows.<br>
And then there was darkness. Some called this abyss Death. But Kat mearly thought of it as a resting. <br>
She groaned softly as Nospiratus chanted the prayers of resurrection over her. Pulling her back from the abyss. As soon as she was able she cast the spell that would cloak him in shadows. And slowly they worked to revive the rest of their fallen party. <br>
She had managed to charm a young bard into garnering the avenging Wizardress' attention away from their fallen bodies. Soon she and the rest made their way away from the docks and closer to the small hall that lead to the northern part of the city. Here they again set up their ambush.<br>
After pulling several guards into their web. They had overstepped once more in the exuberance and had gotten the attention of one too many. This was when the Wizard amongst them had taken the initiative to wisk them from there. All and all a rather successful first foray. <br>
Much information was gathered while they worked their way into the city. They would return, soon, and stronger. They would defeat Qeynos, and all it stood for.<br>
Soon, very soon.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=248.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=248.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=248.topic&index=2><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=248.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=248.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=248.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=248.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
