As her life's blood drained from her she could feel herself falling but had not the strength to catch herself.  Lying where she crumpled to the ground those unearthly silver eyes were the last thing she saw as her world went black... <br>
<br>
Kassy awoke in a cold sweat, the sheets clinging to her body.  <br>
<br>
&quot;A dream,&quot; she murmmered to herself, &quot;Only a nightmare. He wouldnt...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dispite her words tears crept silently down her ebon cheeks.  How long had it been since she'd slept through a night untroubled by such dreams?  There had been few nights since the Change that she had not had nightmares, but they had been growing worse in the past days.  No longer did she only relive the day that had changed her life forever.  <br>
<br>
She shuddered, goosebumps raising on her dark flesh as the memory of His voice echoed through her mind, &quot;If I ask him for your blood do you really think he will refuse me, little elf?&quot;  Kassy shook her head, denying the words and the visions that had followed them.  She dismissed the nightmare and lay down, closing her eyes.<br>
<br>
The grey mists stretched out before her, trailing off into eternity.  She ran, though there was no where to go. She sought shelter that did not exist.  Just when she was sure that He would catch her, she felt a firm hand on her shoulder.  Spinning around, she found herself looking into strange silvery eyes. She gasped in relief and threw herself into his protective arms.<br>
<br>
With her eyes closed against his neck she didnt see him draw his knife...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy,&quot; his voice was soft as he lay beside her, &quot;wake up. You're having a nightmare.&quot;<br>
<br>
She rolled over and opened her eyes, looking up into his strange silvery orbs.  For a moment she caught her breath as the line between reality and blurred before she fully awoke.  Then she was safe again, the dream banished by his warm arms around her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Khas...&quot; she murmmered as she nestled closer into his protective arms, &quot;why does He still torment me with such dreams? I serve and yet still I am punished.  Is He never satisfied?''<br>
<br>
&quot;I dont know, love. The Father's reasons are His own to keep and He need not explain Himself to his servents.  Now go back to sleep, I will watch over you.&quot;<br>
<br>
His fingers caressed her cheek softly as he brushed a few stray hairs behind her ear and she closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When she awoke again, he was gone.  The part of her that had been raised in the sunlit forest of the Faydark knew it to be late morning, though it remained dark in Neriak throughout the day and night.  Rising she moved to a small table in the far corner of the room that had but two objects upon it's cloth-covered surface.<br>
<br>
Kassy knelt before the alter and lit the incense within the small round brazier.  Dark tendrils of smoke rose and twisted in the air above the table and, looking past it, her eyes focused on the object lying on the night-blue cloth.  Once it had been an object of beauty, a medalian of the purest mithral and blessed by the priests of Tunare. Now it lay upon the alter blackened and twisted by Hate.  The enchantress looked at the charm with an expression of mixed loss and indifference as her mind drifted back over the months since she had given herself to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It had started long ago, the day she happened accross Khasirath S'Therik in the mountains of Highpass Hold.  Tempers had flared and icy words had been exchanged, yet in the end they had ended up hunting the foul gnolls side by side.  When they had parted ways she found that she had developed a grudging respect for this Tier'Dal who, unlike most, seemed to rule his hate and use it to give him strength rather than letting it rule him.  Burning within him was a deep set sense of honor, which she didnt understand coming from one such as him.  Kassy was intrigued.<br>
<br>
Again and again they had run into eachother, usually at odds, occationally on the same side.  Always she tried to show him the Light of Tunare's way, and always he listened to her words patiently only to turn around and offer her words of Innoruuk.  Day by day she found herself wondering when she would see this drow again. She scolded herself for these thoughts. He was a powerful member of the Violent Harvest and a servent of the Prince of Hate, she a daughter of the Mother of All.  Yet there was something about him...<br>
<br>
As time passed she found her thoughts turning more and more often to him.  On Valintine's Day she had given him a rose, shyly offering the flower and wondering what use a knight would have for such a token. She expected him to laugh.  To her suprise, though, he accepted the gift with a smile.  They were inturupted before they had a chance to talk and Kassy had gone on her way blushing profusly.<br>
<br>
The next day walking through Nektulos on her way toward the Lavastorm Mountains she had come across him in a small clearing within a grove of strangly out of place white birch trees.  They had talked at length<br>
becoming all the while closer.  What was it about this drow that attracted her so?  Kassy found she didnt care, she only wanted to know his touch.  Before she lost what little courage she had gathered, she had pulled him to her and, to her suprise, he had come willingly.<br>
<br>
That was how it had started.  They met many times afterward, always in secret.  Though Khasirath had assured her many times that if their secret were discovered he could handle any trouble that arose, still she feared.  She haddnt told him that she loved him. Not for many days after she had accepted it herself.  When she had he had only looked at her, his face a mixture of suprise and gentleness, even sorrow.  But he hadnt laughed.  Perhaps someday, she had thought, he will love me in return.<br>
<br>
Not long after Kassy found herself walking through the Commonlands, a smile on her lips.  She was heading for a cabin where she often met Khasirath.  She walked invisibly past the human guards and the wild creatures of the land, not wanting any fights this afternoon.  The enchantress wore a new robe of pure white trimmed with delicate grey lace and she wanted it still to look its best when he saw her.  She smiled to herself, hoping that he would like it.<br>
<br>
When she neared the cabin Kassy's smile faded.  The grass here was trampled flat as though a fight had taken place here not long ago.  There were voices speaking elvish on the other side of the small bruilding, moving toward her.  Three half-elven fighters and an elven druid passed the invisible enchanter.  Their weapons were wet with blood.  Kass rounded the building, terrified to the point of shaking.  Nothing could have prepared her for what she found.<br>
<br>
Khasirath lay upon the ground in a growing pool of blood.  His armor, like much of the grass and dirt, had been scorched by fire and had given way before the blades of the half-elven warriors.  Roots and tangled vines still clung to his boots and legs, holding him to the ground.  His weapons were nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
Kassy ran to him, dismissing her spell of invisibility as she fell to her knees beside the fallen shadow knight.   He was still alive.  Barely.  They had left him to die in pain and torment.  Kassy gathered him up in her arms, dark blood staining her clean white dress crimson.  He was dying and there was nothing she could do to save him.  Her mind cried out to Tunare to give her the power to heal him, pleading for the magic she had once used with barely a thought.  There was no reply, no gift of healing, nothing.<br>
<br>
As she rocked him back and fourth in her arms, the sun glinted off a medialian that hung on a blackened iron chain around his neck.  The symbol of Innoruuk.  Without hesitation she began to pray.  Not to Tunare, but to the Prince of Hate.  Her words were simple and she spoke them only once.<br>
<br>
&quot;My soul for his life.  Save him and I will serve you always.&quot;<br>
<br>
Immediatly both she and Khasirath were bathed in harsh red light.  In seconds the bleeding had stopped and the wounds closed.  The shadow knight began to breath once more and as the light faded his eyes opened...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The smoke had long since cleared from the room as Kassy came back to the present.  She stood silently and looked from the ruined charm upon her alter to the sword that hung upon the wall above it.  She had hunted down the druid that had attacked her beloved and slain him with her own small knife.  Kassy turned away from the sword, a dark smile on her lips...<br>
