Soul's Journey (Part One)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The sun rested against the horizon, splashing a brilliant display of orange and red over everything. Red was his favorite color. The deep red of an enemy's blood, the dusky red that seemed to reveal Hate. Seeing it reminded him of the others, his Family.<br>
<br>
The Reaper, Winnower, Thresher. They were the Triad, the ruling council of the Harvest. Then the Dread Overlords Vinar and Faeolin, and the Ambassador of Kunark, Vresk. These were the forces just below the triad, set and ready to do the Father's bidding at a moment's notice. And there were so many others, all committed to the will of the Father - the Dread Harvesters, having taken on the challenges that others have not. Nospiratus was one of these, yet he was also more. He was the Mad Prophet, and he led the religious sect of the Violent Harvest. There were many Harvesters, Tillers, Harrowers, and Seedlings also within. Xareth couldn't count them all.<br>
<br>
Many of the new faces frequently appeared in the guild hall within Third Gate. He'd seen many of them there, and met many. But his constant traveling kept him far from Neriak much of the time, and a lot of his communication with his Family was done through spies or the mysterious mind link.<br>
<br>
Sunset had fallen now, and the warrior stood and brushed at the grime on his armor. He knew he'd gotten very contemplative since he joined the Harvest, but perhaps that was for the better. In the early days following his separation, he'd run amok like a wyld child. <br>
<br>
The thought made him stop mid-brush and wonder. Wasn't he still a child? <br>
<br>
A slow grin crossed his face. By all standards, he was still an infant. He was now approaching one year of age, and would reach it when Midsummer came a few weeks hence. It should be years before he were able to walk and speak, much less lead the Eastern Domain of the Teir'Dal. One year was short for a human, but for the Chosen race he should still be as a newborn.<br>
<br>
Yet he appeared about 60 years of age, a mere teenager. The Teir'Dal lived for centuries longer than the humans, so he was still very young.<br>
<br>
And his appearance had not changed at all.<br>
<br>
Well, that was normal, he supposed. Due to the longevity of the Chosen Race, it generally took just over a century for a youth to reach full maturity. <br>
<br>
He sighed and let it go. He had not been born Teir'Dal, so there was no point in comparing himself to them.<br>
<br>
Someone shouted for the arrival of the Faydwer boat, and folk began migrating to and from the boat dock. The trip to Felwithe was going to be a difficult one indeed, but it would be well worth it if it would allow him to put his past at rest once and for all.<br>
<br>
Xareth was on the far end of the dock, away from the flow of traffic. He waited until the main flow was gone before boarding. A human woman was perched on the edge of the dock near the boat. She gave him a morbid look as he passed, but said nothing. He ignored her.<br>
<br>
The trip was mostly silent, save the eternal sound of the waves and the cry of seagulls as they flew to and fro. A trio of light dwellers sat near the front of the boat, speaking in low tones. He found a place along the back to settle in, up on a wide ledge. <br>
<br>
It was full dark when the boat pulled out to sea. One of the foul lightborn up front, a Wood Elf, lit a torch and set it on a rack. Xareth was a little irritated at this; he could see better at night without the torch. The light ones were seated well within the ring of light. Two of them were talking in low tones still, but the other, a human, had drifted off and was playing a game with small imbued stones laid out in front of him. <br>
<br>
Eventually a stop was made at an island well out of reach of any mainland. The trio debarked there, and took the torch. Alone at last, and comfortably in the dark, Xareth let his mind wander for a while.<br>
<br>
Midnight came and went. The small continent of Faydwer was actually not too far from mainland Antonica, and soon the Butcherblock mountain would appear on the horizon. The warrior took care to seal his belongings so that nothing would get ruined by the water. Dwarves hated him with a passion, and would not let him approach the docks, much less travel across their mountains.<br>
<br>
That was, unless they didn't know he was there to begin with.<br>
<br>
All was well in that respect, since he hated them just as much. Dwarves to be used as a tool to further the Father's cause, beyond that, they were useless. Well, almost.<br>
<br>
Dwarf chops. Delicious.<br>
<br>
The mountains were well in view, and Xareth finished sealing his gear and secured it on his person. He took care to see that his swords were securely in their scabbards. Then he moved to the portside of the boat, waited until the docks came into view (but not so close as to be seen by the enemy), and dove headlong into the icy sea.<br>
<br>
It was freezing cold. Xareth, knowing that it would be like that, was still surprised a little by it. The water seeped into his clothing and the armor her wore. It made him more heavy, but not so much that he couldn't swim. <br>
<br>
A few minutes later, he broke the surface of the water with a gasp. Wet hair and saltwater got into his eyes, and he brushed at it absentmindedly. Soft mud met his feet underneath, and he waded out of the water and onto the shore, letting the excess water draining off his body. Then he set about setting up a camp and drying his clothing out.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Xareth was up and moving by sunrise. He'd slept fitfully through the night; nothing had intruded into his campsite. He slipped through the trees warily, knowing that the Dwarves had guards posted all through the area. Once a band of Dwarves approached, and he'd been forced to hide in the brush until they were past. Killing them would have been divine, but it would take a miracle for him to take them all out without aid. Besides, an attack would have given his presence away.<br>
<br>
Sunrise turned into midmorning, then on toward noon. The young warrior continued working his way across the mountains, stopping only when necessary. The mountains were well traveled, and he was forced into hiding more than once by various travelers passing to or from one of the lightborn cities. The entire continent was choked with light dwellers, and most likely he would be forced to make his entire journey to the hidden glade as he now was: traveling with a low profile, and hiding when necessary. He hated doing so, but necessity prevailed over pride in this matter.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The forest was dark when he arrived. It was the Lesser Faydark, a smaller sect of trees that had grown and thrived in a valley just off the Greater Faydark. Small beams of sunlight filtered through the high forest canopy, providing unnecessary light to navigate with. He relaxed a bit here. Lesser Fay was far less traveled than the Greater Fay. The only places that you could get to from here was the dark city of Mistmoore and Ak'Anon. Xareth almost wished he'd run into some low class Gnome coming from Ak'Anon. Gnome hide gloves were good for selling, even if the prices had gone rock bottom. After the Gnomes had discovered the icy wastes of Velious, the markets had suffered a great deal. It seemed fitting that Gnomes be stripped of their hides and sold for a fraction of their worth. <br>
<br>
The warrior used his instinct to tell him where to go, and he slipped through the trees easily, keeping an eye out for enemies. He had never been to this place, but he had faint memories of his destination leftover from his former self's mind. There was a faint memory of Brownies residing in the forest as well. That made him very cautious, for stories of those creatures were everywhere. Brownies were known for their ambushes, and appearing to their fallen prey as they lay dying. Even highly seasoned casters had some difficulty with them at times.<br>
<br>
It was twilight when Xareth reached the burned out hut. The thing was in sad shape, having not been cared for in what was obviously a long time. One of the walls was sagging onward, causing the entire building to lean a bit. Nest to that wall, a small area that had once been a vegetable garden was now overgrown by the local foliage. Vines were winding their way up the very side of the building. An ancient tree branch had fallen on the tattered roof, causing the hut to sag even more. The forest was reclaiming it bit by bit.<br>
<br>
He stepped gingerly into the open doorway, half expecting the hut to collapse on him. This place might have some information, some clue, that would help him find the cure. His throat ached almost absently at the thought. Ever since he'd survived the trial to become a Dread Lord within the Violent Harvest, the wound in his throat had been present. The trial had taken place within Neriak, but without a great deal of ceremony, and away from the Dragon of Hate. He remembered that night, knowing that the struggle to keep the Violent Harvest from being obliterated was reaching it's peak. But the trial had taken place, and with the Father's blessing, he had survived to earn the title and lead the Eastern Domain. The very area of the world in which he now stood. Or had he earned it?<br>
<br>
The wound that he'd taken had never healed. It had continued to bleed, letting his very lifeblood seep out onto the hardened rock as he'd kneeled before the Triad. A great deal of effort on his part kept him from passing out entirely, but he was weak for weeks thereafter, and forced to keep the wound stanched and bandaged at all times. Even now, months later, it bled freely when he changed the dressings. His Family had gotten used to seeing the constant bandaging, and never questioned it. But the truth was, it was getting worse.<br>
<br>
Xareth felt the floor shift just a little as he moved slowly through the hut. It had three rooms total, and a door leading out of the back. The High Elf's belongings were scattered everywhere, probably due to time, weather, and the occasional traveler looking to get something for free. Dust kicked up in small clouds around his booted feet as he poked around anything that looked like it might be useful.<br>
<br>
The wound had badly worsened after a while, causing him a good deal of alarm. It hadn't bled even more, nor had it gotten infected. It did something much worse. <br>
<br>
It began to turn pale.<br>
<br>
The injury had gone a pale color, and so had the skin around it. Xareth spent most of his time in wild areas, forsaking the luxuries that cities offered. He had learned first aid through mostly first hand experience, and quickly learned to avoid wild things that he was unsure of. Especially after that encounter with a poisonous plant in Kithicor. That little endeavor had very nearly cost him his life. <br>
<br>
He'd tended many of his own battle injuries as well, and knew what to do with what kind of injury and how to heal it faster. On trips with a group of hunters this wasn't necessary because there was normally a healer nearby. but there could not be a healer nearby all the time, so he learned. And this changing skin color that had inflicted him was obviously not due to a stab wound.<br>
<br>
Soon after, Xareth's spies reported that Silverstarr was experiencing the same sort of problem in reverse. She had been stung by something, and was now inflicted with a darker skin tone in places. Many of the light dwellers enjoyed the sun, and they darkened a little when out in it for long periods of rime.<br>
<br>
But they never turned indigo blue.<br>
<br>
That was what worried him so. Pravdameer had informed him that there might be a way to reverse this bizarre malady, but he would need to do some research. Xareth had listened to his plan about Silverstarr and consented, after making sure the cleric knew that she was not to be killed for any reason.<br>
<br>
He found nothing in the first room, and moved on the next. Pravdameer had reported to him just after he'd captured the girl. He'd had her in the desert then, unconscious. Xareth had listened to what happened and watched as the Priest healed a bite mark and his forearm.<br>
<br>
&quot;It appeared that she was giving you trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Priest flashed him that mischievous grin. &quot;Nothing I could not handle. Atoxus and I are very anxious to get her back to the city for research.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xareth left it at that, knowing that Pravdameer would be content to do just that for as long s it took. He kept numerous tools in his lab, all designed for pain as well as research. The warrior had glowered down at the unconscious bard, feeling that she more than deserved it for the trouble she'd caused in the past.<br>
<br>
Something crunched under his foot, snapping him out of his reverie. He bent to see what it was, and was rewarded. It was a leather bound book, it's cover bent from getting stepped on. Xareth picked it up and peeked in the cover. An odd set of runes were drawn in red ink on the inside cover. He thumbed through a few pages and found a short transcript.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate this madness. It keeps biting at me from within, as if it were trying to break free. I've tried everything I know to stop it, but nothing works.... <br>
There is one hope. I plan to ask Micahe. He studies all types of unusual magicks, and has delved into herbology, psychology, and pathology. I will pay him anything if he can help me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior felt an odd sensation from within. This was written by the man he'd once been, before the separation. Before he was born to the Father. He quickly found the last page and read.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tonight I go for my cure to this insane madness. After Micahe agreed to help, he told me many things. These things were important, because they were the things he would be doing to fix the problem. He said that he'd though long and hand on deciding to help, and I suppose it was true, since it took him more than a month to give me an answer. I suffered greatly during that time. At least for now the madness is sleeping, allowing me the time I need to write this.<br>
<br>
Tonight, he will begin the process to take the madness away. Micahe tells me that the madness is a strange form of multiple personalities, and that they war with each other. I don't know much about the personality business, so I will gratefully assume he is right. He needed two components from me that he can use, but I am not sure why. I gave him my father's dagger, and my mother's necklace. Both are gone now, and they are what I have to remember them by. But the components were to be special, so I gave him those. He carved a spell upon them both, and used his wizard's fire to seal the magicks in them. I hope that this experiment of his will not destroy those two things. They are precious to me...&quot;<br>
<br>
*BOOM!*<br>
<br>
The sound rocked through Xareth, and he clutched the book tightly and dropped into a guarded crouch. It had come from outside, and by the sound of it, it was not far off. Voices could be heard now, and he remained frozen for a moment, trying to determine where they were headed.<br>
<br>
&quot;This way! Get him!&quot; <br>
<br>
They were much closer, whoever 'they' were. Too close for comfort. He glanced around, looking for a hiding spot. They were too close for him to try running out of the hut and possibly right into them. There was nowhere to go. He stood, dropping the book and readying his swords. If he was to die here, then he would die fighting, like a true Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
But what kind of Teir'Dal was born of the Koada'Dal??<br>
<br>
A pang of shame attacked him, and he shoved it away mentally. Several figures zoomed past the leaning doorway of the hut where he was watching. He held his ground, expecting an attack any second. A few more came and went, never slowing. One of them shouted something to his comrades in a foreign language as they continued the chase off into the trees. <br>
<br>
He waited for several moments, not ready to relax. Dropping guard too quickly could cost a man his life. So he waited until he was satisfied that they would not return before sheathing his swords. Another boom was heard in the distance as he bent to pick the book back up. Someone was unleashing a nasty spell out there. <br>
<br>
He stepped out of the hut and glanced about before making his way back toward the mountains. He had what was needed. The knowledge in this book could be put to much use when he returned to Neriak. <br>
