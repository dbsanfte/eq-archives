The Teir’dal Warrior was returning back to Antonica after traveling around Norrath. He had been out, performing certain missions for his guild the Violent Harvest, for some time. His battles had taken him from the barren and blasted plains of the Dreadlands in Kunark, to the frozen and windswept cliffs of the Cobalt Scar in Velious. It had been a long hunt, but in the end he was victorious. He carried with him the items needed by the Harvest, as well as certain other prizes. Soon he would be back in his home city of Neriak, back amongst the Respected Race and all their greatness. Zirrix was not one given to any sort of emotion, in fact it was rumored he had none to give in to. Yet, he missed the dark, cool avenues of the 3rd Gate of Neriak, with the imposing and grand family estates of the nobles of the Empire. He also missed his Lady-Wife, the Battle Mage Mephala, whom he had not seen in too long a time. He hated the outside world of Norrath. It was either too cold or too hot, too bright or too foggy, too wet or too dry. He looked forward to the day that the Empire would strike forth to fulfill the dream of the Violent Harvest and turn all the world into a twilight paradise, with the Dark Elven race reigning supreme. As he walked onto the docks, to await the barge transport for the mainland, he thought back to his most recent hunt. <br>
<br>
He had been slaughtering Wyverns in the Cobalt Scar of frozen Velious. They were an inferior sub race of true Dragons, in the same manner as the Wood Elves are derived from the High Elves, and made their “Roosts” on the high cliffs of the Cobalt Scar. They could not fly, but were able to glide for great distances with ease. They were generally quiet and calm beasts, which did not like to move far away from their nests. But, once angered, they could move with startling speed and attack with deadly ferocity. More then once, Zirrix almost met his end in combat with the leathery winged reptilians. But, Zirrix was a Warrior of the Empire and member of the Respected Race, and therefore naturally prevailed in victory over the Wyverns. They were not like a sentient enemy of the Empire, therefore it was less like a battle, and more like a game hunt against the huge sub-dragons. Zirrix recalled his brother Tzlar, along with the other Casters of Neriak, had tried for a time to domesticate and train the Wyverns for use by Empire as an airborne attack force, but that plan had not been a success. Zirrix had heard through his “agents” that the Casters had started new experiments, geared towards providing ground transportation for the Teir’dal. Apparently, by gaining entrance to the Plane of Growth, the Casters were able to capture the “essence” of certain creatures. If the reports were true, the Empire may soon have a whole new transportation resource at it’s disposal. For now though, there was only his brother and his brother’s “associates” experimenting and casting their fey magic’s in hidden, secret places. <br>
<br>
After many long, cold and blizzard blasted nights, Zirrix was able to gather enough Wyvern stingers to complete a quest given him by one of the Kael Drakkal military trainers. Giving the stingers to Slaggart, Zirrix would receive in return a certain piece of armor which the Violent Harvest wished to acquire. Zirrix was pleased to learn that there were other more valuable prizes to be gained by killing the reptilian/avian hybrids. Zirrix had observed the dissection of most of the life forms on Norrath. It was both the need for knowledge, and to gain any tactical advantage in battle, that made such experimentations worthwhile. Zirrix had noticed that like other avian types, the Wyverns had no teeth, only beaks and two front fangs. They could rend flesh with their talons, and could rip out chunks of meat with their razor sharp beaks, but could not chew their food. Zirrix remembered something from his many studies in biology and tested a theory. After killing a Wyvern, he cut open it’s stomach and found many small rocks. The Wyverns, like certain other birds, swallowed these stones to aid in their digestion. To Zirrix’s good fortune he found that on occasion, some of these rocks were actually of gemstone quality and quite valuable. Most were worth many platinum, and on rare occasions, he even found exceptional ones that were rumored to be used for certain quest armors. <br>
<br>
So, as he hunted and butchered the Wyvern corpses, he was able to amass a tidy sum in gems and rare quest components. Continuing his journey home, he eventually landed in the accursed sun baked sands of the Northern Ro desert. Then, he quickly traveled through the Eastern Commonlands to the Nektulos Forest…HIS forest. Soon he would be in Neriak for the gathering of the guild, and then a few days rest before returning to battle. He would present the armors to the Violent Harvest, and place the profits from the gems into the coffers of House T’Rhennic. He would also save those he or his brother may someday need, and even have a few for his fellow guild mates. Yes, both Rallos Zek and Innoruuk had bestowed their graces upon the Teir’dal Warrior. Such was one of the many benefits of being both, a member of the Chosen and Noble of the Empire! <br>
