<br>
Knowing that Mahrin is currently concentrating on RVR issues, this class report focuses on the Mercenary as it pertains to RVR exclusively.<br>
<br>
Because my test team is too small to give a lot of feedback on this, and because the Live version and the Test version of the Mercenary are currently the same, and because there is more RVR going on Live then on Test anyway, I gathered feedback on various public boards by starting threads requesting RVR Mercenary feedback including what they liked, didn't like, bugs, problems, etc. I read over 10 pages of feedback to gather the information for this report.<br>
<br>
The Bugs:<br>
<br>
Parry bugged? - Many players reported that Parry never once has gone off in an RVR fight. I could not find any Mercernary players that could confirm Parry actually did work in RVR. This could be perceptual but with the number of players that reported it and the fact that no one could confirm it did actually work, perhaps it should be looked into?<br>
<br>
The Good:<br>
<br>
Mercenaries are fairly effective in very small encounters (3-4 people on either side) where they start out in close range. They can take out casters and archers fairly well if they can get the jump on them, although not as well as Armsmen, and have been able to take down other light tanks occasionally.<br>
<br>
The Bad:<br>
<br>
Damage Output - As in PVE, by far the number one complaint was lack of damage output compared to Armsman. This is even more of a problem in RVR. One big factor is the lack of the &quot;first hit shock factor&quot; that the 2-handed weapon users get. This is more of a factor in RVR since fights are usually so much shorter than in PVE. A 2-hander will take someone down in 2-3 hits, and often the last couple hits are attacking the defender's backside since the first hit hurt so much, the defender turned tail and ran. Mercenaries simply can't do this.<br>
<br>
Styles in RVR - Our Dual Wield styles seem more designed for Assasin types than for Mercenaries. We have no good &quot;no-opening&quot; Dual Wield styles, but the reactionary and positional are nearly impossible to do in RVR situations. For example slashing Mercenaries have found it far better to use Amethyst Slash for RVR damage than anything Dual Wield has to offer. <br>
<br>
No Role in RVR - Other than being watered down Armsmen, Mercenaries have no role in RVR, and nothing to make them feel remotely useful. They do the same things as Armsmen do, just not as well. Although we are light tanks, we have no abilities to make us more than just weak versions of the heavy tanks. We also have no abilities to associate us with the Guild of Shadows. This means that RVR groups really have no use for us.<br>
<br>
Endurance - Due to the endurance problem I mentioned in my last report, Mercenaries can only go through about one fight before they are completely drained if they want to stay effective. This not only means RVR downtime, which is dangerous, but also makes it extremely difficult to catch those speedy archers and evasive mages without a full Sprint (and often even with a full Sprint...).<br>
<br>
How we fare:<br>
<br>
V.S. Archers - Archers destroy Mercenaries because we have no way to effectively avoid their damaging long range arrow attacks. Our bows are too short ranged to fire back at them, we have no way to detect them sneaking up on us, and if we go after them they can use their speed booster spell to get away easily. The best option to survive an archer attack is a shield, however, we can't Dual Wield and use a Shield at the same time. This wouldn't be as big of a deal if we could more quickly swap between a Shield and Dual Wield similar to how a 2-handed user can switch between a 2-handed weapon and a shield weapon combo quickly with hotkeys. The problem is that the off-hand weapon goes in the Shield slot. If we could put the off hand weapon or the shield into the 2-handed slot we could hotkey this switch which would really help.<br>
<br>
V.S. Tanks - Against blademasters we do pretty well, and Bezerkers is a toss-up. Against heavy tanks we get destroyed - they outdamage us and we can't hurt them with their superior defense.<br>
<br>
V.S. Casters - With stun/mez, long range bolts, and highly damaging spells to go up against we are nearly defenseless against Casters (and to a lesser extent Healer-types that get stun/mez). However, casters are the one class that we are pretty good at taking out IF we can get close to them and IF they don't stun/mez us. Of course, an Armsman is still more effective at killing casters than a Mercenary is.<br>
<br>
The Suggestions:<br>
<br>
Fix Dual Wield damage output and Dual Wield styles to be more useful for the Mercenary.<br>
<br>
Regarding the lack of a Role in RVR, and the fact that Merc's are the only class in Albion that has no skills unique to them alone, many players had ideas for unique skills to give Merc's. Please note that we ONLY want one or two of these, not all of them by any means.<br>
<br>
Mobility skills - The top requested skill was something to increase mobility to match the &quot;light tank&quot; idea and give Merc's a unique role for taking out archers and casters quickly, then retreating. Here's some of the suggestions in order of popularity (based on how many people requested them):<br>
<br>
Sprint II/III - Sprint that takes less endurance to do and/or has faster speed.<br>
<br>
Charge - Faster form of Sprint that's activated on a timer (but doesn't use Endurance?) and increases the chance to avoid arrows/mez/stun while running (used to charge a mage or archer to close in quickly for the kill).<br>
<br>
Second Wind - Timer-based ability that restores some endurance to increase how long can Sprint or help with use of Styles.<br>
<br>
Run I/II - Allows Endurance to be regen'd while running OR give a faster base run speed.<br>
<br>
Clear Mind - Increased resistance to stun/mez.<br>
<br>
Guild of Shadows skills - The second most requested skills were things that went along with the idea of Mercenaries belonging to the Guild of Shadows. Here's some of the suggestions in order of popularity:<br>
<br>
Detect Hidden - Seperate skill not linked to Stealth, just allows to see other stealthed people. This one was requested far more than any of the below ideas.<br>
<br>
Tracking - When it goes in, many would find this fitting for the Mercenary from a roleplaying perspective.<br>
<br>
Sneak - (Personally, I don't like this one much, but it was requested multiple times so...) Some kind of extremely limited stealth, maybe have it only last a few seconds and be easy to detect, maybe even limit it so you're never truly invisible just transparent, should be just enough to help get in close to archers/mages but not enough to step on the toes of the Archer/Assasin Stealth ability and not enough to allow us to be safe from random attacks. <br>
<br>
Cheap Shot - Nasty style that's on a timer - 5% to 50% chance of a stun &amp; snare &amp; slow from next attack or high damage or something like that. I mostly liked this one for the appropriate name and how it fits with the whole Mercenary theme =).<br>
<br>
Other skills - Other abilities suggested were attack based abilities, such as a self-haste that drains endurance, special attacks that can hurt multiple opponents at once, or some ability similar to the Beserker's Beserk mode. However I think we should wait and evaluate how the fix to Dual Wield and Dual Wield styles affects our base damage output before considering things like this.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
It is clear to me that the main two things Mercenaries are lacking is damage output and some unique ability to make them useful in RVR. They currently have no really good points for RVR other than the fact that they don't die quite as quick as some other classes.<br>
