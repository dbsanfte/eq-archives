Part 24b.</span><hr size=1> (Originally posted as 'Memories and Questions' VoDR, Part 24b, or 'What Tzanntiel was Doing')<br>
<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled to herself as the meeting of Hate’s Culling drew to a close. Some made plans to hunt, or excused themselves for their evening’s rest. But Tzann lingered, watching the few who remained. A familiar woman in sapphire robes approached the small group of people who stood around chatting at the meeting site. <br>
<br>
A number of the members of Hate’s Culling recognized Kassy at once. There was some exchanging of formal greeting, a touch of malice. Tzanntiel just smirked to herself as she stepped forward. She figured she was the real reason that Kassy had come, though in truth, it was not unusual for the Enchantress to skulk about when the Chosen came together. <br>
<br>
“You have always turned up when we gather, Kassy… Curious, is it not?” <br>
<br>
Kassy turned to Tzann, her expression unreadable, “I find it useful to keep those I would watch within my sphere of knowledge.” <br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled, lowering her eyes in a mock bow, “Indeed. I feel quite the same.” <br>
<br>
Kassy’s even expression did not change as she replied, “So I have learned, young Rogue. So I have learned.” <br>
<br>
Khaet, the Ogre who was freed of his slavery to Cearyn’s House that very day, was very curious about this Teir`Dal who was so obviously unlike the others. Tzann took great amusement in dropping some not so subtle hints about what Kassy really was. All of the Harvesters knew her story well. Kassy clenched her fists in annoyance, not liking this mocking attention. <br>
<br>
Kassy raised an eyebrow at Tzann, giving her a pointed look. “Tell me Tzann, why do you linger here? Do you not have more important matters to attend?” <br>
<br>
Tzann had to stifle a chuckle, keeping her face neutral. Such a lack of subtlety in this one. One would think an Enchantress whose powers were designed for misdirection and obfuscation would be more adept at the play of words. “I was just thinking that myself. But I wouldn’t want to be rude, since you obviously wanted to talk…” <br>
<br>
Kassy’s eyes darkened a touch as she replied. “Though I would enjoy a nice… chat, with you, S`Therik, I would do so in private.” <br>
<br>
Khaet made to leave, mumbling about how he could take a hint, but Cearyn lingered at Tzanntiel’s side. Softly whispering in the tongue of the thieves, she offered to follow and watch. But Tzanntiel reassured her that Kassy had a vested interest in her well being right now, and added that the Enchantress would no doubt detect her anyway. <br>
<br>
As the two Rogues spoke in hushed tones, Kassy crossed her arms over her chest, waiting impatiently. <br>
<br>
Cearyn looked up at Tzann, and her face suddenly paled, her whispered words stopping mid-sentence. <br>
<br>
Both Kassy and Tzanntiel looked at Cearyn, and Tzann frowned in concern. The younger Rogue just continued to peer at Tzann’s face intently. “So like him,” she muttered. <br>
<br>
Tzann arched an eyebrow, trying to puzzle out Cearyn’s strange actions. “What do you mean? So like who?” she asked. <br>
<br>
Cearyn lowered her eyes for a moment, “I… don’t know his name.” She paused as Tzann shifted her weight uneasily. “You… his face…” <br>
<br>
Tzann shook her head a bit, glancing towards Kassy before she looked back at Cearyn. “I’m still not sure what you mean. Where did you see someone with a face like mine? In Neriak? Perhaps it was one of my cousins. Many people say that the S`Therik’s all look a bit alike.” <br>
<br>
Kassy chuckled softly to herself. <br>
<br>
Cearyn sighed sadly. “I saw him in one of my visions…” <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel raised an eyebrow in surprise. She was starting to get a strange feeling that she knew who it was that Cearyn was talking about. She suddenly wished that Kassy were not nearby. If she were to say the wrong thing, it could be very bad. <br>
<br>
“His eyes… they were… unusual,” Cearyn said. <br>
<br>
Tzann licked her lips quickly, shifting her weight again restlessly, trying to think of how to control where this was going. <br>
<br>
“And a mark… between his brows that you don’t have,” Cearyn said softly, touching her own forehead, her gaze far off as she remembered her vision. <br>
<br>
Kassy turned to look at Cearyn sharply, betraying her listening more closely than she no doubt meant to. The young Rogue seemed to take no notice, watching Tzanntiel instead. <br>
<br>
Tzann cleared her throat softly, “A mark… A red sword?” <br>
<br>
Still speaking softly, Cearyn nodded. “Blood red… a sword of thorns.” <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel blinked, her eyes widening. There was no mistaking or ignoring this now. “When did you see him? When was this vision?” <br>
<br>
Cearyn shrugged slightly, “Several weeks past, perhaps a full month.” <br>
<br>
Tzann glanced towards Kassy, praying silently that she would hold her tongue. The Enchantress stood a few feet away from them, her face unreadable. Tzann turned back to Cearyn. “The one you saw was my brother. I know no others who bear the mark that he does.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn lowered her eyes, whispering very softly, “He… saved me from my madness…” <br>
<br>
Tzann sighed softly. She knew very little of Cearyn, where she was from, why she had joined with Hate’s Culling. The fact that the young Rogue had visions was a revelation to her. She realized suddenly that with all that she’d been focusing on, she’d been shirking her normal information gathering on the workings of Neriak. “Strange… but very interesting. My brother, Khasirath S`Therik, was the last Reaper of the Violent Harvest.” Tzanntiel paused. She hated to lie to a member of her own guild, but she could not take any risk at this point with her brother’s safety. “He has been… missing… for a very long time. More than ten years now.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn looked back up at Tzann. “I… have a need to find him again… In more than vision. So that I might thank him for the gift he has given me.” <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel looked away, turning to look over the grasslands. Why did lying to this girl bother her so? She had visions, but she was not a Priestess. Did the visions alone make her a Prophetess? Tzann somehow felt very wrong lying to her. But she had to do whatever she must to keep Khas safe. As she turned back to Cearyn, Tzann realized that Kassy had disappeared. Though her mask allowed Tzann to see invisible things, she couldn’t see the Enchantress anywhere. “Perhaps you will get your chance to do so someday, Cearyn. But no one has seen him since the last meeting of the Harvest, before the Father ordered them to disband.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn frowned slightly. “What happened to him?” she asked. <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel sighed softly, recounting what her original investigations had found out. “He was there, at the last meeting of the Harvest. After the meeting he left to go hunting in the Hole near Paineel, but he was never seen again.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn said slowly, “It seemed to me… as though he was unused to physical form.” <br>
<br>
Tzann frowned slightly. The thought that her brother had somehow contacted someone while in his unnatural torpor disturbed her greatly. “It was over ten years ago, as I said. It is unknown if he lives, or if he has passed on to the Father’s Realm.” <br>
<br>
“Much of the Father’s Realm is with him. To see it… as he does… was what was shown to me,” Cearyn said. <br>
<br>
Tzann sighed softly again. The thought of being able to share such a vision with Khasirath made her almost jealous of the younger Rogue. “He has ever been close to the Father, in a way that… to be truthful… I envy.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn looked down at the ground, a thoughtful crease between her brows. “I don’t think it was… as a passing on. He seemed very much alive to me. But if he… had parted ways from his body… by means other than death…” <br>
<br>
Tzann frowned as a look of panic crossed Cearyn’s face. <br>
<br>
“You have to find him,” Cearyn said suddenly. <br>
<br>
“I know,” Tzann said softly. “I have been searching for him since he has been gone. He is my brother, after all.” <br>
<br>
Seeming somewhat calmed, Cearyn bowed her head. “If you have need of me… for any reason… in this search, just say it.” <br>
<br>
Tzann smiled softly, holding back a chuckle again. “Thank you Cearyn. I will let you know if I do.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn met her eyes, almost smiling, but looking somehow too weary to do so. “When you find him… thank him for me.” <br>
<br>
“I will. Your faith that I will find him is quite… touching.” <br>
<br>
Cearyn nodded faintly. “You will, because you have to.” <br>
<br>
Tzann smiled more warmly, her eyes glittering with amusement. It was getting harder not to let loose the fact that her brother was awake and would soon be well. <br>
<br>
Cearyn’s own eyes shone with tears that she quickly blinked away. She seemed to mistake the gleam in Tzann’s eyes to be for the same reason, and offered her a small sympathetic smile. <br>
<br>
“I’ll be sure to tell Khasirath when I find him for you, Cearyn,” Tzann promised. <br>
<br>
Cearyn softly whispered, “Khasirath…” Then louder she said, “I like the sound of it…. Thank you.” <br>
<br>
Tzann turned to look around the hilly plain, wondering where the Enchantress had gone. “I think I should go find Kassy, see what it was she wanted to say to me. I’ll be fine if you want to go on ahead…” <br>
<br>
Cearyn laughed softly. “She wanted to speak with me as well.” <br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled as she wandered off, looking for Kassy. She sighed as she looked around. She didn’t see any sign of her. “Kassy?” she called out loudly. <br>
<br>
The Enchantress stood up from the tall grass, brushing off her skirt, and walked towards Tzann. “Finished with your meeting, Harvester?” <br>
<br>
Tzann smiled, wondering for a moment if Kassy meant to use the old title in a hurtful manner. But Tzann could only take it as a compliment. “Aye, for the moment I am done. You wanted to speak with me?” <br>
<br>
Kassy came closer, nodding. “I did. You have not returned any but a handful of notes to me.” <br>
<br>
Tzann paused to look around them slowly, as if simply enjoying the vista that the small hill they stood on afforded. Once she was sure there was no one nearby she turned back to Kassy, speaking softly. “I have been a bit busy, traveling all over Norrath and beyond in search of information… I don’t often have time to catch up on mail.” <br>
<br>
Kassy’s eyes were steely. “I wish to know your progress. You know more than you let on.” <br>
<br>
Tzann sighed softly. “All I will say is that it is going very well. Within the month you should see results.” Inwardly she steeled herself, but she was careful to keep her expression relaxed and open. She couldn’t be certain exactly how desperate for information Kassy was getting. <br>
<br>
“I want to know the results currently, not in a month’s time,” Kassy growled. <br>
<br>
Tzann smiled reassuringly, tilting her head a bit. “The results are not complete as of yet, therefore I can say no more.” <br>
<br>
Kassy clenched her fists. “Damn it, Tzanntiel.” <br>
<br>
Tzann opened her hands at her sides, almost shrugging. “I only speak so carefully for the safety of the venture, Kassy…” <br>
<br>
The Enchantress cut her off with a hiss, “Why do you treat me like a child rather than an adult capable of understanding?” <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel continued as if she had not been interrupted at all, holding on to that façade of calm and openness. “It is a very delicate thing. One never knows what may be overheard or seen. Every person that knows of a thing adds to the risk of the wrong person learning about that thing.” <br>
<br>
Kassy’s eyes were flashing in her outrage. Tzann swore she looked a heartbeat away from drawing steel or magic. Inwardly she weighed her chances of escaping the woman’s wrath if it came down to it. She knew she had no chance to beat the Enchantress. And for the help she had been, Tzann had no desire to harm her for the moment. She could prove useful again later, possibly. <br>
<br>
Kassy bristled, staring hard into Tzann’s eyes. “And do you think I would hinder you? You, more than anyone, should know better!” <br>
<br>
Tzann shook her head reassuringly. “I know you only wish to help, Kassy.” <br>
<br>
Kassy rolled her eyes, turning to look out over the plain. After a moment she looked back at Tzann, a slight smirk on her lips. “You are just like him, you know.” <br>
<br>
Tzann couldn’t help but chuckle, taken completely off guard by the thought that someone thought she and Khas were alike. <br>
<br>
“Just as stubborn and set in your ways…” Kassy continued. <br>
<br>
Tzann smiled. “Not completely… There are a lot of things I do that he does not approve of.” <br>
<br>
Kassy nodded slowly. “Yes, there are, aren’t there?” She smiled mischievously. <br>
<br>
Tzanntiel raised an eyebrow, wondering exactly what Kassy meant, but decided quickly it was better not to pursue it. “Anyway… I should return to my work.” <br>
<br>
Kassy nodded slowly. “Go then, and for Tunare’s sake, keep me updated.” She looked over the fields and whistled a long low note. Immediately a pure white stallion charged up, and Kassy mounted him smoothly. <br>
<br>
Tzann stepped closer, patting the horse’s neck gently. She looked up at Kassy and very softly added, “Things are going very well, Kassy. I will say this much… I have found the cure.” She paused, studying Kassy’s face. “Within the month, you will see…” she left the word ‘him’ unspoken, hoping Kassy would follow her thought. <br>
<br>
Kassy chewed her lower lip lightly, watching Tzann as she gripped her horse’s reins. <br>
<br>
Tzann nodded seriously as she looked up, no jest or mischief in her eyes this time. <br>
<br>
Kassy said, “That is what I have hoped to hear. A cure.” She smiled softly, “Luck go with you, S`Therik.” She bowed from the back of her steed as she guided his head to the south. <br>

“Safe travels, Kassy,” Tzann said as she watched her ride off, a smile lifting her lips.<br>

<br>
<br>
They had been battling the undead of Castle Mistmoore, and had been cornered outside of the castle's graveyard. During a short lull in the battle, Cearyn was carefully applying her latest poison to her dagger when the vision claimed her. The vial containing her precious poison tumbled from her hand and came crashing to the ground, shattering into a million tiny shards of glass. Her world shifted into slow motion, and she was able to watch each piece of glass float lazily through the air before arriving at its final resting place. When she looked up, she was staring at her own body from the outside, and they were no longer in Mistmoore. <br>
<br>
She recognized this place. She was in the Western Commonlands. This was the night of the meeting. The night she freed Khaet. <br>
<br>
&quot;You requested a moment of my time?&quot; Cearyn asked, stepping from the shadows, hoping to catch the enchantress off guard. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where's that lovely dress you had?&quot; Kassy asked, chuckling softly. <br>
<br>
Cearyn waved her hand flippantly, as if brushing off that she was even wearing one, &quot;I didn't want it torn by some skeleton on the way.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kassy's expression instantly sobered, &quot;I wish to speak to you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then speak,&quot; Cearyn was suspicious, she didn't trust this enchanter. <br>
<br>
&quot;You mentioned a name that I have not heard in some time,&quot; Kassy said, &quot;That of the Reaper of the Harvest.&quot; <br>
<br>
Trying to gauge what it was that she wanted, Cearyn danced around the enchantress's words, &quot;I was but a young child when the Harvest slept for its winter.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You may be young,&quot; Kassy responded, &quot;But you know things that you should not, by all rights.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And what do you know of my knowledge,&quot; Cearyn glared at Kassy, angry that somehow, this woman knew of her visions. <br>
<br>
Kassy raised her staff, looking into the serpent's eyes before turning the staff to face Cearyn, &quot;Beautiful, isn't it Cearyn? The Staff of the Serpent, a jewel in the crown of that which was long ago forced upon me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sensing that something was not right, panic crept over Cearyn and she began to back away. <br>
<br>
Shaking her head, Kassy spoke, &quot;No... Stay and talk with me, Cearyn.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Cearyn shook her own head, trying to clear it from the haze that was coming over her, &quot;I... can't. I have to...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;There are questions Cearyn,&quot; Kassy closed in on her,&quot; Questions I need answered. You are going to answer them for me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Cearyn stood helplessly watching as she saw her eyes fog over and become cloudy, her will to fight sapped from her. She wanted to reach out and shake herself, bring herself out of it, anything, but she was forced to merely sit back and watch, &quot;Anything you wish.&quot; the version of herself that stood below responded. <br>
<br>
&quot;You spoke of a vision,&quot; Kassy continued, &quot;A vision in which you met Khasirath S`Therik... Tell me of it. The Teir`Dal with the silver eyes and the Crimson Tattoo. You must tell me all you know of him.&quot; <br>
<br>
Slowly, as if she could not focus her thoughts, Cearyn responded, &quot;He swims in the River of Hate m'lady. A river of blood red. It is a part of him, and he of it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly, sensing her distraction, a denizen of Mistmoore closed in on Cearyn, striking her, and violently ripped her mind back into her body. Cearyn screamed out in agony, taking the next few moments to focus her thoughts as the monstrosity struck her again and again. The monk she fought with was able to distract the beast long enough for her to focus her thoughts, and for a few moments, Cearyn allowed herself the lull of a well fought, planned out battle. <br>
<br>
As soon as the haze of pain cleared from her head, and Cearyn began to focus on her thoughts again, she became frantic. &quot;I have to find her,&quot; she whispered to herself. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tzanntiel... She needs to know.&quot; Cearyn whispered, fervently hoping that this battle would end soon. <br>
<br>
After her hunting party was safely out of Mistmoore, and Cearyn had made her way back to the Plane of Knowledge, she began scribing a lengthy letter to Tzanntiel, explaining what she had seen in her vision, the charm, not remembering what had transpired. She also explained that her vision was violently cut short, and she did not know how much she told this enchantress. Once the message was scribed, she sealed it with her House seal, and sent it to Tzanntiel, hoping it would get to her in time to be useful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
