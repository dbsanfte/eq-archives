I'll take studded and evade 3 please. Don't know about everyone else but Thrust, Studded, Evade 3, Dodger 2, and Dragonfang sounds a whole lot better then chain and evade1.<br>

<br>
Stacking charge on top of sprint sounded like a great idea. That would put the toggle for sprint in our hands and improve the speed of of charge.<br>
<br>
I liked dirty tricks better before it got changed. At least when it landed it did work. Most of the time I use it now, it has no effect on the fight at all and my target doesn't fumble. <p>Callan McSlaughter<br>

<br>
I've always been of the opinion that Flurry should be available in PvE.  Mythic introduced Flurry to offset the front load damage that a polearm gets with it's opening, no delay, attack.  This is as relevant to PvE as it is to RvR.<br>
<br>
As for dirty tricks, I want to hear two things, a 'whizz' when I activate it and a 'whizz' when the thing STICKS.  This would make it much easier to work out what's going on.  It gets resisted a lot, it's only due to the fact you're hitting a lot that it eventually sticks.  I can't keep up with the messages this produces and the whizz sound effects goes off continously.<br>
<br>
I also agree charge has become pretty redundant.  It would be nice if rather than increasing your speed, which I feel may be too much, it could negate snare effects instead.  This would give the Merc 10 seconds to counter the snare effect of disease and the like.<br>

<br>
1) Flurry should be PvE .. also drop the timer down to 1:30 or 1:00.. battles rarely last longer than that and normally I never get to use Flurry more than once. An extra 150 damage once every 1minute isn't a hell of a lot<br>
<br>
2) Tireless - make this RA scale better. Tireless 2 would be worth it if it was equivalent to a green/blue paly chant.. <br>
<br>
3) Charge - definitely give it a speed boost also please dont have it continue on Sprint mode once the timer runs out<br>
<br>
4) High Parry benefits - strongly agree with this.. something like Advanced Parry at lvl 25(equivalent to guard), Parry Arrows lvl 35, 360 degree parry lvl 45<br>
<br>
5) Dirty Tricks.. its great vs tanks 1v1 but provides little benefit in large battles.. not sure what can be done about this but unlike zerkers and BM's whose RA works on all toons, ours only works on tanks. ALso it would be nice if dirt would only appear over an enemy head if the dirt isn't resisted.. right now I think it shows up if DT procs.<br>
<br>
6) Flank needs a to-hit in RvR also I agree with people who say that SR rarely lands.. In Sidi I can get a flank off but SR mostly misses. I am not sure why this happens.. I in Sidi i mostly just do Flank Flank Flank vs parry mobs and DS DS DS vs non parry mobs.<br>
<br>
7) Crossing my fingers for good Master Level abilities.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Short bows suck - by the time you get within 1500 range, do a /face, draw the bow, aim and shoot, u have been nuked to hell. I draw my bow now once in a blue moon. Not sure what you could do to fix this. If you gave Short bows longer range then Scouts would bitch. If you gave them faster draw times then all the enemy would bitch.  Right now the bow is only good as a pulling weapon. <br>
<br>
Well that is all I can think of for now.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fester@lighttanksofdaoc>Fester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#000000>(10/21/03 6:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> One last thing</span><hr size=1> One last thing I forgot<br>

<br>
Mercenary 1.65 Team Lead Report -=DRAFT=-<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mercenaries are perceived as a fairly complete class that mostly suffers an identity crisis. This is true only because Mercenaries mature with Realm Ranks. The increased desirability of Mercenaries in RvR groups has more to do with access to powerful cheap RA's than because of the class's function. Continuing to have to rely on these cheap, effective (overpowered?) RA's to define our role is an undesired situation. Mercenaries need unique effective tools that allows us to fulfil our role regardless of Realm Rank or balancing actions to RA's.<br>
<br>
The only changes to Mercenaries in 1.65 came in the form of tweaks to the Crush style list. The change to Bludgeon was well received. It is too early to pass judgement on the changes to Concussion &amp; Bone Crusher.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CONCERNS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Role of the Light Tank. In 1.62, Light Tanks were defined as positional fighters, or assist tanks. In this regard, Mercenaries suffer an identity crisis since very few of our tools are tailored to achieve this. Our Dual Wield spec line appears to be nothing more than another base style list. The few styles that fit our role suffer penalties that make its usefulness questionable, given other options in our base style lists. See Specline Issues below.<br>
<br>
Pure Tank Realm Abilities. It is access to these Realm Abilities (RA's) that is giving Mercenaries a rise in popularity. The Prevent Flight RA combined with our ability to Dual Wield is unmatched in Albion. Our access to Determination, especially above level 3, further compounds the issue by ensuring we're able to be in position to Prevent Flight over the course of an entire battle. If at any time these RA's are decreased in effectiveness, so will the Mercenary's role in RvR.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Very true. Those cheap realm abilities did more to increase the value of the class than any change since release.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SPECLINE ISSUES</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dual Wield:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
- This specline should reflect our new role as positional fighters or assist tanks, yet does not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>From experience we are as much a reactive tank than a positional one. I for one consider our best styles are reactive ones. They however do not have enough bang for the trouble we go through to pull them off. (Both the reactives and the positional styles)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
- One of our positionals, Flank, suffers serious penalties due to its lack of To-Hit bonus. In PvE, the only encounters challenging enough for a full group or a larger force, will be very purple. Such high level monsters renders a no To-Hit style like Flank and its followup, ineffective. In RvR this is also seen when fighting Keep Lords. Against other players, the fluidity of a battle prevents the constant re-use of a side positional. With Flank's lack of consistancy, it is more efficient to rely on some other style to hit for less damage, more often.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I agree that the no to hit bonus doesen't help but here is anoter problem with flank. It's mostly used against casters in RvR as they are the only classes that doesen't move around much so it gives us a chance to pull it off. The first hit is almost always Bladeturned after that they usually turn their backs to us as they run away making flank a very situational style that never gets any real use. Eighter make it a very worthwhile style to use or give it something special. Reavers have a side positional chain that does loads of damage since it lifetaps as well. I think something like a short stun (3sec like blademasters) or some other effect should be used to make it a good style.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
- The Damage vs. Endurance cost for Misty Gloom arguably makes this the worst style in this spec line.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>To fit mythic views this style should only be reduced in end cost (heavy reduction needed) the damage should stay the same. Right now Inflame is much better than Misty Gloom in all aspects</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
- Dark Tendrils was changed in 1.62 to be a Parry reactional. Given the popularity of the Reflection-&gt;Hypnotic Darkness chain for the Stun effect and Dual Shadows for the Bleed Effect, Dark Tendrils is rarely used.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I think the Dark tendrills change was good but the bleed damage should be increased to at least the same level as Dual shadows since it's a reactive style.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shadow's Edge + Eclipse\Penumbra</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We lack a good Back positional style in DW. So far every merc i know use their base styles back positional since the 2 back chains we have are not better if not worst than the base ones. Those 2 chains also start both with the same style (Shadow's Edge) and their followups are very similar. Penumbra should be increased in damage by a fair margin to make it really a decent followup.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Crush: ???<br>
<br>
Slash: ???<br>
<br>
Thrust: ???<br>
<br>
Shield: <br>
<br>
- Mercenaries who choose a hybrid configuration including shield spec are penalized for doing so. The interface to change from weapon to shield is time consuming and disliked. While a shield is equipped, the Mercenary is penalized by having unused points invested in the Dual Wield spec as well as being unable to use Dual Wield styles. Mercenaries have very little reason to wear shields since the defensive playstyle is better suited to other classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I think the ability to Hotkey a shield in our 2h Slot is still something we would like very much. Even if most of us do not spec very high in shield we still would like to have access to it without constantly switching stuff in our backpacks.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Parry:<br>
<br>
- Parry is the main means of defense for a Mercenary and is the only specline that does not add increased utility the further you buy into it. That claim true?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Parry is a completly passive defence like evade is but unlike evade it is not a free ability. We must invest quite a load of points in this ability to benefit from it. The benefits are marginal at best granting a whooping .5% per spec point. <br>
Parry should get styles + abilities in a reactive form to compete with shield that gets defensive abilities.<br>
<br>
For example instead of Guard we should get Counterattack : Gives 1 free attack (1hit unstyled)on the mob that hit the person you were watching with counterattack.<br>
We could also have our own form of Engage with parry: Same as engage but gives a chance to counterattack everytime you parry. Could be more than 1 lvl of it atained at different specs to increase the chances to counterattack.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CLASS ISSUES</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Charge:<br>
<br>
- Since the introduction of the Charge ability to Light Tanks, better forms of Endurance Regen. as well as Endurance Potions have been introduced to the game. This ability is now nearly redundant since groups with a source of End. Regen nearly always travel with sprint active, which is the equivalent of an unlimited Charge ability. For the Mercenary in a group without End. Regen., the ability is still rendered useless if the opponent has End. Regen. OR if the opponent uses an End. Potion. The opponent can continue sprinting long after the 10 seconds from Charge have elapsed and not worry about Mercenaries catching up since Charge offers no speed increase.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>To make charge worthwhile it should be Slightly faster than Sprint (aka Speed 3) but still cost end (Maybe more end than sprint) It would still last 10 seconds and be on a 5 minute timer making it something we could use but not overpower us. <br>

Dirty Tricks:<br>
<br>

Sorry Fester, last I heard from Mythic this was a dead horse.  Infies getting items like that is something you have to take up with raid leaders.  The main reason they put restrictions on weapons is to keep them out of the hands of certain classes (i.e. Bane to keep Infies and Mercs from getting a 1H weapon that's THAT slow, and some of the slowest 2H Mid weapons from Savages). <p>Nirala Kindred<br>

Putting the question of Gaheris to one side, personally, I think that flurry in PvE is completely unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Would it *over*power us in PvE?  Perhaps not.  But it would give us a boost where none is really needed.  Outside of a group with a bunch of nukers (in which flurry would be lost in the shuffle anyway since they can take the mobs down so fast), you should be outdamaging other Alb tanks all the time.

About determination.... if determination nerfed, we will get back to dark age of Mezalot 1 year ago. <br>
<br>
IMHO, the problem of determination is the pure tank can attack supports/casters quickly coz the mez/root period is too short, and DAOC has no collision detection for the enemy tank to protect the casters/supports. IMHO, one of the good solution is to make taunt style actually work in RVR. You use taunt style on an enemy tank who is chasing your cleric, if successful, your enemy tank target will switch to YOU!! Not the cleric he is chasing. IF he re-target the cleric again, you taunt another time and his target will switch to you again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Oh ya, if this happen, expect tanks will be the first target to kill in future...

I'm not getting this from Kerrec's report. And I don't see a reason that you should flame him simply because he disagreed with you.<br>
<br>
I'm only a level 45 Merc at the moment, and my experience is generally PvE only, so I can't really comment on much of the report, as it deals almost exclusively with RvR issues. Of the few PvE issues:<br>
<br>
While it would be wonderful to have Flurry work in PvE, and I don't think it would be terribly unbalancing, it might have lower level solo PvE effects. At level 35, Flurry was hitting for ~200 in the BG, which could overpower soloing of yellow-orange con mobs at that level.<br>
<br>
To-Hit on the Flank Chain could use a boost in PvE as well. Landing Flank isn't generally difficult, but the follow up lands perhaps 33-50% of the time on red+ cons, although does nice damage when it does land. <br>
<br>
Generally speaking, the DW styles are good for PvE. I'm looking forward to the style review though because I'm hoping that Mythic will add more effects than just the general Bleed/Snare/Atk.Debuff sort of things and make the advanced spec lines more like those given to Reavers, Savages, and VWs. Something like a Dirt effect built into a DW style would be kinda cool.<br>
<br>
There's my input from the lower lvl side of things.<br>
<br>

<br>
Kerrec also has absolutely nothing good to say about the DW line. I happen to like it except for a few styles that need a tweak. I think there have been substantial improvements to Mercs over the last few months. Here he and I disagree since he has only negatives to say about the class in general. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to bother to argue the point. It's too bad to have a TL who feels that may in my opinioin but for the most part I'll simply ignore it<br>
<br>
Perhaps that was a flame toward the person who suggested that taunts work on tanks. That would make it virtually impossible for a tank to function in RvR if there were no timer on it. Combined with a nerf to tank RAs, I believe tanks would leave DAoC in droves. I certainly would.<br>
<br>
Edit: For what most people consider a strong class, this is one of the most negative TL reports I've ever seen. <br>

<br>
No, it's recognizing the reality of the situation.  Mackey, the TL coordinator and the person these TL reports get submitted to, has flat out stated that Determination is overpowered and needs to be nerfed.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, to me Kerrec's report comes across more as &quot;I know you believe that some of our RAs are overpowering, and that is possibly true, but it is those RAs that allow us to be effective at all in the general RvR environment of today, so please keep in mind that simply nerfing those RAs without making other signifigant changes may effectively nerf the class.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is similar to what the Wizard TL had to deal with for 1.65.  There was no question that a VP nerf was incoming.  Rather than not commenting on the issue, in his 1.64 report he offered one way that VP might be changed to meet some of the concerns about it.<br>
<br>
Now, if you did nothing but read the Wizard TL report on its own, it might indeed look like the TL was calling for a VP nerf, but if you understood the context behind it, it made a lot more sense. <p>Acus TwinHammer<br>

For 14 points and what PF actually does its not really overpowered. Mercs have no way of getting any tank off a healer/caster besides PF. Armsmen/Palys can slam a tank for 9 seconds.. we have no rear style 9 second stun. And unless you have a paladin chances are that you have zero endurance left vs chasing a druid/healer/bard that has 70% endurance left and these will always outpace you and get away from you. PF stops these support classes from always just running out of range, rehealing, mezzing, etc. <br>
<br>
It makes our roles of support tanks (as per mythic's label) doable.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=374.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=374.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=374.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=374.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=374.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=374.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.threadControl?topicID=374.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=374.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=374.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2>Mercenary General Discussion</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
