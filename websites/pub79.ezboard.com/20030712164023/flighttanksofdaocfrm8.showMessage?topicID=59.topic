<br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Version 1.59a Test Release Notes <br>
<br>
Thursday, January 9, 2003 <br>
<br>
===================================== <br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- Poisons applied to weapons will now save when zoning. <br>
<br>
- In some cases, when a keep lord was killed (usually by a GTAOE spell), the keep status would not be changed. This has been fixed. <br>
<br>
- A new command for pets has been added - HERE - which commands the pet to come to your position. Look for it on your pet control window. <br>
<br>
- The Looking for group system should now work across zones. It stores up to 30 of each type of group leaders or solo players, and displays the zone name. LFG status is now saved when zoning. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer /INVITE hidden players on PvP severs. <br>
<br>
- Certain negative effects on the player would not be overwritten by more powerful negative effects (like slow spells). This has been fixed, and will fix a number of style related effect issues that rely on these spell types. <br>
<br>
- Savages will no longer be able to resist their self parry buff (Nails of Kelgor line). <br>
<br>
- The Purge realm ability is now properly available to Necromancers. <br>
<br>
- All Savages now are properly awarded Ignore Laceration at L48 Savagery. <br>
<br>
- Necro pets now only get item resistance bonuses from their controller (previously resistance bonuses from buffs were being passed down as well, allowing double effects). <br>
<br>
- Necro power taps cast on monsters now cap the amount of power regained at the monster's current hitpoints or level, whichever is lower. <br>
<br>
- Necromancers in shade mode can no longer use charged items. <br>
<br>
- Windowed mode and the ability to Alt-Tab have been re-enabled. Remember, you may have significant technical issues when you run the game in windowed mode; be sure to report any problems you find. <br>
<br>
- Long macros and macros with commas are no longer cut off when you log out or zone. <br>
<br>
- Sylvan using Large Weapon combat styles will now animate correctly. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PVP SERVERS ONLY <br>
<br>
- The maximum level cap for Catacombs of Cardova has been changed to level 45. The delay for the changes in these dungeons are dependent upon the epic quests that some classes may need to complete. It is highly recommended that players on the Arc of Ages and Craft of Retribution quests complete these quests before this change goes live. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CLASSIC CAMELOT WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
- All Portal Master NPCs on the PvP/PvE Servers will now respond to the key words [port me]. You must be wearing the medallion of your target destination in order for this to work. This is just an additional method to use the Portal Masters. You can still continue to use them the previous way if you choose. <br>
<br>
- Midgard Quests: Players working on the &quot;Helping the Svartalfar&quot; quest will no longer be able to get the rabid sveawolf skull from any sveawolf. They must get it from the rabid sveawolf. <br>
<br>
Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps <br>
<br>
The PVE encounters at Hildskialf Faste and Nottmoor Faste have had their difficulty increased. (Gaheris Only) Fixed an issue were the weaponmaster at Fensalir Faste would instantly respawn when killed. (Gaheris Only - already fixed on live) <br>
<br>
Caledonia <br>
<br>
The door for the central keep has been moved making it easier for players using rams to damage the door. Prior to this change, rams were not as effective on the door because the door was placed slightly inside the proper location making it very difficult to target. Players will not see a visual change, but the ease in damaging the door should be noticeable. <br>
<br>
<br>
Monsters: Monsters summoned by Summoner Lossren in the Summoners Hall will no longer drop loot. (already fixed on live) <br>
<br>
Hibernia: After having been annihilated by a combination of disease and the brutality of the Fomorians in eons long past, the souls of the Parthelonians have become restless and seek to extract vengeance against the Fomorians and any other unlucky individual that cross their path. <br>
<br>
<br>
Items Notes <br>
<br>
- The Seafarer's Death Shroud (Midgard) can now by dyed. <br>
<br>
- Future drops of the Sapling Staff (Hibernia) should salvage for the correct material type. <br>
<br>
- Gold Stitched Boots (Midgard) should now correctly appear as cloth. <br>
<br>
- The Feverish Runner Drum (Hibernia) can now be salvaged. <br>
<br>
- The Ring of Abundance (Midgard) now increases piety, not intelligence. <br>
<br>
- The Dried Moss Ring (Hibernia) should now equip in the ring slot. <br>
<br>
- The Mandible Headed Axe (Midgard) should no longer display that it has a proc. <br>
<br>
- The Deathsight Perfection Bracer (Albion) has had its magic bonuses slightly altered so that it will not continue to generate a &quot;fails to affect you&quot; message. The new magic bonuses are: resist darkness 6%, skill deathsight +6, power +1, stat int +9. <br>
<br>
- The Poorly Woven Vest (Midgard) has been replaced with a new drop, the Poorly Woven Garb. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SHROUDED ISLES WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
Albion Quests: Lost Treasures: Due to a bug, the reward portion of the quest has been restructured. If your quest journal now says 'Step 13 - Choose your second bracer from Ariette' and you did not make a first choice, return to Ariette behind Fort Gwyntell in Dales of Devwy and she will allow you to get your first bracer. Players will no longer be able to get unlimited no-sell, no-trade bracers. <br>
<br>
<br>
Midgard Quests <br>
<br>
- The quest &quot;Silent Death&quot; has been opened to Savages and Bonedancers. Also, ALL rewards for this quest have been changed to &quot;No Sell&quot;. <br>
<br>
- Bonedancers have been added to the available classes for the Stripe quest. <br>
<br>
- A woman named Medana has come to Aegir's Landing to help stop Catla Gardasdottir's mad plans. Anyone that is level 49 or 50 should speak to Medana in Dyrfjell if they wish to help. <br>
<br>
- Mucking Through the Ick: Savages and Bonedancers have been receiving the wrong rewards for this quest. Savages who received the Silkstand Belt (+2 power) can take it to Belyria in Haggerfel and exchange it for the Hardened Silkstrand Belt. Bonedancers who received the Hardened Silkstrand Belt (+HPs) and would prefer the Silkstrand Belt (+power) can also speak to Belyria and exchange their belt. Players must have completed the Mucking Through the Ick quest and have the belt with them to exchange it. The exchange may only be done once. <br>
<br>
<br>
Albion Monsters <br>
<br>
- Avalon Isle: Nalsor would sometimes chase players indefinitely or kill them again at their bindstone after they release. This should no longer happen. <br>
<br>
- Isle of Glass: A drakoran commander has been spotted in the drakoran encampments in the Northwest of the Isle of Glass. It is suspected that he is planning an attack on Avalonian positions in that region. He has only been seen plotting with his underlings in the early morning hours. <br>
<br>
- Crystal Cave: The Xanxicarian Elite have been toned down slightly. They also chant correctly during battle now. <br>
<br>
<br>
Midgard <br>
<br>
NPC Changes Bjarken: Berge is now a Smith instead of a Vault Keeper. Sisko now sells Dye making supplies and enchanting/recharging supplies. <br>
<br>
NPC Changes in Hagall: Alfdis Rannveig is now a Smith instead of a Healer. She has been moved from Bjarken to Hagall. Mikkal will no longer sell spellcrafting supplies for other realms. A new enchanter has come to the town of Hagall. His name is Bolverk and he can be found near the three huts in the town. <br>
<br>
NPC Changes in Knarr: Reynilda will now sell Midgard spellcrafting supplies instead of Hibernian ones. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hibernia <br>
<br>
- Cothrom Gorge: Travelers passing by the waterfall have reported that the area now smells of death. There are also reports of earth tremors in that area. Some even claim to have seen the very rock around the waterfall move! Globs of green sludge have been collecting behind the waterfall as well. There is some speculation that the sludge is the source of the foul odor, but others suspect that something else lurks behind the waterfall. <br>
<br>
- Vigilant Rock: The sylvanshades south of Necht have reportedly appointed a leader as well as placed a scout to watch over the area. <br>
<br>
<br>
Expansion Item Notes <br>
<br>
- Bonedancers may now wear the Stripe Hide Helm. <br>
<br>

<br>
- The Pelted Fury cloak reward given to Runemasters, Spiritmasters, Healers, and Shamans for the &quot;Ota's Quest&quot; the has been altered.

<br>
- Gazsi's Battle Hammer and Gazsi's Blade (Midgard) should now proc correctly. <br>
<br>
- Dagda's Cauldron (Hibernia) has been renamed to Cauldron of Clarity to avoid confusion with the relic Cauldron of Dagda. <br>
