<br>
  Why did it always rain here?  Did the gods forget the living require the Light of day to grow and thrive or did they think 40 nights of rain would prompt us to go back to the seas?  Perhaps this is all Prexus' doing /shrug.<br>
<br>
Rain...<br>
  <br>
  I've been wandering these plains for as long as the rains have been falling and I have a bad sense of it all.  It is more than the constant chill of my bones from the howl of the wind there is something.... deeper here.   <br>
  When Mildaien said he sensed something not right with Tunare it was more a vague feeling than a statement of fact but it peeked my interest none the less. <br>
  We had been sitting that day by the great inland lake on the continent of Kunark known as Ill Omen;  we sat enjoying the sun and hoping for a fresh feast of salmon should they so grace us.  We chated and jested and wiled away the afternoon when at once a shadow seemed to cross Mildaien's face.  I saw him visibly shiver as if someone had walked over his grave.<br>
  It was then that he said for a moment his connection with Tunare seemed weakend as though separated by some great distance.  I told him he was homesick but he heartely refused my explanation.  He went on to tell me that a ranger never feels far from home as long as his feet are on this plane, for Tunare is home and she is everywhere.<br>
  It was then that I told him of my plans to return home myself to Halas.  It had been far to long since seeing my old freinds and mentors in our secluded villiage.  <br>
  &quot; I will search the lands for a sign of Tunare and send word to you if I find it&quot; I said.<br>
  &quot; Well met Bretton and I will send word to you of what I find in Faydwer&quot; He replied.<br>
  With that old friends parted company, one on a boat to Timourous Deep and The Oasis of Marr, and one to the Port of Kaladim.<br>
<br>
  All of which led me right back here.  North Karana and this never ending Rain......<br>

This, the only day in more than a fortnight without rain, day has shown the me the truth of the statement.   The sky itself shows the handiwork of the god of disease; it is a stagnent dense mist that hangs around me.<br>
How could I have lasted this long in such filth?  Surely this is what drove that pack of wolves to attack me and come to think of it that griffawn as well.  Still I wonder why?  What would escalate tensions between the gods?<br>
Well enough have I seen of the Karana's, I must get to a city with the resources to send what I have found to Mildaien perhaps the ranger knows of some connection between the two.  If not I'm sure my journey will not end here.<br>
  Two days hence I joined a caravan to the city of Qeynos where I had not been since my youth.  Qeynos the City of Men.. surely I would find the means to send my message to Faydwer.<br>
  A week of travel across the Western Plains of Karana brought us to the rolling his of the Qeynos countryside.  Gaurd towers appear more frequently here and at last the sky is  clear and fresh.<br>
  Sitting in a tavern quenching my thirst with some of the city's finest ale, I could only hope the League of Anticonian Bards were as good as their hype.  I had given a quickly sketched note to a , rather curvacious half elven maiden, runner and she had left this very mourn.<br>
  In a way I hoped my response would be a while coming... there are many such ale's to sample here...<br>

Two weeks of sailing this misbegotten behemoth and not one cloud not one hope of Karana's cooling waters.  The shade of the Maiden's voyages' lower decks cannot compare to the cool shade of Karana's rain.  <br>
  But at last we have come to Kaladim and I can once again find the solstice I seek at the root of her fair mountains; shade, cooling winds and fresh mountain spring water.  With that Mildaien's  spirit bouyed with new hope for this journey.<br>
<br>
Soon the road would lead him through the mountain passes connecting the industrious dwarven lands to the home of his people.  Undaunted by the growing feeling of unrest inside him he set out; with his packs replenished with Tunare's bounty at least the road would be kind.<br>
<br>

<br>
The attack was fast co ordinated and primal... blades and clubs beat down relentlessly each a killing blow.  Howls of delight and victory rang through the forest shattering the nights quiet embrace.<br>
<br>
Urok stepped forward and made a final thrust with his wicked glave.  It was all for show of course, nothing could have survived the beating his orcs had laid on that foolish elf.  Ah elves, his favorite prey save maybe for faeries themselves,  Urok could kill them by the dozen if only more would venture forth from their homes in the tree.<br>
<br>
All at once one of the peons ran forth and grabbed for the bedroll, no doublt to claim the coup from this elf.  Urok roar in outrage sending the little orc scampering away quite tangled in the bedroll.<br>
<br>
His eyes shot wide as he looked down at the headless body before him,  correction headless orc body before him.  A moment later he felt a hot sting and the body... well it no longer needed a head.<br>
<br>
He sat and wondered how orc's managed to survive this long.  Clearly not by their intilect that left procreation.  Yes he decided Orcs must be born pregnant.<br>
<br>
Mildaien finished breaking camp by leaving his mark on a nearby log noting each of his brother's and sister's marks in the process in case he needed to call upon them soon.<br>
For now he was home in the towering trees of Greater Faydark a place of wonder.  This was as close to Tunare as one could be without leaving reality all together, life teemed here... and yet still the feeling...<br>
<br>
Over the hills and through the meadows he ran, for days the forest went by but he showed not signs of fatigue, for he was home and haste was perimount.  And all at once it sprang from the earth towering beyond his minds eye.  Kelethim chosen home of his people.  Massive fir's streaching to the clouds cradle the homes of loved one's and friend, businesses and guilds.  Bridges of felled evergreens weaving from tree to tree connecting all this together as a spider would her web.<br>
All safely out of harms reach starting some two hundred feet above the ground, he would have to get a lift.  <br>
<br>
The arm of tunare, his nickname for it not mine, lifted him to the guild level.  Withing moments he traversed the 3 spanses to his guild house tithed and stood before his mentor.  He knelt and his furrowed brow fortold he was unsure as to how to tell the anchient sage about his feelings.<br>
<br>
&quot;Speak Pathfinder&quot; he said. &quot;You did not come to me to simply train&quot;.  Pathfinder, his mind raced.  Pathfinder was a title reserved for but the most regaurded of his breathren.<br>
&quot;Yes M'ilord,  I have lost Tunare from my heart&quot;. he sputtered &quot;I fear something terrible is amiss but I cannot say what&quot;.<br>
&quot;You say you have lost Tunare but you still have her magics with you, do you not?&quot; he questioned.<br>
&quot;Aye M'ilord but&quot; he tried to respond but was cut off by the wise mans words.<br>
&quot;You have not lost Tunare Pathfinder, but we soon may well. Take my words to heart now young one.  Seek the heart of Darkness that is a plague unto Karana.  Burn it Fires of Ro but only after it is anointed in the blood of the anchient worm&quot;. his eyes seemed to dance with fire as he said those words to me.<br>
&quot;But what is the heart, what wurm, tell me more I beg of you&quot;. Mildaien verily pleaded but the old mans fire died out even as the words left his lips. &quot;Sleep well M'ilord, I will find this Heart and I will end this disease... So I Swear&quot;.<br>

Not only had she calmed the lad but she had bandeged and dressed his wounds at the same time. <br>
 Rezeri, the beautiful high elven maiden had stolen his heart the moment he laid eyes on her.  She had been sitting by a brook combing her long golden hair singing a childs lulaby.  <br>
Twas then the brook claimed him for a quick bath as Mildaien pushed the lovestruck druid haplessly to an embaressing meeting.<br>
That had been many years ago and never had he left her side.  Mildaien had gone off to seek fortune and fame but he and Rezeri had decided to see the world.  And so here they were in the outpost of Firona Vie,  surrounded by refugees from a recent skirmish with Pirate mauraders.<br>
<br>
The elven maiden was tending to the wounded and the sick with efficency and caring and it made him love her all the more.  <br>
Suddenly she sat bolt upright and gasped for air. <br>
&quot;What is it Rezeri&quot; Korizon said as he rushed to her side.  Her breath was still coming in laboured gasps as he tried to steady her.<br>
&quot;I felt, I felt nothing and coldness surround me&quot; she responded unsure of herself.  Korizon looked into her eyes trying to understand but not interrupting her thoughts.<br>
&quot;I lost my magics for a moment, my calls for Tunare's healing were not answered.  It was quite unsettling&quot; she replied.<br>
&quot;I am fine now, please I just need some rest.&quot; with that she headed to their rented room by the boardwalk.<br>

Korizon was not happy.  He did not like this one bit and he was going to find out what was going on.<br>

Ice crystals grew from my beard like a spreading glacier.  A true testiment to my northern heritage but to the swarthy man from freeport it was deaths cold blanket.<br>
&quot;How can you stand it&quot; he pressed.  &quot;Walking around in nothing but that damned plate armor and a bearhide over your shoulders. It's not normal&quot;. he said from his bundle of blankets and hides on the wagons bench.<br>
&quot;This is home&quot;. I replied hoping that would shut him up at last.<br>
&quot;Bah home, this is no home more a hunters dream safari but not a home. At best a fur traders outpost.&quot; he cracked the whip across the oxens back urging it to quicken its pace.<br>
<br>
Home and the air fresh the sky blue, what could possible ruin this day.  A moment later the wagon let out a moun of bending planks and a pop as the right side wheels broke off.   I had to ask.<br>
Pernon the driver was up and inspecting the damage to the wagon in an instant.  He wailed a curse at some lost god and stepped forward into the hole that had caused the wheels to fail.  <br>
&quot;Pernon step back&quot; I said, with far to much force. &quot; NOW&quot;<br>
&quot;What are you for, telling me what to do, I ought&quot; I shoved him back and knelt by the spot.  &quot;Hey now watch what you're&quot; but he stopped as he saw what I was looking at so intently.<br>
He let out a whistle &quot;Sweet mother of mercy, Ice Giants&quot;  True to his word we had broken down on a rut made by an Ice Giants booted heal. &quot;What... what do we do now&quot; he stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now Pernon... we hunt&quot; he looked at me like I was some animal half crazed from the cold. &quot;Nothing like giant kiling to warm a man up&quot; I said and picked up the trail.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's gone daft, he's gonna get me killed but I'm following him maybe I've gone daft too.&quot; he reasoned. &quot; Crazy Barbarian&quot;<br>

<br>
He had been travelling the faydark since he was but a boy some 60 or so years ago and never had he seen a tent.  It just wasn't done the greater and lesser faydark forests are not safe it was for just that reason that the elves had built thier homes in the trees and in the side of the mountain.<br>
<br>
A curiosity worth investigating he decided.  Mildaien move silently throught the long grasses of the meadow keeping low to remain undetected.<br>
  The sound of voices carried over the wind to his ears, and they sounded vaguely elven but not quite something was off.  He moved closer skirtting around the camp downwind to avoid detection from any watch beasts.<br>
Yes the voices were most definately elven but the language they spoke was niether old elven or a modern dialect.  Finally the answer came.  Stepping out of the largest of the Pavillion tents was a Tier D'al. <br>
<br>
 Dark Elves had come to Faydwer.<br>
<br>
Unable to understand the language he decided to enter the camp at night under the stealth of dark and determine if this was some random occurence or somehow connected to his recent troubles with Tunare.<br>
<br>
Over the day the camp grew busier, crates of supplies and gear were unloaded from heavy carts and stacked in the second Pavilion tent.  Guards came and went constantly patrolling around the camp, fortunatly they always walked the same route and could not see the ranger in his perch.<br>
With night falling the camp quieted and stationary gaurds were placed about the camp.  The dark elves ate around a low burning fire kept dark and hot as a pile of coals.<br>
  They chatter more seeming to be more relaxed now that night had fallen.   Their tone was light and their voices filled with excitment tempered with caution.  Not being the most loved of races dark elves generally don't travel so in the open.<br>
One by one the darkelves retired to their barrack tents soon leaving a deserted camp, save for the 4 posted gaurds.<br>
<br>
Moments later the stealthy ranger was beyond the most isolated of the sentries.  Moving quickly but silently he moved to the back of the large pavilion tent and unoticed slipped undter the wall.  <br>
He was surronded by the crates unloaded earlier in the day.  Pulling a dagger from his belt he gently pried the top off the nearest crate.  Stacks of iron rations dried berries, casts of water, wine and mead; each and every crate was filled with the same.  It seems the Dark elves were planning an extended visit to Lesser Faydark.<br>
<br>
Finding nothing hinting at the purpose of this stay he slipped back under the tent and moved to the back of the largest of the Pavilion tents where he had seen his first Dark elf and from what he deduced their commander come from.<br>
<br>
Entering the big tent he saw shelves laiden with supplies of a more sinister nature.  Bone chips and  body parts floating in jars laiden down the hastily errected shelves and a large table stood in the center of the  tent covered with more of the same.  Carefull not to touch any of the foul stuff Mild moved through the tent searching for more information.  In the back portion of the tent he heard breathing.  Carefull not to go any closer and disturb the sleeping Tier D'al he turned to leave. <br>
 There in front of him was a Map fully filling the side of the tent wall.  After a quick study he determined it was a map of the entire Lesser Faydark valley although there was one small change to what Mild was used to.  Where once stood a quiet secluded valley now stood a great mansion protected by a stone and steel gate;  Imposing as it looked on the map Mild could not believe the Dark elves would be so bold but there it was, Mistmoore.<br>

<br>
He said it with an even tone despite his own eagerness.  He had been searching for a clue to Rezeri's sudden malady for almost two days with not but a clue his luck took a turn for the better when a local business owner mentioned that a bard runner had come to town.  Bards were known for knowing things about everything, call it a job related perk.<br>
  He sought out the bard which wasn't particularly difficult as it seemed wherever she went a crowd would follow.  He had followed her into a tavern and waited for the general din around her to disperse.  After gleaning her drink of choice from a passing barmaid he ordered another and joined her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need information&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;Well now although this drink is welcome my information normally costs just a wee bit more&quot; she replied and took a long draught of the honey mead.  She was half elven like Korizon a few inches shorter than a human lass but still full figured.  The only tell tell sign outwardly of her elven heritage were her sharply pointed ears.  She was a striking woman with blaze white hair cropped short, much more practical for someone running the roads and wilds of Norrath.<br>
&quot;I have coin, and I am not without means&quot; he began to reply but she cut in.<br>
&quot;I have no doubt you do but not now. I have just disembarked that blasted behemoth ship and all I want is a few hours for me&quot;.  She sat back and finished her flagon and reached into her pack.  After rummaging around for a moment she pulled out a lute and began to play a slow melody.  At first most of the patrons simply ignored the music but Delara began to play faster the tune changing coming alive if you will like a beast awakening from a long slumber.  The tempo double and double again the pitch and timber soared soon the patrons had gather round her in a large throng gapping and staring caught up in the tempest unleashed but the Half elven maids skill.<br>
Her voice cried out in joyous battle lyrics to Tunare and Karana. With a final strum she stopped dead silent bowing her head low.  The common room exploded into cheers and whistles, many a coin was thrown into her now conspicuously over turned helm sitting on the table.<br>
Korizon had to smile, she gave a wink and played a few more tunes before retiring  for the night.<br>
Delara walked up to him and said. &quot; See me tomorrow and I'll see what I can do about some information for you.&quot;  She smiled again and climbed the steps to her private room above.<br>
<br>
A man could get used to adventuring with a bard although he was sure Rezeri would have something to say about the outlandish bards taste in leggings.<br>
<br>
He sighed and returned to his own lodgings and his still ailing wife.  This was a start and a glitter of hope opened in Korizon's soul.<br>

<br>
I'll be damned if that isn't the symbol of Innoruuk on that wagon.  That's all I could think to myself I was so unprepared.  Here in the Mountain of Permafrost were no less than three emissary's from the south.  An oger large and powerfull built for combat, I respect that but he really wasn't my focus.  The Troll fully 8 feet tall nearly as big as his oger companion and a mouth filled with razer sharp teeth so foul instant disease from a bite.  Although daunting he too was not the reason for my ire.  Standing  upwind of the brutes leaning against a cart was none other than a dark elf, It was unheard of to see one so far from friendly lands.  <br>
<br>
Ahh but how did I come to be here,  let me see how to explain that.  No need to explain time is short.  <br>
I watched their movements for days trying to decern the reason for their sudden and risky presence here but no answers were forthcoming.  I finally decided to enter the Goblin Lair myself and learn what was afoot.  <br>
I wrapped my waist with 2 large sacks of flour then through an old oxen blanket over my head and shoulders like a large cloak and entered the caves.  I realize of course that I do not stand near 10 feet tall like the oger emisary but I was hoping that I would seem imposing enough to pass as at the very least a lesser oger.<br>
The goblins not being the brightest of creatures scattered as I approached whispering small praises at my back... maybe this wasn't going to be too hard after all.<br>
I decended into the darkened halls where the tunnels weave and wind to allmost impassable sizes.  Finally It opened into a great room filled with flags of the assembled races.  I slipped off to the sides and listened in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Surely even you can see that we must be unified for this event to succeed&quot; it was the Dark Elf talking &quot;We cannot hope to accomplish this task alone and we must keep our enemies occupied untill the casting is complete&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me don't see you's fightting da humans, me don't see you's dieing to make um not see dis&quot; stated the oger emissary.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, we take mounting casualties&quot; the troll jumped in &quot;and we see no help coming from the Tier D'al, do you expect us to keep dieing without some clue as to the progress of your labours or sign of the rewards&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;So it has been&quot; snapped the Dark elf &quot;and so it will stay. We are not fighting a small skirmish here.. we are eliminating an entire race from existance.  There will be deaths there will be losses but the reward is so great you will continue&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do Innoruuk really tink he can keel an udder God me dont tink he can&quot; the oger glared across the table at the elf.  Ogers by nature hate all elves whether they are high elven wood elven or even dark elves.  They did normally give Dark elves a wide bearth but today Roak was feeling particularly venoment.<br>
<br>
All eyes turned to the Dark elf sitting at the head of the table. Rising from his seat he said.<br>
&quot; Innoruuk can and he will destroy Tunare!  He is not alone this time&quot;. the look of sheer exstacy on the emisary's face led me to believe that he was speaking as if from his God itself.<br>
&quot;Now you will keep up your attacks and we will continue the casting.  I will be staying here to supervise the goblins mining of the crystals now return to your duties&quot;.<br>
<br>
It was enough for me.  Time to find Mild and get to the bottom of this befor this &quot;casting&quot; was complete.<br>

<br>
but it has to be done.  He had just finished reading the note I had sent from Qeynos and it deepend his worry.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So now I have dark elves in the Faydark and a Plague running rampant in the Karana's&quot; he mutter a little too loud.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that&quot; came a quizzical female voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry it's nothing just thinking out loud think nothing of it&quot; he wanted to head off any further banter there was too much to work out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps I can be of assistance&quot; she replied. &quot;Delara of the Antonician Bard at your service&quot;.<br>
That was a bit of a shock and he turned to face her.  Bards were known for their informed nature as I stated earlier what I had not mentioned up to this point is that they we're also known to bring troubles to those traveling with them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry but no I can handle this on my own thank you&quot; mild quickly replied. &quot;I'm sure my road does not follow your own path&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I think it does&quot; was the reply. &quot;You see I have been comissioned to seek out any and all information regarding strange happanstance related to the all mother Tunare.  If what you say is true I believe that to be relevent, do you not&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot help you, I have much to do and little time to do it&quot; Mild was about to go into a triad to dissuade the half elven beauty but she cut him off.<br>
<br>
&quot;All the more reason to take me along. After all I am a Bard traveller gatherer of lore and I'm sure that my employer, a well equiped druid, could be of assistance&quot;. she prodded him along with the speach picking up pace. &quot;You see he will spare no cost as his wife is ailing in this time of trouble for Tunare&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mild's face blanched &quot;What is his name&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure he can be pursuaded to bring you into the agreement&quot;..<br>
<br>
&quot; WHAT is his name&quot; this time she did stop. Looking into his eyes and seeing the genuine urgencey she let slip her employers name.<br>
<br>
&quot;Korizon, I have not his surname.&quot; Mild slumped to the ground as if hit by a giant.  Rezeri was ill of course that made sense considering her ties to Tunare are as strong as the Mild's themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may join me and all haste must be made we travel to Freeport to seek more information and get word to my Barbarian friend in the North&quot;  Things were starting to get interesting, of course thats just my point of view.  I imagine the followers of Tunare weren't quite as thrilled as I was but if they want to put another twist on this tale... let them scribe it themselves.<br>

<br>
The streets run foul as sewers and aqueducts overflow, surely an end to this rain would come soon.  Never before had Mildaien or myself for that matter seen a season so wet.<br>
Although I had heard no mention of the goodly aligned Prexus in the Dark elf emisary's rants I still believe him somehow involved.<br>
I had departed Halas only a day after returning from the frozen tundra for when I arrived a message most urgent waited me.  Mild had related the condition of Rezeri to me and of Korizon's involvement in attempting to find the source of our misery.  His newfound bard companion had pointed them to an orcle of sorts in the port city of Freeport.  She had assured Mildaien that his information was very reliable and they had sought him out as soon as they arrived.<br>
<br>
The alley was dark and cluttered wisps of matterial blew in the light breeze and rain.  Mild took a tenative step into the darkness carefully feeling for the solid coblestones beneath the shifting mud of the rain soaked earth.  Clearly he was out of his element, citys were not known to be friendly to Rangers solitary defenders of the wilderness.  Delara however had seen dozens of alley's just like this in her dealings and was quite comfortable, alert but comfortable.<br>
<br>
&quot;His shop is at the end of the alley beneath the arch&quot; she whispered. &quot; Knock thrice and await his call, your answer is Garou&quot;.<br>
&quot;Garou, aye&quot; and he slipped down the alley.<br>
The door stood under a large stone arch ironbound and forboading, symbols of power and runes of defence clearly etched along its surface.  He made sure to follow the instructions precisely.<br>
Moments later the door swung inward revealing a dimly lit corridor with a bright red light at the end floading out from a room beyond.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Enter now, quickly before you flood me out&quot; the voice was anchient and crackled with ire. He moved to the portal and beheld a room filled with fetishes of all shapes and sizes. There were feather from exotic birds, bones from unknown beasts and mirrors adorning almost every inch of the walls.  More impressive maybe than all of this was the perfect crystal globe resting on a golden stand adorned in dragon carvings. Sitting behind the crystal on a pile of silk pillows was an old man or Erudite by his still elegent manner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come forward&quot; he beckond Mild with a boney hand and motioned for him to sit.<br>
&quot;I seek&quot;...... &quot;You seek the Heart of Darkness&quot; he interrupted. &quot;and you seek to end Tunares pain&quot;.<br>
<br>
Startled by the accuracy of his words mild stammered to reply &quot;yes... err yes I seek it, can you tell me of it what it is and where to find it&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can do this but...&quot; he paused looking deeply at Mild his eyes seem to pierce the very soul. &quot;I am not sure you are ready young one&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am I must be there is no other choice and there is no time. Tell me please Ubadar where can I find the Heart and the wurm&quot;. Ubadar paused a moment longer and then bent over the great crystal and began to chant.  Soon the rooms light changed from red to near white and energy crackled to life around the ball.  Spinning and rising from its pearch on the dragon stand the crystal rose growing brighter with each passing moment.  Mild was now straining to keep his eyes open so intense had the light become but Ubadar stared directly into the raging energies.  Finally Mild felt the energy ebb from the crystal and it settled back to its resting place and grew cold.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Heart of Darkness is Cazic Thule&quot;. Those words shot through the ranger like a dagger in his heart.  How could he hope to kill Cazic Thule. &quot;The anchient wurm is Nagafen&quot;. I am tired ranger leave me.<br>
<br>
Mildaien left the small shop broken.  He had no idea what he could possibly do to save Tunare now.  He reached the street where Delara still stood, she looked at him quizzically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not the answer you were looking for&quot; she queried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not at all, unless killing a god to save a god seems plausible to you&quot;. he replied, a bitter tone edging his normally calm voice.<br>
<br>
Delara scrunched up her face at that. &quot;What do you mean explain&quot;.  He quickly recounted the the events and what Ubadar had said.<br>
<br>
&quot;That does seem a bit beyond us.... but I seem to recall something about Cazic now let me think...&quot; she drew back under an awning and pulled out her lute.  She played a few chords and began to sing an epic tale.<br>
<br>
&quot;How is singing going to help us now&quot; Mild snapped. She stopped playing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have another plan, perhaps you've someplace to go hmmm, if not then let me play and stop interrupting&quot;.  Once again playing words began to flow freely.  In the second movement she found the answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cazic is on Norrath&quot; she said excitedly. &quot;He is mortal and not infinite now&quot;. &quot;Every hundred years or so he returns to the Temple erected in his honour in the Feerrott Jungle where he takes sacrafices and endulges in and orgy of fear and death&quot;.  &quot;To be here he must assume an avatar and while he is an Avatar he is mortal and not as powerfull as when on his home plane&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I take it all back sing bard, sing for Norrath, Sing for Tunare and send out a call to arms to all the Rangers of Tunare we need them now and we need to be in THE FEERROT&quot; he now had  hope again.  If they could kill a god what chance would a veneralble red stand against them.<br>

Unending it had come and still they ran.  Weeks of running through forests and jungles they had come,  Pote, Ginwiel, Reddale, Dandealus, Terminat, Herne, Kemian and more.  They had heard a call to arms by a brother in need and a Mother in Pain and they had come.<br>
They rangers passed through the wilds as a pack of wolves hunting and eating on the fly they stopped not to sleep but passed in and out of the revelry gaining what rest they needed to run.  Mildaien led their charge southward across the firey deserts of Ro, his pace pushing the limits of endurance, time was of the essense they could not fail.<br>
<br>
&quot;Korizon&quot; the voice was weak &quot;Korizon what troubles you my love&quot;. He paced across the room like a caged beast lost in his mind's mire wondering how the bard was fairing.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry my dear, tis nothing really.  I am awaiting word from my informant from the mainland&quot;.<br>
&quot;Surely that cannot be all, tell me&quot;.  He lowered his head, never could he keep something from her.<br>
&quot;It is about you my love.  The sickness that grips you runs deep and the bard seeks a cure. I am worried that she will not return in time&quot; he spoke honestly holding nothing back from her.<br>
&quot;My life will not end, have faith my love. Tunare will not fail me&quot;.  Such loyalty he was unsure was fitting.  Tunare had not done so good a job so far.<br>
&quot;I have faith in you, but I would feel better if I at least heard from her that things are going well&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
Night fell across the swamp, the sound of frogs chirping filled the damp night air.  They stood before the final rise that would lead them into the Feerrot to the Temple of Cazic Thule already the journey had proven difficult.  They stood over the corpses of two swamp trolls and soon enough would have to contend with ogerkind and the lizardmen gaurdians of the temple.  Pote lit the fires removing these trolls from life perminently stood and led the rangers up into the hills.<br>
<br>

<br>
at last the rain has come.  Two days since thier arrival from the swamp and not a drop or even a dense fog;  they needed the stealth the distraction it could provide to enter the Temple.  Lizardman patrols roamed the Islet on a regular ,although be it random basis, making an easy approach impossible.  So they waited across the alligator infested river beyond the sensitive noses of the lizard folk.<br>
<br>
The rain now came bringing not only visual cover but water to wash away the sent of their travels.  Two at a time the traversed the river while the waters were carfully watched for signs of submerged predators.  The were an impresisve sight, 15 of Tunare's finest prepared to meet death this day should that sacrafice be needed.  Delara of course was not ready to die just yet but she knew it was too late to back out now for already they had lost three of their host to oger attacks,  no forward was the only way left.<br>
Pote and Reddale returned with two lizard corpses and signaled to follow.  As they moved they seemed to almost blend in with the surrounding vegetation reminding Delara of the stories told of the forest spirits that protected Kelethin.  She pulledo out her flute and played a song without sound and stepped into the shadows with them.<br>
<br>
&quot;A TRAP!!!&quot; she screamed and sat bolt upright from her sleep. &quot;They are walking into a trap!&quot;<br>
Korizon was at her side in a moment &quot; What trap who tell me Rezeri&quot;.<br>
&quot;Mildaien he is in great danger,  Tunare came to me in my dreams, her voice was weak but she warned me the rangers are walking into a trap... please warn them Korizon&quot; she fell back exhausted.<br>
&quot;I will go at once&quot; he rang for the cleric of brell, a sturdy woman who had been helping him since Rezeri took i'll. &quot;Keep her safe for me I shall return at once&quot;. he spoke quickly as he gathered his armor and weapons.<br>
Stepping into the light of day he called apon the his heritage his god and opened a portal in the sky. With a crack of thunder and a flash of light he was gone, leaving behind many stuned and amazed town folk in his wake.<br>
<br>
Ginwiel and Kemian downed the next two guards without much effort and carefully hid the corpses.  This was going almost to well as far as Mild was concerned.  Even in the heat of passion created by the coming of their god normally lizardmen are not taken so unawares.   With grappling hooks secure they climbed the side walls of the Temple itself gaining perchase on a ledge just above the main gates.  Looking out over the courtyards surrounding the temple as far as the eye could see were fields of moving green bodies swaying to the chanting in the temple, he was glad it was going so well so far.  They dropped silent as death on the four gaurds at the gate.<br>
<br>
Thunder hearalded the arrival of Korzion to the Feerrott.  He felt weak as a kitten from the casting and was glad that ogers fear thunder.  He took these few moments of reprieve to collect himself and get oriented.  South and west with the speed of the wolf he ran.<br>

<br>
unbearable, oppressive...hot.  What can I say I'm a northman.  The Lavastorm mountains are exactly as the name implies, rolling hills blasted by heat and flowing rock a desolate place to be sure.  The footing is treacherous with one wrong step causing an end to most in a pool of molten stone.  <br>
Yes the heat is unbearable but Mildaien's  note was specific.  <br>
&quot;We are on our way south to confront the mortal god Cazic Thule to claim the Heart of Darkness then we shall travel north to the Lavastorm and find the high wurm lord Nagafen, I know you cannot make it to us in time in the south so I emplore you to gather what forces you can and await our arrival near the temple of Ro&quot;.<br>
<br>
So here we are a small force of barbarians loyal and true ready to slay the wurm.  Szotak, Bistia, Kilany, Judana, Baman, Gustufsen, Mullzy and of course myself.  We had travelled hard from Halas travelling great distances in a short time thanks to the Tribunal's magics.  We now sat encamped on a hill overlooking a huge Pit of molten rock;  it is so large I would almost call it a lake.  I had sent one last dispatch from the City of Freeport to my small friends in Rivervale, perhaps some of the wee folk would be interested in assisting their brothers in arms slaying the ainchent wurm, time would tell.<br>
<br>
<br>
The light dimmed to near total darkness as they approached the steel bound doors.  Mildaien moved to the front to listen at the door in hopes of determining the whereabouts of the Temples inner guard.  He peaked through the keyhole and was surprised to see the main courtyard itself empty.  Gingerly he pushed open the great door.  The rain had  stopped and the grounds were wet and cool but vision was good and they could see no trace of the lizard folk.    Quietly they moved out into the courtyard staying tight to the wall and moving westward towards the nearest door.  They were nearly to the door when all the doors burst open and lizardmen warriors poured out onto the ramparts and into the courtyard.  A voice boomed as thunder.. &quot;INFIDELS you dare assult the Temple of Cazic in his time of Revelry,  Prepare to Die&quot;.<br>
It is hard to say what runs through a man's mind right after hereing the voice of a god tell you that in no uncertain terms you are about to die but for the Rangers they would think of Tunare and die with high hearts.<br>
They formed a tight defensive semi circle and met the first charge with blades and spell fire.  Delara changed instruments to her lute and played a rousing battle hymm pushing the rangers to incredable stamina and speed.  In the first wave a score of Lizardmen fell, the second wave a score more but there were 100 such score and 100 more.. they could not fight forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
I heard the stone fall just before everything went dark then there was a crackling of energy and a lightning bolt coursed through my armor into me and out the otherside.  I could tell by the screaming that my companions were also taken by surprise.  I rolled backwards with the force of the bolt and came to my feet some 10 feet away outside of the globe of darkness.  Standing above me on the ridge was a dark elf holding a slender wand, he was saying something and moved to point the wand at me again.<br>
<br>
Terminat and Reddale had fallen Ginwiel was badly hurt and Mild himself was bleeding from a number of minor wounds.  Delara was playing what seemed to be two or three songs at once how is beyond me but her efforts were solely responsible for them still being alive.  <br>
The lizard folk moved forward to finish the rangers but paused to look at the huge steelblue wolf standing at the gates.  The wolf seemed to smile as if thanking them for stopping and staying so close together and then their world errupted in a blaze of chain lighting.  Waves of power fell from the heavens scattering the lizardmen in all directions.<br>
&quot;Follow me now if you want to live&quot; Korizon yelled.  There was no resistance as too a man the rangers grabbed fallen comrads and injured friends and followed the druid down the darkend hallways.<br>
<br>
The blast scorched the stone where I had just been standing sending several large chunks flying from the force of the blast.  I came to a rest by our firewood and hatchet.  I turned to see Bistia Baman and Szotak engaged with several dark elf warriors and the shaman were busy healing and countering the magics of the evil clerics.  So it was up to me to end that meddaling wizards life.  The globe of darkness once used against us was now shielding me from his view so I stepped inside moved to a jog and errupted from the far side to see him grinning and pointing that deadly wand at me again.  Of course the grin faded when he noticed the hatched I had just thrown spinning towards him.<br>
<br>
<br>
They met a few guards on their way deeper into the temple but they fell quickly heavilly outnumbered by the remaining rangers.  Korizon had dropped a number of thorny barriers to cover their flanks and rear as they ran so the focus was on what lied ahead.  They opened the next door and fell into a pool of water that filled the room.  In the center was a glowing orb and inside it was a figure most foul.  <br>
&quot;MORTALS  your deaths shall be slow,  Prepare to meet your end for now you face FEAR now you face CAZIC THULE,  MILDAIEN!!!&quot;.<br>

<br>
bleeding from a dozen wounds staring into the lifeless eyes of his brother his friend Kemian.  He could hear the sounds of battle and the dyeing,  he heard the clang of steel on steel he heard the thunder of korizon's casting and he heard the death of a God as his eye's closed forever.<br>
Mildaien knelt beside Pote and gently closed his eyes one last time and moved to do the same for Kemian.  Finally he stood and approached the corpse of the God thing known as Cazic Thule no easy task considering the broken leg he now walked on.  This beast had ravaged the rangers nearly killing them all before they learned his weaknesses and still it almost won.<br>
He stood legs astride the fallen gods corpse and brought his sword high above his head and drove it into the chest over and over again until finally the breast bone spilt wide open revealing that which they had come for.<br>
The heart... the sight of it revulsed him and he nearly retched but time was short the sounds of impending doom at the hands of the lizard folk were growing louder.  He pulled an oiled sack from his kit and  anointed it with holy water to insure the seal then reached down and pulled  the black heart free.  With a sickening sucking sound the heart pulled free of the chest cavity oozing black ichor and trailing the stench of a thousand rotting corpses. He tied the bag and secured it to his belt and moved to the others already huddled around Korizon.  The druid was hurt some say mortaly but still he sat meditating preparing to cast a great portal spell to carry them to the Common lands and through it all he could only think of his wife so very far away fighting her own battle.  <br>
He stood and they winked out of existance...<br>
<br>
The look on his face was priceless... a mix of shock and amazement.  He was standing there looking at the axe protruding out of his chest his mind not yet registering and tell the rest of his body that it was dead.  I of course knew this to be true and moved back through the globe to find my next dark elf.<br>
We had been taken by surprise and been outnumbered but truthfully the wizard had been what tipped the scales in the Tier D'als favour, with him now dead the rout was already on.<br>
We looted the corpses and hid them in the Lake of Lava, a fitting end for dark elves,  where ro's fire would dispose of any sign in moments.  We then moved our campe farther to the northwest and set up more diligent watches.  Now all that was left was to wait for the arrival of Mildaien and his force.<br>

Rain....<br>
<br>
Mixing with the liquid stone creates quite a turmoil.  First theres the steam, great gouts of the stuff billowing upward creating a dense blanket to cover the valley, and then theres the sound a constand rumbling through the earth as molten rock becomes solid and then reliquifies crackling and sizzling all the while.  Were it not for the excellent cover the steam fog provided I am quite sure I would have gone mad long ago and ran screaming back to Halas for a dip in the fjord.<br>
<br>
We had located the Wurm's lair three nights ago and spent limited time scouting the caverns, it was all a bit risky you see, certainly we could move invisible to the guards but unfortunatly we had discovered the gnolls have magics of their own.  This detail was not lost on me.. if we could not somehow get beyond the gnoll casters undetected surely the wurm would have a warning of our arrival and have time to prepare for us.  Something else disturbs me here, a feeling nothing so far I've seen but I have a feeling that there is more to this cavern than gnolls... bah I'm sure we will kill that obsticle when we come to it.<br>
<br>
Kairn's were erected a short distance from the stone of power.  Many spoke even more paid tribute to the fallen including many of the commons residences.  Word was spreading like wildfire of the fall of Cazil Thule and the rangers party had been elevate to near epic status by the feat ( of course I'm sure they will soon be at that status humans are just slow to recognise the deeds of other races).  <br>
For Mildaien however this was a time of sorrow and grief.  He had lost many.. too many good friends.  These were his brothers he could not feel the joy of the commons folk what he did feel was rage and determnation.  <br>
<br>
Korizon came to his side and laid a hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;We must go, as you yourself said time is short&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know..  I know&quot; he said his voice trailing off. He looked down once again to the bag tied at his side and cursed it.<br>
<br>
They mounted fresh horses provided by the commons folk and set out for the Nektulos forest, they would have to brave the cursed woods to reach me in the mountains in time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;..... Answer me DAMN YOU.&quot; the voice crackled with rage and hatered. The troll and oger stood nervously before the great ornate stone desk each willing the other to answer the enraged Tier D'al.<br>
It was the troll who finally spoke,&quot;My lord and god has fallen&quot; the room fell into silence,&quot;The rumors are true&quot;.<br>
The dark elf fell back into his chair to stunned to speak at first.  &quot;Cazic Thule, defeated, I had not believed that possible but perhaps I have underestimated Tunare's disciples&quot;.<br>
&quot;Gather your finest troops and bring them to the fallen temple of Najena there you will meet my Pretorian and finish this threat once and for all&quot;. his eyes we dark and piercing daring nay challenging either of them to disagree.  There was no argument coming and before nightfall one hundred of the finest oger and troll warriors marched on Najena.<br>

<br>
good to see you old man&quot;. I said as I clasped his arm.  We had not seen each other in some months since that fatefull day fishing;  yes fishing on a quiet shore on a sunny serene day.  Now we stand on the edge of the abyss waiting to assult the inferno that is Nagafen in hopes of destroying the Heat of Darkness to save Tunare and her brood.  We're in their world now.  Gods and goddesses strife hate and Pain are the results of their petty conflicts and we... we are but the toys of omnipotent children at play.<br>
<br>
&quot;and good to see you Bretton.  I see you have had little excitement I hope you have not been to bored&quot;. mild replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh we managed to find a thing or two to do while we waited&quot; I was snickering to myself and thought it best not to share.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ginweil has recovered from his wounds and is charting a path to  the wurm that should allow us safe and undetected passage.  With anyluck we'll take him completely unawares&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I much prefer a straight out fight to all this sneaking around you know and my breathren feal the same way&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you do Bretton but we dont have the resources to defeat an entire kobald clan and a fully prepared dragon.  Its this way or none and none will not do&quot;. his interjection was forcefull but not overbearing and I could see he was still somewhat distracted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well then, we shall do this your way&quot;. what else could I say. This friend of mine had seen so much and been through so much in the past few weeks I could not bring myself to fight over this small a detail.  I only hoped that Ginweil would not find so easy a path. That brought a smile to my face and I went back to sharpening my blades.<br>
<br>
Over the mountains a league away 120 other warriors were sharpening or dulling their blades. By dawn their would be less elves alive to see the end of Tunare and the end of their race.<br>

<br>
why do I keep starting my stories this way.  Oh yes I forgot it's always raining in Norrath.  Mildaien had returned to us almost compleatly out of breath to warn us.  <br>
&quot;Ten score, moving swiftly towards us&quot;. he blurted between breaths.<br>
&quot;We must move on the dragon now! or all is lost&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Finally some action&quot; Bistia growled and heafted his weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are only twenty we cannot fight an army we must retreat to the caverns and make haste to the dragons lair, we can lose them and finish what we came here for&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pah, we should finish the Dark elves and their consorts first then slay the dragon&quot; Szotak fully supported Bistia in this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please listen to me we must Slay the dragon and complete our task then we can deal with the armies of Hate&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well elf, we will follow you for now&quot; Bistia turned and led my breathren towards the caves. <br>
Mildaien sighed a clear sign of his relief that my people had conceded on this point unfortuneatly we were going to get to fight the Dark elves after all.<br>
<br>
We turned to see a fast moving band of Dark elves break off from the main host and head for the kobald caves. <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn we must not be flanked,  Charge to the caves!!&quot; the shout had the power of a command and the urgency of desperation.... and we ran.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like we're late Farging&quot;<br>
&quot;Could be&quot; he conceeded &quot;or we could just be fashonbly late&quot;.<br>
&quot;I like your take late,  now lets not miss the fun&quot; Niivag turned to the host of dwarven warriors behind him then to the host of Halflings riding their war hounds and called the shot.<br>
<br>
&quot; Cry Havok and Let Loose the Dorfs of War&quot;  and fifty of the stout folk charged into the rear flank of the advancing hoard of ogers and trolls.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not stop charge them cut through the Tier D'al&quot; Mildaien shouted to be hear over the sounds of battle coming from behind. &quot;We cannot help those behind we must press forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Niivag.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Farging&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think they'll make it&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't say, but if they don't I call dibs on the dragons horns&quot;  His tone was jovial considering the circumstances but they both knew they would be hard pressed to survive if Mildaien and I failed in our task.<br>
<br>
&quot;The dwarves sing loud and strong they will keep the ogers from our flank fight on my brothers and sisters&quot; I had to yell to be heard over the screams of the dieing and ducked an overhead strike from a Tier D'al's flail.<br>
Korizon opened a hole down the middle of their ranks and although normally fatal to alow yourself to be flanked in battle we needed the chaos to keep the normally lethaly organized Dark elves off ballance.<br>
We were moving well the Dark elves were falling and we were taking only minor wounds then Bistia stopped moving.<br>
<br>

danced of off the surface of the crystal making flicking shadows move with lift like purpose.  It added to the already forboding design of the room.  Slender dark hands roamed the surface of the crystall not touching it but shaping the swirling mists moving them to reveal the battle raging.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are trapped M'ilord&quot; the seer cackled. &quot;Even now your warriors move to finish the elves and thier barbarian comrads. I am sure as an added bonus once they are finish with them they will turn to the dwarves and halflings&quot;.<br>
<br>
He sat cold and unmoving showing no outward sign that he had even heard the seers words.  His focus was on the battle and his mind was lost in visions of ascention.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you keep that warrior from moving, you must hold him the others will not leave him behind&quot;. he sounded almost frantic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes m'ilord, I can hold him so long as the braziers burn&quot;.<br>
<br>
He threw his head back and laughed... &quot;Can you feel it Tunare,  Can You,  your end is near all mother but first you will witness the death of your champions then your children and then you will die&quot;. he laughed for quite some time...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Form up around Bistia... fight defensively let no one flank him.&quot; I shouted commands though my throat was long since raw.  We had stopped our advance and the Tier D''al were regrouping preparing to move on our position but we could not go on.  Bistia had stopped moving at first I thought twas mearl to pick a weaker point in the darkelves line but when I looked down at his feet the awfull truth was revealed.<br>
His boots ripped open and long dark tendrills reached out and down burrowing into the stone itself. The stuff moved up his legs binding them together till it looked as though he was half man half tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;What scorcery is this&quot; I screamed..<br>
<br>
&quot;That is exactly what it is&quot; Mildaien interjected &quot;We must hold here if we can untill the small folk can reach us to strengthen our line&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no time for that&quot; Bistia growled &quot;the dark elves will charge soon and we cannot hold them.  You must go on we shall hold them off as you flank them and enter the cavern&quot;.<br>
<br>
I of course was shocked to hear these words come from Bistia's mouth.  I had known him since I was a lad training for travel in the north;  he was one of the most decorated hunters of the plains even then with a growing reputation as a warrior.  Never though had I though him capable of seeing the truth of a situation so clear and never did I expect him to take such roll in a battle so large.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Bistia.. we could hold the line for...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No we cannot.&quot; his voice was firm there would be no further debate. &quot;Matrex Mullzy go with them the rest of us shall hold the darkelves as long as we can. Now go&quot;<br>
<br>
I looked long into his eyes and saw a peace there.. I hoped I would meet death with the dignity and valor of the man standing before me now.  We wished them good hunting and sped off towards a small ridge to the rear of the main group and began casting.<br>
<br>
So here we were eight against a dragon... no one said it would be easy...<br>

<br>
decay hung in the air, an oppressive blanket of odor and death clinging to our bodies assulting our senses.  Kobalds were not known to be the most sanitary beast and who knows what the wurms lair held.<br>
Ginweil and Mildaien were at the front their elven vision keen to spot any approaching sentries and more importanly the tribal shamans.  We were of course invisable but we could not chance that these furry beasts could muster the magics to see beyond our illusions, only stealth and cunning would get us to the beast untouched and catch it unawares.<br>
Mildaien raised his hand to signal a stop and motioned me forward.  We were perched high above a pit of lava with a path way leading up and around it, many kobalds worked hides and others practiced throwing crude javalins at surprisingly lifelike dummies.  He pointed to my left to a rough hewn wall where the stones nearly formed a ladder, following his hand I could see it reach nearly to the uppper part of the ledge where it curved up and into another cavern.  Taking his lead I began to climbe the smooth rock surface.<br>
Before long I was feeling very exposed, although invisable, here I was spread out weapons sheathed in a pit filled with carnivorous half dogs and so we all were.  I doubled my efforts reaching high to the ledge but it was still almost a foot away.  Finally out of frustration I lept up and out to the ledge.<br>
Small stones fell away as I fought for purchase on the ledge sending wiffs of smoke up from the bubbling lava and catching the attention of more than a few of the elder Kobalds.<br>
I motioned to Delara to give me her hand and hefted the tiny elf maiden to the ledge with one quick pull;  I repeated this for all but my breathren who are a bit to large to heft even on an empty stomach.  <br>
Then I heard the chanting....<br>
I dove into the tunnels mouth taking the rest of my startled party with me and motioned them to follow quickly once we sorted out who's feet belonged to whom.<br>
Maybe we weren' t seen?...<br>
<br>
&quot;They fight well for barbarians, Not one has gotten tangled up in the other. Truely amazing considering how close they stand and how long their limbs are&quot; Farging had to agree.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never ceases to amaze me&quot; Ghett replied. &quot;But I'm fer thinking they'll be hard pressed if those four ogers get their backsides afor us&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;True enough, shall we ajoin to them then and prolong this little parlay&quot;  Farging added his 2 cp.<br>
<br>
&quot;FORM UP LADDIES,  TIME TO ROLL&quot; the dwarves and halflings mearged into a rolling mass of bodies and did roll right over the nearest trolls and ogers and broke out into a run towards the last bastion of Barbarian and elven defence.<br>
They arrived just in time to prevent the oger assasins from finishing off Herne and Szotack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well met good dwarf&quot; Herne replied. Szotack grunted what was taken as a thanks and continued swinging his might staff.<br>
With the lines shored up the armies of Hate regrouped below the rise preparing another assult.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your men fight well&quot; Bistia said. &quot;You have saved the battle and bought our freinds valuable time to reach the Dragon&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you calling a MAN&quot; a melodic but deep voice called from the dwarven ranks and a stout dwarf with short side wiskers stepped forward.&quot;This Carit is no man and if ye insult me again you'll feel my mace in yer arse&quot;<br>
&quot;Now hush up and lets see what I can do about them legs of yers&quot; and she went into a casting of her own.  Moments later the vines embedded in the ground began to release.<br>
&quot;It will take a while but you'll be free soon enough&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;My thanks good dwarf.. er lady&quot; Bistia bowed and ackward bow and went back to issuing orders to the remaining elves and barbarians.<br>
<br>
and then the sky grew dark..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/unazule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nazule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/31/01 8:05:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Day</span><hr size=1> The Sun vanished from the sky....<br>
<br>
it was like this all across Norrath, and all sentient life felt the first assult of the great casting.  Waves of hatered seemed to pour from the black clouds like a tempest and all but the sturdiest of folk were knoked unconcious.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They hold still their attack, we should fall back to the mountains side by that rock outcropping.  From there we can hold much longer&quot; Niivag pointed to the spot most defendable that they could reach.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I know not what stays their charge but the respite is accepted, Fall back Fall back&quot; Bistia shouted to the  three score remaining warriors. Three score of a force that once numbered over eighty strong,  the price had been great.<br>
<br>
They reached the ledge unhindered but for the wounded they carried with them.  They looked out apon the fifty or so remaining ogers trolls and Tier D'al and saw why they had not attacked.<br>
Rising the above the hills behind them re-enforcements were arriving.  From his vanage atop a large boulder Bistia could make out two colums of ogers and trolls, he estimated their strength at one hundered or so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well there you have it... Damned darkelves have turned this little skirmish into an all out war and forgot to tell us&quot;. Ghett grumbled.<br>
&quot;We are outnumbered five to one now, perhaps we should make a break for the caves as well and try to stem the tide there&quot;. Farging added.<br>
&quot;Aye we could hold them there almost indefinatly assuming we can handle the kobalds from behind us as well&quot; Niivag stated.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;WE must do something now or all is lost.  Do you not feel the hate in the air, can you not feel the evil that comes with this storm.  We must assist my love and his comrads with the slaying of the dragon befor it is too late&quot;  Rezeri had been fighting this battle with the leaders of Kelethin and  Felwithe since the dark clouds first appeared in the skys.<br>
&quot;Dear lady we cannot simply call up our amies and charge off to fight something that we have no proof of and especially leave our homes undefended&quot;. Minister Elran put in.<br>
&quot;You don't understand do you&quot; she chidded &quot;If you do not do just that all that you know will cease to exist, you will have no homes to defend you will not even exist yourself&quot;.<br>
A murmure ran through the court like chain lightning opening up many debates around the chamber.<br>
&quot;So you would have us believe that the very existance of the elven race is at stack and that the information on how to save it was emparted to a lowly ranger&quot;. sarcasm dripped in his voice &quot;Peposterous, and further more you say he is attempting to slay Nagafen with but a handfull of adventurors,  dear lady what PROOF have you&quot;.<br>
From the shadows came a voice.. &quot;She speaks truely as I have seen it all in prophecy&quot; Ajahn stepped forward.  Yes Ajahn the foreign emisary from Odus and long time member of the court of Felwithe was backing Rezeri's claim.  <br>
A stunned silence settled on the room;  Ajahn's prophecies often came true and now this endorsment did sway the council's stand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Emissary,  are you quite sure of this,  we cannot afford to be in error here&quot; Elran spoke in an even tone althought he now did feel fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am, and I have just come from scrying.  Their is a battle raging ev'n as we speak in the Lavastorm mountains.  If you do not go now your champions will surely perish&quot;.  with that Ajahn moved back into the shadows and the room exploded into activity.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sound the alarm, recall the knights and gather all the druids that will come.  We have a battle to fight&quot; Rezeri collapsed into the arms of her attendents. She muttered over and over in her semi concious state. &quot; hold on my love, we are coming&quot;.<br>
