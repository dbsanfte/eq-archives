 Hail!<br>
<br>
Due to my unconscious condition during much of the afternoon, I missed<br>
some of the goings-on in the area of Bergut...his actions, his words, his<br>
final moments. Could someone kindly fill me in. I understand he gave<br>
clues, etc. I'd like to post the complete story...as well as gather the <br>
facts to pass on to the &quot;team&quot; that will be investigating. Anyone and<br>
everyone is encouraged to post their &quot;Wedding Day Memoirs&quot; here.<br>

 Whoever did this must be very well versed in poisons...never seen poison like this, ever. I have a feeling that the Fier'Dal and Koada'Dal are behind this, i was almost incinerated when i was pushed by some unnatural force in Solusek Eye, and afterwards i felt dizzy, but that may have been hunger. i will attempt to find out as much as i can.<br>
Still dizzy....<br>

 Already our alliance with Da Skurge is reaping benefits for all who walk in shadow! My thanks to both the shade of Bergut (ooc-nice work lol!) and to the lovely, yet deadly, Yshaa, for their thouhts and ideas. I have already mentioned to Selilya that I will forego my usual remedies this eve, and seek out Innoruuk's black heart in my dreams in an effort to learn more as well. Also, I have recently spoken with a priest of Ro, a fellow visionary, who thinks he may be able to draw a spiritual impression from the Mistmoor coins. As nothing in life is free, he has demanded teh return of the Ingot of the Fervent from Gull in the Ocean of Tears. It seems that when Gull was but a Harrier in South Karana, he intercepted Jovan, and took the Ingot from him after fierce conflict. Jovan is now a drunk in High Pass, and teh Temple wants teh Ingot returned to its vaults. Unfortunately, the priest there will only speak with me on this matter, so I will need to personally reclaim teh INgot and return it to him. I will be going to Gull's new holdings in the Ocean of Tears tonight (Nov 14) at approximately 6:00 PST if any wish to accompany me.<br>

Time will tell what this Mistwraith is, but be it elf or otherwise, it will rue the fact that it ever existed in our world.<br>

 Your benefits from Da Skurge would be even more apparant had i not any duties in the, uh (ooc: i'm not used to this at all) duties in another plane of reality, something called school. (ooc: i got school, otherwise i would go too, could use that to go with my other 'of the' armor) but, later on, i will be making a dive into the frozen depths to retrieve another ingot, the ingot of the reverant, and a statue stolen by a goblin in Runnyeye Citadel. (yes, my gauntlet and bp quest) a time is unavailable, but I would like to show my appreciation for this fine guild with a fine government by donating both items to the Harvest, consider it a gift (ooc: the bp and gaunts are total crap to me, too heavy and no wis, trust me nospiritous, forget the bp and get the gi, only a 6 AC difference, but, i am offering this to Violent Harvest for free, since cleric armor is such a hassle to sell, besides, I crave adventure! The adrenalline! The rush! Wait, i'm still in ooc! danggit! that would have been good...i AM new at this!) <br>

Your generosity and friendship is certainly a sign of your true place among the Chosen of Innoruuk. Please let me know when you are heading for the Goblin Citadel, as I would thoroughly delight in bringing the word of hate to the infidel that reside there. I would wear the Chestplate of the Constant with great pride, for I believe strongly in recovering these ancient artifacts in teh name of Hate, thus keeping them from teh hands of the unworthy Lightborn.<br>
<br>
Fear not about using terms of loyalty and respect, for only those born to Shadow understand its true meaning. Are we not persecuted across the world for following the true paths? Only our ultimate loyalty to one another and to our Dark Prince will prive us through to teh end.<br>
<br>
I hope that you and your fellows in Da Skurge will call upon us when needed. The Harvest is prepared to mobilize in defense of those who serve the Shadow.<br>

 Many a time I have tried to get fellow skurge members to go to the Citadel, but alas, they are preoccupied with larger targets (i.e. Dalnir, Cazic-Thule, almpost Kaesora, SolA, and the drab Najena) though I would like to offer incentive: in the Citadel not only live the vile goblins, but three Evil Eyes that drop parts for the Centaur's crafted armor, and there are sets of blackened armor down in the depths, I tried to venture alone, but made it only until I found an Evil Eye that proved too much for me.<br>

 Can teh goblins resist two of Innoruuk's faithful priests? I think not. Add then the perilous backing of the Raiser of Bones, and a force to be feared is unleashed upon the world. Like so many places in Norrath, the Citadel shall be claimed for Hate and for Shadow! <br>

<br>
 With thanks to members of Legions of Bristlebane (to a small extent), Cannonn of Da Skurge, Creapiing, Vinar, and Serapis of Violent Harvest, we successfully killed Sludge, the Goblin King, The warlord, and many other goblins, from the battle, we found much blackened iron, awarded to myself, Vinar, Creapiing, and Serapis as well as the Icon of the Constant (i'd have the bp of the constant ready if i didn't accidently vulcanise one of the bars, and when i bought a replacement, i forgot to get it enchanted, now i need to buy one more bar and the bp is yours Violent Harvest) we also got some bones that could be used as weapons by Creapiing, Vinar, and Serapis. All in All, it went very well, and I will get you the Chestplate of the Constant as soon as possible.  <br>
