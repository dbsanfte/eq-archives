I hope it provides some help for new Savages, and suggest that at least a portion of these ideas be placed into the FAQ.)<br>
<br>
This treatise is divided into two parts. The first describes some new discoveries about how styles work. The second describes specific tactics for using those discoveries with hand-to-hand fighting, along with some older tactics.<br>
<br>
<br>
A number of recent experiments with how to make hand-to-hand work most effectively have brought to light some interesting behaviors of styles that can dramatically improve performance with hand to hand. Here's a quick rundown for the new hand-to-hand Savage, or the older hand-to-hand Savage who hasn't been paying attention to the ongoing discussion:<br>
<br>
First, some terminology. Almost all hand-to-hand styles are either positional or reactionary styles. A <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>positional</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> style requires you to be in a specific position relative to the enemy (to the side or behind for hand-to-hand styles). A <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>reactionary</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> style requires you to react to a specific circumstance that occurred on your enemy's last swing before you swing. (i.e. you evade the enemy's attack, then swing at that same enemy with Totemic Fear.) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chain</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> styles are neither positional or reactionary, but might follow a style that is.<br>
<br>
The other important distinction is between &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;imperfect&quot; styling. When you perform a style <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>perfectly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, you've satisfied its prerequisites. If you perform a style without satisfying the prerequisites, it is performed <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>imperfectly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. (This is different from not styling at all, as we'll see below.) Note that you cannot try to do a chain style unless you've tried to do the prerequisite style the previous round.<br>
<br>
Discovery 1: There is good evidence that the Attack bonus (bonus to hit) is applied even when a style is performed &quot;imperfectly.&quot; This means that certain hand-to-hand styles are extremely useful even when you don't do them &quot;just right&quot;. As an example, if you perform the Totemic Fear style without evading first, you still get a High bonus to attack, which means you'll hit more often. You pay the same endurance cost as normal (very low). The damage bonus and Hindered effect do not, however, apply. In general, effects never apply to imperfectly performed styles (but see discovery 3.)<br>
<br>
Discovery 2: If you perform a style imperfectly, and that style is the prerequisite for a chain style, then the chained style may be attempted, and will result in an imperfect performance. This allows you to work your way up a style chain without any perfect styles at all. Note: once you've started the chain imperfectly, the later chain styles will never be better than imperfect.<br>
<br>
Discovery 3: (the thing that makes discovery 2 important) Unlike other effects, the &quot;Hits &lt;n&gt; targets&quot; effect applies <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>even to imperfectly performed styles</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. This means that if you use Totemic Fear imperfectly (i.e. you didn't evade), then use Totemic Wrath imperfectly (because you performed Totemic Fear imperfectly), you still hit three targets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that we've gone over that, here are some interesting tactics based on those styles (I've tested these myself, and find them to be quite efficacious.)<br>
<br>
1) (New Tactic) The &quot;fake anytime&quot; attack bonus style<br>
<br>
Some people have bemoaned the lack of anytime styles in H2H, saying that it really makes it hard to use the weapon spec effectively. Well, it's true that we don't have any good anytime styles with a damage bonus (Wild Call doesn't count, since it degrades our defensive abilities.) But: since we now know that the attack bonus applies even if we perform the style imperfectly, we can use one of the other styles as an anytime style!<br>
<br>
If we look at all of the styles available to hand-to-hand users, we see that the best &quot;fake anytime&quot; style is Totemic Fear--it has a High attack bonus, and a Very Low endurance use. Before Totemic Fear is available, Clan's Call makes the best &quot;fake anytime&quot; style, with Low endurance use and Medium attack bonus.<br>
<br>
Based on this, we can use Totemic Fear as an anytime style. Even when we aren't tanking (although it might be better to get the damage bonus from Clan's Call at times like that, especially if you have an end regen buff.)<br>
<br>
2) (New Tactic) &quot;Fake anytime&quot; as a backup<br>
<br>
The next thing to do is think about how we can use our new &quot;anytime&quot; style as a backup. This is pretty easy: if we're tanking, it makes sense to use Tribal Rage with Totemic Fear as a backup. That way, if we parry we take a hit in the attack bonus (only low), but get a high damage bonus. If we evade, then we perform Totemic Fear perfectly, and get a high attack <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a high damage bonus (excellent!). And if we do neither, Totemic Fear performs imperfectly, and we still at least get a High attack bonus. Since the endurance use is Very Low for both of these styles, it's reasonable to use them continuously while tanking, with no fear of endurance running out. That means we don't need to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>react</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to the evade or parry happening, since we'll already be doing the styles. If they do occur, we win!<br>
<br>
3) (New Tactic) The Imperfect Chain<br>
<br>
This isn't a tactic that will make crowd control classes happy--but in situations without crowd control (I was in a group with no CC where we were fighting 3-mob pulls last night, this worked wonders), we can use the Imperfect Chain technique to get multi-opponent hits.<br>
<br>
Let's say that we're in a group with three tanks, pbt, and some healing, but no real crowd control. The group is fighting pulls mostly by concentrating on one mob and killing them quickly one at a time. In addition, you are high enough level to tank at least two of the mobs yourself.<br>
<br>
Now, in this situation, choose one of the mobs (probably not the one the other two tanks are working on), and perform Totemic Fear on it (perfectly or imperfectly, doesn't matter.) The next swing, switch to Totemic Wrath. You attack all three enemies. These are normal attacks, by the way. There's a chance for weapons to proc, you do normal damage, you get multiple attacks. After that, do Totemic Fear again. (If you have Totemic Sacrifice, you could do that too, and should, since it has No endurance use instead of only Very Low.) Using this technique, you're attacking the targeted mob every round, and the two other mobs as well every other round.<br>
<br>
Since the multi-target styles depend on enemies being in your front fighting arc, be sure your groupmates understand to keep the mobs together and generally in front of you. You can move your mob to them if you need to, but it's better if everybody's working together.<br>
<br>
Note: This technique is addictive. Hitting nine times in a single round is very enjoyable. You may find yourself moaning and considering using Kelgor's Might to aggro a few extra mobs just for fun. (But you probably shouldn't.)<br>
<br>
4) Taunting Call as an anytime style<br>
<br>
A good tactic, especially if you are fighting high-con mobs solo, is to use Taunting Call as an anytime style. This has a High bonus to defense, which means you're more likely to be missed, or to parry or evade (it looks like). I don't use this technique much, personally, because the Medium endurance cost is pretty high. Of course, also use Taunting Call to get mobs off of yourself when you need to. You can hold out for a while against pretty tough mobs using this to let your group get back to you.<br>
<br>
5) Kelgor's Claw as an anytime style<br>
<br>
I've heard mixed reviews on this. The bonus to evade is apparently not terribly obvious. If it works, this is a good way to lead into a perfect Totemic Fear, however. Do a Totemic Fear backed up by Kelgor's Claw. I do not use this technique, again, because of the Medium endurance cost. Also, it seems to me that Taunting Call might be better all-around.<br>
<br>
6) Wild Call as an anytime style<br>
<br>
This is dangerous, and a poor tactic. Try not to use it. While Wild Call is the only anytime style that has a damage bonus, it also has a Medium penalty to defense. Since most of the best hand-to-hand styles depend on good defense, this seems counter-productive. Also, even though style damage scales up with level, since Wild Call is only a level 6 style, the damage bonus is smaller than one might like.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary of situations for these tactics:<br>
<br>
Soloing single mobs in an area with no aggroable mobs nearby:<br>
<br>
Open using Kelgor's Might. Use Tribal Rage backed up by Totemic Fear. If Tribal Rage is performed perfectly (you parried), follow up with the Tribal chain. If Totemic Fear is performed perfectly (you evaded), follow up with the Totemic chain. When following up with chains, use the start of the chain (Tribal Rage or Totemic Fear) with the second style in the chain (Tribal Assault or Totemic Wrath) as a backup. You may be able to get two or three Totemic Fears off in a row before being forced to the second tier Totemic Wrath style, which has only a Medium attack bonus.<br>
<br>
Soloing single mobs in an area with aggroable mobs nearby:<br>
<br>
If there are aggroable mobs nearby, don't use Kelgor's Might unless you're sure you're out of range for adds. Also, be careful with the chain styles, since they hit multiple targets. It might be best not to follow up with chains.<br>
<br>
Soloing two or three mobs in an area with no aggroable mobs nearby:<br>
<br>
Make <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sure</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to open up with Kelgor's Might, and consider bringing up at least one defensive buff. Use the imperfect Totemic Fear, Totemic Wrath chain technique to fight both mobs at once. When the first mob drops, the other one or two should be around half health. You're unlikely to actually get a perfect reactionary technique off here, because you'll have multiple mobs attacking you at once.<br>
<br>
Grouping multiple mobs with CC classes:<br>
<br>
Be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> careful with Kelgor's Might. In fact, you may very well not want to use it at all unless things really start to go bad. Likewise, strongly consider before using any of the multi-target styles (Tribal Assault, Totemic Wrath, Totemic Sacrifice, or Clan's Might.) Make sure you're not going to break mez before you use these to get more damage.<br>
<br>
If you're doing CC at a distance, you can get adds on you to give the CC casters a little more time by using Kelgor's Might as the mobs pass you. This can aggro them if they're in the radius. Make sure your CC classes know you'll be doing this before you try it.<br>
<br>
If you can hit the mobs most of the time, get behind them and use the high damage back or side chains. If you very rarely hit with those styles (it's a high group for you), use Totemic Fear as an anytime style instead, for the High attack bonus.<br>
<br>
Grouping multiple mobs without CC classes:<br>
<br>
Use Kelgor's Might as an opener as the adds rush past you to sweep them in and keep aggro off of your casters. Use the imperfect Totemic chain technique to hit all of them at once.<br>
<br>
Grouping single mobs:<br>
<br>
These are probably pretty high con for you, so use Totemic Fear or Clan's Call as appropriate. (If you can't hit with Clan's Call, use TF.) Try to get off a Kelgor's Fist at the start of the fight if there are no aggro problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope that new hand-to-hand Savages (and perhaps some older Savages) will find these techniques useful in their daily carnage. I certainly have.<br>

The heavy hitting of the zerker combined with the continuous grinding of the savage seems to tear through mobs extra fast.<br>
<br>
I imagine it would be rather disconcerting in RvR as well.  &quot;Ahh!  Do I attack the one pounding me really hard with the big weapon, or the one hitting me 2-3 times every 1.5 seconds?&quot;<br>
<br>
For those who play in other realms, I hear that Flexible and Scythe specs have similar properties (not many anytime styles), so some of the above-mentioned tactics may apply.

Did it really never occur to any of you that this is (was, I should say,) a massive bug, and not a &quot;discovery&quot;. <br>
<br>
I mean really, how could you think that the ability to apply a style effect (hit multiple targets) on a failed style was a unique and interesting design aspect of HTH, and not a bug? As the original post indicates, this is a feature that applies *to no other style effect besides hitting multiple targets*. And yet no one questions why this may be, despite the fact that hitting multiple targets is a relatively powerfull style effect compared to most. Lol.<br>
