Creapiing sat on the edge of the water spraying pebbles into the lake and causing ripples that spread beyond her sight.  “That is my purpose now, to make barely discernable ripples in the world of Norrath,” she reflected.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Memories crowded her mind of her days with the Violent Harvest.  She had felt powerful then.  Her gauntleted hands had felt as if they could crush lightlovers with such ease.  The irony amused her.  That power had been a façade.  Certainly she had wielded one of the best trained, most ambitious, and tightest knit group of Dread Lords ever gathered for Innoruuk’s cause.  And they had been successful, and rewarded by Innoruuk with powers which superceded that of the kings of old.  But the power she had once held in the palm of her hand as the Reaper of the Violent Harvest was simply a small part of that which she now wielded.  Once she had waged war against lightlovers, now she quietly and effectively manipulated events in Norrath, Luclin, and even on the Planes of Power.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Creapiing grinned as she set the hook on a fish and reeled it up and onto the shore next to her.  The slender silver fish was plump and would be very good eating tonight.  She suddenly laughed remembering how many fish she had casually wasted when she had first left the Violent Harvest.  Her one regret had been leaving behind Khasirath.  So much unfinished business lay between them.  Her departure had been a bloody trail that led nowhere.  She had left no clue or even a sign that she still lived.  For days she had been morose without realizing why.  Then one day she realized….Khasirath.  How could she leave him?  What meaning could her life have?   She felt trapped, her position now required total secrecy, and any relationship for one who was part of the Breagan D’aerthe would be exploited to the fullest.   She could not allow Khasirath to be used, or used against her.  Like a dark cloud gathering, her mind formed a plan.   She would fish until she found the perfect fish, then she would snap its neck and make a perfect mold.  The mold could then be used to make chocolate fish.  When these were sent to Khasirath, no one would think it was more than an infatuated lovers fancy.  Only Khasirath in all of Norrath would think chocolate fish was a message from her.  She must have wasted half the fish in the lake to find the perfect one.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Creapiing had pressed the fish into warm wax, taking a mold of its beautiful form.  On her mission to Mistemoore she had stopped by the brownie village to kill a few…they made the most fabulous chocolate.  Finally, she had filled the mold with chocolate to form a perfectly formed fish.  Meticulously she had spent weeks and weeks painting silver scales on each one.   Each eye and fin had taken her a full day.  By the time her basket of fish was ready, Khasirath was missing.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reports thicker then her fist flowed through their encampment.  Weeks went by with scant information.  Finally Khasirath was located.  The Breagan D’Aerthe discussion on the subject had ended abruptly with the decision that Khasirath was better off left where he was at this time---until he was needed.  Creapiing had only managed to wrangle one concession, that she be allowed to find the cure, for the day when Khasirath would need to be found, for the benefit of the Breagan D’Aerthes plans.  Years had flown by, and the cure had been discovered, but yet they waited.  Creapiing could not afford to seem too interested in Khasirath’s well-being, and yet, every person in the Breagan D’Aerthe routinely found his file on their desks.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ten years later Creapiing got her opening.  Khasirath had been found by Tzann…at last, and without any influence from her.   Now she was free to act.  Carefully she took a sheaf of rich red and gold paper, enscribed the cure upon it, and spent hours meticulously folding it into the shape of the lure she had once hooked upon his armor.  He will know, he will be safe, he will be well again, she prayed to herself.  <br>

Part 19.</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel woke suddenly, instantly aware that there was someone standing next to her bed, leaning closer.  There was no time for rational thought, no time to even remember where she was.  Before she could think to scream for help, she flung her blankets at the figure, rolling off the other side of her bed as she snatched up her fungus beast spine dagger from under her pillow.  Her fingers clenched the leather wrapped hilt with panicked strength as she crouched low, using the bed as her shield.  A hissing snarl twisted her lips as the first waking terror congealed into pure focused hate.<br>
<br>
Spine dagger angled offensively, she snapped her body up, poised on the balls of her feet ready to charge in or duck away.  She looked across the bed at the figure and watched as her silken sheet slithered down to the floor off its shoulders.  Her blanket still hung over the person’s face and most of their body, and they made no move to free themselves of the covering.  Tzanntiel blinked quickly, her eyes wide to draw in the dim light as she watched.  The figure did not move at all, and made no sound.  The hairs along Tzann’s naked arms and shoulders prickled as she stared, waiting for some reaction.  There was absolutely none.<br>
<br>
Quickly Tzann sprang onto the bed, stepping closer with her dagger ready to strike.  When the person did not react again, she reached out, grasping the blanket.  As she pulled it back, every muscle in her body tensed, preparing to drive her weapon right into the figure’s gut at the first sign of hostility.  The blanket fell away to reveal Vhalshae in her plain robe, standing as still as a marionette on its stand.  Her short white hair was tousled from the blanket and her own pillow, and Tzanntiel could see how wide dilated her eyes were.  Even now, she did not react in any way to where she was, or what was happening.<br>
<br>
Tzann tossed her dagger onto her pillow as she stepped down from the bed, reaching for her sister’s shoulder.  Vhalshae turned to face her awkwardly, her head turning more slowly than her body, lolling on her neck as it came back in line.<br>
<br>
“Vhal?  Are you ok?” Tzann whispered, reaching up to touch Vhalshae’s cheek.  Her skin was icy chill and smooth.  Tzann could almost swear there was a thin layer of ice over her pale flesh.<br>
<br>
At the soft touch, Vhalshae’s head snapped up, her eyes meeting Tzann’s piercingly.  Vhalshae’s mouth opened slackly, and an inhuman sigh left her.  Then she spoke slowly, and it was not her own voice, but a chorus of voices, deep and resounding, harsh and hissing.  The voices spoke in Elder Teir`Dal, their words pouring from Vhalshae’s motionless lips.  “The Eyes behold the Path, yet fill with doubt.  Hate is not pleased by hesitation.  Thaw the Sword.  Free the blade.  Serve Me well.”<br>
<br>
Vhalshae stood a moment longer, swaying unsteadily as the last words rang in the air.  Suddenly she crumpled to the floor, as if the strings that controlled and supported her had been severed all at once.  Tzann knelt beside her, landing heavily on her knees as she reached for her sister.  The younger woman’s breathing was rapid and weak, her heart racing.  Slowly her skin warmed in Tzanntiel’s hands, but she would not respond to her gentle shaking and pleading whispers.<br>
<br>
Looking down, Tzanntiel saw something clenched in her sister’s fist.  Prying her fingers open gently she retrieved the page of notes she had given her.  Vhalshae’s grip had been so tight that her nails had torn through the thin paper, drawing blood from her palm that stained the page.  Tzann sighed deeply as she set the page on the floor.<br>
<br>
After trying to rouse her for a few minutes, Tzanntiel gave up.  She scooped Vhalshae up in her arms and carried her back to her own room.  Laying her on the narrow bed, she tucked the blankets around her tightly.  Vhalshae’s breathing had relaxed some, and her skin wasn’t as cold as it had been.  Tzanntiel stood there watching her for a while, wondering at the price her sister must pay for the gifts the Father had given her.<br>
<br>
Slowly Tzann returned to her room, and put her sheet and blankets back on her bed.  She sheathed her fungus beast spine and slid it back under her pillow with a soft sigh.  The crumpled note on the floor caught her eye and she stooped down to pick it up. Sitting on the edge of the bed she smoothed it out and looked at the list yet again, marred by her sister’s blood.  As she stared at the page, something seemed odd.  She frowned as she tried to puzzle it out.  Suddenly she realized that her sister’s blood formed a rough image of the Elder Teir`Dal rune for ‘truth’.  Tzann blinked for a moment, sitting straighter.<br>
<br>
Without another thought, Tzann tossed the bloodstained page in the hearth, and quickly donned her armour and gathered her things.  She left House S`Therik without another word to anyone.  She had suppliers to see.<br>
