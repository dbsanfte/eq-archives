<br>
Berserker Patron god: Modi the arch-god of the Norse pantheon, and especially of battle. Berserkers have the ability to drive themselves into a battle rage, which gives them tremendous offensive power. When in this state, they shapechange into bear-man form and fight without thought of personal safety. Kobolds, while fierce, do not have the size necessary to do this god justice. <br>
<br>
Reality <br>
<br>
The lightly armored, dual wielding tank of midgard. We wade into battle with little defense, and have less offensive power then either of the other realms heavy tanks (who have better defenses as well). We have no defenses against archers (no shield spec, weak armor), and often die very quickly in battle, yet do not do enough damage fast enough to catch up with them. Currently we also cannot turn into bears for more offensive power, as shapeshifting is not yet implemented in its full form (rat-form doesnt count). <br>
<br>
The good: <br>
<br>
1) We are a decent class to play for PvE, and can reliably solo yellow con monsters <br>
2) We can use a hammer in one hand, and an axe in the other, giving us 2 damage types per round <br>
3) At lower levels (below 25) frenzy works well to get us out of hard spots <br>
4) At reasonable RvR levels, we can get enough abilities to reduce the effects of CC on our class <br>
<br>
The Bad: <br>
<br>
1) At higher levels Frenzy is less a help, then a hindrance, as we lose more defensive ability then we gain in offensive ability <br>
2) Our damage doesnt scale as well as other classes, at higher levels, others in our realm, and outside our realm can do more damage. <br>
3) We must use reactionary styles to do competitive damage, yet frenzy will not allow us to use those styles, effectively ruining frenzy. <br>
4) Relying on a 3 part style chain in RvR with lag (ravager, atrophy, scathing blade), is VERY VERY difficult <br>
5) STILL waiting on shapeshifting <br>
6) Charge cannot be used on enemy's from your own realm on the PvP servers, and charge gives no benefit over sprint if the person is buffed by a shamen. <br>
<br>
Suggestions: <br>
<br>
1) Left Axe style effects are being broken by the hit of the left hand axe, except for frosty gaze (level 39 style). This needs to be looked at by the style team <br>
<br>
2) Aurora Borealis (50th Left Axe style) works only when the MOB/opponent parries your right hand attack (versus left), this MUST get fixed. This style is very rarely used, and does not do enough damage to compensate for its difficulty. This should be made into a followup style to Doublefrost, or damage increase of 15-20%. <br>
<br>
3) Please add shapeshift, with corresponding bonuses (maybe sniff out stealthers?) <br>
<br>
4) Still waiting on at least a timeline for shapeshifting <br>
<br>
5) Our &quot;unique&quot; realm ability being a style that is on a timer is near useless, and to make matters worse we suffer a major damage penalty if we dual wield!! This MUST be fixed, as its a direct insult. We would prefer a new ability, possibly an &quot;Inspired Frenzy&quot;, which would always crit for 80-100%? <br>
<br>
6) Doublefrost needs to have its endurance usage reduced, as its far too high considering it is only a small upgrade in damage to our snowblind style. Naturally we would prefer doublefrost to be put back to pre 1.5 state. An alternative would be to increase its hit bonus. <br>
<br>
7) Berserker Epic armor goes well beyond the str stat cap, can you please check it and convert the extra str into slash/crush resist? Could you also change its appearance to more of a &quot;classic berserker&quot; style, as in bear robe, with a bear skull for the helm, etc. Similar to your painting displayed at loading time. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Defenders rage/revenge make the other realms melee styles look silly, please give similar damage styles to the dual wielding tanks (zerk, merc, bm). Possibly do this class code (automatically given free at a certain level) so as not to overpower assassins and rangers (i.e. do NOT tie it directly to our styles) <br>
<br>
9) Increase the speed on the Charge realm ability to at least sprint +20%, otherwise its useless if buffed by a shamen. <br>
<br>
10) Add working effects to our styles (namely icy brilliance, and aurora borealis) similar to assassin poisons (i.e. snare, debuff, etc) <br>
<br>
11) Sword zerks have no slow high level swords to use, please change the level 51 1h sword to 4.0 speed to match the cleaver <br>
<br>
The 3 biggest problems berserkers currently have are: <br>
<br>
1) Cannot catch fleeing opponents, or close with a ranged attacker fast enough. Increasing speed on charge would fix this. <br>
<br>
2) Strength soft cap of 300 is easily reached by trolls(weaponskill no longer increases past that point), Please increase soft cap to 350 and hard cap to 400. This is an issue for all viking classes. <br>
<br>
3) Frenzy is almost useless after level 40 due to the much higher defense loss at those levels. Many suggestions have been made about modifying this ability including the following: <br>
A)Frenzy V - May Evade while Frenzied <br>
Frenzy VI - May Parry while Frenzied <br>
Frenzy VII - &quot;Mind control&quot; spells (i.e. mez) no longer affect you while Frenzied <br>
<br>
B)Allow hits during frenzy to go through bladeturn <br>
<br>
C)Lose defense ability on a sliding scale, so that at level 50 you have 50% of your defensive ability. <br>
<br>
D)Use level to raise the floor on the crit damage done while frenzied,i.e. at level 50 your crits range from 50-100% <br>
<br>
E)While frenzied our AF goes up by 2x our level (i.e. at level 50 it would be a 100 af buff). This would simulate the historic accounts of berserkers not feeling the weapons hit them. <br>
<br>
Many other ideas have been posted, most of which are very good, many of which are variations of the above. 100% of zerks do seem to agree frenzy at higher level is not worth the trouble, unless you are fighting a stunned opponent who cant fight back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=14.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7>Team Lead Reports</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
