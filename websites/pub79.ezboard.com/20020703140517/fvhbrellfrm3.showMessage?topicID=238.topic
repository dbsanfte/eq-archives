The rain would quickly run down into the padding beneath her armour, and under normal circumstances be soaked up.  This time, however there were doubts.<br>
<br>
The blood, sweat, and grime was literally building up everywhere on her.  The leather bindings of her armour had started to mildew, even as the shine to her plate armour faded.  Her hair, usually brushed and soft, was now matted and muddy.  The brief attampts to brush the tangleburrs out, had only succeeded in entangling more of her snowy locks.  Eyes that could normally cut deeply into the soul were red-rimmed and haunted.  This was how a warrioress looked after weeks of feral solitude.  The long nights spent in ambush and her relentless campaigning were taking their toll.<br>
<br>
Her exile had been no real surprise.  Her rebellion was sure to result in it.  However, once the truth was known, surely she would be welcomed back.  Praises would be hung to her name, as she deserved.  As always, she had stayed loyal to the Fathers will.  No matter the cost to be payed.  <br>
<br>
Days came and went, still no summons came.  The much awaited messenger, in the livery of one of the houses of Neriak, was not to be found.  With the passing of each day  Faeolin, once Myrmidon of the Empire and Dread Overlord of the Violent Harvest, fell deeper into dispair.<br>
<br>
If she were to identify pity by name, she would have pitied herself as her thoughts turned to how far she had fallen.  No longer, would they speak her name with reverence and fear.  By now, it was most likely a curse if spoken at all.  <br>
<br>
As she moved through the overgrowth to her destination, all thoughts turned to the events to come.  For most military minds, an ambush every night in close proximity to the last was pure folly.  It would only be a matter of time before a counter-ambush was planned.  Faeolin had already allowed herself to be attacked, she had welcomed it even.  So much the easier for her to destroy them.  Only once had she been forced to withdraw, and that because a patrol of Feir'Dal had come to investigate the screams.  <br>
<br>
Oh, how she enjoyed the screams.  If she must suffer, then so should the House of Mistmoore.  The pain she dealt was nothing to the agony of her humiliation.   With that single purpose, she had begun taking scalps before ending the lives of her undead targets. <br>
<br>
Tonight though, she was not content to take them as they passed.  That the manor itself was being rebuilt, only proved how ineffective she had been.  Tonight, as many times before, she would enter into the castle proper and wreak her vengeance.  This time though, she would be totally and completely alone.<br>
<br>
The rustle in the foliage was almost indescernable, lost to the sound of the falling rain.  Her weapons readied, she settled herself down to wait. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ufaeolin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faeolin</A> at: 3/26/02 6:55:20 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=238.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=238.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=238.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=238.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=238.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=238.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
