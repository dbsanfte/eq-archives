Part 16.</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel walked into the apartment in Shadow Haven with a spring in her step.  She found Shaede in the small kitchen eating her lunch.  Smiling, Tzann tossed her pack to the floor and sat down in an empty chair.  Shaede blushed as she smiled at her.<br>
<br>
“It’s good to see you again, Tzann,” Shaede said.<br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled, “I’m glad to see you again too.”  She opened her pack and pulled out a scrap of parchment and a quill, and quickly wrote down the name ‘Archerius Talnathian’, then pushed the parchment next to Shaede’s plate.<br>
<br>
Shaede looked down at it and asked, “What is this?”<br>
<br>
“My best lead so far.  I’ve heard this Erudite was an artificer who specialized in temporal magics.  I need you to go and find out everything you can about him for me.  It’s possible in his research and works we’ll find some information about disabling items like that collar.  It may be hard to find, as he lived a long time ago, but I need you to find everything you can,” Tzann said, her eyes all but glowing with excitement as she watched Shaede’s face.<br>
<br>
Shaede’s smile was warm and hopeful as she folded the parchment and tucked it into her newly repaired robes.  She looked like a new woman compared to what Tzann had found in Torsis.  Her hair was clean and freshly trimmed, her skin soft and radiant.  “I’ll get right to it, Tzann,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, pet,” Tzann purred.  She stood up and walked around behind Shaede’s chair, leaning down to wrap her arms around the Mage’s shoulders.  Shaede ran her hands gently across Tzann’s wrists, tilting her head forward.  Nuzzling into Shaede’s hair, Tzann kissed the back of her neck.  “You are simply too beautiful for words,” she mumbled, leaning over more to press her cheek against Shaede’s ear.<br>
<br>
Shaede blushed so deeply that Tzann could feel the heat against her cheek.  “I… I should go get started.  I want to help you every way I can,” Shaede whispered.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel hugged her tightly for a moment, brushing her lips against Shaede’s cheek.  “You are right, beautiful pet.  I may have to go out again, but once you find what you can, bring it back here and wait for me.”<br>
<br>
Once Tzann let her go, Shaede got up and grabbed her things, pausing only to give Tzann a quick kiss before she was out the door.<br>
<br>
Checking through the window to be sure the Mage was out of sight, Tzann let out a sigh.  The name was a red herring she’d made up by scrambling up a name she’d overheard someone say in the Bazaar.  But it would keep Shaede busy for a few days, and out of the apartment.  Though she was bound to Tzann now, she still didn’t feel she could trust Shaede completely.  At least it would make Shaede feel like she was being useful.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel had gone back to the Echo Caverns and seen her Shadow Knights the day before.  It had taken all day to properly reward them for guarding her boxes, and to explain to them what she wanted them to do.  She grinned mischievously as she thought about it, grateful as always for her ability to heal quickly.<br>
<br>
About an hour after Shaede had gone, Tzann went to the apartment door, and took her time propping it open.  Grabbing a broom she swept the floor, brushing the dust out onto the streets, as almost everyone in the city did.  Leaving the door open for fresh air, she went into her bedroom and shut the door.<br>
<br>
“It’s safe now,” Tzann said with a grin.<br>
<br>
One of the Shadow Knight brothers appeared, holding one of Tzann’s trunks in his hand.  He grinned widely and set it down on the floor, walking over to hug Tzann tight.  “Just as you ordered, Mistress Bloodthorne.”<br>
<br>
Tzann curled her fingers into the man’s wild hair as she kissed him deeply.  He hugged her so tight it almost hurt, but she didn’t complain.  One of his legs nudged between her thighs and she chuckled.  “Still hungry after yesterday, pet?”<br>
<br>
He laughed deeply and nodded, “Always.  My brother will be here in a few minutes.  He took a different route, just like you said.”<br>
<br>
Tzann smiled brightly, “Excellent.”  She pulled the big man’s head down for another deep kiss before pushing him away gently.  “Stay out of sight, I’ll open the door for him.”<br>
<br>
The Knight stood against the wall beside the bedroom door obediently while Tzann opened it.  She lay down on her bed, pillowing her head on one arm as she lay on her side, watching the man beside the door.  He stood still, watching her with dark and dangerous eyes as she spread her legs teasingly, her one leg hanging off the bed, the other foot flat on the bed, her knee bent.  She slid a hand languidly along her inner thigh as she waited, watching the desire raging against the Knight’s control in his eyes.<br>
<br>
A short while later the man beside the door nodded to Tzanntiel and she got up and closed the door.  Almost immediately the second brother appeared, setting the trunk he carried next to the first one.  He looked almost exactly like the first brother, except his hair was a tiny bit longer.  Even their armour and weapons matched exactly.  Not many could tell them apart easily.<br>
<br>
Both men embraced Tzanntiel roughly, and she chuckled as she encouraged them, kissing them and teasing them with her hands.  She so loved being trapped between the two of them, yet still being the one in control.  She let them play for a while, reveling in the bruising roughness of their embrace.  Finally she pushed free enough to speak, “Let’s go take care of the last box, my pets.  I don’t like the thought of it being left unguarded.”<br>
<br>
Reluctantly the two men pulled away, nodding in tandem.  “Whatever you want, Mistress Bloodthorne,” one said.<br>
<br>
The two Knights called their spells of shadows to hide themselves, and followed Tzanntiel as she got her pack and cloak.  She locked the door after them and led the way back to Echo Caverns.  Halfway to the hidden entrances she slid into her own kind of shadows, certain of the fact that her pets would be able to keep track of her.  In truth she wasn’t that concerned about the last trunk.  The Rogue guild leader would be watching the Knights’ house.  Anyone who was foolish enough to even knock on the door would no doubt be dead before they realized what had happened.<br>
<br>
Once they were past the last hidden door, the Knights dropped their shadows, and led Tzanntiel into their house.  She stepped into sight once the door was closed.  One of the brothers opened a secret space under the floorboards and pulled out the last trunk.  “We wanted to be certain it was as safe as possible while we were both away,” he explained proudly.<br>
<br>
It was time again for Tzanntiel to take the lead as they returned to the safety of the shadows and left the outpost of thieves.  The two Knights followed her closely.  One carried the trunk while the other walked with his weapons drawn.<br>
<br>
Any city requires a way to dispose of wastes.  While above ground, some small villages can get away with trenches and dumps, underground cities require more complex measures to ensure the city will stay clean.  And this means sewers and catacombs.  When Tzanntiel had found her place within the outpost, she had learned all she could of the sewers from the other Rogues who lived there.  Shadow Haven was a big city, and its sewers were very complex.  Rogues and other practitioners of Dark Arts had improved on them over the years, adding their own access points and hidden areas into the near-endless maze of tunnels and aqueducts.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel led the Knights confidently into the maze of tunnels, following memory and instinct, and the occasional subtle way-marks to one of the more remote hidden rooms.  The trio stepped out of the shadows at Tzanntiel’s quiet order.  The brother who carried the trunk put it down carefully in one corner of the empty chamber while the other brother searched the room carefully to be sure there was nothing around to disturb them.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled at the two Knights as she watched them.  “You two are simply incredible.  I can never thank you enough.”<br>
<br>
One brother chuckled deeply as he grabbed her from behind in a fierce bear hug.  “You always know how to take care of us, Mistress.  We’re happy to return the favor.”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel arched back to run her fingers through his hair while his brother came up in front of her, pressing her back roughly into his brother’s arms as he kissed her hungrily.  Tzann purred deeply as she wriggled between them, trying to caress and tease them both at once.  Their hands seemed to be everywhere, exploring her body, creeping under her light armour.  She grinned, moaning softly as one bit at the back of her neck.  She really didn’t want to make them stop just yet.  But she knew she had to, there was far too much to be done.<br>
<br>
“I really have to get to work, my pets.  I’ll go with you back to the edge of the outpost, but then I’ve got to go.  I’ll stop by your place as soon as I can, and show you again how much I appreciate your help,” she smiled, running her hands across their breastplates.<br>
<br>
They each let out a deep sigh at almost the same moment, and Tzann chuckled softly.  “I really am sorry I don’t have the time to play today, pets.”<br>
<br>
“We understand,” one of the brothers said as they both cast their shadow spells again.  Tzann slid into hiding easily and led them back to the outpost by a different route than they had come in.  She knew the two of them didn’t know the catacombs very well, and she wanted to do all she could to ensure they wouldn’t find their way back to the room the trunk was left in.  Not that they had any interest in the trunk itself, of course.  But their delicious distractions were hard to refuse.<br>
<br>
After parting ways with the Knight brothers outside the outpost, Tzanntiel hurried back through the twisted sewers to the hidden room.  The trunk had remained undisturbed, as she expected.  Very few went this deep into the catacombs for any reason.  Tzann picked up the trunk and slipped back into the shadows.<br>
<br>
It took her almost a half hour to get to the small chamber she had found during her own explorations.  It wasn’t as large as the chamber she had the Knights bring the trunk to, but it was far more secure.  Only one passage led into it, and it was very hard to reach.  Tzann could also tell the small chamber had been undisturbed a long time, no doubt forgotten by whoever had built it.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel opened her pack and laid out her bedroll against the far wall.  She lit a small lantern and set it on the floor beside the trunk.  Carefully Tzanntiel checked her tell-traps, disabling each one after verifying that it hadn’t been disturbed.  All of them were just fine, and she let out a sigh of relief as she finally un-strapped and unlocked the box.<br>
<br>
Opening the trunk, Tzanntiel’s breath caught in her throat, her blood chilling in her veins.  Khasirath was there, just as she had left him, but tucked in next to him was a basket of woven rushes dyed black.  Tzann’s hands trembled as she leaned closer, checking to see if there were any traps attached to the basket.  Part of her couldn’t accept what she was seeing.  The trunk had been well guarded and the traps hadn’t been broken.  No one should have been able to do this!<br>
<br>
Finally certain that it was safe, Tzanntiel picked up the basket and looked into it.  It was lined with a dark red cloth, and inside were a dozen chocolate fish.  Each one was almost twelve inches long, and looked something like a trout.  They were so perfectly detailed that she could see each scale along their sides.  In the mouth of one fish hung a fishing fly.  After a moment Tzann realized it wasn’t a real fly, it had been made of red paper with a golden pattern on it.  Carefully she pulled it free, and looked at it more closely.  It was one piece of paper, folded cleverly into the shape, and Tzanntiel could see faint indentations on the paper, as if there was writing on the inside.<br>
<br>
Tzann set the basket and paper fly aside quickly, returning to the trunk.  Carefully she lifted Khasirath out and laid him on her bedroll.  She looked him over carefully.  He looked about the same as she’d last seen him, and she was relieved to see the bites on his wrist were mostly closed now.  It didn’t look like anything had been done to him, and she could tell his condition was the same as before.  The thick collar gleamed dully in the feeble light of her lantern.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel tucked the blankets and furs around her brother carefully, and then returned to the basket.  She sat down on the stone floor and picked up the paper fly. Carefully she began to unfold it, a frown of concentration creasing her brow as she carefully puzzled out the intricate folds so as not to tear it.  Finally she had it undone, and carefully smoothed the thin paper against her thigh.<br>
<br>
Inside the paper were words in a language Tzanntiel had never seen before.  The words were mixed with strange symbols that she felt had to be related to magic in some way.  The script was tight, precise, every symbol and letter carefully crammed onto the small square of paper.  Tzann stared at the paper, shaking her head in confusion.  What could this mean?  And who could have put it here?<br>
