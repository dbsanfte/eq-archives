Part 17.</span><hr size=1> Standing on the stone circle that marked the portal to the Faydark forest, Tzanntiel was lost in troubled thoughts.  Before she left the catacombs under Shadow Haven, she had set every trap she knew in the narrow passage leading to the room where her brother slept.  At the crumbled tunnel entrance she had carefully scribed the tiny way-marker for ‘bad air’.  In the sewers pockets of gas that could steal a man’s breath or burst into fire were common and Rogues tended to try to warn each other where not to go.  She’d also been careful to make it seem the mark was old, and that the passage was as unused as she had found it originally.  It was very deep in a remote section of the catacombs, and normally she would think all her precautions had been enough.  But since she had already been proven wrong once in that respect, she was full of doubts.<br>
<br>
For a while she thought that perhaps she should just break down and bring Khasirath right to House S`Therik.  No one from outside the House could harm him there.  But there were plenty within the House that might want to take advantage of his condition.  She had not worked this hard and this long only to give him over to death.  Especially not when she felt this close to a solution.<br>
<br>
The writing was meaningless to her, but someone had gone to great lengths to get it to her.  She prayed silently to the Father that it would be the cure she was seeking.  Now she just had to find someone to translate it.  She had a perfect idea of who could do it, but he was never an easy one to deal with.  This was someone she had no chances of controlling, or binding.  She would have to play her cards just right to get something useful.<br>
<br>
For the twenty-fourth time since she had left the catacombs, Tzanntiel smoothed her cloak around her shoulders, her fingertips grazing the edge of the small note in it’s hidden pocket along the edge of the cloak.  Her weapons were in their sheaths at her belt, close to hand.  She sighed in relief as the stone circle sprang to life suddenly, blue and white energies enfolding her, carrying her to a momentary black void before she blinked, and was standing within the ancient forest of the light elves once more.<br>
<br>
Walking slowly, Tzanntiel wandered under the ancient pines, letting the sounds of the forest surround her, following the faintest prickling sense to what she sought.  The small creatures hardly took notice of her stealthy form whispering through the trees; even the fairies, who loathed Teir`Dal, fluttered by on sparkling wings without bothering her.<br>
<br>
Every tree in the Faydark seemed to live an enchanted life.  They grew straight and tall, their boughs so thick that only the mistiest green twilight shone through from the sun far above.  Tzanntiel walked through them, looking at each one she passed.  Finally she stopped, and walked closer to one particularly large pine.  Its roots were old and deep, and its branches disappeared into the gloomy green of the upper canopy.  Under the circle of the old tree’s branches, Tzanntiel knelt down.  She was not within arm’s reach of the thick trunk, but she was close enough to feel the knees of some of the giant tree’s roots under her shins.  The air buzzed with unmistakable slow, lazy snores.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel reached into her pack and pulled out an old glass wine bottle.  The glass was smoky grey, its surface etched with delicate runes and scrolling patterns of intertwined dragons.  Slowly, as if performing some unspoken ritual, Tzanntiel pulled the cork free, and began to pour out the thick red blood from the bottle onto the ground below the tree.  She moved her arm slowly, spreading the blood over the roots as far as she could without rising from her kneeling position.<br>
<br>
The old pine began to stir faintly, as if a breeze ruffled its branches.  But there was no wind to be felt.  Tzanntiel smiled.  “Greetings, old one,” she said softly.<br>
<br>
The whole tree suddenly seemed to awaken, the stout wood of its trunk creaking deeply as its branches stretched upwards to the sky.  “Hmm, who is here?” came a mumbling voice.  Then suddenly the tree roared, “I AM THE GREAT WISE TREE!!  WHO GOES THERE!?”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel sat quietly for a moment, watching in wonder as the tree stretched and shivered.  The sound of its needles hissing against one another was almost hypnotic.<br>
<br>
More quietly, the tree muttered, “Mmmm… Whomever it is comes with some good drink….”<br>
<br>
Smiling, Tzanntiel looked up into the tree’s branches, and spoke respectfully, “Simply a young Rogue in search of wisdom, great one.”<br>
<br>
Growing still once more, the tree said, “Come closer… My eyes aren’t that good anymore.”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel stood up, leaving the old bottle sitting on the grass.  With a measured step she drew closer to the thick trunk, stopping barely two paces away from it.  Suddenly a pair of pale blue eyes opened in the rough bark, a little bit above Tzann’s own eye level.  The tree’s needles shook with what seemed to be a chuckle, “Ah, I know you…” it said slowly.  “You are… You are… the Teir`Dal… Forlourne’s friend, aye?”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel bowed her head, a slight smile on her lips, “Yes, I know Forlourne well, old one.”<br>
<br>
The eyes in the tree slowly drifted, looking over Tzann, then seeming to focus on something past her left shoulder.  Tzann did not turn to look, keeping her head slightly bowed.<br>
<br>
“Yes… yes, as do I… We had our… hmm… arguments,” the tree said slowly, it’s gaze trailing off through the still forest.  “Where is that pup, anyways?”<br>
<br>
“I am sorry to hear that you and Forlourne have argued, wise one.  Last I saw him was on Luclin, in Shadow Haven,” Tzanntiel answered quickly.<br>
<br>
The tree stretched again, its trunk creaking like a ship’s mast.  “Ah, the moon.  Foolish travelers….” Its words faded off like a breeze into incomprehensible muttering.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel chuckled softly, still studying the tree through her lashes as she kept her head bowed.<br>
<br>
The blue eyes focused sharply on her once more.  “Soo… I am sure you did not come merely for my lovely company, child…”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel lifted her eyes, taking in the full view of the tree’s massive arching branches, the arrow straight strength of its trunk.  She smiled as she nodded appreciatively.  The tree’s eyes turned up to follow her gaze.  “You are quite impressive to behold, in truth.  But I was hoping you would be able to help me with a little something, if you have the time.”<br>
<br>
The eyes traced over Tzann’s face slowly, “You like my branches?  I know of an ancient art… to make trees beautiful.”<br>
<br>
Tzann met the tree’s eyes, smiling softly.  “Indeed?”<br>
<br>
The eyes moved up and down, as if nodding, “Aye, aye… I have the time, especially for one who brings such gifts.”<br>
<br>
Grinning warmly, Tzanntiel bowed her head to the tree, “It should be an easy thing for you.  I know how very wise you are.”<br>
<br>
The tree’s eyes wandered off again, into the misty spaces between the trees.  “Aye, it is an ancient art, lost to this world… My branches cut as angles… My roots nurtured like none others….” Its soft voice trailed off to silence for a moment.  Then it returned its attention to Tzanntiel.  “And you are buttering me up… I like that too,” it muttered softly.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, as if she had blinked, the tree was gone.  Standing on the dark ground was instead a High Elf man, whose pale eyes were the same as the tree’s had been.  Pine needles drifted down slowly like a green rain from nearby trees that had a moment before been leaning against the forest giant.  With a dreamy smile the man sat down, ignoring the dirt under his robes.  “Sit, sit,” he said with childlike excitement.<br>
<br>
As Tzanntiel sunk to the soft ground, she reached into the secret pocket of her cloak and pulled out the small square of red and gold paper.<br>
<br>
The High Elf sat forward, his eyes widening quizzically, “Hmmm…. What is this?”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel handed him the paper with a small smile.  He took it quickly, his eyes flicking back and forth quickly as he read it.  “Ah, I haven’t seen this in ages… since my days as a guest at Castle Mistmoore… before the undead plagued his walls.”<br>
<br>
“That was quite long ago.  It must have been fascinating to see it before it fell to such ruin,” Tzanntiel said.<br>
<br>
The Elf looked up at Tzanntiel, “It is an ancient form of shorthand.  Something not seen by most… remembered by less… And understood by… me.” He grinned proudly, and Tzann could see the long sharp canines beside his even, gleaming white teeth.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled warmly in appreciation of the Enchanter’s skill at languages, keenly aware of the man’s powers.  She couldn’t let herself forget it for a moment, despite his open and charming demeanor.  Like the winds, his moods could change in an instant.<br>
<br>
“Aye, it was before the great Elven wars as well,” he mumbled softly, his eyes returning to the small page of script.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled brightly, “I knew you would be the one to understand it.”<br>
<br>
Looking up suddenly, he all but shouted, “HA! Understand it?  There is a possibility I wrote this!!!”  Frowning he turned back to the paper, muttering softly.<br>
<br>
Sitting back, Tzanntiel bowed her head, trying to look properly impressed and rebuked.  Her palms itched with the desire to hold her blades, but she quelled it.  This one was easy to offend at times.<br>
<br>
Looking up, the Elf seemed to return from his wandering thoughts.  “Well… These are some powerful ingredients.”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel looked up to meet his eyes, a trill of excitement racing down her spine.  “Ingredients?  For what, a spell?”<br>
<br>
He nodded, his gaze wandering back to the paper.  He traced the runes and symbols with one gracefully pale finger.  “Aye, aye.”  His eyes closed for a moment as he thought silently.  “Spell… aye a spell.”<br>
<br>
Shaking his head suddenly, he met Tzanntiel’s eyes, “It is… Well, bah, let me write this out…  What language do you need it in?” He held out a hand, and began to tick off languages on his fingers.  “Dragon… elder or modern of course… Fae, Elemental…”<br>
<br>
Suddenly he snatched at the air to his right with a hand.  Gripping his fist closed tight he brought it to his mouth and acted like he was popping something into his mouth.  Thoughtfully he chewed at nothing.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel looked down at the ground as she thought a moment,  “Perhaps you could manage to put it in the Dark Speech?  I doubt ye would know the Cant….”<br>
<br>
He grinned slyly, leaning forward.  His voice lowered to a conspiratorial tone, “The Cant?  My dear… I was a Rogue for 500 years…” He winked at her as he sat back, chuckling softly.<br>
<br>
Tzann grinned openly, “Indeed!  I knew there was a reason I liked you.”<br>
<br>
He laughed openly, “HA!  You are a nice one for the betrayers.”  He looked down at his hands, and started in surprise as he saw the page in his hand.  When he spoke it was in the soft sibilant tongue of the Thieves’ Cant, “Oh! Now let me see here…”<br>
<br>
He pulled a parchment and quill from his robes, and began to jot down notes from the page in the chicken-scratch scrawl of the Cant as easily as if it were his native language.<br>
<br>
Sitting back he muttered, still in the Cant, “Well that should be all of it.”  He looked from the page to his notes, peering at them more closely.  “Hmm… Do you know what this is for?”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smirked mysteriously as she met his gaze, “I am hoping it’s an answer to all my current problems.”<br>
<br>
Tilting his head, he switched back to the Common tongue, as Tzann had spoken in, “It is a method of releasing something… Although I do not know what.”<br>
<br>
Tzann nodded thoughtfully, watching as his gaze wandered off again.<br>
<br>
“But your secrets are your own.  I can not ask to know what is not for me.”  His eyes seemed to follow the path of something unseen as it wandered through the forest.  “Or something like that….” He muttered.<br>
<br>
Tzann smiled as she watched him closely, “You are very kind, to be so understanding.  I hope I will be able to repay you some way for this…”<br>
<br>
The Enchanter continued to gaze into the distance as if he had not heard.  “Let’s see… Your secrets are yours….  What is for me to know is mine….  What is not for me is yours, and not mine…” Softly he continued to mutter off different combinations of the words.  Tzanntiel looked down at the papers still in his hands, the quill having fallen to the forest floor forgotten.<br>
<br>
Suddenly he looked up, his eyes focusing again on Tzanntiel’s face.  “Oh?  Oh yes… the favor…  Well, think nothing of it.”  He smiled patronizingly, sitting up straighter.  “It is my pleasure to see you trying to foil ancient magics!” he winked roguishly.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled warmly at the Enchanter as he smiled happily, as a child might.<br>
<br>
Standing slowly, he began to brush the dirt from his robes with the papers still in his hand.  Tzanntiel bit her lip, trying to hide her wince.  She stood up as well, staying a respectful distance from the man.  He began to whistle a simple little tune, looking off into the trees.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel bowed her head to him as she said, “May I have the translation now, wise one?  And the other paper as well, please?”<br>
<br>
Looking up at her with a touch of surprise in his eyes, he said, “Hmm?  What?  Ohhh that paper... of course…” He looked down at his hands and frowned, “Ohhh!!!  It got dirty… Damn Orcs, I always blame the Orcs, see?  They are dirty creatures.”  He handed out the notes and the red paper rolled up together.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel bowed her head again as she took the papers, subtly brushing the dirt off of them as she folded them up and tucked them away into her cloak.  “They are indeed.  Filthy beasts,” Tzanntiel agreed.<br>
<br>
The Enchanter continued on, looking through the trees.  “Aye!!  Hmm, speaking of which… I think Emperor Crush owes me a dance.”  Looking back at Tzann he saw her tucking the papers back into her cloak.  “What is that?” he asked.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled widely.  “I doubt Emperor Crush will be too happy to see you…”<br>
<br>
He laughed aloud, “Bah, he will love me in seconds.”  Again his grin revealed his fangs.  Tzanntiel watched his eyes as he gazed through the forest.<br>
<br>
Smiling, Tzanntiel said, “Indeed he will.  You are very… charming…” She chuckled softly over the ‘charming’ part, throwing the Enchanter a wink.<br>
<br>
He laughed again, “Ha!!  Always a charmer!!’<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled, smoothing her cloak with one hand, her fingertips brushing the pages in their pocket reassuringly.<br>
<br>
