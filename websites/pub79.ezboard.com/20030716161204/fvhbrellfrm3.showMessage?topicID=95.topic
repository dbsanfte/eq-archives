*RP* The Initiate Seeks to become a Disciple.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The young prophet looked over his latest acquisition. The potions he had acquired from the Ebon Mask had done their job - the young Silverstar slept soundly. As he gathered the tools he would require for the upcoming experiments, there was a knock at the door. He went to answer and discovered one of his contacts in the commons. The man was very devout, and had been following the sermons of the young prophet for some time. Every once in a while, he provided some information that he thought the young prophet might find useful. &quot;Yes child, what can I do for you tonight?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have information for you in regards to the one named Xosha X'Tai.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pravdameer had let it be known he was seeking some information on certain things and people, and the young assassin was one of them - he had a job that would require her expertise, but until now he had been unable to find her. &quot;Yes, child? Continue.&quot; <br>
<br>
The man nodded from the shadows and said, &quot;She has been seen in the city again - at the Blind Fish. She will not be there long, but will most likely depart again for more travels.&quot; <br>
<br>
The young prophet nodded and then gave the man the blessings of the Father as he said, &quot;Go now with the power that True Hatred gives, child&quot; The man thanked the young priest for his gift and then hurried off. Pravdameer turned then to seemingly thin air and said, &quot;Well, it seems the time has come, Atoxus. I must speak with this assassin and gain her aid in order to finish the last stage of the task given me to attain the rank of Disciple of Hatred. It should prove...interesting. I wonder just how much she knows of me - and how much I have yet to learn of her. Yes, I know that Atoxus - I was a member of the Shadows of the Blade after all. Yes, I also heard she was associated with House W'Rath, but that is not as much a strike against her as it would be if she were associated with the Traitor. You can't be serious? She is friendly with that one?&quot; <br>
<br>
The young Prophet of Hate smiled a bone-chilling grin as he thought back on his history with that one. &quot;I wonder if she has learned yet that she failed to remove me from the lands of Norrath? Most likely.&quot; The Prophet then looked back at the unconscious form lying on the slab. &quot;Ironic that I should be dealing with a friend of the rogue and a member of her former house at the same time. Granted, this bard is no ranger, but then, our task is not the same this time either. We do not have much time, so I will go to the Fish and approach the young assassin, and then return here to see if I can learn what I need to in order to tend to the issue.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pravdameer nodded, and then secured the door to his chambers within the halls of the Violent Harvest and headed for the Blind Fish. <br>
<br>
As he entered the bar, he saw her sitting at a table looking out the window seemingly absorbed in thought about something or other. Pravdameer approached her table cautiously - he didn't want to startle the young assassin. He was but a few steps away when she said, just under her breath, &quot;It's about time you arrived Priest. I was beginning to wonder how blatant I would have to be before you came out to see me. I understand you have been looking for me?&quot; <br>
<br>
Pravdameer quickly suppressed his surprise, and merely said, &quot;Yes - I understand your services are available. I seek to work with you as a fellow member of the Violent Harvest to eliminate some ankle biter spies from within our fair city. I do not believe I am up to the task alone, as I am a man of peace, not war - I am a healer, not a warrior.&quot; The young prophet smirked at the half-truth of his words, pulled out a bottle of his personal stock of Fish Wine, and poured a glass for each. &quot;I would be happy to answer any questions you might have, child.&quot; He saw a glimpse of the fires of hate flare up as he called her child, and couldn't help but chuckle as he awaited her answer. <br>

Re: *RP* The Initiate Seeks to become a Disciple.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Xosha had been restocking for sometime now. The missive she had received from Selilya having been put off too long, she had decided to get started with the attempt on the Erudite in Kerra Isle. <br>
<br>
She hadn't the least idea where it was, or who this woman was, and what her unholy discrepincy against the Tier'Dal of the Violent Harvest might have been. But truly it mattered not. This killing would be the first step in a long ladder of personal and social assencion fro Xosha, and with her Mentor behind her (Innoruuk keep her soul) and having reunited with her friends a few times, the time had come to start that ascension. <br>
<br>
And so it was the Xosha bartered at the counter in the commons with a food peddler. She sighed and payed the hefty some for a weeks worth of rations and water. The merchant keeping a warry eye on her all the while. <br>
<br>
&quot;Relax, I told you I'm not with the Ebon Mask anymore, it's been years, really!&quot; Xosha sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;All the same rogue,&quot; he spat the words out, &quot;I shall keep my eye on you as you back out, no funny business!&quot; <br>
<br>
Again Xosha sighed. This was really a pain in the ass, it was as if there was some master list of all inductees of her field that circled around the- <br>
<br>
Out of the corner of her eye Xosha saw a small figure, not dressed dark, but rather dressed too plain. Dressed as if to mix in well with the crowd. Unfortunately the manner inwhich he watched her was all wrong, he stood in one place too long, then at Xosha's glance, would turn and talk casually to a vendor, a vendor who would inturn look a little puzzled at the sudden informality. <br>
<br>
Xosha smiled to herself, no, not a killer. Sure Xosha was next to unseen in Neriak nowadays, she doubted there would be any action against her. The gain from killing a little rogue like herself could be only minor, say the coins in her pocket. She would expect agression against her in the dirty streets at Foreign Quarter from the standard ruffians, but certainly not spying. <br>
<br>
Xo walked calmly out of the food shop, and nodded politely to the vendor as a goodbye. He snarled back at her as his farewell. Then she walked to the Blind Fish, took up a booth, ordered Elven Wine, and waited. <br>
<br>
It was a member of her prospective guild that finally approached her. Pradameer, she thought to herself. The name had always been a familiar one to her, something in it ringed of anger and maybe even of treachory. She thought she might need to dislike this one for her past, but try as she might, she could not conjure the reasons why, and so then dismissed it as foolishness. <br>
<br>
She smiled to him and nodded, he smiled to her and did the same, then took a seat and did not order. <br>
<br>
&quot;Lady X'Tai,&quot; he grinned. Pravdameer had a beautiful set of teeth, she thought. It did tend to make is mouth look a tad too menacing though. <br>
<br>
&quot;Prav,&quot; she referred to him informall, on purpose. &quot;I have been expecting you.&quot; <br>
<br>
And thus the gentle parlay and interchange of attack, counter attack, riposte, parry, dodge that would be thier conversation ensued. <br>
<br>
Eventually Xosha was a bit taken aback. This one needed a piece of work done. Surely this cocky finger waggler didn't need her services? She was forced to revaluate her subject. The noted first the newness of his garb. When first she had seen him she picked it up as him wanting to just look good, but now she thought maybe it was new because he hadn't seen enough action to make it old and worn. His face, free of scarring, his staff, only slightly dented. He was wealthy enough to afford a spy, but not the kind of wealth that someone out in Norrath would find killing dragons. <br>
<br>
He ended the conversation with the almost typical now &quot;child&quot; reference. Xosha barred her teeth immediately, and Prav smiled. No, thought Xosha, if he calls me child, it is certainly not due to my station among assassins. I think THIS one calls everyone child. Xosha could feel his burning hate almost across the table. It was likely he called everyone child in an attempt to anger, and in anger somehow lead them to hating him... very tricky this one. <br>
<br>
Xosha leaned back, quieted her face and her body as she had been taught. Extended her palm, spat into it and said, &quot;That'll be five hundred platinum a head Prav,&quot; then cocked her lip in a sneer. <br>
<br>
The magic caster followed suit, spitting in his and clasping hers. <br>
<br>
If nothing better, I am one step deeper into this guild, she thought. Next I think I'll be meeting thier Selilya. Soon as I kill this fool Erudite. <br>
<br>
Xosha bought another round, offered Pravdameer a drink, he smiled politely and shook his head no, Xosha shrugged, and drank.  <br>
