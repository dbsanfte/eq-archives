Hate-It's not just for Tier'Dal &lt;RP: Part 1&gt; <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Maladwen sat in his office. He spun his dirk around on his desk, pondering his defeat at the Danak Shipyards. How had he been so stupid? How was he so careless? Flashbacks of killing the various dragoons, and slaying the giant golems all came back into view. That was a battle he will never forget. <br>
<br>
Looking at his various papers, he shuffled them and placed them in his desk drawer. They murdered his fiance, and they were going to pay. He promised this, no matter what he will get his vengence. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
General Shadowlurker invited the Reaper of the Harvest to his office to speak with her about some items he stole from her guild. She stepped into his office, and he bowed respectfully to her. &quot;Hello Reaper, I have a matter to discuss with you,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
They were obviously enemies from the start, but something...most likely something more professional, stopped them from lashing out at each other. Maladwen began the conversation, &quot;Reaper, I am aware that one of your harvesters have placed a...rather large bounty on my head for stealing two very valuable items from him during my invasion of the Danak Shipyards. Two, weapons, that were in his family for....generations I suppose. I would like to negotiate giving them back, and any other items I stole from you.&quot; He offered her to sit, and she glared at him. &quot;As you wish, you don't have to sit,&quot; Maladwen said. &quot;Here are my terms Reaper, to giving back the items etc.&quot; He pulls an envelope out of his coat. &quot;May I read them?&quot; he said as he drew a letter out of the envelope. <br>
&quot;If you wish,&quot; The reaper said, raising a brow out him. Maladwen began reading: <br>
<br>
I will return the items I have stolen and withdraw my troops from anywhere belonging to the Tier'Dal in result of the following: <br>
<br>
A suit of Tier'Dal crafted armor <br>
The Shadowlurker Family and Friends would be left alone and free of ANY Tier'Dal Harm <br>
I receive 100 platinum hard currency <br>
I receive a sacrafice of two harvesters and one seed.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladwen looked up from his note,&quot;Does this sound unreasonable?&quot; The Reaper seemed infuriated. &quot;Yes, yes it does.&quot; Maladwen smirked, &quot;Excellent.&quot; He looked down and read some more, &quot;Oh, and two or three of these requests may be taken out with a proper cause, blah blah blah. Now Reaper, why is this unreasonable?&quot; <br>
She laughed softly at him, &quot;You amuse me Maladwen.&quot; <br>
&quot;I am an amusing little elf,&quot; Maladwen said with a smile. He could see the Reaper was uncomfortable with this situation. He stepped over to his window...this office had been very special to him, much has happened there. He looked out at the field, stains of blood filled the grass, or so only in his memories. That had been the site of his murdered fiance, the day of their wedding...he will never forget that. <br>
&quot;I am taking this very seriously Reaper, I am willing to give you those items,&quot; he said. The Reaper responded, &quot;Maladwen, those who are too serious are nothing. They are nothing in this life, but god's tools through now, and the next life.&quot; Maladwen smirked, &quot;I am not serious 100% of the time, only on serious topics, like diplomacey.&quot; He turned around. <br>
&quot;and do not think I will be polite, I will never forgive you for murdering her.&quot; She laughed at him. &quot;Maladwen, you accuse an entire race for the actions of one.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladwen cought onto the, unsteadiness of the Reaper of Violent Harvest. &quot;I blame Tier'Dal for their actions. Now, back to the topic, you are not answering my questions.&quot; <br>
&quot;No question has been asked,&quot; Creapiing said. <br>
&quot;I asked why are my terms not reasonable?&quot; he replied. &quot;You should know that one Maladwen.&quot; <br>
&quot;I do not know of your culture.&quot; <br>
&quot;I know you have studied as very thoroughly Maladwen,&quot; The Reaper said. The arguement was becoming personal. <br>
&quot;I studied your warfare...your politics, not your culture.&quot; Maladwen was growing very impatient. <br>
&quot;You amuse me my friend I give you that.&quot; Creapiing said. Maladwen's fist smashed into his desk and broke it, he turned from a Fier'Dal to a Tier'Dal in a matter of seconds. &quot;I am NOT your friend Reaper! Those terms will be met!&quot; <br>
&quot;We will be receiving nothing from the agreement! What will we be receiving?&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladwen thought for a moment. &quot;I shall remove my assasins and sabatuers from Neriak, and I will and all current hostility between our two cities. You are great generals, crappy diplomats,&quot; Maladwen's indigo face was turning red. <br>
&quot;Very well general,&quot; The Reaper said and slammed out the door. It was time... <br>
<br>
/ooc This is basically a moderated version of what happened between Creapiing and I. I guarantee you it is going to get better when I have time to write a bit more. <br>
&quot;If you're going to kill, do it quick, to the back, where he can't see you,&quot; Maladwen Shadowlurker when he eluded the Dwarf Bounty Hunter.<br>

Re: Hate-It's not just for Tier'Dal &lt;RP: Part 1&gt; <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Maladwen looked over at his map of Norrath hanging on the wall and yelled, &quot;I HATE that woman!&quot; He then packed all his necessary gear together that he brings on all of his travels...it was time. He ordered his colonel to come into his office with his warm clothes. &quot;To, Halas sir?&quot; the colonel asked. Maladwen grabbed the warm clothes, mainly skins of all sorts that he'd patched together after 20 years of various huntings. &quot;No, I'm going to Velious, I got tipped off the Winnower may be down there,&quot; Maladwen was still packing his items. &quot;I wonder how much she'd be worth...&quot; <br>
<br>
The colonel raised a brow at him. Maladwen simply grabbed all he could from the man, and threw it into his bags and ran out the door. This was going to be a fun trip if he ever saw one. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
In Nro... <br>
<br>
Maladwen ran across the desert, the Dervish Cutthroats almost attacked him, before they recognized who it was. Then he heard the gnome welcoming people onto the raft. &quot;WAIT!&quot; he yelled. The raft was just leaving as Maladwen jumped onto it. <br>
<br>
It nearly threw the giant barbarian off, and he scowled at him. Maladwen tipped his crested helm at him, and waited until they reached the island. The waves beat up against the raft, it was very clumsy. <br>
<br>
Finally they came up to a sandy island, and Maladwen thought it would probably be a good idea to cross it. He found a dock at the other end, and so he sat there, and waited. Just like for most boats, he waited, and waited, and waited...and waited and waited. <br>
<br>
Finally, after a few hours, it came. It was a very loud clanging boat, and he jumped onto it. Thankfully, he packed his own wine, as the gnomes somehow managed to misplace their rum (silly gnomes). He laid back, and listened to the bard next to him play his soft soothing music. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're going to kill, do it quick, to the back, where he can't see you,&quot; Maladwen Shadowlurker when he eluded the Dwarf Bounty Hunter.<br>
