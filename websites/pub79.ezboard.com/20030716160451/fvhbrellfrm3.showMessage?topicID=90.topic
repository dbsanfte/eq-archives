Winnower of the Harvest<br>

<br>
Destruction of the Bond<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The time had come to face the truth. <br>
<br>
Selilya knew it to be true. Yet acknowledging that the relationship with Ernseax was over still smarted. As she assimilated all the random memories and thoughts and emotions, she had to sit at her dining table in her cottage. The weight of all that had transpired was now on her shoulders. <br>
<br>
She smiled as she recalled those first days…the fumbling warrior attempting to impress her. Then they had fought side by side, beating down the infernal picklaw goblins at Highkeep, and she was impressed. But far beyond his hardened battle skills lay a tender, unsure jester. The laughter was so frequent and so timely it seemed. <br>
<br>
He knew Selilya's background…and her mission, yet he remained supportive. As time permitted, he would assist where he could. She watched with pride when he arrived to cast his lot in with the Violent Harvest as they faced Nostramis in the reclaiming of their most sacred relic, The Bloodstone Chalice. He had even come to the point of leaving his long-time family, the guild Da Skurge, to join her in her guild. <br>
<br>
Then he had asked for her hand in marriage…again. Selilya couldn't recall exactly how many times Ernseax had proposed. She turned him down several times…yet he persisted. <br>
<br>
The fateful day had come…and the preparations had been made. The wedding was scheduled in the beautiful Nektulos Forest, where all could gather…some were not quite welcome within the walls of Neriak. Security had been shored up quite a bit, since there had been death threats on her life, but she had realized early on, when she took up the mantle of Winnower of the Violent Harvest, that most Norrathians would despise and reject her message. She had accepted that. She knew that even within the Teir'Dal ranks, many would deny her. Indeed, the threats were carried out…she had been taken and poisoned…as she was being escorted to her groom. Even Subati, who came to give her away, could not prevent it. Yet, all turned out well…and she had been revived…and wed. The perpetrator had been dealt with…for the time being. <br>
<br>
Life had now begun as a couple. Selilya finally felt she could balance the darkest parts of hatred and wrath with the deepest longing to care for those she needed the most. She knew Ernseax had a need to hunt with his friends. She would not deny him that…it was as much a part of him as partaking of fine brew was to her dearest friend, Nospiratus. She just hadn't counted on his disappearing. He was going to Guk…that much she knew, but when didn't return after several days, she sent spies to find him. He had been injured severely…but managed to make it home to mend. That mending only lasted a few days before he was off again. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be fine. Trust me. I always come home,&quot; he'd assured her. He smiled that boyish grin at her and quickly exited the door. She waved at him through the window and watched him vanish into the mist at the end of the path. Three weeks went by with no word. There was plenty to do with the Violent Harvest to keep her mind occupied, but when the time for her evening rest came, she felt the longing and worry…and the first doubts about his real feelings for her. Word had come back through the Harvest's network of spies that he had been seen at the Danak Shipyards speaking to some rather unsavory merchants…the kinds of merchants the Chosen Race avoided. He finally came home, hands full of presents, and much affection. Yet, there was something in his eyes that she had not seen before…or had she? That look…it was from long ago… <br>
<br>
Indeed, in a matter of days, Ernseax filled his packs with provisions, kissed Selilya, and headed out on another hunt. There wasn't much to say. She smiled weakly at him and waved…then donned her cloak for the quick trip to the grange of the Violent Harvest. There would always be matters to handle there, so for a time, her mind would be immersed in other affairs. <br>
<br>
One month went by…there had been no word. Selilya asked Salvyn, the Assassin for the Harvest, to seek out information regarding Ernseax. There were some sightings in some of the more nefarious sections of Oggok, but little else to offer Selilya hope. Then Salvyn had come to her door one evening… <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid I've learned something,&quot; he stammered. &quot;I wish…&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Out with it,&quot; she insisted. &quot;I just want to know what is going on.&quot; She sat down in her favorite bearskin covered chair and motioned for Salvyn to sit at the dining table. He lowered his eyes and relayed his information. Ernseax had posted a missive at the guild hall of Da Skurge that he was leaving Antonica for the promise of riches and a new life in a faraway land. Salvyn confirmed with some of the guild members there that the handwriting was indeed Ernseax's. They had expressed shock and some disappointment, but, perhaps, they were not entirely surprised. <br>
<br>
Salvyn looked up at Selilya, ready to console her…ready to offer a shoulder if she required it. He was astonished at what he saw in her eyes. There was no emotion, no tear, no… <br>
<br>
Selilya looked at Salvyn and smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for your efforts,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You have, once again, earned our trust in your skills. Please be on your way now…and good hunting to you.&quot; She stood up and went to front door, opened it for Salvyn, and quietly closed it behind him as he exited. She sat back down in her chair. From deep within her soul, an anger began to boil and churn. The anger flowed through her…permeating every fiber of her being. Neighbors would say that on that particular evening, they thought they had seen a soft red glow coming from her area of town… <br>
<br>
That had been over four months ago. Selilya went about the business of the Harvest in her usual efficient manner. The message of hate still needed to be proclaimed, and the day of Innoruuk's harvest would one day dawn. All had to be ready. Already the Reaper and Thresher were working on battle plans. She admired their military prowess. Her Master had crafted this Triad well. Many of the most devout members were gaining in skill and might. Some were ready to approach the planes of the gods… <br>
<br>
Then there he was… <br>
<br>
Selilya had gone to hunt the hill giants in Rathe Mountains. It was a relaxing pastime to her. The sheer exhilaration of felling a beast four times her height was a rare treat for her. As she stepped into the Feerott for her journey home, she practically ran right into him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Selilya!&quot; he exclaimed as he put his arms around her. &quot;It's so good to see you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Stunned…she could do little other than offer mere pleasantries. <br>
<br>
&quot;You look good, Ernseax. What are you up to? Where are you headed?&quot; Small talk…after such desertion…nothing was left but small talk. He went on about his misadventures…how he chose unwisely in abandoning her for the promise of wealth. He spoke for what seemed an eternity…and then it came. <br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we work this out?&quot; he asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;I…I…just don't know,&quot; she replied. &quot;You left…you left without a word. You ripped my heart out, Ernseax, and I had to find out about it from your friends. I just don't know.&quot; She turned away from him and walked away…she never looked back… <br>
<br>
She had seen him several times since then. She struggled in the night with the demons of indecision…but never once…did she find that spark that had been there in the beginning. There were no more images of laughter…all she saw was the face of her father…as he handed her mother a bag of coins and told her to go away…so he could live his life in luxury and newness. That is what Ernseax had sought…and he had caused the destruction of their bond just as surely as her father had caused her mother's death. <br>
<br>
Yes, Selilya had to face the truth…and she knew…her time with Ernseax would be no more. <br>
