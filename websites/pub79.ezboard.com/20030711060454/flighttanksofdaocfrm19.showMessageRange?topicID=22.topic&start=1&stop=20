<br>
1) 59 axe and 65 LA vs 64Slash and 64DW. Will affect dmg caps but not by much.<br>
<br>
2) We need the quickness on both characters to better compare, they also affect the dmg cap.<br>
<br>
3) Weapon speed differences affect dmg cap. You can't do much about this unless you can find a same speed weapon. Not easy to do.<br>
<br>
4) Amethyst, back slash aren't dual wield styles. (For comparing LA to DW, try misty gloom (anytime) and shadow's edge (back-positional). Dual shadows is a front-positional. Flank is the side positional.<br>
<br>
5) IF LA was equal to DW, you *should* see styled mainhand dmg. lower for LA. This is compensated by the offhand swinging 100% of the time vs 62.5% for CD/DW (LA base dmg is reduced because both hands swing 100%).<br>
<br>
Or compare the style bonuses by subtracting unstyled dmg cap from styled dmg cap.<br>
<br>
I expect you will find that the growth rate (or the style bonus) for LA is still higher than CD/DW styles but obviously when you look at total main-hand dmg the difference is very close unlike live servers.<br>

<br>
on a per hit basis this may be true, but don't forget LA users will still be able to take advantage of the dual weapon haste effect each round. mercs and BMs can't. <br>
<br>
if you're swinging at 3.4 speed every round that is a 30% haste each swing. assuming 64 DW spec the merc will only swing both weapons 37% of the time to get his 27% haste on those rounds only. <br>
<br>
over even a short amount of time berserkers will still have much higher damage output than mercs and bms because of DW/CD mechanics. citing damage caps is useless for compairing LA to DW and CD if swing rates are not also included because of the haste effect and different offhand swing chances.<br>

This was changed a long time ago to allow berserkers to spec in weapons other then axe.  Before that if you did not spec in axe, your damage was horrid as it was checking both your axe and your left axe still to determine damage.<br>

Cd/Dw hit for 100% base damage.  2nd hit is always for 100% base damage.<br>

Left axe hits for 62% + .5left axe spec on right hand base damage.  2nd hit is always for 62% base damage.  Because of the lower 2nd hand base damage it equals out to the same damage over time as the 2nd weapon swinging for CD/Dw.  <br>
<br>
100 swings at 62.5% base damage vs. 100 swings at 100% swinging 62.5% of the time.  Same damage.<br>

Ok. What about unstyled cap (without using a style), does your axe spec affect it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Left axe hits for 62% + .5left axe spec on right hand base damage. 2nd hit is always for 62% base damage. Because of the lower 2nd hand base damage it equals out to the same damage over time as the 2nd weapon swinging for CD/Dw. &quot;<br>
<br>
That's not my understanding of how LA works (I could be wrong). Doesn't the base dmg for the lefthand also raise with leftaxe speccing? So if you have 50 LA spec, it would be 62%+25% = 87% of base dmg for both hands (unstyled).<br>
<br>
&quot;100 swings at 62.5% base damage vs. 100 swings at 100% swinging 62.5% of the time. Same damage.&quot;<br>

I agree with you if indeed offhand base dmg. doesn't increase.

I must stress 'was' because i think even Mythic (After having the numbers drilled into their heads by the players testing, yet again) is seeing that they went too far, and are looking at this again. Hence the delay on the patch release.<br>
<br>
I, personally, am not offended in the slightest Grim. I'm on your side here and am totally baffled why Mythic won't do the 10%-15% drop to LA, 10%-15% boost to DW/CD, that so many seem to think is a reasonable middle-ground. Who knows, maybe the delay will find them actually going this rout. In fact, if they did, i think light tanks would be for the most part done, when you add all the other long over-due fixes. Oh, i also agree that ''Zerk mode' <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>does</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need to be looked at in light of the new Triple Wield and Dirty Tricks.<br>
<br>
Secondly, i know only too well that Amethyst Slash, Side Slicer, and Back Slash aren't DW styles. But given the fact that Keth/Grim added his Axe numbers, i thought i'd toss in my Slash numbers for the hell of it. I didn't even think about Misty Gloom, since it's known by everyone that this style is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>total</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> joke that never makes it onto any Merc's quick-bar, especially if they have access to Amethyst Slash. (I feel for all you Thrust Merc's out there who need to use Misty Gloom as their only soild anytime style. Ouch!)<br>
<br>
Thirdly, and i know this is going to be a bitter pill to swallow for a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lot</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of Merc's out there, but my Qui during this test was 133. Actually, my true Qui cap is 145, but i'll only hit this when wearing my RvR suit of armor, which still isn't completed yet. I'm a Briton Merc' who added +10 Con/Dex/Qui at creation, since we get Str with every level. In fact, the numbers look like this:<br>
<br>
[Avg. Wep. Spd: 3.35, when both swing, and i use the popular (1-(Qui-60)/400*Spd=New Delay) formula]<br>
<br>
Qui 90 = Spd: 3.09875<br>
Qui 133 = Spd: 2.738625<br>
Qui 145 = Spd: 2.638125<br>
<br>
Since most of my gear works together, i can't really get my Qui down, without greatly effecting several other factoring stats. And yes, you're seeing that right, that is over a full 0.5 second taken off my swing delay, and i could even shave another 0.10 second off if i capped Qui to 145. Many people just don't want to believe that the Qui stat really does effect their swing speed as much as it does. My style damage does take a hit for that fast swing speed, trust me. But, being a class that has a more solid base damage over my style damage, i'll take the sytle damage hit to get more base damage. The math is just to strong to support that i do get more damage. Trust me, i really researched this to choose my final stats and spec. Throw a Haste buff on me, and i become really dangerous.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, it's true that LA should get a higher style damage. As soon as you put a weapon in your off-hand with LA, the base damage of both weapons is divided (How much so is based on how much LA is trained in) signifigantly as a balance for both weapons swinging every round. It's totally true, Merc's/BM's get more base damage, and 'Zerkers get more style damage, to make up for their lower base damage. Grim can explain it very well, and has been forced to do so many times, so i don't blame him for not wanting to spell it out, again.<br>
<br>
I do have to say though, that i could <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>never</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, no matter what mob (Even level 1 mobs) i hit, with any weapon, using any style, get style damage getting even close to +2000 to +3000 and higher. I'd be lucky to get even +1500. And i think this is part of the problem we're seeing.<br>
<br>
The problem has been explained before, and is two fold. 1) A properly spec'ed and buffed 'Zerker can get <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>so</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> much extra style damage that it doesn't matter what their base damage is, they will totally over-compensate and be hitting damage caps with no effort. 2) Defense has been very broken in RvR for a looooong time. Offense classes are the only classes that can be guarenteed to actually work. If the Block/Parry bugs really have been fixed this time, this is going to change, in a big way.<br>
<br>
All this said, Merc's and BM's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>still</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are deserving of a modest boost to the damage their DW/CD lines do, in my oppinion, for one simple reason. These supposedly 'advanced' weapon spec lines offer no styles that give any signifigant advantage over the 'base' weapon spec lines. There are a few notable exceptions (Reflection + Hypnotic Darkness, being one of the only DW style chains that actually gives anything in return for the quick-bar space they take up) but for the most part, Merc's and BM's use Slash/Thrust/Crush or Blades/Pierce/Blunt styles almost exclusivly, since the returns from DW/CD styles just don't exist. Why spec in an advanced weapon line that gives you styles that are only on-par or <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>worse</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> then the base weapon lines? Just to boost the odds of an off-hand, no +damage, no +to-hit, swing? That's not good enough for me. And why should i risk trying for a very hard to get positional style that will miss if my target twitches in the lag-fest that is RvR, just so i can get what might be a tiny bit of extra damage? I could just spam out Amethyst Slash + Diamond Slash, not have to worry about position, and get a Very High bonus to hit in the process, while still getting the same damage.<br>
<br>
I will gladly do more tests. Tell me what numbers you want to see, and i'll be glad to try and get them for you. I want to do this to clear the damn air! People all seem to just go on popular oppinion, many times with no supporting facts, and don't go take a small amount of time to actually test something to see if the claims are true. Many people also make their judgements based on flawed information. This has to stop, and that is why i've started to personally test some of these claims. With so many conflicting statements that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>everyone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> keeps say are correct, i want to see for myself. The results have been interesting, to say the least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#000000>(5/30/03 3:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cap Damage Logs Live and Pendragon w/ 1.62</span><hr size=1> &quot;Left hand damage does not increase with left axe spec. &quot;<br>

LA) Ravager: 102 (mainhand) + 62 (offhand) = 164 dmg<br>
DW) misty gloom: 134 (mainhand) + 84 (x 47% offhand) = 173 dmg<br>
<br>

Find a blue-to-yellow con mob and attack that without styles. You won't be hitting the hard-cap so the numbers won't be exactly the same, but if what you're saying is right, you'll see both hands doing roughly the same damage per combat round. Otherwise you'll see the right had hitting noticably harder, even when both weapons are identical.<br>

If i'm mistaken, and you are attacking blue-to-yellow con mobs from the get-go, then i applogize for my error. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kethryndc>Kethryn DC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#000000>(5/30/03 7:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cap Damage Logs Live and Pendragon w/ 1.62</span><hr size=1> What was your axe spec in those tests?  did you keep it constant througout?

I tested the axe speccing as well, it did not impact dmg caps like you said. Only LA is raising the dmg cap for both hands.<br>

I don't think it's any different live, but you can test that to make sure.<br>

This has alot more to do with Qui/Haste and weapon speed than relevant class damage output.<br>
<br>
For example, with my 3.3 speed 100% Qua Rapier, my caps barely break 300dmg.  Then, when I do tests on a fully buffed cleric (thrust vulnerable vs. my thrust spec), I do HALF the damage of my CAPS.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I've noticed that Pre-1.62 Zerkers could hit my chain for aggregate (both hands) damage nearing 500 in RvR when everyone is fully buffed.  This is NOT Vendo damage.<br>
<br>
All I'm saying, is in all the testing I've done, I've found many SMALL things that have made pre-1.62 Zerkers overpowered, and one of those things is that they seem to hit through armor much better than other melee classes.<br>
<br>
I've pretty much given up trying to get logs to do comparisons.  No matter what we do, someone will come and say our data is worthless because:  Not using same weapons, not at same Qui, not against same target (armor tables), etc etc...  Basically the only way to lay this whole issue to rest, is to have lvl 50's of equal RR, on a server like Gaheris where both can use identical weapons against the same target.  And that is not going to happen anytime soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#000000>(6/2/03 12:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beware of Caps</span><hr size=1> That's why the growth rate's formula (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.nc.rr.com/obsidianguard/wyrd/Styles.htm)is">home.nc.rr.com/obsidiangu...les.htm)is</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> the best tool we have for comparing styles.
