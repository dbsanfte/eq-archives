The meeting had gone very well, save for the strange attack on Darkrayne. So many new Harvesters, new faces, even a new Dread Overlord. Despite all the recent losses the Harvest remained strong. As ever he lamented that his work kept him away from the hunt so much. He understood far more keenly now the frustration he had seen on Creapiing's face so often in the past. A Knight turned hermit by the requirements of duty. It rested uneasily at best on his shoulders.<br>
<br>
And then there was his House. Just to think of it he felt a dull ache deep in the back of his eyes. His Matron and her Consort grew older. He could start to see the edges of their power wearing thinner. Weakness could not be abided in a Noble House of Neriak. Especially not in its Matron. Khasirath knew he must redouble his efforts yet again to be prepared, to be vigilant. Should he miss the right time, all could be lost. He went now on the hunt to grow stronger for just this reason. The Hole near Paineel was an excellent place to hone his skills. Shaede had agreed to join him there, and they left the meeting together quietly. She even told him that she had a Wizard waiting to transport them.<br>
<br>
As he stepped out into the sacred forest, Khasirath drew in a deep breath. As much as Neriak's stone halls, this was home to him. He walked away from the gates with a nod to the Dragoons at their posts. He avoided the paths, heading directly through the gloomy underbrush to his goal. His heavy armour made barely a sound as he approached the ancient pyramid, the Spires used by the Arcanist Wizards for transportation.<br>
<br>
A snarl twisted his thin lips as he saw the white robed Koada'Dal standing their silent vigil in the shadows at the edge of the clearing. None of Neriak's spies had been able to divine their purpose here. Those captured refused to divulge their plans. Even their dead would not give up their secrets to the Necromancers of the Lodge of the Dead. They had planned skillfully for this, whomever was behind it. For months now these apprentices had watched the Spires, with no changes visible to any scrier or sage.<br>
<br>
Khasirath had his own suspicions. It must be the Arcanists of Felwithe. He felt they must be seeking a way to open a more permanent portal, most likely one that would only work in one direction... from the Faydark to Nektulos. A portal large enough to lead an army through. With a wolfish growl he lunged at the nearest sorceror from the shadows, his lance biting deep into the youth's back, stealing his life before he could draw a spell in defense. Methodically Khasirath and Shaede circled the Spires, and killed all they found, leaving the corpses to rot on the rich loam soil.<br>
<br>
They climbed the side of the pyramid, Khasirath's earlier smile replaced by a disgusted sneer. Pointless. He knew it would not take long for new apprentices to replace those they had slain. Ever since they had appeared it had been the same way. Felwithe apparently had an endless supply of young fools willing to die for this cause.<br>
<br>
He was pleased to see that the Wizard Shaede had found was a young red robed Teir'Dal who sat atop the Spires in meditation, his imp familiar watching the Reaper vigilantly. Even though Wizards were Spurned, Khasirath far prefered acquiring transport from one of the Chosen Race, rather than some foul lightborne Wizard. Or worse yet, a Druid.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are ready to go,&quot; Shaede told the Wizard.<br>
<br>
The Wizard looked up from his book, then slid it into his pack as he stood. His voice was whispery and sibilant as he replied, &quot;Of course, my lord and lady. It would be my honor to serve the Father's Harvest.&quot; The young Wizard bowed deeply.<br>
<br>
Khasirath smiled to himself at seeing another young Teir'Dal who recognized the Harvest. Perhaps someday this one too would hear the Father's Calling. He inclined his head to the Wizard in a small bow, &quot;My thanks for your time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Placing one hand on Khasirath's wrist and the other on Shaede's to include them in the arc of the spell, the Wizard began to draw upon his power, calling and shaping it with precise skill. Khasirath stood silently so as not to interrupt, and soon the glimmer of the portal enfolded the three of them.<br>
<br>
As he disappeared into the portal, a deep pain stabbed behind Khasirath's eyes. But then the spell was drawing him along, carrying him elsewhere, and he could not speak or move at all.<br>
<br>
The sway of the spell left him as suddenly as it had taken him, and as always for a moment he could not move. His eyes started to widen as he saw not green misted forest, but dark marble walls.<br>
<br>
From behind something wide and cold and hard was slipped around his neck. Distantly he heard the sharp 'click' of a clasp sliding home.<br>
<br>
There was nothing more.<br>
