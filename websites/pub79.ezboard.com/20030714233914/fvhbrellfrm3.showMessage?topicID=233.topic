Her mind raced trying to recall what happened, but the pain would not allow it.  Swimming through the sea of agony Shaede pulled herself up onto the wall of the pit and dragged her broken body onto the rock.  She looked down to her legs to assess the damage and a gasp escaped her lips as her lower body began to melt into a pool of water.  Panic ripped through her mind as she cried out, but then she understood.<br>
<br>
Watching in intrigue she willed the pool of water into a coalesced form. Her lower body formed together as the rest of her melted into the pool of water.  Her mind raced with this, she could feel the body repairing itself incredibly fast.  She marveled at the sensation of knowing every cell of her body, every bit of her essence.  Careful she knitted her broken and burned body back together, bringing the water to form and repair.<br>
<br>
Suddenly her form snapped back to its normal Teir’Dal nature and she stood uneasily.  Stepping over she saw the river of blood she had left and her equipment and gear as she had left it. She picked up the items, trying desperately to dig through her thoughts.  As she dressed she pricked herself on something in her component pouch.  Pulling it out she smiled to herself, it was the guild pin of the Harvest.<br>
<br>
She took a step back as if blasted by some unseen force.  Images flooded her mind in a cacophony of horror.  The war with Mythral and his followers, the accusations brought against the High Chancellor, her own death.  She collapsed to the ground.  She had died, but? How was she still here? Innoruuk’s face flashed before her.  His rictus grin sent shivers through her.  He was displeased with her.  He had shown her so many signs of his approval and she showed her respect and her thanks by betraying him and destroying herself.  Wickedly taloned hands cut through her spirit.  The aura of Hate surrounding him made her regret ever displeasing such a powerful creature, for displeasing her God.  His voice echoed throughout her being as he berated her, told her of his displeasure of his hatred for weak creatures of flesh.  She understood then her failings.<br>
<br>
Begging for a last chance she took his abuse.  Her hatred grew within her at that moment but not without the temper of sanity.  Her Lord and her God then showed her the glory of what was to come. She drank in the hate that she could handle, but he kept giving it to her giving her his Divine Hatred.<br>
<br>
She screamed with the memory and that brought her back to the here and now. Quickly she memorized the spell of Gate and transported herself back to House K`Thalion.  No more would she run, no more would she let her fears and her failures control her.  She appeared in her private chambers and began to pack in preparation.  Frantically she put things into her packs, trying to be sure not to forget anything.  Going to her desk she stopped suddenly and looked at a fist sized rock she found there.<br>
<br>
Looking at it curiously, she picked it up, attached to it was a note from Nospiratus addressing it to her as a ‘gift’.  Her brow knit in confusion, what had the drunkard done now and why did her leave her this rock?  She turned ready to hurl it against the wall when she ‘heard’ it speak. Looking at it closer she smiled softly.  This? This simple stone meant so much to her, she knew then the Prophet was alive.  As she studied the strange stone she noticed many details she had missed in the beginning sparkling with crystals and small stones tainted with oxidation.  Gasping softly she let it dance over her hand, the rock was a perfection of the elements.  The rock contained the four elements. Air, trapped in the crystalline pockets. Water shimmered within a few of the pockets of the Geode. It shimmered with the look of fire from the oxidation of the base materials and used in the fusing of the different types of rocks. Earth? Earth was the most blatant of the materials making up the stone. Suddenly things became very clear.<br>
<br>
Her mind went through the implications of what this stone presented.  So simple an object answered so many questions.  Where had the Prophet found this? She nearly dropped the stone. Looking it over carefully she took her dagger and opened one of the pockets.  She poured a bit of the water into her hand; bringing it close to her face she smelled it and took a taste of it.  Shaede nearly dropped the stone. She knew this taste!<br>
<br>
Quickly she found some of the maps she had discarded from her search.  Now she didn't need to run!  She could end this war and stop the insanity that was brought by the missing Prophet.  Only the presence of Nospiratus could prove to Mythral that he had been manipulated in this, who had played the fools of all of us though?<br>
<br>
Quickly she called forth an elemental of fire, watching as she reflected how much of herself was in that element.  So many mistakes because she did not move with the flows as the air would, that she did not show the strength of earth, that she did not shift herself like the water. Dismissing these thoughts she raced to the commons of Neriak.<br>
<br>
Nearly knocking over the Priest of Discord she and her elemental ran to the top of the ramp, without stopping she dove into the waterfall that lead to the aqueducts and aquifers of Neriak, behind her the elemental followed shrouding the area in a cloud of steam.  Swimming down into the back areas she learned from the map she sought the opening in the back wall.  Her lungs cried out in panic as she fought to draw breath, then she found it. Swimming madly she snaked her way up into a cavern.   Her head broke the surface of the water and she gasped for air.  Quickly she climbed out of the water and entered the cavern.  Her elemental casting light in the small cave.<br>
<br>
There on the ground sat the Mad One.<br>
