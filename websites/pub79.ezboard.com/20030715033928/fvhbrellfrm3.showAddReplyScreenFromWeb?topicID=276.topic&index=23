Part 11.</span><hr size=1> Hours passed while the woman slept, but eventually she rolled over, opening her light blue eyes slowly.  She saw the basket, and blinked at it in confusion for a moment before turning to glare at her elemental.  She sat up, looking around the stall carefully.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel couldn't help but smile in her hiding place, &quot;Good morning, Shaede,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Shaede frowned, turning her head toward the voice without seeing anything.  &quot;Who is there?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's just Tzann,&quot; she replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tzann,&quot; Shaede said softly, as if she did not recognize the name at first.  &quot;Oh, Tzann.  I saw you the other day,&quot; she muttered softly to herself.<br>
<br>
Without bothering to correct her that 'the other day' was more like two months ago, Tzanntiel chuckled, &quot;Is it all right if I come out now, or will Sparky over there get upset?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede looked up at her fire elemental with a wry smirk, &quot;It's all right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel walked out of her hiding place, and sat beside Shaede's bed, next to the basket.  Shaede looked confused, as if part of her mind was still asleep.  She picked up the bottle of wine and looked at the wax seal around the cork.<br>
<br>
&quot;Untampered with, I promise,&quot; Tzann chuckled.<br>
<br>
Shaede almost blushed as she smiled, &quot;If you wanted me dead I'm sure you would have done it already.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded with an impish grin, &quot;So true.  But I don't want you dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding, Shaede rolled the wine bottle between her palms slowly.  &quot;It's been a long time.  Why are you here, Tzann?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel sighed, wrinkling her nose as if she didn't want to get to business just yet.  She pulled the rolled up parchments from her pack and held them out towards the Magician.  &quot;I need your help, Shaede.&quot;<br>
<br>
Setting the bottle down, Shaede took the bundle of papers.  She slipped off the ribbon and unrolled them.  She looked through the pages one at a time slowly, the color draining out of her face.  As she stared at the last sheet, Tzann could see she wasn't even breathing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shaede,&quot; Tzanntiel said a bit sharply.<br>
<br>
Shaede looked up suddenly, drawing in a deep breath.  Worry verging on panic was clearly written on her face.  &quot;Where did you get these?&quot; Shaede whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I made them,&quot; Tzanntiel said plainly, sitting back.<br>
<br>
Shaede's eyes returned to the papers, flicking back and forth as she looked at them, &quot;I ... I've seen this before.  In some books I was researching.  You made them, from what?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel sighed softly, not liking this openness in her old friend, the poor attempts at subterfuge.  She'd never seen such a state of panic in her before.  &quot;From the collar,&quot; she answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did you find it?&quot; Shaede asked.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel chuckled dryly as she watched Shaede, unwilling to give away much at this point.  &quot;Well, I guess technically I found it in Mistmoore, but I don't know how it got there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding quickly, Shaede flipped through the pack of papers, her hands trembling.  &quot;It was created long ago.... Not as old as the Combine, mind you....&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded, watching Shaede's face closely.<br>
<br>
Shaede continued, trying to control the quavering in her voice, &quot;There was an artificer of rather exceptional powers long ago.  He had a slave, a woman, that he wanted to keep forever.  He created the collar for her.  It was supposed to ... sort of lock her away from time.  Powerful temporal magics, you understand.  Theoretically she would never age....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Or only age very slowly,&quot; Tzanntiel added, her tone clearly a statement rather than a question.<br>
<br>
Shaede looked up at her, her lips moving soundlessly for a few moments.  &quot;Well ... well, perhaps.  It's all theoretical you see.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I just need to know how to open it,&quot; Tzanntiel said suddenly, stopping Shaede again.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head, Shaede said, &quot;I don't know how.  There was nothing in the books about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes, Tzanntiel tried to calm the rising anger she felt.  Shaede seemed so on edge she was afraid that pressing for more details might make her run, or worse, attack.  The years of solitude had clearly changed the Magician greatly.  &quot;Ok.  Well, what about those books.  They may be useful to me.  Do you remember any titles?  Where you found them, anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede set the parchments on the bed, and picked up one of her packs.  Almost guiltily she reached in and pulled out a few books.  &quot;Here.  I don't know how much good they will do, but I don't need them anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blinking, Tzanntiel accepted the books and slid them into her own pack carefully.  &quot;Thank you, Shaede.  I need all the help I can get,&quot; she said quietly.<br>
<br>
Shaede picked at her fingernails, avoiding Tzanntiel's eyes.  &quot;It's been activated, then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it has,&quot; Tzann answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's on a person?&quot; Shaede asked, even more quietly.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel clenched her jaw a moment, not wanting to answer, weighing the possibility that honesty might just gain her more information.  The two of them had been very close, long ago.  It had been one of the few relationships Tzann had ever had that wasn't at least partially for business, where she had simply let herself enjoy what they shared without trying to gain advantages or learn weaknesses.  She knew that Shaede was very different around her than anyone else.  It was probably as close to revealing her true self as any Teir`Dal came.  Finally Tzann answered, &quot;Yes, it is, Shaede.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede closed her eyes for a moment, drawing a deep shaking breath, &quot;And you and I both know the person that it is on, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded as she looked towards the Magician's fire elemental, making sure that it had not moved.  &quot;Yes,&quot; she finally said aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you told anyone else about this?&quot; Shaede asked.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel schooled her expression carefully, &quot;I have others working on this, yes.  None know as many details as I do, but there are enough that know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede's eyes widened slightly.  &quot;You haven't told any of the Harvest, have you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I haven't,&quot; Tzann said.  It was mostly true.  Tevesh wouldn't remember knowing, and Kassy had been declared anathema after her short stint as a member, which more or less meant she'd never been a member.  <br>
<br>
Shaede sighed, her shoulders sagging as she relaxed.  Her pale blue eyes were reddened and glassy as she looked back up into Tzanntiel's face.  &quot;Why do you need the collar opened, Tzann?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel found she could not look away from Shaede's eyes, amazed at the deep pain shining from them.  &quot;I need him back, Shaede.  My House needs him.  I miss him,&quot; she added quietly.<br>
<br>
Shaede lowered her head, her hands covering her face for a long moment of silence.  &quot;What have we done?&quot; Tzanntiel thought she heard her mumble.<br>
<br>
The dusty old stables were quiet for a long while, Tzann watching Shaede closely while the Magician was wrapped in her private torment.  Tzann licked her lips, knowing there was more, wondering how to get to that information.<br>
<br>
Quietly Tzann spoke, breaking the silence, &quot;His heart beats once, perhaps twice in a day.  He breathes less often than that.  The beasts in Mistmoore had found where he was hidden, they were feeding from him.  I don't know if the collar protected him from that, or if he's in even greater danger now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly Shaede lowered her hands away from her face, looking up at Tzanntiel as she spoke.  She was transfixed by each word, flinching slightly at the details.  Her breathing was slow and shallow, as if she wished she could simply stop breathing.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel pressed on, speaking slowly, letting her worry carry on the soft words, &quot;He is pale and cold, he's lost weight and muscle.  He looks like a dying man, Shaede.  I need to help him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede's hands trembled as they twisted in her skirt like a pair of doves trying to strangle one another.  She looked up into Tzann's eyes, then dropped her gaze, staring into her lap.  Seeing her hands, she stilled them, pressing her palms against her thighs.  She drew a deep breath and let it out in a quavering sigh.  Turning to look at her fire elemental, she dismissed it with a soft word.  Tzanntiel watched silently as it dispersed into the ether.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was the one who had the collar found, Tzanntiel.  I lured him to the place where it was put around his neck,&quot; her voice was cold, lifeless.  At the admission Tzanntiel felt white hot rage uncoil in her chest, flooding through her body, screaming for revenge.  Closing her eyes tightly she reined it back, grinding her teeth as she brought the bloodlust under control.  Only when she felt the stillness again did Tzann open her eyes.<br>
<br>
Shaede lifted Tzanntiel's hands, placing them around her own throat.  Over Tzanntiel's arms she looked deep into her eyes.  &quot;Hate forgive me, Tzanntiel.  I did that to him.  Kill me, end it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel's eyes narrowed as she felt her arms tense, sharply aware of the softness of Shaede's throat in her hands, feeling the racing pulse under her thumbs where they crossed over the Mage's windpipe, ready to curl in and crush the fragile flesh.  A moan like a growl broke from Tzann's lips as she dropped her head onto her arms, her hands still locked on Shaede's throat, holding but not squeezing.  &quot;I cannot Shaede.  It is not my place to punish you or to forgive you.  I only want to free my brother.  He can decide what should be done.  He is the one who has suffered.&quot;<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes, Shaede sunk down out of Tzanntiel's hands, collapsing onto the bed.  Sobs shook her shoulders, her fingers coiling into her hair as she held her own head as if to keep her skull from bursting.  &quot;How many times have I died?  How many times have I taken my own life, only to return?&quot; she moaned.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel sat back on her heels, staring at her hands.  When she answered her voice was soft but dull, &quot;It only means the Father is not done with you, Shaede.  You have more to do here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede shook harder with her crying, &quot;Why wouldn't you do it, Tzann?  I want to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It wouldn't do any good.  The Father would just bring you back again.  It wouldn't bring you peace.  And the only other thing I could offer you....&quot;  Tzanntiel stopped, shocked at herself for what she had almost blurted out.  &quot;Well, let's just say it would be even worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede didn't seem to have noticed Tzann's odd hesitation.  &quot;We did it to save the Harvest.  Your brother had lost his focus, but he never would have stepped down.  He was too duty-bound.  But we didn't save it, did we?  It's all gone now.&quot;  She almost choked on her words as she sobbed.<br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled dryly, &quot;That's why I knew he wasn't dead, Shaede.  His sense of duty.  I knew he would have come back.&quot;  She sighed, watching her friend cry.  &quot;I don't think anything could have saved the Harvest.  You said 'I helped' and 'we did it'.  Who else was involved?&quot;<br>
<br>
She stiffened, her sobbing tapering off.  &quot;I ... I can't say, Tzann.  It will be up to them to step forward, when the time comes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel sighed deeply.  She could tell pressing further wouldn't get her anywhere.  Silently she watched Shaede, lost in her thoughts and her unanswered questions.<br>
<br>
Curled up like a child on the rough mattress, Shaede was lost in her thoughts as well.  But hers would not remain silent.  Once she had admitted what she had done, everything else that ached in her heart wanted to be spoken as well.  &quot;After the Harvest was gone, I had nothing.  I went down to Grobb and Guk, lost myself in the stink and the frogs and the bugs for ... I don't know how long.  Months?  Years?  I tried to return to Neriak, but I couldn't return to my House.  I lived in the Foreign Quarter, like a commoner, an orphan.  Eventually I did the wrong thing again, and I ran.  Came here to hide with the other dead things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, Tzanntiel reached out, cupping Shaede's cheek.  The lines of worry and pain on her face made Shaede look older than her years.  Tzann frowned, &quot;But you aren't dead, Shaede.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silent tears crept down Shaede's cheeks as she looked up at Tzanntiel.  &quot;I feel dead.  I want to be dead.&quot;  She covered Tzann's hand with her own, pressing it tighter to her cheek.  &quot;What did you mean before, the other thing you could offer me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel pulled her hand back, crossing her arms over her stomach and almost hugging herself.  She tried to laugh, but it sounded hollow.  &quot;Eternal life?&quot; she said, shrugging.<br>
<br>
Shaede shook her head slowly, &quot;I don't understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel closed her eyes a moment, her fingertips brushing the hilts of her weapons on her belt.  &quot;I was turned, Shaede.  I am a vampire.&quot;  She looked into the Mage's eyes, expecting to see revulsion, hate.  It was the vampires who had brought such awful destruction to Neriak and to the Violent Harvest long ago.  Tzanntiel had been changed shortly before that time, and she was not bound to the Mistmoore vampires who had been behind the Blood Harvest.  Such a paltry fact wouldn't matter to many; a vampire was a vampire, something to be destroyed.<br>
<br>
It was with amazement that Tzann realized that Shaede was not angry, or disgusted.  The Mage's eyes grew wide, her lips trembling as a flush spread over her pale cheeks.  &quot;Oh, Tzann.  I ... I remember what that was like.  I had let Mythral turn me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel blinked.  When the Blood Harvest had fallen over Neriak, she had fled, hiding out until all was said and done.  She had missed many things during that time.  &quot;But, you're not a vampire now, Shaede.  How?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede shook her head.  &quot;I don't really understand it.  Mythral did something, freed those of us he'd turned.  A ritual, or something.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sitting back, Tzanntiel watched Shaede quietly.  Somehow the Mage always surprised her.  She realized no matter how well she thought she knew a person, there was always more to learn.<br>
<br>
&quot;So that's why you are so worried about Khasirath.  That you might have to turn him to save him,&quot; Shaede said.<br>
<br>
Sighing, Tzann nodded.  &quot;Yes, Shaede.  He wouldn't understand if I did.  I doubt he'd ever forgive me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded, then tilted her head slightly as she watched her friend.  &quot;Tzann, are you hungry?&quot; she asked, stretching out her arm towards the Rogue.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel blinked as she looked down at the Mage's thin wrist.  Such an offer from one who wasn't already bound to her completely amazed her.  &quot;No.  No, I'm fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede lowered her eyes, laying her hand back on the bed.  &quot;I miss that, Tzann.  I want to feel it again.  I want to be your thrall, so you can command me and make me help you fix all this.  Make me something useful again, give me a purpose.  I'd do anything you wanted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann couldn't help but smile a bit, her eyes sparkling with mischief.  &quot;I've missed you, Shaede,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
Shaede smiled as well, a small sad smile.  She only nodded in answer, lowering her eyes.<br>
<br>
Tzann climbed over Shaede, curling up against her back and holding her gently.  She closed her eyes as she nuzzled against the back of Shaede's neck.  As her hand stroked along the Mage's side, she could feel how thin her friend had become.  Her fingers traced the arcs of her ribs, the smooth curve of her hip bone.  Tzann purred softly.<br>
<br>
Shaede turned over in the circle of the younger woman's arms, nestling her head under Tzann's chin.  Her hand trembled as it wrapped around Tzann's waist, holding her tightly.<br>
<br>
Tzann reached up, stroking Shaede's face, brushing her hair behind her ear.  &quot;Are you sure this is what you want, beautiful?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded without looking up.  &quot;Please,&quot; she whispered, running her hand slowly up Tzanntiel's back.<br>
<br>
Sliding down on the bed, Tzann tilted Shaede's face up to meet hers, catching her lips in a long, deep kiss.  She moaned softly at the quivering openness Shaede gave her, and caressed her body through her old green robes.  Her kisses trailed down Shaede's cheek, then her throat, teasingly running the tip of her tongue down the soft warm skin.<br>
<br>
Gasping softly, Shaede tilted her head back, exposing the length of her neck to Tzann. Her heart was pounding in anticipation, waiting to feel Tzanntiel's fangs and the indescribable sensations they would bring.<br>
<br>
Tzann grinned as she teased Shaede, slowly pushing her over onto her back.  Tzann's hands rested on the bed to either side of Shaede's head as she bent down over her, kissing her throat, her body half-covering Shaede's.  Shaede whimpered, holding onto Tzann's shoulders.  &quot;Please,&quot; she whispered again.<br>
<br>
Tzann bit into Shaede's throat quickly, closing her eyes as the rich blood flowed over her tongue.  Shaede moaned deeply, writhing underneath her, her hands closing tightly on Tzann's shoulders.  After only a few heartbeats, Tzann pulled away, licking the small wound to close it.  She did not want to take much with Shaede in such a weakened state.<br>
<br>
Shaede whimpered softly, holding even tighter to Tzann.  She didn't want it to end.  She wanted to feel more.  But all she could do was whisper 'please' again and again.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel smiled as she leaned back enough to bring her hand to her own throat, cutting into the skin with her nail just as she had with the Knight in Shadow Haven.  Cradling Shaede's head she brought her lips to the cut, and mumbled for her to drink.<br>
<br>
Shaede's tongue flicked out and tasted the blood, and then she found herself drinking deeply, the power and heat of it filling her.  She felt she couldn't stop herself.  She didn't want to stop herself.  Waves of sanguine darkness surrounded and engulfed her.<br>
<br>
When Tzanntiel finally pulled away Shaede whimpered, her hands trembling.  Tzann could already feel that Shaede's arms were stronger from the gift of the blood.  Grinning, she stroked Shaede's hair, purring softly to herself.  It had been a day of deeply mixed blessings, pain and pleasure, answers and new questions.  But for now, the pleasures that lay before her had her full attention.  The search could wait another day ... or two.  She smiled as she bent down to kiss Shaede's flushed lips again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/03 8:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 12.</span><hr size=1> When Tzanntiel left Kunark, Shaede went with her.  They traveled to Shadow Haven and Tzann helped settle Shaede into her new apartment.  She stopped in at the merchants and restaurants that she frequented, and told the owners to provide Shaede with whatever she might want and put it on Tzanntiel's tabs and credits.  Back at the apartment she offered the Mage a pouch of coins, telling her to have her robes repaired.<br>
<br>
Shaede blushed, &quot;I shouldn't take your money, Tzann.  The robe isn't important.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grinning, Tzann pressed the pouch into her hand.  &quot;You have to take it, Shaede.  I can't have you wandering around looking like I beat you.  You deserve better, pet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede lowered her eyes, blushing even more.  She tucked the pouch away.  &quot;If you insist,&quot; she mumbled.<br>
<br>
Tzann went into her bedroom, Shaede following a bit uncertainly.  Shaede watched as Tzanntiel knelt down and started checking her pack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you leaving so soon?&quot; Shaede asked, frowning.<br>
<br>
Tzann looked back over her shoulder and nodded.  &quot;I have to.  Got to check in with some folks, see what they've found for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede sighed deeply.  &quot;I'll miss you.  I don't know what I'll do here alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann chuckled, standing back up.  &quot;Just relax, enjoy some good meals, good shows.  You need to take good care of yourself and regain your strength.  If you want to help, you can go poke around the library, see what you can learn about temporal magics similar to that collar.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trying to smile, Shaede nodded.  &quot;If that is what you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann leaned in to kiss her, purring softly.  &quot;It would mean a lot to me, pet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaede could feel herself blushing again, her heart racing.  &quot;Ok, Tzann.  I'll do my best.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grinning, Tzanntiel took her pack out to the main room, and grabbed her cloak.  Pinning it around her shoulders, she smiled at Shaede.  &quot;I'll be dropping in every few days.  Don't worry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blowing Shaede a kiss, Tzann walked out into the streets of Shadow Haven.  She wandered down by the reflecting pool, slipping into the shadows of the crowds as she walked into a carpenter's shop.  Like a ghost she passed through the secret tunnels to Echo Caverns.  She remained invisible as she walked through another hidden door that looked like a cave-in.  Soon the narrow tunnel opened into a cavern, the outpost of Rogues and Dark Art practitioners.  <br>
<br>
Carefully she crept into the main hall, then into the rooms where her Shadow Knight thralls lived.  One brother sat in the main room, tending to his weapons and armour.  The other was no doubt on duty.  Tzanntiel did not reveal herself to the man, she simply wandered through the small rooms until she found her trunks, and checked them over to be sure they had remained unopened.  A smile lifted her lips as she saw the subtle tell-traps she had set were undisturbed.  These tiny traps were harmless, and therefore nearly undetectable.  But the traps would be destroyed if the trunks were opened without first disarming them.<br>
<br>
Her spirits lightened as Tzanntiel returned to Shadow Haven, and then the Nexus.  She had a lot of journeying before her, and she was eager to get on with it.<br>
<br>
Traveling to Freeport, she met up with the man she had sent to the library of Erud.  He had found one small reference to the collar in a book of artificers, but it was not very detailed.  As they sat and drank at the Hogcaller's Inn, Tzann let him read through the books Shaede had given her.  He verified what Shaede had told her, that there was nothing about opening the collar in the tomes.  When they parted, Tzann told him to contact her if he found any new information.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel went to Highpass next, but the woman she had met there before had not yet returned from Skyshrine.  She rented a room at the Tiger's Roar, and enjoyed the music of the resident Bard in the common room.  As the night grew late she invited him to her room for a more private performance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/03 8:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 13.</span><hr size=1> A knock at her door awakened Tzanntiel around noon the next day.  One of the serving wenches explained through the door that she had a visitor.  Sitting up in the plain bed, Tzann told her to send them in.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later the door opened, and Tzann smiled at the Human Wizardess as she walked in.  &quot;I hope your travels went well,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Pulling off her cloak, the woman sat down on the edge of the bed, and nodded.  &quot;It wasn't bad.  I'm sorry if I kept you waiting here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a pleasant enough place to spend the night, don't fret about it.  Why don't you tell me what you have learned?&quot; Tzann said with a wide smile, stretching out under the blankets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, the Brood of Veeshan certainly had no hand in making this particular item.  The runes are not theirs, or even similar.  But they did recognize the basic theorems behind them.  Powerful temporal magics, designed to be permanent.  Not an easy thing to break,&quot; she replied.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded, a slight frown creasing her brow.  &quot;Not easy, but possible?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Wizardess nodded, &quot;It should be, but they were not sure exactly how to go about it.  They say it is similar to the wards that used to bind the outcast Kerafyrm.  But those particular wards were bound to the four Warder dragons who guarded the Tomb.  So once the Warders were slain, the wards were weakened enough for Kerafyrm to break free.  In this case the spell is more directly tied into the materials of the collar.  But to destroy the collar while it is on someone would most likely harm, or possibly kill them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel rubbed her face for a moment, thinking hard.  &quot;Not good,&quot; she muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;They further theorized that there may be some way to weaken either the collar or the magics within it enough to open it temporarily.  But without the item to study directly, they could not divine the best way to do so,&quot; she added.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel looked up into the woman's eyes with a slight smile.  &quot;Well, that's hopeful news.  If I can't get any further on my own, perhaps I can bring it to them.  I would have to earn their respect first of course, but I'm more than willing to if it comes to that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling the Wizardess nodded.  &quot;Indeed.  I wish I could have found more for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann reached out and ran her hand down the woman's back slowly.  &quot;Don't worry about it.  You've helped a lot, especially by keeping my hopes up.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Wizardess smiled a little as she rested a hand on Tzann's leg through the blankets.  &quot;I wish I could stay, but I have to get back to my duties.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann squeezed her shoulder lightly.  &quot;I understand.  Take care, and let me know if you learn anything new.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I promise I will,&quot; she said as she stood up.  She began an incantation and moments later had disappeared into the portal she created.  Tzann blew her a kiss, then sighed.  She had hoped for better news than she had gotten, but at least it wasn't as bad as it could have been. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/03 5:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 14.</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel returned to Neriak the next day, and checked in with her contacts at the Library and the Tower of the Spurned.  Neither one had found anything.  Tzann thought it was probably because the books Shaede had were from their libraries.  She showed each one the books, and they agreed on the previous opinions, that there was no information about opening the collar.  As with the others, Tzanntiel left them with instructions to contact her if they found anything new.<br>
<br>
Next she returned to House S`Therik.  The stately manor house was quiet as she entered.  She was about to walk up to her sister's room when a servant stopped her in the hall.  He bowed as he handed her a sealed scroll, saying that it had been delivered the day before, but that they had not known where to forward it.  Apologizing for the delay, he bowed again and hurried off to his other duties.<br>
<br>
Tzann went into her room and closed the door.  Sitting at her writing desk she broke the seal on the scroll and slowly read it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dear Tzanntiel,<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The culling has returned, Innoruuk's word has reached me, and I am sure you know what I mean by this, for you have no doubt had something of the vision as well. The Grange has opened, and I dwell inside. Return to Innoruuk at haste, I await your arrival.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daiunus Darkenvalor<br>
Loyal servant to our Father</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Frowning, Tzanntiel read the letter once more.  She pondered what Daiunus meant by visions.  She had never had one herself, not a true vision like her sister and brother did.  She felt the Father's Hate keenly, ever since Anari had almost ended her life, but she was just not able to See as the others did.  She thought for a moment that she should not go to Daiunus.  She had so much work to do, and she was not certain it would be safe to be among so many ex-Harvesters.  Shaede had insinuated that others of their number had been involved in the plot against her brother.<br>
<br>
She sat and thought for a long while, but finally decided that she would go.  Something stirred deep in her gut the longer she considered the letter.  It was like the tension she felt when slinking through the shadows of Neriak, or out in the wilds and dungeons when she hunted and the warriors called out that the enemy approached.  Some part of her felt that call, that excitement, and she couldn't deny its lure.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel walked to the hearth in her room which was kept burning hot by the servants.  She tossed the letter into the flames, and watched it burn to ash, stirring it slowly with a poker to be sure it was completely destroyed.<br>
<br>
Next Tzanntiel went to Vhalshae's room.  As always the younger woman was meditating or praying, kneeling beside her bed.  She looked up as Tzann walked in, the slightest of smiles twitching at her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are closer, Tzanntiel.  I can feel it,&quot; Vhalshae said in her whispery voice.<br>
<br>
Tzann sighed deeply, &quot;I don't feel closer.  Every time I turn the news seems to grow worse.  Did those sketches help you at all?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae turned and looked at the wall beside her window.  All the parchments had been tacked up there, one next to the other.  She nodded, &quot;In some ways, yes.  I sense the mystery in them, but I cannot quite see the solution.  Those runes are the ice and amber I felt.  We must learn how to thaw them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a secret I've had no luck in unearthing, Vhal.  I'm starting to doubt the answer exists anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae was standing in front of her sister in an instant.  She grabbed Tzann's chin in a fierce grip, forcing her to look deep into her endless black eyes.  &quot;Never doubt, Tzanntiel S`Therik,&quot; she hissed.  &quot;Do not dare to doubt the Father's Will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann flinched at the pinching grip and the venomous words, but she did not try to pull herself free.  &quot;I'm sorry Vhalshae.  I just don't know where to turn now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae released her sister's face with a look of disgust.  &quot;To your faith, dear sister.  Perhaps you need to spend more time in prayer than in your drinking houses scrabbling after scraps with those rats.  The Father will provide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, Tzanntiel turned away from Vhalshae, lost in thought.  &quot;I will try, Vhal.  It doesn't come as easy for me as it does for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are the Father's daughter, Tzanntiel.  Just as I am.  Stop doubting and go do what needs to be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann walked out slowly, feeling more uncertain than ever.  She looked back just as she was about to shut the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soon, more than a month, but less than two, our Matron will bear her newest and last child, Tzanntiel.  Be certain you are ready, or the opportunity may have passed,&quot; Vhalshae whispered as she settled back down to the floor, running a fingertip across the symbol of Innoruuk she wore around her neck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/03 9:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 15.</span><hr size=1> Daiunus' meeting was the next evening.  Tzanntiel spent the day at House S`Therik, but kept to herself.  She didn't feel like talking to her siblings or cousins, or even her favorite playthings among the servants at the moment.  She tried to pray, as her sister had suggested, but her thoughts would not be still enough for her to concentrate on the litanies.  Growing agitated, she paced her rooms, frowning.  &quot;What does Vhalshae know of what I do and how I do it&quot;, she thought.  &quot;Prayer may solve her problems, but not mine.  I am of the Ebon Mask.  We find our answers in the shadows, down in the dirt and the blood.  Kneeling on marble floors is all well and good for the Prophets, but not the stealthy Eyes of the Father.&quot;  Silently she resolved to do whatever she had to, but she would do it in her own way.<br>
<br>
&quot;My eyes are the Eyes of Innoruuk, the seeds of Hatred shall be sown amongst all,&quot; Tzanntiel muttered softly.  It was the section of the Litany of Purpose spoken by the Rogues of the Ebon Mask as part of one of the high rituals of the Spires.  As a youth the words hadn't meant much to her, but now she understood and savored each word.<br>
<br>
When Tzanntiel entered the Grange the next evening, she felt a chilling calm over the hate that burned within her.  She couldn't recall a time when she had felt so directed.  She paused at the gate, looking over the pair of Trolls who guarded the door, outfitted in piece-mail armour that she recognized.  It had been re-fitted for the large creatures from the armour of the Teir'Dal guards who used to serve the Grange in the time of the Harvest.  She raised an eyebrow as she walked past them, wondering what other changes and surprises the once-Thresher had in store for the meeting.<br>
<br>
More Trolls patrolled and guarded the halls, looking awkward and uncertain of their new duties.  One noticed her wandering and directed her to one of the larger meeting rooms.  Inside she found Daiunus, and more than a dozen other people.  It seemed the spirit of the Harvest still moved many hearts pure in hate.  Some of the people she recognized, others she'd never seen before.  A few kept to the shadows so well she could not even identify them.<br>
<br>
The meeting itself was fairly brief as such things go.  Daiunus explained his vision, and what he planned to create.  Some of those gathered seemed uneasy, they argued for the new company to be more like the Harvest had been.  But Tzanntiel could see the wisdom of what Daiunus had planned.  The Harvest was over.  If they simply tried to recreate what the Prophecies had wrought, they would fail.  This new group, Hate's Culling he called it, would be something different, founded in the new age the Harvest had prepared for Norrath.  Tzanntiel also liked the idea of the non-Teir`Dal having more freedoms that they had had in the Harvest.  She herself used many contacts and allies from outside the Chosen Race, and she knew how capable they could be when given free rein.  By the end of the meeting, everyone present was in agreement, and loudly supported Daiunus' new guild.<br>
<br>
As Tzanntiel left the Grange, she felt buoyant, as if the secret weights she bore had been set aside for a while.  No one had mentioned her brother during the meeting, and she felt that was a good sign.  If one or more of the conspirators had been there, they must have no idea that Khasirath had been removed from their hiding place.  Though it may feel like time was growing shorter, no one was directly opposing her efforts in any way she could divine.<br>
<br>
Leaving Neriak behind, Tzann returned to Shadow Haven.  Her holiday was over, and it was time to return to work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
