His teacher sat with him just across the table. “You’re either very brave or very stupid to show your face here again, Knight,” his teacher finally said, breaking the ill silence that the two had been suspended in for the better part of an hour. “The Queen even held audience with you after what you did... It was a bit hard to believe until I saw it for myself. The Indigo Brotherhood wants you banned from the city and the Spires tell me that the Dark Lord Himself has said that you will not be returned next time you are slain. That is the only reason you are allowed beyond the gates. What you did sickens me, Magil. A Knight of the Queen’s Dark Army does not hunger for the flesh of his own brothers and your plot to off Zexus didn’t please anyone either. I have been asked personally by the King to kill you myself but I can not do it.” Magil glanced up with an eyebrow raised but remained silent. His teacher spoke again, “It’s getting late, Magil. I’m going to retire. You’d better not cause any more trouble or I’m going to have to kill you. I don’t want to by any degree, but I must if you threaten the city once more.” “Goodnight, Nezzka,” was the only words that crossed Magil’s lips as Tolax stood and exited. Magil stayed, swishing his drink around in its glass.<br>
<br>
A tall Iksar entered, wearing nothing more than the tired rags of a beggar. He had a look around and stopped on the place where Magil was seated. He went over and sat down in the chair that Tolax had neglected to push back under the table. “Seems like I’m not the only one who can’t sleep tonight.” The words flowed from the forked tongue of the Iksar in perfect Teir`Dal as if he had been born so himself. Magil glanced up again, a bit surprised. “Who in the hell are you? How did you get in here?” was all he could think to ask. “I have served under the King in the past. He allows me free passage in the parts of the city that are not consecrated holy ground to your people,” was the Iksar’s reply. “Well that do they call you?” Magil asked, a bit intrigued now. “I am Brother Quiqui, a monk of Cazic-Thule.” “I guess that explains your choice of dress,” Magil snickered. <br>
<br>
The two talked on. Magil grew angrier and angrier. For no particular reason, he felt a burning hatred toward this disciple of Thule. His tongue spit acid into Magil’s mind. It became painful to listen to him. Quiqui talked on, unaware of his new friend’s condition. Magil stared blankly at him; all that was Magil was no longer there. He was just a smoldering ember in a room full of powerful spirits, ready to burst into an unrelenting rage at the Iksar. “Magil?” inquired Quiqui. He had started to notice his friend’s absence. “Shut up!” snarled Magil. “Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” Magil stood abruptly from his chair and threw the table aside, his hand on the pommel of his blackened sword. Quiqui jumped from his seat and grabbed for Magil’s sword, wrenching it from his grasp and throwing it to the floor behind him. “Are you alright, Magil?” he asked. Magil wasn’t there anymore. He reached inside his belt bag, drew a dagger, and stabbed for the Iksar’s heart. Reacting before Magil had his hand all the way out of the bag, Quiqui stepped back and grabbed Magil’s wrist from the top, stopping the advance of the blade. <br>
<br>
Quiqui felt his mind explode into a fury when his hand contacted Magil’s. This rage was new to him; he was powerless against its might. With Magil’s wrist still locked between his thumb and middle finger, Quiqui cupped his palm around the tips of Magil’s fingers. He brought his own hand up and forward, shattering bone into nerves and tearing through the muscles in Magil’s wrist. Magil fell to his knees in agony. What was this? Magil had never felt such intense, razor-sharp pain. The dagger fell from Magil’s grasp and Quiqui caught it with his tail, flinging it through the chest of the guard who had decided to join the fight from behind.<br>
<br>
“What do you want!?” Magil was struggling with consciousness. Quiqui smiled darkly at him. “This time, Magil, you’re not going to win.” The words pierced him as if a sword. There was nothing Magil could do. His entire body was paralyzed from the pain of Quiqui’s grip. He could think of only one thing. His hand shimmered with the power he had known since his birth. “I don’t think so,” Quiqui grinned. “Oh?” Magil let the power free from his hand and into the Iksar and the malevolent energy only arced off the scales and fizzled into the air. Magil’s face turned from one of pain to one of fear. This was a pure fear, the knowledge that one is going to meet absolution. Magil didn’t want to go. He hadn’t finished his purpose. He cursed himself for being so careless with his life in the past. This was the end of the X`azhagal bloodline. No! This couldn’t be happening! Quiqui knew. He knew well.<br>
<br>
Magil felt something inside his body. It was pulling for his soul. The world blackened. The pain faded. Both departed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ucreapiing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>creapiing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/02 9:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=264.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Finality</span><hr size=1> great story Magil, nice to see you are still around and writing a bit.<br>
