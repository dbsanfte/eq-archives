The proof sat before him, the head of his once and former Lord, a creature as powerful as a god, and one that could only be destroyed by legendary warriors.  The Breagan D'Aerthe would be one of those legends, a childhood fantasy that was now bound in truth.  Daiunus could not stifle a laugh as he thought of the legends of Innoruuk being at his call, it was just unbelievable.  Daiunus looked back at the wardesk and the plans upon it, knowing that even the most difficult plans just became possible.<br>
<br>
The new Thresher looked at his assistant, &quot; Destroy this letter, and the envelope, I will not soon forget the words or directions written within.  The bag,&quot;  Daiunus hesitated, &quot; leave the bag, I will hide this well myself.&quot;  With that, the assistant took the letter and brought it to the heat of the torch that Daiunus had lit in order to read his letters, and warplans.  The assistant then left the room, leaving the Thresher to his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Daiunus raised the head from the bag, looking directly into the cold, lifeless eyes of Mayong Mistmoore, &quot; Aye M'lord,&quot; Daiunus said with sarcasm dripping of venom and Hate, &quot; The Breagan D'Aerthe do exist, and they are behind me and the Harvest.&quot;  Daiunus sank back into his chair, tossing the gift of the Breagan D'Aerthe unto the wardesk, for him to admire while he sat contemplating the next move that he would make.<br>

The servant and guards had heard nothing while he had been inside, and had continued to guard the door as ordered.  Khasirath walked slowly, almost stiffly.  His face was a passionless mask, and the redness of his eyes could easily be mistaken for the rage that was common to the Chosen.<br>
<br>
The servant bowed low as the Dire Overlord stepped out and handed him the keys. “Have some men take the dead out of there.  They are to be burned,” he said simply.<br>
<br>
Blinking in confusion, the servant stuttered, “But… but my Lord, the dead are always taken to the Lodge for their experiments…”<br>
<br>
Khasirath snarled as he suddenly grabbed the man by the tunic, pulling him close and almost off his feet, “I will not be questioned, fool!  I said burn them.  You will see it done yourself, or you will join the dead.”<br>
<br>
Pushing the servant back against the wall of the hallway, Khasirath turned away.  Regaining control of his anger he looked back over his shoulder at the cowering man.  “Once the bodies are removed, you will gather my personal servants to see to the cleaning.  I will give them my own instructions.”<br>
<br>
Slowly the Dire Overlord walked back through the Grange to his office.  He nodded to those he passed, but did not stop to talk.  He had no real answers for them, and had much thinking still to do.<br>
<br>
Inside his office he gave his manservant Dythos explicit directions for the ones who would be cleaning the Reaper’s office.  Once the young Rogue had hurried off to deliver the orders Khasirath sat back in his chair, sighing deeply.<br>
<br>
Burning the bodies would most likely bring a review from the Lodge.  But he could face Nezzka Tolax and his displeasure.  Whatever had come over Creapiing it seemed clear to him that she wanted those people silenced.  He knew they all served her, and as such may have known something that should not be passed on.  The Lodge of the Dead was most canny when it came to unearthing information.  Access to those bodies would be almost the same as giving them the keys to her office.<br>
<br>
Even without understanding what this all meant, and what would happen now, Khasirath knew he must do what he could to support and assist the Reaper.<br>
<br>
Khasirath walked to the side table of the office, and set a cone of incense in the small brazier he kept there.  He lit it and sat back down in his chair, trying to relax as the familiar scent filled the air.  He found his thoughts far too chaotic to properly meditate, the concerns and the loss filling his mind.<br>
<br>
He unclasped his bracers and put them on his desk, then drew a keen-edged dagger from his belt.  Slowly he drew the blade across his wrist, slim parallel lines of blood welling up.  His eyes half closed as he centered on the pain, letting it drive all thoughts from his mind until stillness reigned within.<br>
<br>
Setting the blade down he licked the blood from his wrist, a soft growling sigh leaving him as his hate finally flared to life, bringing him into harmony with his God.  Resting his head back his body grew still as he sank into communion with Innoruuk.<br>
