The Journey Ahead<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The young Shadow Knight strode confidently into the Dark forest of the Teir'Dal...Today he had business to attend to...The Soldier he sought was not one of Innoruuks chosen he was exactly the opposite...This one he was to meet was of the Lightborn...A wandering monk...A memeber of the Silent Fist Clan...The relationship they shared was long standing and the respect mutual...Darkehn sought to further his knowledge of combat..Who better to teach him of strengths and weakness' than a man who could bring down his enemies using only his bare hands??? They had crossed paths in the past and had even shared in some carnage...This one loved to fight...His only thought was of furthering his physical and mental perfection...Finally the one he sought appeared from the shadows cast by a grove of trees...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Knight of Shadows&quot; he said, confidence seeped from his very core.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we ready then?&quot; Darkehn asked with his usual boyish grin beaming.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet&quot; the monk stated as he drew closer to the young Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
With a flash the martial expert was upon him relentlessly pummeling him with fists that seemed to hit unaturally hard and fast...Darkehn drew his steel as he fell upon the ground...The first assault knocked the wind from him and bruised more than his hide...Jumping to his feet the child of the Prince of Hate whirled around to face his adversary...But the monk was no where in sight...&quot;This one is indeed swift&quot; Darkehn mumbled to himself turning his gaze towards the shadows once more...The monk emerged from the shadows once more holding in his hand the very necklace he had inherited from his father...Smiling the lightborn placed the collar on the forest floor and backed away...<br>
<br>
&quot;Take it&quot; the man said as he smiled, &quot;If you can.&quot;<br>
The rage welled up inside of the young soldier...He lunged forward pretending to go for the necklace but at the last moment as the monk swooped down to intercept him Darkehn swung his axe in an upward arc squarely into the mans chest...The blow caught him off guard and sent him reeling back clutching his torso...The armor absorbed most of the impact but a small wound was present; blood seeped through his fingers...<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhh trickery, always a Teir'Dal's best ally&quot; The monk said as he gritted his teeth obviously perturbed...<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;OOC&gt; Well that is just a start I shall post the rest soon. This story in part explains my absence from the Game....More to come stay tuned...<br>

<br>
&quot;And it seems to me that trickery is also an ally of yours&quot; Darkehn said wiping the sweat from his brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye&quot; The monk replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;For one so agile you did not evade my strike&quot; the young Shadow knight started in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hah!&quot; the monk laughed &quot;I merely test you&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you to be angered by my actions Lynxe&quot; Darkehn said. Never before had he spoken his adversaries name aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not get angry young one I merely wait and strike when the time is right&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And when would that time be?&quot; Darkehn asked wearily.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will not know it when it comes Darkehn. For it will come swift and without warning&quot; Lynxe smiled as he said this and looked toward the tunnel leading into the Eastern Commonlands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we done playing around yet?&quot; Darkehn asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe so&quot; <br>
<br>
Lynxe turned to exit the dark forest with the young soldier of Innoruuk in towe. He knew that the young shadow knight was not to be trusted but some how he sensed that his new student would excel in the arts of war. Darkehn knew full well that his actions wmight be frowned upon by the Harvest but his thirst for knowledge and understanding drew him to the Pale One. This one knew much of the ways of man. His understanding of this would indeed help Darkehn on his path to glory. Darkehn followed the monk through the land of Deserts and forests and onto a great boat. This boat the Monk told him would take them to there destination. The untamed wilds of Kunark.<br>
<br>
OOC: This is the rest of what I have...I should be back soon to Check up on things. Thank you for your patience<br>

Re: The Journey Ahead<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I had heard from a merchant friend who had seen<br>
Darkehn battling the monk, Lynxe. Knowing Darkehn<br>
was a part of the Violent Harvest, he watched with<br>
interest as he saw the two leaving together, and<br>
he contacted me.<br>
<br>
This monk was then seen by my spies in Kunark, so<br>
I managed to get word to him that I wished to meet<br>
with him. Of course, I was concerned with one of<br>
my family's well-being, and I wanted to know if he was<br>
in danger. Had this monk hurt Darkehn or held him against<br>
his will in any way, I was fully prepared to slay him on<br>
the spot. I will never tolerate anyone who takes<br>
action against a member of the Violent Harvest, unless,<br>
of course, it is a command of the Triad, heh heh.<br>
<br>
We made a mutual agreement to meet in the area<br>
between The Overthere and Frontier Mountains. After<br>
spending a wretched evening of hunting at Lake <br>
Rathe, I made the journey. In the back of my mind,<br>
I could see Serapis shaking his finger at me for travelling<br>
like this unescorted, yet this evening, I was filled with<br>
enough rage and hate for any encounter.<br>
<br>
With some trepidation, I cast shadows on myself and<br>
began the harrowing trip to the entrance of the Frontier<br>
Mountains. When I arrived at our predetermined spot,<br>
I saw the monk sitting under one of the trees at the side<br>
of the path. <br>
<br>
He motioned for me to take a seat beside him on the <br>
grass. I glanced all about, looking for any sign of an<br>
ambush, but could see nothing. I warily sat down on a<br>
grassy patch and looked him in the eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is Darkehn?&quot; I queried, never averting my gaze.<br>
I would know if he were trying to deceive me.<br>
<br>
&quot;He is well, Dark Lady,&quot; he replied, a slight smile on<br>
his lips. &quot;I will not harm him, be assured. I only<br>
have his best interest at heart. Now, it is true, he<br>
may suffer some cuts and bruises along they way, but<br>
they only serve to make that young one stronger.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was puzzled by the comments the monk made. It<br>
appeared that Darkehn had come willingly, but I just<br>
couldn't be sure. There had to be some good reason<br>
that he would risk being chided by the Triad for this<br>
&quot;lapse&quot; of judgement. What could Darkehn learn from<br>
one such as this?<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Dark Lady, you seem puzzled,&quot; he laughed. &quot;So<br>
be it. You don't believe that your young soldier is well.<br>
You will have to trust me.&quot; With that, he stood up, and <br>
ran off into the night. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll return on the morrow, so you may hunt with me and<br>
judge for yourself,&quot; he yelled back. &quot;You'll see.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was too long a trip to turn back now. I plan on trying<br>
to hunt with him for a bit. My only concern is knowing that<br>
a Pale One has such influence over one of Innoruuk's <br>
Chosen. Ack!! <br>
<br>
I managed to find a safe place to rest after my<br>
meeting with Lynxe and pondered my course of action for<br>
our next encounter. <br>
<br>
Be well, young Darkehn, whereever you might be.<br>
