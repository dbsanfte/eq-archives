<br>
Mercenaries have received some improvements in the past few months but they are still the least popular tank in Albion by a large margin. All the Team Leads agree that the Mercenary and blademasters are by far the most useless, gimp, unpopular melee-based class in the game. And we have numbers to back us up - these classes are lowest in the charts of &quot;Number of each class in the top 25 for RP's earned&quot; and &quot;Total RP of each class&quot; by a large margin compared to the other melee based classes. Also any chart comparing number of people playing each class shows that Mercenaries and blademasters are very significantly lower in popularity than the other melee classes, and are getting lower every day. Even the &quot;Hybrid&quot; tanks that are being looked at now are much more popular than the DW tanks, and with the recent changes to them even Friars can now tank better (more damage output and less damage received) than Merc's can...<br>
<br>
The Mercenary Community would like to thank the item devs for remebering Mercs in the recent itemization of Lyonesse and Dartmoor.<br>
<br>
BUGS<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Some older Merc's that were affected by the bug where they would not get Engage from training in Shields are still missing it. Any Merc's created after that bug was fixed are getting it just fine, but those that already trained past 7 in shields when that bug was still there are still missing Engage. There aren't many Merc's left that have this problem however.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Merc's cannot hotkey Shields since the shield slot is being used by their second weapon. Please allow shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield/weapon combo for RVR purposes. Blocking arrows and bolts in RVR is the only reason we ever use a shield, but this limitation makes it hard to even do that.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Bleed based styles do not scale in damage like other styles. They always cause the same amount of bleed damage no matter how high the spec level is for that style list. This affects all tank classes with bleed styles.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; The message when using Dirty Tricks is &quot;You cast an increased fumbles spell!&quot; - it should be changed to something like &quot;You throw dirt in 's eyes!&quot; ...since when were we spell casters? <br>
<br>
TOP ISSUES<br>
<br>
#1 Our DW style list is PATHETIC and USELESS, worst in the game, even Thrust is better! My own Merc uses Thrust styles instead of DW styles, how pathetic is that?? See my previous reports for details, but mostly it's because they do pathetically low bonus damage, less than even Slash and MUCH less than Left Axe, 2-handed, or Polearms. Also the bonus damage doesn't apply to the second hand on a double-hit, meaning it only applies to half our total damage that round (whereas one-weapon users have style bonuses apply to their total damage that round), AND it has NO no-opening style chains at all, making it very un-versatile for a tank class. This is the main reason why we are STILL outdamaged by 2-handed/polearm/etc. and thus is the biggest problem with the class.<br>
<br>
#2 We have no purpose in RVR, it's not worth even showing up. We are plagued with the same issues as every other tank (getting mezzed, unable to catch up to speeding archers to fight back, etc.) but even more so because of our inferiority compared to the heavy tank of our realm. We can't take hits like an Armsmen, we can't kill stuff as fast as an Armsmen (see #1), we can't shoot at long range as well as an Armsmen, and we have no advantages in any other aspects like mobility or detecting stealthed units or sneaking up on people or any of that stuff either. We can't move fast enough to catch up to those speedy archers and their run spells and we don't have any no-opening styles that slow them down, casters just stun/mez us or nuke us from a distance, and we can't even do decent damage to doors with our tiny damage weapons - we're really nothing more than a target for basically every other class besides blademasters. Please implement something for us DW classes such as Sprint II, Charge, or some kind of Snaring ability in order to allow us to get close to archers and casters, or something else to add RVR viability like Detect Hidden or Camaflage. You can find details on these suggested abilities and how they could work without unabalancing the class in my previous reports.<br>
<br>
OTHER ISSUES<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; We can't train in Shortbows like Armsmen can train in Crossbows. It is completely unfair that the Armsmen can train in long range attacks for increased accuracy and damage and we can't even though we get bows before they do. Also many bows throughout the realm, including our level 20 Epic bow reward, give Shortbows bonuses which don't do anything since we can't train in them anyway (and no one else uses Shortbows but us in Albion)!<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Dual Wield classes should have an increased chance to Parry. It makes sense that it would be easier to Parry using two small swords than it would be to Parry using one huge 2-handed sword. Recent information suggests that 2-hand users had a bug making it so they were Parried more often then they were supposed to - if this bug is fixed, it will give them an even larger advantage over us than they already had (since we will thus Parry them less often), so making us get a DW Parry bonus would help maintain balance. Just go out in the yard and try it yourself using some sticks. Two short sticks versus one really long large stick. Try to do the motions of swinging and then parrying with the two short ones then try it with the large one. Now implement your findings into your code.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; If the chance to do a double-hit while using Dual Wield is affected by the enemy's level, please remove this factor. It is unfair considering that the 15% 2-handed bonus and the Left Axe bonus damage are unaffected in this way (other then the normal damage reduction from a high level mob that we all have to deal with). This could be the reason that DW/CD still seems to do less damage then expected.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Please make the next fix to Mercenaries a fix to only Mercenaries (and maybe BM's). Remember that Assassins and Rangers use DW/CD as well, but they don't usually put more than 10 points into it if that. Please stop making all our fixes be more for them than us! They have their own issues, and I don't think DW/CD is really one of them any more. Assassins are quickly becoming better tanks than Merc's and BM's with their high evade and other abilities and the almost the same DW power as we have with the high base chance and low rewards for putting points in it. Instead, reward those of us that actually put points into DW/CD by massively improving our pathetic style list and either further increasing the DW/CD chance reward for each point spent or adding new abilities for high spec in DW/CD. Also consider bonuses to DW ability based purely on class, that would thus benefit Merc's and BM's but not have any affect on Assassins and Rangers, such as a &quot;Dual Wield II&quot; skill that boosts DW ability and is only given to Merc's and BM's.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
<br>
Currently Mercenaries are a gimmick class overshadowed in every way by Armsmen, due to a vastly inferior style list that prevents them from doing as much damage; worse armor, less hitpoints, and the weakest Evade in the game (Evade I) making them have lower defensive ability (and a harder time pulling off the many DW styles dependant on Evade); worse long range attack because they cannot place spec points in their bow ability like Armsmen can; and they do not even have the advantage of mobility or stealth-type abilities that the class description indicates they should have - an Armsmen is just as capable in these regards as a Mercenary. <br>
<br>
As long as this remains true, Mercenaries are an unfinished class. Since our class is fairly simple, fix the issues I've listed here and you'll be pretty much done with the class - and most of these are pretty simple changes.<br>
