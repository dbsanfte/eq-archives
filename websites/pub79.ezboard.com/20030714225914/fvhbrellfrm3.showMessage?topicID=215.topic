Turmoil seemed to abound in this dark place. Something was afoot.. So many different schemes that it would drive a mortal insane trying to decipher them all. <br>
<br>
In silence it continued to move through the halls of the grange. Watching, listening and learning. It sensed an absence. Where was he? A sudden rage filling it. Who had overstepped the Fathers desires? Who had taken his prophet?<br>
It stopped briefly in shock. Why did it care what became of him? <br>
<br>
It reasoned.. it was not his time. His fate was for the Father to decide, not some mere mortal. And so it moved once more. It would unravel the mistery. It would find and free him. And then it would seek the Fathers judgement upon the one who saught to destroy the Harvest. <br>
<br>
Emerald eyes narrowed as it watched the mage move from her house. It followed unseen as she made her way to Khasirath's side. And it listened as they spoke briefly. Yes.. she had much to gain from his disappearance. Should she prove culpable.. she would rue the day. <br>
<br>
Another thought flashed. And it found itself deep within the sulferic tunnels of the Iksar. The heat sweltered and yet even here the shadows prevailed. It watched as he came to terms with his confusions. As he made his choice. <br>
<br>
Emerald eyes narrowed as it sensed another, the eyes flashing as they connected with perhaps the only other being here who could at this time see it. The undead enchanter. A subtle grin pulled upon its lips as it held his gaze. &quot;Feel it.. &quot; the thought flashed in his mind. &quot;Know your weakness.. &quot;.. <br>
It chuckled silently as his eyes widened. &quot;See your judgement.. &quot; and then it was gone.. leaving him to ponder it, and its message.. <br>
<br>
Eyes closed as it thought long and hard on the matters at hand. Who could be trusted? It knew instinctively. Changes where made. Upon opening its eyes it found itself kneeling before the Father. His anger was palpable. It seemed to have a life of its own. She nodded as he raged, his commands explicit. The vampyre would be the key in this. <br>
<br>
Softly whispered words found it once more within the heart of Neriak. Its mission clear. Gone where the vestiage of mortality. In its place Innoruuk's handmaiden now stood. His Valkyrie, his sword of judgement. The culling was at hand. Anquish would darken the lightless streets. Blood would taint the waters. Death would come to those who misstepped. <br>
<br>
Again the scenery changed and in dreams it made itself known to the Vampyre first. The vision of it like some dark twisted avenging angel. The chosen.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukhasirath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khasirath</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.violentharvest.com/sigs/vh_anim.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/12/02 2:01:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/unospiratus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nospiratus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mad One</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/7/02 10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Blood Harvest</span><hr size=1> The screams started in the foreign quarter, early in the cycle that humans would have called the night.  Neriak was a city that lived without stopping, not held to the standards of the sun, but still there was a time when many chose to rest or find their pleasures in the sports of their choosings.  This hour, this changing of the guard in the city from labor to revelry, was when the screams began.<br>
<br>
Screams were nothing new to Neriak, certainly not in the foreign quarter.  But as they spread, the laughter in the taverns changed, dulled and faded.  Screams filled the air from too many points at once, and they were too filled with anguish to be explained away as blood sports.  These shrieks, these cries, were filled with horror.<br>
<br>
The guard quickly began to move toward one scream, only to hear another in the opposite direction.  Reinforcements were called, the off-shift guard called in by the chiming of the Watch Stones.  Within an hour, the entire city militia had been turned out to take up posts in the Commons in an effort to stymie whatever force had attacked the city of stone.<br>
<br>
Slowly, the cries in the Foreign Quarter gave way, and the guards began to relaxe.  Most guards that is.  Dvin L'Crit of course kept his troops at full attention, looking for the cause, ivestigating the strange lack of bodies.  Blood was evrywhere, splattered across walls, pooled upon the streets, spilling out of door jams, but there were no bodies.  Dvin was studying some footprints through one large pool, the strange orange tint proving that it was an ogre that had found death waiting by the pottery wheels, when his sharp, elven ears picked up a sound that had not been heard in the city for decades - three high pitched whistles, droning in disharmonic threat.  Third Gate was under attack.<br>
<br>
The militia blaocking all access to the Commons, quickly divided, half speeding for the inner city, half maintaining their posts.  By the time they arrived in the Third Gate, they found the blood already seeping across the walkways of the temple.  Now at least there was a body, or part of one.  The head of the priest was missing, but his robed body lay sprawled across the gangway, still twitching when the first guards arrived.  the regent Symbol of Innoruuk that had graced his neck, lay smoking in the crimson gore.  As before, the screams were everywhere at once, but no host of invaders could be found.  The screams lasted all night, a night of blood, a night of shadows, a night of the harvesting of souls.  This was the night of the Blood Harvest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ufaeolin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faeolin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Overlord</span><br>  Posts: 428<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/7/02 1:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whispering shadows.. </span><hr size=1> The altar of the Dragon of Hate was her destination.  It was there, the most sacred of places that Faeolin knelt.  Stone grated against her greaves as she adjusted into a more comfortable position.  <br>
<br>
As she took her hand from the sword in her scabbard she laughed grimly at the name of her blade.  &quot;Defiance,&quot; she thought.  &quot;How fitting that you will be at the forefront of the battles to come.&quot;  She then covered up the blade of her axe &quot;Frostbringer,&quot; lest its magical coldness freeze itself to her armour.  Taking the skull of her mother from her head, she felt it magically soften itself and revert back to the bone that it once was.  To come before the Dragon with weapons drawn, or head covered, was considered disrespect to the point of blasphemy.  <br>
<br>
How many times had she witnessed or partaken in ceremonies here.  It was here, that she had been bound to the Harvest.  Again, she had knelt when the oaths of Dread Lord were taken.   Immeasurable was her pride at being honored so.  She had been rewarded by the Father time after time.  No longer even, could she be considered a Champion of the Harvest.  She was a Myrmidon, both honoured and feared. <br>
<br>
The Violent Harvest swore to do the Fathers will, swore to always Hate with Honor.  The oaths spoken here gauranteed that.  The blood of so many, had been let into the sacred chalice.  Each time, the bonding within grew stronger and stronger.  <br>
<br>
How unbelievable then, the figurehead of the Harvest, had been the first to fail those oaths.  With her own eyes, Faeolin had seen injustice done.  With those same eyes, she had watched with horror as honor was cast aside.  <br>
<br>
What were oaths that were not kept?  How could hatred unchecked be used to further the will of Innoruuk.  Why should she keep promises to those who failed to do the same?<br>
<br>
&quot;I remain your child, Father,&quot; she prayed.  &quot;Although you have not found my hatred worthy, I still offer it up to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then, that the screams began to ring out over the 3rd gate.  The whistles blew, and still Faeolin knelt.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Harvest has failed you, Father.  Perhaps not all of us, but the spirit of the Harvest is dead.  To me, your will remains my will.  I will gather up, those who remain true to you.  I ask that you bless us Father, give us the strength and the purity of hatred.  Let us persevere as we strike down those who failed the oaths spoken here.  Let me prove worthy of the task you have revealed to m....&quot;<br>
<br>
Even with her mind completely open to her prayers, Faeolin became aware of movement behind her.  Rolling quickly to the side, she drew her weapons and stood in one smooth practiced motion.  As a veteran of many campaigns, Faeolin  had survived countless ambushes.  She was prepared now for any attack.  <br>
<br>
To her great surprise she was not being assaulted this time.    What she had thought to be an attack upon her was merely a robed Teir'Dal.  He had gathered his robes up to run and was past her in an instant.  Sheer terror showed clearly on his face as he began to chant.  Magic began to shimmer, and a portal opened and began to immediately close around him.    Before he could complete his spell of gating, a sword flashed from the blackness of the shadows.  With a splattering of blood, his life ended.  He never even drew breath to scream.<br>
<br>
As the shadows coalesced into the shape of a woman, Faeolin gasped.  A wave of hatred crashed over her, so pure and so complete that it took her breath away.  Never again would the warrioress feel such contempt.  Only in the realm of the Father himself, could creatures like this be seen.  Instinctively, Faeolin relaxed her guard and knelt, preparing for the blow that was sure to come.  <br>
<br>
It took only a moment for the spirit to measure the armoured woman splayed out before her.  This one struggled, but endeavored to remain true to the wishes of the Prince of Hate.  Judgement made, the form returned to the shadows and renewed it's assault upon the unworthy.  <br>
<br>
Only when the screams began again, did Faeolin dare to look up.  Some of the blood from the corpse, had landed on her gauntlets.  <br>
<br>
&quot;My hands are covered in blood, before they have struck a blow.  I recognize the sign, and I will be obedient.&quot;  <br>
<br>
With those words, Faeolin once again placed the skull of the last Matron of House R'Danya back upon her head.  Her weapons already bloody, she made for the Grange. <p>Faeolin R'Danya<BR>

Vresk stood for a moment silhouetted by the relative brightness behind him before he strode through the entrance and into the Grange proper.  Servants, already busy with much of the sudden preparations for war, scrambled aside.  Some were merely attempting to get out of his way, and others attempted to tend to his wounds.  The monk had no time for either.<br>
<br>
The flames of Hate danced both in his blue eyes and the red fire that limned the sigil on his left arm.  Without even a greeting to the other warriors of Hate, he stalked into his chambers.  He was angered briefly at what he found there.<br>
<br>
All his incense was burning.  His meditation items arranged just so.  It wasn’t that anything wasn’t the way he preferred it.  It was merely the fact that he knew one or more of the servants or slaves were taking care of his needs against his wishes.  Perhaps his anger was more geared towards the fact that tonight, of all nights, he was almost happy that he had little else to prepare for his meditation.  The matter was of little consequence, and pushed out of Vresk’s mind entirely.<br>
<br>
Quickly he disrobed, putting everything in its proper place.  Then, going to the steaming stream at the back of the chamber (kept warm by the lava tube running close to the surface here, the same lava tube that made his chamber uncomfortable for the Teir’Dal), he cleansed himself both physically and spiritually.  A few dried scales fell off, but all in all, he hardly looked like he’d been in intense battle.<br>
<br>
Having cleansed himself, he concentrated on finding his center before stepping carefully into the middle of the chamber and slipping into deep meditation.  Immediate chaos ensued.  A devastated landscape full of rotting corpses and flowing blood filled his senses.  A million souls cried out a single word.  A single name.  Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
The monk quickly centered himself again before being overwhelmed by the vision.  His vision blurred and shifted.  When it again became clear, he found himself facing a shadow figure.  Its entire body from head to toe was composed of blackest pitch.  In the background stood an enormous dragon which Vresk immediately recognized as the Dragon of Hate.<br>
<br>
Vresk studied the figure in more detail.  It was humanoid in shape, a bit short for a full blooded human though.  Perhaps some sort of elf.  He couldn’t make out any details of the face at all.  *Dark tidings, Faceless One* he projected mentally to the figure.<br>
<br>
The figure moved, appearing to center its attention on the monk.  *So you have come at last*<br>
<br>
*Aye* the Iksar was wary, untrusting of this situation.  Normally he controlled his own visions during his meditations, but he sensed now that he wasn’t completely the master here.<br>
<br>
*You have reached the status of Master of your people, Vresk.  MY people.  The people I created*<br>
<br>
*My journey has come far.  I have further yet to go*<br>
<br>
The figure chuckled darkly.  The sound reminded him of the lizardman throwbacks in the Temple of Cazic Thule.  *So you come from victory in the battles and return a humble monk?*<br>
<br>
*I simply am what I am, nothing more.  And the Harvest gained no victory this day.  Though Faeolin stands defeated in combat, it is Mythral that yet rises and continues his schemes.*<br>
<br>
*Your words are wise.  Your voice calm.  You hide your fear well, Iksar*<br>
<br>
In his mind, Vresk’s “voice” grew hard.  *There is no fear in me*<br>
<br>
*Oh?*  The figure seemed amused.  *Then what am I then?*<br>
<br>
*A fragment of the Faceless One’s Will, bound to the sigil he trapped within me.  I am here to remove you.  You are no longer welcome.*<br>
<br>
The laughter changed abruptly, and the figure grew larger, more menacing.  *You _dare_ threaten me?*<br>
<br>
*I threaten nobody.  I state a simple fact.  I am the Master here, not you.*<br>
<br>
*I have more control here than you can imagine.*  The figure gestured, and the landscape changed abruptly.  They were overlooking Cabilis.  Or rather the ruins of Cabilis.  Buildings and pillars had collapsed in on themselves, and fires burned in over half the city.  Bodies were everywhere.  Burned, twisted, gutted.  And in one corner, preparing the final defense, a full legion of Iksar; warriors, shadowknights, monks, shamans, necromancers, all the remaining force of the Empire gathered.<br>
<br>
Outside the city was the source of the conflict.  Hundreds of Teir’Dal surrounded the city.  Engines of war were rolled into place, and another volley of flaming material was sent crashing into the ruined city.<br>
<br>
The last remaining legion marched out of battle, and the Teir’Dal army prepared.  They were tense, waiting for something.  All eyes were at the head of the dark elf columns, awaiting a signal.  A single Iksar stood at the head of the amassed army.  An armor clad figure approached the Iksar.  The monk could tell by the insignia on the figure’s insignia that it was the Thresher of the Harvest.  “What are you orders?”<br>
<br>
“Kill them.  ALL of them,” the voice was Vresk’s own.  “Let no Iksar survive the Violent Harvest.”<br>
<br>
And the battle was joined.  The details of the battle mattered not.  The end results did.  Of the mighty empire of the Iksar, not a single survivor remained.  Vresk’s final act was to survey the carnage before ending his own life.<br>
<br>
*This is what you head for.  Traitor to your own people.  You fear this.  I sense it.*<br>
<br>
*You know me not then.  While this is one possibility, it is certainly not the only one.  While I find the possibility of warring with my people regrettable, I will not allow them to continue to stagnate under your current rule.  They will be delivered, or they will perish by my hand.*<br>
<br>
The image of carnage wavered and fell, leaving him alone once again with the dark figure.  Vresk could see that it had faded somewhat.  Some of the background could be seen through its transparent darkness.  *Very well,* the figure projected in his mind.  *You may win this time, but do not think it will always be so.  I will be here lurking, ready to bring you back to where you belong when you grow weak.*<br>
<br>
*You are no longer welcome here*<br>
<br>
*It wasn’t a question, Whiff*<br>
<br>
Vresk felt his Hate gather.  He formed it in his mind into a ball of energy.  A sphere of his pure rage.  The roiling black mass pulsed and writhed.  Vresk hurled it with all his strength at the figure.  There was a tremendous explosion that rocked him back on his tail.  When the smoke cleared, the figure had vanished.<br>
<br>
Vresk came out of his reverie relaxed and somehow feeling cleansed.  He stood in his chambers and looked around.  Stretching his muscles, he exited his chamber, prepared for the coming battles.<br>
