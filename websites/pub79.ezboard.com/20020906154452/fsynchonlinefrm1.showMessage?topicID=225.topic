<br>
Also, what alt would be good for the Guild?<br>
<br>
I have played, well I should say started different characters; Druid, Cleric (loved him - still have him), Shaman, Wizard...I think that is it.  If I do start another, I think I would like the Chanter but who knows.  I am a Tank at heart.<br>

Why are you going to have an alt?  By the time Jag is high enough to allow you time to have an alt, the guild will be completely changed.  Hopefully, there will not be a need for any certain class.<br>
<br>
I created an alt because there are times when I cannot find a group and am too broke to do any trade skills.  My alt, right now, is nothing but a time killer.  Someday I will have Laz where I need her to be and will only use her when needed.<br>
<br>
As far as the goods about clerics:<br>
Groups are usually very easy to find.<br>
Everyone loves clerics.<br>
You get to save and restore lives, which can feel really satisfying.<br>
Because the groups are dependant on your mana, they will do what is needed to ensure you have mana.<br>
<br>
Some bad points about a cleric:<br>
Staring at your spell book through half your life.<br>
Med time at higher lvls is outrageous.  You are reliant on others to help you keep mana.<br>
You are reliant on groups.  Solo'ing is difficult to say the least.<br>
If something goes wrong, 9 out of 10 times, it's the clerics fault, even though most of the time it's not.<br>
You are not allowed to make mistakes....period.  *I know that sounds harsh, but even the people that care about you, still want to know WTF was that?*<br>
At higher lvls you have to go anon so you don't get constant tells to rez people 20 zones away.<br>
You are the center of the group, so if you leave, groups disband.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are many more, but these are the ones that come to mind first.  I can honestly say that the only thing that bothers me is always being questioned over every death.  I feel the good outweights the bad tenfold.  <br>
<br>
So, whatever you choose, do it for yourself.<br>

<br>
Pros:<br>
Any great group can always be improved with a chanter.  Mex and Clarity are sometimes a necessity, and so far (lvl 42) I have not had difficulty finding a group anywhere.<br>
Clarity: Self explanitory...permanent Clarity<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
CHA: Some people say that having to worry about CHA and INT together causes a problem, but with the right gear and camp drops (especially if you plan on twinking)  having both a high int and high cha at the same time isn't very hard to achieve.<br>
Aggro: At the earlier levels, you will die a lot, but later as you are in more experienced groups and with better taunters, this doesn't become a problem<br>
Solo: As a chanter, I never could solo very well at all, but I have heard of some methods that seem to work really well, but I never understood them too well<br>
Money: It may just be me, but I always seem to be broke as a chanter<br>
<br>
Overall its an incredibly fun class with great abilities, and if you like to duel it is even more enjoyable<br>

The best class with the best damage and the most useful abilities is a Rogue. <br>
<br>
One great thing about a Rogue is that you can see more than anyone else in the game. You can walk places most people would be killed even if invis etc...<br>
<br>
Rogues also are very welcome in groups after lvl 45 - 50<br>
(which is the important stage of the game)<br>
<br>
IMHO - LoL<br>
<br>
Plus, Rogues can pick pocket, anytime you're broke just go to Rathe Mountains and pickpocket Hill Giants for an hour or two and come away with a few hundred plat..<br>
(you usually get between 20 - 30 plat per Giant) =)<br>
I have never had to do this because I trade well.  *GriN*<br>
<br>
One more thing about Rogues.. if you have ever had to go afk in a group for a sec and come back and you're dead???<br>
hehe, you can hide / sneak when you go afk and when you come back it won't be you who's dead.. LOL<br>
<br>
Once in DL this Rogue went afk for a min.. the VERY next second the warrior we had  could not pull just one or 2 he pulls like 5 and the rogue died... poor Rogue.. she'll never do that again.. LOL anyways...<br>
<br>
Many many unique abilities a Rogue gets to play with, plus there isn't a lot of them and of the ones there are, most are cheap hacks.. lol<br>
<br>
Also, since this will be an alt you will be twinking it I assume.. and Rogue armor for lvls 30 - 45 (twink armor) is all droppable.. and fairly cheap ( ie. Ravenscale etc..)<br>
<br>
I hope you found this useful as I am honest and not biased to my class. ;-P<br>

<br>
That's right, we're the ultimate mid range class.<br>
<br>
PROS:<br>
<br>
We get a wide range of combat abilities, and a wide range of spells.<br>
<br>
We get hide/sneak, plus camo and lev.  It makes us the perfect explorers.  <br>
<br>
We can forage for food and water, and even make some plat on occasion from selling stacks of foraged goods.<br>
<br>
A Ranger can solo, or find a group; depending on the intelligence and experience of the people who are grouped.  (Some people say rangers are worthless between 22 and 30th.  To that I say HARMONY!)<br>
<br>
Eventually, after a LONG, LONG, LOOOOONG time we get to dish out more damage than any other class, and from range no less.  (C'mon Trueshot!)<br>
<br>
Tracking is the MOST uber skill in the game.  If you drop me in any zone I've spent more than a few hours wandering arround in I can tell you which zone I'm in, where in the zone I am, and which direction I need to go to get out of the zone.  There's also the ease of telling if a quest mob/npc is up without having to look for them.  The same goes for mobs with good drops.  One or two checks on track while moving about the zone and you'll know if they're up.  If you're really good, and know a dungon well, you can even use tracking in a dungon to find your way arround.  Other classes get tracking, but only basic tracking.  Rangers also get to chose between normal/distance/rdistance/difficulty/rdifficulty.  It makes tracking of rangers alot better than other classes.  <br>
<br>
CONS:<br>
<br>
It's sometimes hard to find a group, especially if there's a bunch of ignorant people who don't realize the wide range of ablities that a ranger has.<br>
<br>
Soloing can be expensive if you're not soloing animals.  (Arrows cost money, good arrows cost ALOT of money)<br>
<br>
Ranger equipment is EXPENSIVE.  I have yet to see a great piece of ranger gear that is affordable at the level that it's useful.  (Talon's Darkwood Bracer, Any of the upper level bows, Fleeting Quiver)<br>
<br>
You'll die alot in the upper game.  You'll be the one who has to pull the mob off the caster who's getting smashed about.  Then the Cleric will (most likely) heal the now safe caster and not be able to keep you alive while you're taking damage.  Hence the cry of, &quot;The Ranger died, again?&quot;<br>

shaman have great buffs and offensive spells. plus they can take a few hits now and then. not to mention that it's easy for them to solo if not able to find groups. but shaman are usually wanted. oh and they eventually get a pet<br>

i think you need to wonder what your goals are for this other character. you might reach warrior god status and not have time for another character <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

all in all.. have your goals in place and decide from there what character best suits you. not what people's opinions are of the best character. hell i wouldn't be playing a paladin if i listened to people, but i have a hell of a time with her. wouldn't trade her for the world even though i complain a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There's an island there with spectres on the peaks and skellies and gargoyles arround the edge.  The skellies and goyles are PH's for each other.  When you kill a goyle they can drop a gargoyle eye that sells for 8 or 9 plat.  Good cash for kills that are mid-twenties.  (I think that's their level)<br>
<br>
You can also raise you Paineel Faction in the Warrens and get the key to Paineel from one of the skellies there.  Once inside there's a bunch of low-twenties guards that drop a weapon and shield that you can sell in the town for 8-9 plat.   The best part is that the guards don't seem to be on any faction so you can keep doing this and still have good faction with Paineel erudites.<br>
