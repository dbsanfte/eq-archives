<br>
Tomorrow never comes in a land of eternity, or so it is said, truthfully I welcome the neverending, it holds us to our path and beckons us to more.  Like a carrot dangled before an ass, prophecy is a wonderous motivator and self serving.  <br>
Prophecies, yes what a wonderfull web they weave, they trap the imagination, they lead nations, they chain the masses; self serving and undeniable they are the perfect ruler.  I have come here in search of such a prophecy though I have reconsidered it over a thousand times already.<br>
<br>
The twilight fades to dusk leaving me in shadow;  I prefer it such as most surface dwellers find my appearance reason to flee or attack.  What I seek and what I seek to do should remain in darkness till the time arrives.<br>
<br>
The robed figure crossed the fields unhindered by all form of creature;  no giant no undead or even the drakes would hinder his passing, they knew what lies beneath they could sense it in the core of their beings.  It made its way methodically north towards the great lake Rathe....<br>

<br>
Spinning faster in tight circles around the room her hair a raven banner flowing in the wake of onlookers so captivated by the ferocity and beauty of the dance.  Sweat beaded on her brow and made the soft skin of her nape glisten in the torchlight, they were hers to a man she would have whatever she desired this night.  She wove among the throng of ensorcered men sometimes leaning against them sometimes mearly brushing past twirling and returning time and again from the stage.  Finally the music stopped and the crowed cheered.  <br>
Suddenly three men charged into the tavern, two were obviously of the city watch the other a merchant, the merchant pointed to her and cried.. &quot;There she is, get that thieving gypsie&quot;.<br>
<br>
If not for the fact that most of the men were still stunned by the revelation and that they were busy checking for thier now missing change purses, she would have been caught for sure.  The moments hesitation from those nearest her allowed for a desperate escape.  She lept high into the rafters grabbing the chains supporting the center chandelier and shinnied up into the dark of the rafters.  She ran on the thin beams as a normal man might on a flat road and dove headlong through the open shutters rolling down the eaves and into a hay stack out back. <br>
&quot;Always plan for the worst, forsight will save your life&quot; she mentally thanked her father once again.  She was up in a bolt running hard for the stables but they would reach her before she could mount and flee.  She pulled two of the largest purses she had aquired that evening and through them high spilling the contents across the street behind her.  Every street urchin and begger in Freeport seemed to appear behind her slowing the rushing mob and the city guards.<br>
<br>
She mounted and raced out into the desert of Ro hoping to dash any desire to pursue in the reputation of the harsh arid lands.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well keila, that did not go nearly as well as I had hoped&quot; she looked down at the cat curled up around the saddles horn. It yawned back at her in a sympathetic gesture. &quot;Well we shall see how excited you are when the food runs short&quot; she  scratched its ears and rode on in silence, the road always provided for those who knew how to ride it.<br>

<br>
rolled on as far as the eye could see beating down oppressive masters of life and death.  For those not prepare the deserts of Ro are more often a graveyard then a caravan route.  Walking itself is a labour with the sands pulling and sucking at a traveller's feet.  Alaina now walked as her mount had long since succumbed to the desert sands.<br>
<br>
&quot;We need shelter before we are nothing more than corpses for this infernal sun to bleach&quot; she spoke to the cat now curled up around her neck.  It tapped its tail weakly against her shoulder in agreement.<br>
They travelled for the better part of the mourning before spying the reprieve they sought there ahead was the outline of a palm tree.  They made their way stubbornly towards it, the oasis was a beakon of life to all denizens of the desert there would be others she would need to contend with but the price was to great to turn back.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly there were no animals at the waters edge and no sign of the orc raiders that often camped here.  She thanked her good fortune and fell to her knees at the pools edge and drank deeply of the cool waters.<br>
The waters rippled near the center of the pool.<br>
She finally raised her head from the glutony as a shadow fell across her.  It was though the sun were in eclipse she turned slowly to see the cause of such an odditly only to find herself looking up at the most imposing man she had ever seen, if it was a man at all.<br>
He drew a huge sword easily as large as she was and charged right for her.  Normally she would have dove to the side or rolled to safety but the fatigue and water were too much for her to over come and she closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
The oger hurled himself over the tiny human girl bringing the full force of his six hundred pounds to bear on the crocidile as it burst from the water.  His sword cut a cruel wound in the beasts head and side but the fight was not gone from it yet.  It turned its maw and caught the oger around his waist pulling him under the water.<br>
<br>
She turned weakly to watch the water boiled and churn as the two combatants struggled to gain the upperhand in this ballet of death.  Finally the waters calmed not a ripple graced the surface of the waters, she looked out across the pool and wondered who that man had been to save her life.  He strode from the waters answering that question himself,  with a wicked toothy smile he said...<br>
&quot;Dinner&quot;. and dragged the croc's corpse up the bank towards a hastily errected leanto.<br>
<br>
She watched him walk off to stunned to know what to do,  he was after all an oger and by rights should have taken the easy meal being her.  He looked back at her over his massive shoulder and motioned her to follow.<br>
<br>
She did.... what else was there to do.<br>

stood cold and calm.  He stood on the shores of lake Rathe staring out over it's fog enshrouded banks looking for the tower in the mist.  Finally his eyes survayed a light flickering on one of the larger isles,  he walked out towards the water and stepped out on its surface.  The water hissed and boiled and soon ice formed a thin crust under where he stood;  he strode off towards the isle vanishing into the fog.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;So, whats your name&quot; Alaina inquired.  Her huge companion turned and threw a femure into the pool then turned back to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gahhl,  they call me Gahhl&quot;  He reached to the spit now nearly devoide of the sizzling crocodile and tore off another mutton sized chunk.<br>
She watched him devour the meat with gusto and wondered again what the oger had planned for her.  She ate the rest of her meal in silence feeding small bits to the cat curled up in her lap. It purred contently as it ate the roasted meat tapping its tail on her legs.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what brings you out here&quot; she prodded.&quot; I mean this isn't the most hospitable place to live&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just passing through myself&quot; he stated &quot;Needed to restock my food and water supplies before I continue on&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, well then where does the road take you perhaps I can join you on the road&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think you want to go where the road is taking me, but you may travel with me untill we cross the desert&quot; his tone was one of finality but was by no means angry for sure this was a different oger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent, when shall we leave? Dawn?&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;We leave at sundown,  travel when its cool and rest during the heat of the day.  Get some sleep the sun will be low in the sky soon&quot;.<br>

<br>
gone now, it's burning heat replaced by cold pale moonlight.  The desolation of the Ro sands seemed sureal in this earie light the rolling dunes flowing into one another like a rolling surf.  They had made good time these last few days under the viel of darkness even the flowing sands seemed more forgiving to the travellers.<br>
<br>
She was falling behind,  it had been thus since the first night.  Her legs could not carry her as fast as the oger's loping stride and he seemed never to tire, she jogged to catch him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You.. you say I would not want to go where you are going&quot; she panted &quot;but perhaps you could slow your pace to allow me to at least make it from these sands&quot;.<br>
<br>
He stopped, turned, and bent down to look her in the eye.  &quot;I have no time for your comfort nor your banter, you have two choices girl, keep up and shut up or risk the deserts alone and talk all you want&quot;.<br>
<br>
She blinked and stared at him to dumbfounded to replie.  He had saved her life and seemed quite hospitable but perhaps she was pushing her luck, an oger is after all an oger.<br>
<br>
They continued in silence although she marked the pace had noticably slowed...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He stepped from the water with a hiss. The grass withered under his heal turning black in moments.  The goblins rushed forward spears infront of them in a show of strenght to dissway this intruder they had not even a moment to see the waves of force building around his form.   His form shimmered ans a field of black grey mist formed around his body then expoded out in a three hundred and sixty degree wave.  The goblins stood thier ground bracing for the impact;  as the energy passed through them the flesh ripped from thier bones leaving bleached white skeletins in its wake.  The flesh and blood fell away in a heap of wet torn skin and organs as twin blue lights rose to the heavens their souls returning to Prexus.  <br>
<br>
He held his hands out twin bolts of black lightnight ensnared the light pulling and absorbing them into his body.  His eyes blazed red for a moment and then returned to coal black.<br>
He strode forward to the tower and walked into the chamber of the old chief.  It stood casting and drawing a wand but the speed and ferocity of the attack were staggering.  He crossed the room in a blink driving his fist into the happless goblins chest tearing out his still beating heart.  He held it in front of the dieing goblins eyes to watch its last beating and took the wand from its now limp grasp.<br>
<br>
He smiled...&quot;One step closer&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Get away from me you pile of rot, go find me new components&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes master&quot;  and it shambled off down the stairs.<br>
<br>
Maxamillian slumped down in one of his studies plush chairs and tried to visualize the casting and what went wrong.  He had learned of the ability to summon and enslave specters to the summoners will from an anchient text he aquired.  The cost in platinum had been staggering but the gains would be well worth it.<br>
<br>
He visualized the power of the powerfull undead and the prestige it would bring him and the respect it could harness.  He pictured arriving at the arcanum in Freeport for the annual Festival of Magiks with his new servant;  he pictured the mixed expressions of awe and fear it would  garner and he smiled.<br>
<br>
Jobartik clicked back into the chamber.  &quot;Master we are out of Runes&quot; <br>

Max sighed a heavy breath &quot;Then we will leave in the morn for Antonica, time grows short and I must have this new servant&quot;<br>

Those here trying to eat were hard pressed to get the intense odor.  The had been dealing with this for the past three days not for lack of action;  they had sent a porter to the galley to find the source of the odor and dispose of it.  He never returned.  They sent an ensine to find the missing lad and at last deal with the offensive odor;  he too did not return.<br>
They were about to send a third lad to find the truth behind the smell and the missing ensine and porter, when they heard the ear spliting wail.  They grabbed weapons and tried to enther the hold but the door was barred and even with the combined strength of six burly sailors it would not give.  <br>
The stood around the door discussing what to do next some suggested getting axes and breaking down the portal but even as they spoke a mist was forming around their legs.<br>
The mist seemed to animate in the fresh ocean air and take on claw like fingers.<br>
The two sailors nearest the portal screamed in terror as the talon like mist wrapped around their legs.  They howled an unearthly scream of pain and fear which became high pitched and distant as the others watched rivited in horror.<br>
The crowed backed away as the screams finaly stopped and the sailors fell forward with a lifless thud.<br>
When finally the mists receaded back beyond the portal two of the braver sailors moved too their fallen comrads.  They turned them over to discover the bodies withered and dry,  looking more like mummies of a thousand years than the living breathing men they had been just a short time before.<br>
They had burried the men at sea immediatly and ordered no one go near the hold for the remaineder of the journey to Odus.<br>
Deep in the dark of the hold he smiled well fed and now with the privacy he required for the remaineder of this trip he dreamed of the storm to come.<br>

Gahhl nodded causing a small shower of sweat to fall from his brow. There was a loud snapping of branches and a flurry of activitie to his right.  Bouncer Hurd stormed out of the forest and charged towards her.  She was about to leap into the underbrush to skirt out of the rampaging ogres way when fire exploded in her skull.  The world grew dizzie and dark she looked up at Gahhl through fuzzy eyes and heard him say.<br>

Max shifted in his seat,  the beutifull but deadly dark elf always put him on edge.  He normally would have sent a courier as she stated but he needed to inspect the goods personanly and make haste  to complete his spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear Najena&quot; he began. &quot;You are ever the inquisitive one, but you must know that I am far to much a gentleman than to bore you with such trivial matters;  I have come this day to renew my ties, the couriers can be far to impersonal.

She grinned that perfectly wicked smile obvious to his ploys but playing the game.  She above all eles enjoyed the intriuge and the verbal sparring.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well then you must stay for evening feast,  ne're could I let a good customer leave without enjoying my hospitality&quot;.<br>
<br>
She had him caught in his own net.  He had deffered her from her line of questioning only to be trapped here longer than he wanted and most likely into a dinner conversation about his work again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Milady, how could I refuse such grand entertainment&quot; he smiled back at her and sighed in his head.<br>
