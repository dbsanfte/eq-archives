<br>
 A triumphant day in the Ocean of Tears<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Excerpt from Vinar’s Journal&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I was wandering the Dreadlands yestereve when a carrier bird came to me with a note. Upon opening the note I noticed the urgency in the writing it read:<br>
<br>
“Dread lord,<br>
<br>
I need your assistance in the Ocean of Tears. If you could please join me here it would be appreciated. The oldest Cyclops that walks has been seen near here. And he has something I want. <br>
<br>
Reaper”<br>
<br>
“I remember my hunt for this creature myself. She was right by my side the entire time I must help her.”<br>
<br>
I memorized my portal to the deserts of Northern Ro and gated there to get to the docks of Freeport. Where I am no longer welcome just cause a couple of those damn guards in the Commonlands looked at me wrong once and had to be burned. Any ways I am digressing. I sat on those docks hidden from minds eye waiting on that damn boat when I get another message from her stating the urgency of my hasty arrival due to a large number of Cyclops on the island. As I got done reading this the boat appeared. I sat on the boat for a few minutes till we entered the Ocean. As I got within sight of the Island I could hear the reaper hollering for me to hurry up. I jumped ship and swam (since I can swim faster than that slow boat) over to the Island. As I approached the Island I could see a Cyclops standing there and began to cast my flames of hate upon him. The reaper cast her magics upon him and the enchanter began to cast as well. He was a white skinned elf and made my skin crawl till he cast an illusion upon himself to change his form. I used most every bit of magics in me but that foul smelling beast went down in a pile of burning flesh.<br>
<br>
We kept this up for several hours. Thank the father that the light skin left. We were doing very well until one Cyclops came and he was a true bastard. He resisted many of my spells, as did the reapers. I watched her fall as he swiped at her. Then I noticed the necro that was pulling Seafury Cyclops’s onto our island to fight them and I returned the favor by running mine through his camp. Needless to say the Cyclops was taken care of then. I returned to my spot and sent word to Nospiratus to come help with Creaping she needed his magics to revive her. He was stuck in the Ro’s but was coming. Another Cyclops appreared and I had to hide to avoid death as the reaper. He finally dissapeared after a couple minutes of looking for me I could swear he had my scent but must have had a bad eye cause he couldn’t find me. Nospiratus then sent word he was at the docks and would be here shortly.<br>
<br>
Then it appeared as if out of no where the oldest Cyclops that walks the land. I knew I couldn’t take it alone but I had to try for if I didn’t someone else would. I then snared the giant beast and began to lead him around the island. I could smell the burnt flesh chasing me then the footsteps sped up and I knew my spell failed. I yelled for the prophet to hurry up. I was losing ground with the Cyclops so I decided to stop and try to immobilize him. He started wailing on me. I forgot what it was like to actually get pounded on like that. Then I see a necro near casting its darkness spell on him and then he poisoned the creature. He then told me it was just going to assist for he had slain this monster before so he was just assisting me. I then continued my blasting of this monster for a while I could not step on this island at all without smelling its burnt flesh. I was finally getting comfortable when the necro's spell broke and the Cyclops started tearing after me. I asked the necro for help, as I was stunned from the repeated beatings he laid on me. I didn’t even notice that I was at less than a quarter my total strength and I just ran around the island so as I could evade death. I stopped to burn him again and he charged me once again he was about to hit me for a killing blow my mind cleared and I felt strong again as the prophet was there to once again save my indeed. He then helped me fell that beast and revive the reaper. There was not much like the joy of listening to that giant beast fall to the ground screaming.<br>
<br>
We stayed there a while longer recounting how lucky we were and hoping to see another of them but they hid from us the rest of the evening. Needles to say we have given thanks to Innoruuk and the Guild Blood Lords for their assistance this day.<br>

Well done, Dread Lord Vinar, Reaper, and Prophet.<br>
