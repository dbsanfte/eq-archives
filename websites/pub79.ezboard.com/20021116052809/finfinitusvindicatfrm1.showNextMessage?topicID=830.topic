<br>
Talionis FCFS'd us on Va Dyn. No big deal. We were going for Itraer Vius and he just happened to pop while we were en route. Members of your guild should not be sending rude comments to members of our guilds in the process. If Talionis wishes to have that kind of relationship with us then fine, they will win some and they will lose some. If it has to be antagonistic, it will be that way too. Its that simple.<br>
<br>
We instruct our people to act with civility and maturity in a FCFS situation. Apparently Talionis instructs theirs act like children.<br>

<br>
I use /shownames 1 which means you have to make yourself stand out from the crowd for me to NOT lend assistance. I'm blind to guildtags.  There are a few people in this game who I wouldnt feel deserved my help, oddly enough a few of them happen to be in your guild. I would not lend the slightest bit of help because history has proven to me that these people are not worthy of my common respect.  <br>
<br>
I am new to this guild.  I dont consider this political, it's just from my previous dealings with them that I will not, should not and wont extend the courtesy.  Rest assured, you are not one of these people.  <br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to ask for help from me,  I'll extend that common courtesy to you anytime.<br>
<br>
It's evident that there's a huge amount of friction between your guild and mine.  in the short time that i've been guilded I've seen your members using /ooc and /shout to spew stupid immature remarks, act completely childish and bring a whole new meaning to the word drama.  <br>
<br>
I can understand why there's an undercurrent toward you since you wear that guild tag.  It doesnt have anything to do with you as a person, but rather those you choose to be loyal to.<br>

I have tried and tried to mend fences with your guild but apparently its his sole desire to make our two guilds adversarys. This is unnecessary. <br>
When you and others were in IV we all understood that the actions of our members reflected on us as a whole. That hasn't changed. So what occurred yesterday reflects on you as well as your guildmates. If FCFS'ing a pos mob like that made Jaharad feel good I feel sorry for him. We hardly care. What bothered some of us is the people who WERE there. Who we thought were friends. <br>

We had a fast damage group and after a while our monk notices the Mob was up and I then send out a tell to the guild letting them know its up at the same time IV starts to show.  Yes this was a race.  When we noticed that the mob was up we starting pulling toward it with our one group.  I ask anyone to honestly tell me that I was not in this zone with my XP group for Hours.  And yes I understand that hostile things may have been said and for that I offer an apology.  My group was in the corner near the mob before anyone entered the room so I truly feel we were pulling into the mob first and that noone should feel bad about this.

i remember when we did sontalaak together a few months ago.. its very sad when in a short time we have come to this point. <br>
<br>
i never had anything against talionis at all i exp group with a few all decent peepz.<br>
<br>
however after reading the rants and stuff on p.com it seems that you guys pretty much think that we are a pretty lame guild and make inside jokes about our attempts at mobs.<br>
<br>
what the fvck is wrong with all of you guys this is a mofo game and play to have fun.  if all of us met in real life we would sit down and have a fvcking beer and get along.  <br>
<br>
i always liked jaha however lately i see in ooc smart ass comments that pretty much diminish my respect for you guys. <br>
<br>
i hang out with my guild and believe it or not guys we dont give a ratz ass what mobs you do we just prety much worry about ourselves .. we  are a fun guild not really hardcore like talionis /nod. btw talionis &gt; ALL <br>
<br>
do you guys really hate us ? <br>

We had 5 clerics, 4 rogues, 3 wizards and a manaburner there...that wouldnt have been a problem. You were in the zone with me...at the zone with me...so you werent in that spot for hours that I could see...but none of that matters..it was a FCFS race, we lost it and its over with. Like I said, we were going for IV anyway and he just popped while people were en route for that raid. Pretty much just coincidence. <br>
<br>
So grats on Va Dyn...but I saw no reason for the impolite manner with which some people in your guild seem to think they need to treat us. Its not acceptable.<br>
<br>
You dont need us gunning for mobs youre doing anymore than we want you doing the same to us. You had your revenge for the Zlandicar incident in ST. So let it go. If you choose not to, then we will not respect what you guys are doing either. We left your extremely long Klandicar pull alone last time even though we could have shown up and applied pressure to your raid. We knew exactly when he popped and chose not to hassle you guys. <br>
<br>
So decide...as a guild...either you want an enemy...or polite competition.<br>

<br>
Festering, you asked for our view on IV, well I cant speak for 50 people, but I can speak for myself. IV is a very capable guild but in my opinion underachieving. I've been saying this for a long while now. Yes you can take down the big mobs kudos to you guys, I'm glad for you, but at the same time I have seen you guys whip 7 and 8 times before actually killing something. At first I felt bad for you guys and was rooting for you, but after a while it just kinda got to be a running joke. Understand where I am coming from please. I have a very, to quote my own mother, demented sence of humor. It's funny to see people fail. Especially when they are your competition. And lets face it, we are each others main competition so there is going to be some ill will and run ins. It's going to happen no matter what we do to prevent it. I have nothing but love for most of you, there are just a few that it wouldnt hurt my feelings if they got anal raped by a gay brama bull.<br>
<br>
As for the comments made: I did not make them, but I do want to applogize to any of my friends in IV if you were offended. I think that the comments made were meant for a select few and not the whole guild, but thats just my interpretation.<br>
<br>
For the big mouths out there: shut up, this goes to both sides, you know who you are.  You have a comment, you make it in guild or in a private tell to a friend. There is no need to get 60 some odd people pissed at you. 90% of the time this is what I do and it does work to relieve that stress. Just remember that if you are in IV and a big mouth, your faction is probably maxed negative with Talionis, no need to keep working on it. If you are in Talionis and a big mouth, your faction....(hopefully youy get the picture)<br>
<br>
As far as FCFSing: This regretfully is an FCFS server now, we all know this.  Get over it.  Yes there are some zones that arent FCFS, but First Raid First Serve (whole differant argument for a differant time).  There is going to be some ill will when something is FCFS'd, you cant get around that. Some people will talk about getting revenge when FCFS happens, to those of that think that, shut up. All you do is cause problems. The afore mentioned comments were meant for all who read it, IV and Talionis alike.<br>

Geez, if pointing and laughing at someone makes you feel better then good luck on life, and I hope I never deal with you again.<br>
<br>
This incident turned nasty because people were, for whatever reason, acting like children.  Sure IV has had difficulty in the past after forming from 5 small guilds with little or no real raid experience, but without being inside the guild and seeing what we are doing now, making those kinds of statements makes you look like a tool.<br>
<br>
Whatever your personal feeling about a guild, or certain players within that guild, nothing excuses childish behaviour.  Personally, I think I get along great with Abery, Jaharad, Moonshiine and many others in Talionis, but these kinds of incidents leave a sour taste in my mouth.<br>
<br>
I also use /shownames 1 and as a rule don't associate people with their guild tag, but judge everyone on personal merit.  Xanivus, it would behoove you to learn this lesson... <p><center>

I'm sorry you took my post so demeaningly. I was actually trying to write it in a mature fashion. Pote, I don't assume that IV whipes on everything. It is just those whipe outs were my main raid experience with IV and that is what I remember most. You'd think it was funny too if you saw us whipe over and over again. Don't deny it, you know you would. =P<br>
<br>
Alright Jab, since you don't seem to like me much this is for you.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me to grow up, you simply do not know me well enough to tell me that. Carit, Rob, Matrex and anyone else that I have known since level 20 can make that assesment.  Also I am sorry you took it as me laughing at IV. I simply said it got funny at some point and that I do feel bad when it happens. Festering just asked a question and I answered it to be best of my abilities. I am sorry that you took it a bit too far.<br>

Stop listening to that idiot Jaharad whos only gonna kill your guilds reputation down the road and realize that kind of elitist attitude is only going to hurt you.<br>
<br>
Our guild doesnt send tells, or speak publically about other peoples failures, and yes other guilds do fail on stuff and we see it. Wipes happen, to everyone. We wiped on Aayronar, and hey guess what...you did too right AFTER us and you had DONE the mob before. So dont talk to me about that crap.<br>
<br>
Your guilds getting really full of itself. Sounds to me like you guys just need to mind your own damn business.<br>
<br>
We are WAY better than when Jaharad was in this guild, way better. So form your own opinions, and keep them to yourselves. <br>

I could not have said it better. But I do take notice of the people who do me and my guild wrong.<br>

Abery offered help/ Yes I think she is a great person.<br>
<br>
Give her a frickin' bone people.<br>
<br>
EVERYONE on both sides should no guildtags mean S H I T somet imes. Abery is a nice person who was trying to help out. Who the hell cares about ooc nonsense.<br>
<br>
Xanivus, as a Talionis member who helped IV in the past, and fought alongside them, I KNOW you understand.<br>
<br>
SICKENING.<br>
<br>
BA. You of all people know not to look a gift horse in the mouth.<br>
<br>
Was I there ?<br>
<br>
Can't really ever be sure how many chars I have played or have access to.<br>
<br>
Someday people might get an idea that I know more than a 60 unguilded rogue should.<br>
<br>
/sigh.<br>
<br>
I still miss all of my friends.<br>
