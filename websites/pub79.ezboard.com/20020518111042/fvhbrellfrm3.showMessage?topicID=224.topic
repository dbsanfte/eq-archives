For the last few weeks they had both been conspicuously absent from Neriak and the lands of Norrath. Partly in memory of a friend and ally that had pasted about a year before, and partly for other more secretive reasons. The Keep flew flags of mourning, and a deep sorrow permeated even the usual somber and dark atmosphere of the land around the estate. Each brother had reflected of their friend in their own way, each alone and in silence. Many bottles of Kalish were emptied, all in the name of Morrigu, Redhand of the Empire. As the time of remembrance had passed, the reports from the spies and gatherers came in. Political ones for Tzlar, and military ones for Zirrix. Between them, the brothers of House T’Rhennic held considerable power within the Empire. Tzlar was the Chancellor of the Imperial Council, and Zirrix a General and member of the Imperial High Command. They had both heard the “silent” rumblings for some time now. It was always amusing to them, that the enemies of the Empire thought if they moved slowly, silently, and hidden in shadows, they would succeed. How many enemies did the Empire have, they could not easily be counted. Each enemy convinced that it, above all others, would prevail against Neriak. But, as it had for many millennia, as it had since the birth of the Empire, House T’Rhennic would be there to guard against all enemies. Then, exact a vengeance to terrible to contemplate, against any who dare raise up arms against the Children of Neriak. Each brother had looked over the reports of the recent happenings.<br><br>They knew of the arguments, accusations and disbanding of many guild members. They knew how heavily the disappearance of the Prophet had weighed upon the members of the guild. Open defiance, challenges, threats and even combat had resulted from the stress. Fortunately, both brothers were absent from such a display. Now, as with all plots against the Empire, things were beginning to converge. From many different angles, and many different sources, force was being applied to the Empire in an attempt to undermine it. It was not the power of an opposing army, for none could hope to topple their Imperial Majesties from the Throne. No, these attacks involved conspiracy and deceit. They involved ancient enemies, traitors, and those cursed even amongst the Dark Races of Norrath. It was an old game, one that the brothers had seen, in one form or another, time and time again. It was what Zirrix called a “Dwarf Trick”. Because in many battles, rather then lay siege to a castle, the Dwarven miners would remove the stone under the support from the ground around the castle. That would cause a subsidence, and thus the castle’s own weight would cause it to fall. Zirrix had devised a counter move, which involved the use of certain high level Mages. During a siege of any Teir’dal stronghold, Zirrix would have the Mages cast spells that would turn the ground to mud, then immediately back to stone in alternating layers. That way, the castle’s support would remain stable, and any miners in the tunnels would find themselves first buried in an avalanche of mud, then encased in stone tombs. <br><br>That is what was happening here. An enemy, ancient, evil (and some would say as powerful) as the Empire itself was once again moving it’s pieces. Tzlar, through espionage and intrigue, had used his political abilities to narrow down to a few, which enemy it was. It was now for Zirrix to “wield the blade of vengeance” against those who sought to harm his people and their Empire. Some, many allies of House T’Rhennic, had recently turned against the Guild. Zirrix would not attack them, for they were just unwilling resources in the upcoming conflict. The enemy had made it’s first move, after many centuries of planning. Now, it was time for the Chosen of Norrath, the Respected Race of the Empire, to move it’s pieces into play. Power was something that all Teir’dal understood, and now was the time for all to see where the considerable influence and resources of House T’Rhennic would take hold. Finishing the letter, both brothers signed it and dispatched it, with a compliment House Guards, to the Guildhall of the Violent Harvest…         <br> <p>General Zirrix T'Rhennic<BR>Dread Lord<BR>Violent Harvest<BR><BR><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/selilya/TRhen_Sig.jpg" border=0> </center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukhasirath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khasirath</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.violentharvest.com/sigs/vh_anim.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/12/02 2:05:13 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=224.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=224.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=224.topic><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=224.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=224.topic><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=224.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=224.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Website</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
