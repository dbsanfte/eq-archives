Will be happier if the current changes in testing go live and haste procs last for 1 minute instead of 15 seconds (though I actually wonder if that may be too powerful.  As it is, with a good quick buff and the haste proc, spamming DS with 3.0 speed war mace results in a merc who doesn't ever stop swing motions for the duration of the haste :-)<br>
<br>
Of course, keep in mind that haste procs overwrite theurg haste buffs, so if you reliably have a theurg with you to buff, haste is probably not the way to go.<br>
<br>
Reactives are put on armor, and have a chance of going off when that piece of armor is hit. <p>Acus TwinHammer<br>

<br>
Reactives:<br>
<br>
Direct Damages: From levels 40 to 47, these function as they do for a weapon. Each hit gives it the chance to proc. The type of DDs are; Fire, Cold, Energy, Spirit. Spirit tends to be better, for a lot of people tend to neglect Spirit as a resist. Though, it's a flimsy reason to choose and by no means is spirit the best of them. Choose as you wish. The highest DD has a value of 95.<br>
<br>
Self AF buff: Procs a self armor factor buff for a value of 75. Must be 47+ to use. Very few use it, as AF just doesn't appeal to most. When it's zerg vs zerg, you're going to get hit A LOT. 75 more AF isn't going to help. It can, however, prove worthy in more group vs group scenes. It works, though, and that's good enough to consider having. I do believe, however, that it gets over-righted by a paladins AF buff Chant.<br>
<br>
Damage Over Time: Matter only, level 47 required. 4.0s ticks for 20 seconds. That's just flat out nice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Matter is one of the resists people tend to bring up, but even so, it can hit as hard as a DD, and multiple times too. Can get 5 ticks with one 'proc' of this DoT. Highly recommended for battleing stealthers who evade like mad and hit a lot, or pretty much anything that likes to hit you.<br>
<br>
Self Haste: 47 requirement, lasts 15 seconds. Not bad, good for faster swings, it hastes for about as much as the highest theurg spell. It works, and if you like speed, i'd consider it. Not very popular (many theurgs on galahad, can just ask them for it), but worthy of consideration.<br>
<br>
Self Damage Add: 47 requirement, 15 second duration. Like the one in the earth wizard line, this one isn't very popular due to the damage shield not scaling well with levels. It has a value of 5, pretty weak specially when compared to what else you could have. Wouldn't advise this.<br>
<br>
Self Melee Health Buffer: Refered to as Ablative, this procs a 'shield' around you that takes a set value of the damage delt to you, per melee hit, untill it has reached it's maxamum hold value. Think of it as a shield with HPs. When procced, the shield will take a portion of every melee swing that lands on you (say, 15-25% value, though i'm not certain), and puts it twords its HPs. Once it has reached 100HPs, the shield &quot;dies off&quot;. Very, very nice reactive and everyone puts at least one of these things on a peice of armor. Some even make a whole suit with this type of proc, and it works very well for melee combat, zerg or group. Extremly advised <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Offensive Procs (Effects):<br>
<br>
Direct Damage: Like the reactive counter-part of this proc, every time you land a swing, it has a chance to proc a Direct Damage spell. You can apply these as early as level 20, up to the highest level currently avaluable, 47. Highest one procs for 95 damage base. Same elements as the armor (Cold, Heat, Energy, Spirit). A nice addition to any weapon, it really helps in dishing out that frontload damage that is critical in RvR. For Duel Wielders, it's often placed on the mainhand to make up for the lack of damage per-hit. Not many favor it on the offhand because of how infrequent the offhand swings, and even procs. Good proc, highly consider it. Because resists are so flimsy (varys from person to person), it's safe to pick an element that appeals to you for its looks when it procs.<br>
<br>
Self Melee Health Buffer: An ablative for the weapon, this ones value is half (50) of what the value is for the armor. Not very considered due to how it works better on armor, and a defensive proc on a offensive weapon is.. ironic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Open for consideration, but not really recommended.<br>
<br>
Self AF Buff: Just the same as the Reactive, same value, ect, same uses. Consider lightly, but I wouldn't go for it.<br>
<br>
Damage Over Time: Same as the Reactive, works very well in any RvR situation. Because it works as over-time, many feel that a DD is better, since frontloading is much more favored then over-time battles. But, once procced, the damage can do the same as a DD - but hit 5 times over. Real nice, in my opinion. Offhanders favor this on the offhand to complement their ability to deal damage over time, though having DoTs on both can prove more frontloading then a DD on one, DoT on another. It's mostly choice here, it's a very nice choice if you decide you like DoTs. The difference of having it on a weapon and it on an armor, the weapon is going to be harder to get off as you're not going to hit as much as you are going to get hit. It's a smart idea to place a DoT reactive and proc on a weapon, if you can't decide where you want your DoT.<br>
<br>
Self Haste: Same as reactive. Some like it, others don't. I don't bother with it, but sometimes there's just no theurg around.<br>
<br>
Self Damage Shield: Just as unappealing as on the reactive side. Just doesn't do enough damage when you get hit. Wouldn't advise this.<br>
<br>

What is the percentage chance of an Effect / Reactive Effect going off? <br>
A. The chance for an Effect to 'proc' is based on the delay of the weapon it is imbued into, unfortunately Mythic have not released the formula for how it is calculated. The base chance for a Reactive Effect to 'proc' is a flat rate of 10% (it was lowered from 20% in the 1.54I patch).&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure where I heard it, but I heard that it was 35%. Although, i'm pretty sure that's wrong as I don't proc like that. :/ I'd say 10-20% is the range we're looking at. Same for reactives.<br>
<br>
I'm not to sure the costs, although, at the highest level of Ablative, it cost me about 300 gold per peice. Kind of expensive, but I personally think I got a deal on it. I now have a guildie that can do it for free, so I no longer know about the prices. But, I can tell you, it wasn't in the plat ranged for proccing my two weapons some-time ago with DoT and a DD. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>
