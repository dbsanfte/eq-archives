<br>
Khasirath himself came to lead Shaede to the room that had been prepared for his communion with Innoruuk. They went far below the manse itself, into the subbasement, to a corridor lined with many doors. Shaede’s air elemental followed the pair, guarding them watchfully and silently. Her custos had been ordered to remain in her borrowed suite of rooms.<br>
<br>
The room they entered was of moderate size, and fairly bare. The back wall was almost filled with a large mage-light rune of the Eye of Innoruuk. A chair had been placed next to the door, and a small chest sat in one corner. Shaede noticed with trepidation that a pair of iron manacles hung from the ceiling.<br>
<br>
Waiting patiently in the room was Vhalshae, Khasirath’s youngest sister. The girl wore a plain black robe, the holy symbol of the Spires of Innoruuk around her neck her only adornment. Severely cut white hair framed her youthful face, but the endless black of her eyes made her seem far older, and far wiser than her years. If she were human most would say she was about the age of twelve or thirteen.<br>
<br>
Khasirath turned to Shaede, looking deeply into her eyes, “You are welcome to stay and guard me, as I said before. But you must not interfere in this rite. You will have to follow Vhalshae’s instructions very carefully.”<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded, “Of course, Khasirath.”<br>
<br>
Without a word to Shaede, the young Prophetess prepared a tea for Khasirath, and told him to drink it. Shaede watched curiously, the bitter smell of the herbs was somehow familiar to her. Khasirath drank it all, then knelt down across from his sister on the floor. Without quite knowing what was expected of her, Shaede sat down as well, near Khasirath. Her elemental floated over to guard the door.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae stood before the two Harvesters, and began to lead them in prayer. The Litanies of the Father and the Catechisms of Faith were well known to them both, and for close to a half hour they sat and prayed.<br>
<br>
Finally Khasirath looked up to Vhalshae and nodded. Shaede saw that his pupils were vastly dilated. The draught must have taken effect. Vhalshae instructed the Reaper to remove his clothing. Without hesitation he did so, placing his clothes in the small chest before standing in the center of the room, under the manacles. The only thing he left on was his Initiate’s symbol of Innoruuk. His long hair had been braided into a single rope, and he pulled it forward over his shoulder so that it lay against his chest.<br>
<br>
As Vhalshae was not tall enough to reach, Khasirath began to fasten the manacles around his own wrists. Shaede frowned with concern, deeply unsettled by what she was seeing. Despite her uncertainty she walked over and helped Khasirath fasten the second manacle. Once he was chained Khasirath was forced to stand on his toes, his body stretched taut.<br>
<br>
Apprehensively Shaede stepped back, watching the Reaper and his sister. The young Prophetess walked over to the chest to get something, undisturbed by the Magician’s doubtful glances. Khasirath stood still and silent, focused on his own inner mantras. His body was well toned, with vivid red rune markings standing out luridly against his indigo flesh. Shaede could not help but notice the many scars across his body from the battles and rituals of his many years in service to the Father.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae walked back over slowly and stood behind her brother, a barbed whip in her small hands. “Khasirath S`Therik, Reaper of the Violent Harvest and Reaver of the Dead, ye have come before the Father in search of Communion with His divine Will. Ye must surrender your body and your soul that ye may be judged. Open your hate, Knight, and let it flow into Innoruuk, from whence it came.”<br>
<br>
Shaede took another step back as Vhalshae unfurled the whip. Softly the Prophetess began to chant, and this prayer was one that Shaede had never heard before. As the soft words flowed, the flogging began. With a steady and tireless rhythm Vhalshae whipped the Reaper’s back, the barbs in the leather cutting his flesh. Shaede’s eyes went wide as the blood welled up across Khasirath’s shoulders and back, slowly oozing down his skin.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae’s face was serene and distant, like the face of a porcelain doll as she called upon the Father to accept and guide the Reaper in his seeking. Khasirath’s entire body was rigid, accepting the blows without a flinch, though occasionally Shaede heard a small hiss of pain as he let out a breath.<br>
<br>
Shaede watched it all with horror in her heart. She had never seen such a rite performed, had never even known it existed. She kept looking at Vhalshae, wondering if one so young could truly have the skill to do such a thing. The books she had brought to research were forgotten as she stared at Khasirath and the Prophetess.<br>
<br>
Twenty minutes, perhaps thirty passed, the steady chanting and whipping the only sounds. Shaede walked slowly around to watch the Reaper’s face, hoping for some sign that everything would turn out all right. The rapturous snarl that twisted his face did nothing to relieve the malaise she felt. He stared right through her, his eyes locked on the far wall as the hate swept through him, growing so strong that it became greater than the pain he was feeling.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Khasirath’s body shuddered, and he hissed in a deeply pained breath as he collapsed limp in the chains, his head falling forward against his chest. He swayed slightly, his feet dragging across the stone floor. Shaede gasped and rushed to him, putting her hand to his chest to see if he yet breathed. His skin was so hot it seemed to burn her hand, and at first she felt no breath.<br>
<br>
“You must not interfere.” Vhalshae hissed, her voice cold.<br>
<br>
Shaede ignored her, closing her eyes as she sought to feel any sign of life. After a long moment she finally felt him draw a slow shallow breath. Relief began to flood through her, but she jumped back as his body was shaken by another blow of the whip.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae continued to flog Khasirath with the same even rhythm as before, and Shaede watched on, struggling within herself. He did not react at all to the blows, his body simply swaying under its own weight. His breathing was so slow and shallow that Shaede could barely be sure he was still breathing.<br>
<br>
After watching a bit, and realizing Vhalshae had no intent of stopping, Shaede moved to support Khasirath’s head, trying to lift it off of his chest.<br>
<br>
“You must not, Shaede,” the Prophetess warned, her voice harsh.<br>
<br>
“But he will strangle like this!” Shaede protested.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae did not miss a beat of the flogging. “Innoruuk shall sustain him,” she explained. “If we do not trust in that, then he shall die.”<br>
<br>
Shaede stepped away again, wrapping her arms around herself as she stared at the bizarre display. Vhalshae continued her soft chanting as she flayed her brother’s back. The young Teir`Dal’s concentration was intense, and her arm seemed tireless.<br>
<br>
For a long time the flogging continued, and Shaede grew numb to the sounds, lulled by the endless chanting. Slowly she paced the floor, struggling to trust in the Reaper’s decision to do this, and to trust in Innoruuk’s Will to protect him.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Within his soul, Khasirath sought out the deepest part of his hatred, urged on by the chanting that he could no longer hear, and the pain that he no longer felt. As his consciousness settled into the rage and the fire that was his greatest strength, he called upon the Father with all of his will, forcing himself free of his body to flow into the sea of hate and follow it to its source.<br>
<br>
As the Reaper’s spirit entered Innoruuk’s true realm, it coalesced into a phantom of the elf as he was within Norrath. Living armour of the deepest shadow formed around him, and a cup-hilted saber of pure hatred lay ready in its sheath at his side. Both of these were gifts from Innoruuk to His Knight, rewards for his service and faith.<br>
<br>
At first Khasirath stood on a featureless plain veiled in thick shadow. He willed himself along, moving not as a man does in the world, but as a spirit. He commanded himself along the plain, seeking out the source of all hate, Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
As he drifted along, the plain began to shift around him. Shadows thickened and took shape; threatening figures stalked his path, their eyes blazing with venomous rage. Khasirath refused to be intimidated. He wrought his hatred into a shroud and its aura drove the phantoms back. They hissed as they retreated, their voices like bones sliding over bones.<br>
<br>
Khasirath pressed on, looking neither right nor left. Soon he came to an immense cathedral upon a hill overlooking the shadowed plain. No mortal mind could have conceived the arcing buttresses and jagged spires that crowned this monument to Hate. The geometry was divinely perfected, yet absolutely impossible. The whole of it seemed to shift and breathe as Khasirath drew near, and the leering gargoyles turned their heads to judge him with eyes of living flame. The cathedral seemed to be formed of the shadows, its color so flawlessly dark that the depths of it denied the existence of light.<br>
<br>
Without pause, the Knight entered the cathedral, and proceeded through its sweeping nave to the chancel. But in this cathedral there was no altar before which to kneel. Here was set the Father’s Throne. And upon the towering throne sat Innoruuk Himself. The Prince of Hate leaned forward as Khasirath approached, and the waves of the God’s alien presence immediately assaulted the Reaper’s mind. The air was thick with hate itself, and the shrouding smoke smelled of bitter blood.<br>
<br>
Khasirath advanced as close as he dared, and clasped his fist to his heart in salute, bowing his head before his God.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk spoke with a voice that was like a thousand impossibly deep voices raging in hatred, “Speak, Knight. Why dare thee approach Me?”<br>
<br>
“I have come to seek Your guidance, my Lord. Your Harvest is being divided and Your Prophet is lost. Show me Your Will, so that I may carry it out.” Khasirath said, staring up into the eyes of his creator.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk laughed, a dangerous sound like worlds being torn asunder. The Reaper felt the weight of that dark humor slam into him, twisting inside his soul. He realized then that he could not move. Frozen, he continued to stare into the Father’s eyes as the God stood up from His Throne.<br>

<br>
--- <br>
<br>
Shaede paced slowly, lost in her own thoughts as the flogging continued. The crack of the whip barely registered in her mind any more, for it had been going on for such a long time. Restlessly she sat in the chair by the door, and pulled out one of the tomes from her pack. She regretted not taking the Reaper’s advice. She simply could not focus on the text while she watched him hang there in chains, still as death.<br>
<br>
She tried to concentrate, turning to a marked page to reread a particularly troublesome section. It was hard going, but finally she was able to lose herself in the work of translation.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Khasirath let out a choking cry of agony, and Shaede almost dropped her book. She stood and tossed the tome onto the chair as she rushed to the Reaper. As she came around in front of him she gasped. His face was covered in blood that streamed from deep ugly gouges around his eyes. His eyes were still shut tightly, his face twisted in pain.<br>
<br>
Shaede drew an enchantment into herself, the mana of the spell sparkling faintly as it settled into her eyes, allowing her to see invisible things. Quickly she looked around the room, but there was nothing there but the Reaper, the Prophetess, her elemental and herself.<br>
<br>
Shaede gently touched Khasirath’s face, her hand trembling. His skin was still burning hot, and he did not react at all. His breathing was rapid now, but still frighteningly shallow.<br>
<br>
Shaede turned to Vhalshae, and noticed the girl’s face was ashen as she continued her chanting and whipping. “What is happening? What did this to him?”<br>
<br>
The Prophetess swallowed hard, almost stuttering as she tried to answer, “It is the Father’s Will, Shaede…” Her voice was soft and distant.<br>
<br>
Shaede shook her head slowly, looking at the Reaper’s face. His pain was so apparent, though he was still once more. She watched him for a long moment, not knowing what to do, too confused even to know what to think.<br>
<br>
Khasirath groaned in pain, his body stiffening in the chains. Shaede bit her lip as she watched him writhe. His eyelids fluttered open weakly, and a wash of blood and clear vitreous poured down his cheeks. Shaede clasped a hand to her mouth to choke back a cry as she saw his empty eye sockets before his eyes closed again, and he fell back into unconsciousness.<br>
<br>
“My god… What can we do?” Shaede asked the Prophetess.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae shook her head, almost trembling as she continued to work the whip. “Pray, Shaede. Pray for him.”<br>
<br>
--- <br>
<br>
Innoruuk’s talons were like lances of white-hot flame as they clawed at Khasirath’s face. He pierced the Knight’s eyes, His claws twisting skillfully in the sockets like a vendor working flavored ice, removing every last trace of his violet orbs. Frozen in place, Khasirath could not even scream as the agony seared his soul. The God’s hateful laughter filled the cathedral and Khasirath’s mind, mingling with the endless torment.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk withdrew His talons, but the pain raged on, and Khasirath feared it might very well destroy him. He heard and felt the God drawing closer yet, bending down as His dark aura crashed into the Knight’s soul, smothering him in its Hatred.<br>
<br>
He felt the breath of the God wash over his face, the acrid blood scent enveloping him as the breath filled his empty eye sockets. It burned within his head, the acid mist swirling and eddying within his sockets, solidifying slowly. Within his soul he screamed, desperate to give release to the suffering. Never had he felt pain like this, not even under the Father’s Touch.<br>
<br>
Like a puppeteer cutting the strings, Innoruuk released the paralysis, and Khasirath crumpled to the floor of the chancel. The Reaper writhed and spasmed, trying to scream, but all that could escape his seizing lungs was a whimpering groan. For a long time he thrashed, but eventually his strength was spent and he lay still, trembling hard under the endless pain.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk sat back on His Throne, and Khasirath could feel the perverse satisfaction rolling in waves from the God.<br>
<br>
“I am pleased with you, my child.” Innoruuk said, the dark chuckle still ringing in his words.<br>
<br>
“But you are blind as a newborn. You refuse to see what in under your very nose, so you come fumbling for a teat from which to draw what you need.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath heard the Father’s talons clawing at the arm of His Throne. The keening sound made him tremble even harder as he absorbed the Father’s words.<br>
<br>
“The truth is all around you, child. When your eyes open, perhaps you will be more inclined to perceive,” Innoruuk growled.<br>
<br>
With that, Khasirath was suddenly falling. He panicked, flailing. He could see nothing at all; only feel the wind rushing past, and the sickening twisting in his gut as he plummeted. The smell of blood surrounded him.<br>
<br>
And as he fell, suddenly he could see… a hundred pairs of lupine eyes glaring at him with cold and limitless hunger. The eyes seemed to float upon a misty sea of blood, and they were all the same shifting green-jade color. The vision sustained itself for a few heartbeats, then the eyes faded away into the sea of blood, and the sea itself faded to black, leaving Khasirath sightless once more.<br>
<br>
With a sickening jerk, Khasirath found himself back in his physical body, strung from the cold chains, and lost to the crushing pain.<br>
<br>
--- <br>
<br>
Khasirath let out a deep groan full of pain and loss. Shaede jumped at the sudden sound, biting her lip as she saw the way he trembled and writhed. His head lolled from side to side as he continued to moan.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae tossed the whip back onto the chest. “Get him down, quickly.”<br>
<br>
Shaede hurried to open the manacles, though the clasps were tight from Khasirath’s weight. As he came free she couldn’t hold him up, only control his fall to the floor. His wrists were deeply gouged from the metal manacles, his back covered in blood.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae brought over a box of bandages and salves, and began to tend to the Reaper’s wounds. Shaede grabbed up some of the supplies to help. Khasirath was senseless from the pain, shivering hard as he weakly moaned through the bandaging.<br>
<br>
Vhalshae gently opened his eyes as she tended to the scratches surrounding them. Shaede caught sight of it as she worked, and was shocked to see that swirling white pupil-less orbs filled his eye sockets. A shudder went through her as she watched Vhalshae finish applying salve to the scratches and wrap gauze around Khasirath’s face, covering his eyes completely.<br>
<br>
Once the bandaging was complete, Vhalshae lifted Khas’s head onto her lap, rousing him enough to help him drink another tea she had prepared. After he drank he calmed somewhat.<br>
<br>
“Khasirath… will you be alright?” Shaede asked.<br>
<br>
His voice was weak and pained, “Aye, Shaede. The Father found me worthy enough to return to Norrath.”<br>
<br>
“But your eyes…” she whispered.<br>
<br>
Khasirath sighed deeply, “I do not think He will make me remain this way. He implied my sight would be restored. A Knight without sight would be worthless to the Father.”<br>
<br>
As she watched him lay there, Shaede could see it was only his faith that kept the Reaper from falling into panic.<br>
