The coming of Napus<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;In a Time of great Good, you will be the instrument of Evil&quot;.<br>
<br>
Those were the exact words a small elven boy heard scream into his mind as he was pulled into a crack in the mountain's side. He watched as a massive swarm of hornets encased the village. The hum was deafening and soon it drowned out all screams as well as the hope to find anything alive in the mass.<br>
<br>
He watched for the rest of the day and well into the night. He awoke the next morning to find the last of the elves that managed to escape being slaughtered. A dark warrior clad in black armor stepped up to the child and spoke to him, &quot;You will come with us, there are many waiting to speak to you little boy&quot;.<br>
<br>
He was lead miles into the planet's crust. After what seemed likes days with no rest, they stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;We can go no further, you must continue alone&quot;. Watching as his escorts left him he wished this was all a dream, that he could wake up. But that was not going to happen. The small, afraid boy turned back and noticed a door. Upon closer inspection he noticed no hinges, knob, lock or anything that might open it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Step through young one, we wait to see what our God has sent us. If you are the one, you will have no problems passing.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voices sent chills through his spine as they rang out and echoed into the corridor. He managed to tear his arm away from his side and reached out to the door. His fingers slipped into it and he was at once cold to the bone. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are waiting. Are you coming or shall we send for the guards&quot;?<br>
<br>
Remembering the guards killing what remained of his friends he decided to step through. Becoming instantly cold was as painful as hearing the murmured screams and cries of his family. Yet he pressed on. When the other side was reached he noticed several things about his appearance and the way he felt. He noticed his hair turn white as snow, and his skin as blue as the midnight mist. On the inside he felt a strange sensation. Like if he touched something he could destroy it. More than a feeling, more like an instinct that has awakened after it's long sleep. He also noticed that the room had lit a little and he could see now.<br>
 <br>
Hundreds of cloaked figures appeared from the hallway as they released their grip on invisibility. The boy took a step back and all the figures knelt before him.  Before him was a pillar that read, &quot;A small child will pass, delivered from the hands of Innoruuk&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does that speak of....... me?&quot;, the boy spoke.<br>
<br>
Many years pass the boy becomes a man. He acquires a name. A name hidden in meaning and wrapped in mystery. A name that has taken a profficy of a small boy whose evil was as pure as the door was black. A child whose future holds the key to the Evil Elf's empire.<br>
<br>
Napus Nigus<br>
<br>
He set forth on a mission of as much secrecy as importance. To find the Necromancer that will guide his devastating touch. To find the one that speaks with the God he now serves.  Napusnigus found that before leaving, all the training and spell learning and knowledge gained in the underworld was suspended in his mind.  A piece of parchment was in his tunic when he awoke, it read, &quot;You will remember more as you grow older and wiser. And one day you will remember all that you have learned.&quot; The man comes forth from the underground to tear asunder the things that he hates, and those things number more than are countable. He will strive to do so with all his being, for he does this for the new God he serves....<br>

Ahhh, Napus. Old friend. So you wish to tell the tale at last.  <br>
