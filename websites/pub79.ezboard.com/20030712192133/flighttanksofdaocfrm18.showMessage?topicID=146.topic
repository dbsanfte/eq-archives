This idea came to me suddenly during a conversation with a friend who also plays DAoC, while discussing how some style lines are not very desirable due to many factors, and how some styles become outdated and not worth using. I play a Thrust spec'ed Mercenary almost exclusively, hence why I focus a lot on those style lines and omit most of the others (which I don't know nearly as<br>
well). I am aware that the ideas I'm posting below would require a serious reworking of the game code and are not likely to be implemented anytime soon if ever. But one can always hope...***<br>
<br>
As is apparent just from reading these forums, the concept of &quot;The grass is greener on the other side&quot; is a predominant factor in many discussions/arguments, and this carries over to melee styles as well. With the recent 1.62 Melee &quot;adjustments&quot; to my class styles, the topic of &quot;styles&quot; and &quot;fairness&quot; has been on my mind of late. During a discussion with a friend, I came up with this...<br>
<br>
The basic idea is customization, along with a basic layout for all melee style lists. Let me begin with the basic layout. There are a limited amount of styles to work from. The first two are/should be basic newbie styles. However, after those 2, every style should provide equal potential regardless of level. The only difference between the styles will be the effects they provide. For example, a lvl 6 style would do the same damage as a level 44 style, but the difference is the lvl 6 style effect would be a snare, and the lvl 44 style would be a 9 second stun (to use effects examples from the current game). Lastly there would be 1 chain in the style lists, consisting of 4 styles, of which the last is always the lvl 50 style. So, to break it down:<br>
<br>
- 2 Newbie styles<br>
- One 4 part chain, ending with the lvl 50 style<br>
- Remainder are &quot;utility&quot; styles.<br>
<br>
Newbie Styles: These are the first 2 styles in the list. They are intended to familiarize brand new players to combat in DAoC. With the advent of /level for people with lvl 50 characters, these styles will never be used by people who already know how the combat system works. These are the only 2 styles that will ever become outdated to a character. The first style will always be a front positional. The reasoning for this is that many people who are new to DAoC will want some time to familiarize themselves with their characters and abilities before seeking out groups. They are obviously melee characters, and being solo, their opponents will always be facing them anyway. The second style would be a side/rear positional, with the intent of providing a more powerful positional attack to use should the new player choose to group or as an opener against non aggressive monsters.<br>
<br>
-&quot;The Chain&quot;: In RvR, when a melee class fights a melee class, the battle has usually already been decided at that point. A melee'er will never (short of the opponent being less than not very intelligent) get to use reactionaries based off Evade/Parry/Block when fighting a support or caster class. Having chains with these as requirements is handy dandy for soloing and duels, but tends to render the large majority of the desirable styles useless in RvR. &quot;The Chain&quot; is intended to be the tool for doing damage. Obviously the second style in the chain at least requires the successful application of the first style, and the 3rd requires at least the successful application of the second, etc. The requirement for the first style, is about the only major issue that I can't seem to bring myself to make a decision about. According to Mythic, the Light Tank's damage potential is supposed to come from positionals, namely the side positional (based on the 1.62 DW/CDW enhancements), so I'm inclined to follow their lead in this for style chains meant to do damage.<br>
<br>
The are a few good and bad features I would introduce into The Chain to balance out their intended damage potential. I envision that the damage from the 4th style in the chain would equal to pre-1.62 Berserker full crit damage from their best style, with the trade-off that it would be extremely difficult to succeed to the 4th style. Before I get to the &quot;extremely difficult to succeed&quot; part, I want to touch on effects.<br>
<br>
This is how I would do effects for the chain, and you'll see why in a bit. First style snares your opponent for a short duration (4-5 seconds after reasonable resists are factored in), the second style has a short stun (4-5 seconds full duration, as per current stun style mechanics), the third style would have a significant Bleed (as per the post 1.62 improved Mercenary/Blademaster bleeds) and the 4th (lvl 50 style) would be specifically tailored to the style line in question. I'll get to that later. The first style would have a Very High To-Hit bonus, the second would have a High To-Hit bonus, the third would have a Medium To-Hit bonus and the 4th would have a Low To-Hit bonus. The decreasing To-Hit bonus a trade-off for the damage potential mentioned. Other built in trade-offs can be increasing defensive penalties on each style in the chain.<br>
<br>
Ok..that being said, the &quot;extremely difficult to succeed&quot; part. I envision that, besides the first style, all the styles would have 2 requirements. Obviously the first requirement is that the previous style succeeded. The second requirement would be positionals that vary along the chain and a special requirement for the 4th style. For example: first style has a single requirement, lets say a side positional. After succeeding that, the opponent is now Snared. The second style requirement is that your character be facing the opponent (front positional). Once that is successful, the opponent is now Stunned. The third style requirement is that your character be behind the opponent (rear positional). Once that is successful, the opponent is now Bleeding Heavily.<br>
<br>
Now here's the final difficulty (and yes I know what this implies). The second requirement for the 4th style in The Chain is that a class &quot;special&quot; ability be triggered and active/alive/whatever. Here are some examples of a few I could think of. A Mercenary would have to trigger<br>
Dirty Tricks, a Berserker would have to trigger Vendo, a Blademaster would have to trigger Triple Wield, a Hero would have to trigger Moose, a Hunter would have to trigger their wolf pet (and it remain alive until the style is accomplished), etc. YES, I know this would require the<br>
inclusion of a &quot;special&quot; ability for every class that can melee...but I don't see this as a bad thing. A little fluff for Warriors and Armsman for example, is not something that would be frowned upon, I am sure.<br>
<br>
One last twist...a feature I would implement would ensure that The Chain wouldn't require that the melee character remain on the same target to succeed. As long as there are no unsuccessful attacks (including &quot;target out of range&quot; or &quot;target not in view&quot;) messages, the chain can be continued. An example to illustrate: I begin the chain with a successful application of the side positional (with snare effect) against a melee chasing a support class. I then quickly target and /stick a melee that is chasing me and successfully apply the second style (with stun effect). By now, a caster is kiting his melee'er towards me (hoping I could land a snare) and I switch to that melee opponent, /stick as he's moving by to automatically line up the rear positional requirement and successfully apply the 3rd style with it's Heavy Bleed. Unfortunate for my caster friend I didn't snare, but I could choose to trigger Dirty Tricks and apply the final whallop to that tank, or instead I could choose to switch targets to the PBAE'er that is unfortunate enough to come in range at that time and show him what Point Blank Damage really is!<br>
<br>
I'm sure you're all saying, that would be an unlikely event, and I agree. But it would be the type of achievement that would make you jump out of your chair and yell, &quot;YEAH!&quot;, right? Credit would be given where<br>
credit is due..if some players just have &quot;more&quot; skill and manage to get that chain off more often, there would be no doubting who is &quot;good&quot; and who is just spamming &quot;TEH I WIN&quot; button. And of course, you'd want people to KNOW when you get those chains off...or when you almost did...<br>
<br>
So, I would propose that the colour scheme for the styles be changed as well (the trailing blur behind the weapon, whatever that's called?). The newbie ones would have their own..just something plain like white or something. All the &quot;utility&quot; styles (which I'm going to get to soon) would have their own colour. Each style in The Chain would have their own colour. Dark Blue, Yellow, Orange and Dark Red for example. The final style would have an impressive animation/trailing effect that would be noticed. I would also add a battle yell sound..the type of &quot;I just WTFPWND you&quot; sound someone high on adrenaline would make. Think of a Berserker in battle type of yell. Anyway, this is already long and I'm not done yet.<br>
<br>
- &quot;Utility&quot; styles. Remember I mentioned customizability? These styles are what I was thinking of. Once the 4 styles in The Chain + the 2 Utility styles are accounted for, there are ?? styles remaining to play with. Each style has 6 properties: Opening, Effect, To-Hit, Damage, Endurance and Defence. Each property has several levels/options to it:<br>
<br>
-Opening: Anytime, Front, Side, Rear<br>
-Effect (each can also have various levels, such as stun duration or bleed value): None, Snare, Slow, Bleed, Taunt, Detaunt, Stun (my opinion is Melee Stun should be a property for shield users only, with the exception of the short stun hard coded in The Chain)<br>
-To-Hit: None, Low, Medium, High, Very High<br>
-Damage Bonus: None, Low, Medium, High, Very High (just Numerical Values based off the Growth Rates?)<br>
-Endurance: Low, Medium, High, Very High<br>
-Defence: Very High Penalty, High Penalty, Medium Penalty, Low Penalty, None, Low Bonus, Medium Bonus, High Bonus, Very High Bonus<br>
<br>
Each level of each property would be assigned a value based on it's desirability. Then each style would have a certain amount of &quot;points&quot; to spend based on style level. As an example, someone could have an Anytime Style with a High Damage, and Very High To-Hit, but he'd also be stuck with Very High endurance cost a High Defensive penalty and a near useless effect if one at all.<br>
<br>
I hope you can understand what I mean, and see where I'm coming from regarding &quot;utility&quot;. This kind of setup would allow for varying play styles. Pure defence, Pure offence, jack of all trades, etc...<br>
<br>
There are probably a lot of holes still in this, but I am writing this at work..little bits at a time. Feel free to enhance, fix or run with these ideas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=146.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.threadControl?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18>General Light Tank Discussion</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
