<br>
A dozen times, the scene played over in his mind, each time unaltered in its content, unchanged in its conclusion.   He saw her face as clearly as the planet-rise through the tower window – her hair as white as the aura on the edge of the sun-struck sphere of Norrath.  His scribe, one of three servants that had chosen to follow him to the solitude of their Luclin sanctum, watched in silence as Nospiratus stared out the window at planet-rise.  His tasks had changed with the new manner of Nospiratus’ visions.  No longer was he the invisible hand that wielded the penmanship of visions transcribed.  Instead, he was a friend, a confidant and one who worked as a partner with the Prophet in deciphering the many layers of meanings trapped beneath the surface of madness.<br>
<br>
Nospiratus shook his head, his hand reflexively feeling for the silver flask bound within the leather sheath at his hip.  The vodka was there, cold and ready to relieve him, should he need such.  Of course, since the change he didn’t need to drink, and the flask remained unopened even as his fingers danced across the smooth surface with a familiar intimacy. Finally, he sighed and turned to the scribe.<br>
<br>
“The same, my friend.  Still the same.”  Nospiratus glanced toward his desk, stacked under with prophetic volumes and the half-formed musings of his own interpretations.  Sneering in disgust, he waked away from the month’s work that cluttered the teak surface.  “Useless garbage,” he muttered as he paced.<br>
<br>
The scribe cleared his throat once, and when the Prophet graced him with a glance and a brow raised in query, he said, “Thus said the Prophet Zeranda T’Kliath of Nerios - ‘Two shall enter the Western Port, but only one will emerge.  The balance of Hate and its opposite shall bring about the beginning of the end, a completion and an origin.  With their sacrifice, the future of Norrath will be sealed’.”<br>
<br>
Nospiratus snorted in response.  “Zeranda was a stooge of the King.  Three quarters of her prophecies were politically motivated, and after she was finally assassinated her daughter declared that her mother had only shared prophecies those that supported her sovereign.”  Nospiratus’ tone was bitter, and he vented the flavor liberally.<br>
<br>
“Forgive me, my lord,” the scribe said quietly.  “I had thought we were attempting to resolve the meaning of prophecy here.  If you wish to ignore those former prophets who may have had a different philosophical bent than you, then perhaps you should alert me before I begin my research.  Perhaps if his Grace could give his servant a list of acceptable prophets…”<br>
<br>
“Enough!” snapped Nospiratus.  His face was flushed with the surge of his hatred – so strong and tangible now, and always so near the surface.  After a moment, he smirked slowly and added, “I get the point.  You were much simpler to deal with when I never saw you.”<br>
<br>
The scribe nodded once.  “My task was also much easier when you were asleep my lord.  At least then I did not have to tolerate your owlishness.”<br>
Nospiratus smirked again.  Katarinia had infected all of them with her mannerisms, her environmental tastes, and her language.  The three servants doted upon her as if she carried their sons in her growing womb, not his.  His son…<br>
<br>
Turning back toward the window he watched the sphere clear the horizon, filling most of the window frame with its luminescence.  Almost, he could see the waves surging across the gravel beneath the docks in the city where his son would be born and raised – away from his parents, away from the birthright that would have been his had his father remained within the covenant imposed by the Prince of Hate.  In his pride, Nospiratus had chosen to cast aside that sacred trust, and in his pride he would be punished by the loss of his son.  Kelebrindor would never bear the name K’Thalion now, in fact he would never know hate nor be able to tap into the wellspring of divine power that coursed through the blood of his parents.  There was nothing he could do about it now – nothing he would do if he could.  He had chosen freedom and independence for himself and for Katarinia over the preservation of the patriarchal line.  His choice complete, the future was sealed.<br>
<br>
Looking back to the scribe, Nospiratus asked, “Are the two mother and child or are they myself and ma vie?”<br>
<br>
Black eyes looked on expressionless, as the scribe intoned from memory, “Accoridng to the Prophet Nospiratus K’Thalion, ‘And they shall be bound in the blood of Hate with the hungry eyes of vengeance standing as witness…’  You were quite clear that you would be bonded, Prophet.  But, we cannot be certain that your little rebellion against the Prince has not offered some change in the course of events.”<br>
<br>
Nospiratus shook his head.  “No.  I have never uttered a false lead.  The visions have always been correct, regardless of changes in the vortex of life and reality.  If you penned it correctly,” and he added with a quick smirk, “which I am certain you did, then the bonding will take place in the blood of Hate.  So these new visions must therefore be an echo of those foretold by the King’s prophetess, as you suggested.  They must foretell of the Child Of Nimhiliel Innoroki, and the leaving that I see is that of the birth of my son.”<br>
<br>
“Logical, rational and reasonable, my lord,” intoned the scribe.<br>
<br>
“Aye,” agreed Nospiratus.  “That is what has me worried.  “Qeynos must fall as has been foretold –the Fall of the West must be made to happen to announce the beginning of the end of the Light.  But, when the Mad Prophet provides a rational connection…”<br>
<br>
“Then it is best to have a back up plan,” the scribe added.<br>
<br>
Nospiratus glanced at the scribe quickly, then nodded.  “You are right my friend.  We haven’t much time and there is much to be done.”<br>
<br>
“Then its about damn time we get to it instead of staring at the world form our window of morosity.”<br>
<br>
Nospiratus paused as he reached to clear a workspace on his desk.  “Tell me scribe, have you always been this sarcastic?”<br>
<br>
“My lord, had you endured fifty-six seasons of your own drunken ramblings, I somehow doubt you would be as pleasant as I.”<br>
<br>
Nospiratus stared at the scribe for a moment then nodded in silent agreement.  Without another word, the two set to the work of ensuring that the shadow converging upon Qeynos would see that his vision would be true to the interpretation he most desired.  Like an asp, his finger struck at the symbol of Qeynos, and with a grin worthy of the dark purpose in his mind, he began to trace the possibilities and lay the foundation for the end of time.<br>

Its light falling upon the fog covered ground. Silence hung heavy through the sparsly wooded plain as silent feet moved with blinding speed, the fog giving way briefly to the creatures passing. <br>
Ghost could barely keep up as he and his master trailed the creatures wake. Its wings spread wide for added speed hung like a darker cloud over its form. Occasionally the moonlight would glint off the tallons which graced its hands. <br>
A soft snarl reached the ears of the rider as the creature came to a halt, it crouched low as though scenting a track. Its eyes glinted eiriely as it turned briefly to face him. He could make out the fangs, so close was he, the sight making his heart race in both fear and awe. As it rose he noted the supple form. Female by all accounts. Kneeing Ghost the rider moved forward as the creature sprinted once more into a run. Yes, it was definatly tracking something. The question was what?<br>
In the distance the rider could make out the faint glow of a dying fire and knew instinctively that the person or persons about the fire where the creatures prey. He spurred the horse on to circle the encampment. To come from the opposite side of the creature. From the darkness he could make out the silver hair of the occupant of the camp. A young man lay stretched out upon his bedroll lost to sleep, but not for long as suddenly its battlecry filled the air. <br>
Before the young man could even rise he found himself held fast to the ground, frightened emerald eyes met the hatred burried deep in the darker emerald eyes the creature. It hissed at him as it raised a taloned hand over his head. <br>
&quot;Stop!&quot; Nos cried out as he recognized the man, boy really. Not more than twenty perhaps. He lept from the back of his horse and charged into the camp. No thought of his own welfare only that of saving his child and his bondmate. &quot;Kat, wait.. please Ma' Vie.. dont.. &quot; his voice softened as he drew nearer, attempting to calm the rage and hatred in the creatures eyes as it swung its head to look upon the intruder, it hissed softly, &quot;How dare you, mortal, interfer in the fathers work?&quot; It rose then, an unuttered spell holding the boy fast as it stepped over him and approached the prophet. &quot;Do you know the price for interfering in the Fathers Wrath?&quot; It growled at him as its body coiled, preparing to strike. &quot;Kat, you cant, not our son.. think.. dont let him do this to you, to us.... &quot; Nos found his words cut short as he was suddenly, and roughly flung to the ground. The speed at which it had struck him had left him no time to prepare. He found himself now laying beside his son, equally paralyzed. <br>
It chuckled softly as it crouched between the two men, &quot;night and day.. &quot; it whispered softly as it took its leasuire at studying the contrasting difference between the two men,&quot; The father will be pleased at this nights offering. Kelebrindor!&quot; its gaze then fell exclusively on the boy, &quot;Your existance is an abomination in the eyes of the Father, for this you will meet your end. Nospiratus!&quot; It turned then to look upon the father, &quot;You have interefered for the last time in the work of the Father, You too shall pay the ultimate price.&quot;<br>
Almost gently a taloned hand come to rest against each exposed neck, for a brief moment cupping the curve, then with a singlure vicious swipe the skin was parted and the jugular severed on both. Their blood mingled and drenched the earth. &quot;Return to the abyss of hatred, to feed the fires..&quot; It growled, its words the last either would ever hear, as their lifes blood stained the ground. <br>
As the life flickered then seeped from two pair of eyes the creature sat back upon its heels, its head lowering as a sudden overwhelming pain engulfed it. An inner pain never felt before. A howl of rage broke from it.. &quot;No!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot; Kat woke with a start, her heart pounding with fear. Her hands moved frantically to craddle the still growing child within her. &quot;No.. &quot; she whispered softly. &quot;What is it Ma' Vie,&quot; Nos asked softly as his hands reached to pull her down beside him. His arms coming about her to craddle her against him. &quot;A dream.. just a bad dream.. &quot; she whispered softly, trying to convince herself. &quot;Aye Ma' Vie.. just a bad dream, rest now. Close your eyes. Nothing will harm you.&quot; Nos' words soothed her back to sleep. Yet even as she slept he remained vigilant. A dream he had said, but was it really. Or was it a omen of what was to come should their path sway?<br>
