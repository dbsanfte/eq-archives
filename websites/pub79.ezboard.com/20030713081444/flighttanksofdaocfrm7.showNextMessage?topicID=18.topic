<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Overview</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The Savage is a fun class to play, but there is still a good deal of work to go before we're ready for release.  There are still some major bugs with the Savagery line, most notably the ability to resist our own buffs as well as the strange morphing that changes the abilities when we have other buffs or effects on us.  The Hand to Hand line is a good line, but there are some potential concerns with the styles.  Additionally, many of the effects on the styles are missing or don't work.  There is also a significant discrepancy between the character stats most useful to the class and the stats that raise as we level.  This needs direct attention.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Statistics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The Savage currently has STR, DEX, and QUI as advancing stats. STR is, in fact, tertiary. However, the Savage's weaponry seems to now STR/DEX based. The Savage, with the way their weaponry, skills, and magical abilities are set up, really need 4 stats to raise: STR, DEX, QUI, and CON. Because I am a proponent for spec-diversity, I would like to see a self-only CON buff as an innate ability to assist in the raising of CON while leaving the stats and weapons as-is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion: <br>
<br>
1. Create a self-only CON buff as an innate ability to assist with the CON needs of the class while leaving the primary statistics and weapons as they are.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I believe it is also necessary to make sure the Savage is:<br>
<br>
1.  On the heavy tank HP table, given that our special abilities cost health to use.<br>
2.  Using the heavy tank STR damage tables for their QUI/DEX weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Savagery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In many views, this should be the 'bread-n-butter' line for the Savage.  Without this line, the Savage becomes a dual-wield/parry class, or a Berserker II.  There is still concern that the cost-benefit ratio still has not reached an acceptable level.  The recent increase in duration and decrease in costs has helped some, but some of the abilities are still not showing much combat performance improvement when compared to performance when not using them at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bugs</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Outside buffs/affects prevent Savagery abilities from working.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With the most recent patch, this bug is fixed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Savage Abilities cannot be 'delved' unless they are cast.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As of the most recent patch, this bug no longer exists. However, in-game delving does not produce the quantitave description of effect, only the spell name and minor miscellaneous information.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Issues</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>DPS Buff Increase Not Enough</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
For instance, the DPS buff.  At level 1, the buff increases DPS by 5%.  On a level 20, 7.1 dps weapon, this is little more than a .3dps increase.  This is barely noticable.  Even with the high level version, the 25% DPS increase on a 16.5dps weapon only increases the DPS of the weapon to 20.6.  Through the damage formulae, this works out to be roughly equivalent to an 8dps Damage Add.  However, the damage provided by the DPS buff is all subject to the melee resistance of the target, which Damage Adds are not.  The buff needs to exceed that of other self damage add buffs in the game because of it's much shorter duration and much higher cost.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Alter the range of the buffs  10%, 18%, 29%, 37%, 45%, 50%.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kelgor's Vigor Alteration</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kelgor's Vigor is not likely to be used, given that most Savage weapon styles are low fatigue.  The Shaman Endurance buffs make it even less likely.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Make Kelgor's Vigor a focus regeneration ability.  The ability would work similar to a focus damage shield in that any attack, movement, or action would interrupt it, making it impossible to use while in combat.  While active, the ability would slowly drain Endurance and quickly regenerate HP.  This would help reduce downtime for the Savage, which is one of our biggest leveling problems.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hand-to-Hand</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There are some concerns about the Hand-to-Hand line's style list.  There is only one 'anytime' style that has bonus damage associated with it, and it is also our taunt style.  This makes the anytime style unattractive in group situations where we may not want to be tanking.  It also gives little variety for our main style in RvR.  The other concern is that the line's defining styles, the ones with PBAE attacks associated, are all second tier on reactionary or positional chains.  There are none that we can readily use.  The final concern is that our stun is secondary off a side-positional style.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bugs</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Effects Missing from Styles</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Positional Styles</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Side positional styles are very, very difficult to pull off in RvR.  As such, this nearly negates the usefulness of having a 9 second stun in the line.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Swap the positional styles' position requirements.  Change Clan's Call to be Side Positional and Kelgor's Fist to be Rear Positional.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PBAE Styles</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
None of the line defining PBAE damage styles are readily available.  They are all secondary off reactionary or positional chains.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Remove the prerequisite from Clan's Might, opening up only 1 2-target style.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No Good Anytime Styles</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The 'Coup de Gras' style of this line is a 3-tier chain off an evade.  However, the style that increases evade chance will never be used.  Why?  Because it has no bonus damage.  <br>
<br>
Kelgor's Claw has medium fatigue cost and the only thing it is designed to do is increase chance to evade.  This style would be perfect if it also contained a high bonus damage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion: Add a high bonus damage component to Kelgor's Claw. Increase fatigue cost if necessary.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

1.  The level 5 guild gift for the 'slash' choice cons red to level 5.  The 'pierce' gift cons yellow.<br>
<br>
2.  The level 7 quest text after receiving the reward tells you to go have the item enchanted by the enchanter, yet the item cannot be enchanted.<br>
<br>
3.  The Savage retains the small shield ability.  However, upon gaining level 5 and removing my shield, I was unable to re-equip the small training shield.  The messaging said I had not skill with items of this type.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Suggestions</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There is one thing I think would solidify the Savage's niche within Midgard without stepping on the toes of the Berserker:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sense Aggression</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - this would be an ability added to the Savagery line. Radius: 350, Duration: 10s, Cost: 25% health/instant, Casting Time: Instant, Effect: Cause Savage to see 'shadowed' form of all stealthers within the radius of effect for the duration of the ability.  Midgard needs a class with anti-stealth abilities to counter Albion's and Hibernia's.  This ability would help distance the Savage from the Berserker's role in Midgard as well.  With the health cost so high, and instant, this spell could not be used to solo hunt assassins, but it would be useful in helping protect a group of friends. Place this at Spec 34.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Conclusion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Bugs:<br>
<br>
1. No Parry increase with Kelgor's Bane.<br>
2. No Attack Speed Debuff with Kelgor's Might.<br>
3. No Bleed Effect with Clan's Might.<br>
4. No Evade increase with Kelgor's Claw.<br>
5. No Parry increase with Tribal Wrath.<br>
6. The level 5 guild gift for the 'slash' choice cons red to level 5.<br>
7. The Savage retains the small shield ability. However, upon gaining level 5 and removing my shield, I was unable to re-equip the small training shield. The messaging said I had not skill with items of this type.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestions:<br>
<br>
1. Add an innate, passive, CON buff to the Savage: Levels 10 (+<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , 20 (+16), 30 (+24), and 40 (+32).<br>
2. Swap the positional requirements of Clan's Call (change to &quot;Side&quot;) and Kelgor's Fist (change to &quot;Back&quot;).<br>
3. Remove the prerequisite requirement from Clan's Might.<br>
4. Sense Aggression - Radius: 350, Duration: 10s, Cost: 25% health/instant, Casting Time: Instant, Effect: Cause Savage to see 'shadowed' form of all stealthers within the radius of effect for the duration of the ability. Savagery spec 34.<br>
5. Alter the range of the DPS buffs as follows: 10%, 18%, 29%, 37%, 45%, 50%.<br>
6. Make Kelgor's Vigor a focus regeneration ability. The ability would work similar to a focus damage shield in that any attack, movement, or action would interrupt it, making it impossible to use while in combat. While active, the ability would slowly drain Endurance and quickly regenerate HP. This would help reduce downtime for the Savage, which is one of our biggest leveling problems.<br>
7. Add a high bonus damage component to Kelgor's Claw. Increase fatigue cost if necessary. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trevanti>Trevanti</A> at: 11/21/02 7:41:56 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=16.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=16.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.threadControl?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm7>Team Lead Reports</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
