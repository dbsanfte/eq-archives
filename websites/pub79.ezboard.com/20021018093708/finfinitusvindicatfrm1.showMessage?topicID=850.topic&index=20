Sorry we had to be next to your raid. You know this. And yes, I've tried pulling SW or Hosh to the zone in before and there are nasty Line of Sight issues and tons of adds come. Your raid was never in danger - we were waiting for Hosh to roam upto the safe spot, then we'd pull her. Also the reason we waited so long was for Trabius' burn to refresh.]<br>
<br>
Then you had no business being there with us did you? Dont say your sorry unless you mean it, which clearly you dont. If we can pull Phara Dar with ONE monk from deep in his lair...and both those dragons roam VERY close to the zone in, then either your monk sucks, you dont want to take risks, are lazy, or just dont care that we were there and wanted to one-up us. None of these excuses wash. You had no business being in our pull spot.<br>
<br>
[PNP RULES : Whoever first engages/pulls the mob gets the kill, and moreover whoever does DAMAGE to the mob first gets the kill. The guide was totally in the wrong considering our burner got summoned (meaning he was ONLY person on agro list cause its such a low agro spell, if you didn't know). MB = the equivalent of a level 1 nuke agro, maybe lower, hence Trabius' burn hit before any of you engaged.]<br>
<br>
Once again, you assume Sumie even knows for sure he had agro first. The dragons WARP in there, its never a 100% for sure thing you will know who got agro there first. We pulled a roamer and both dragons warped on top of us....thats how we wiped in the first place. Neither dragon was even visible to Judaih, and from what im told, werent even close to where he pulled from. Even if Sumie threw a shuriken the dragon may have already been agro on Judaih, who may have FD causing Sumie to die. Not one of us, standing in the back of the cubby will EVER know for sure who got what. The guide was watching the whole thing and made up his own mind. You put yourselves in that position...only YOU did that.<br>
<br>
If Trabius MB'd with Judaih FD and Sumie dead...then yes he would have been next on the hit list. That still doesnt make the dragon your pull for sure. The fact he MB'd so early, ahead of you all makes me believe he was trigger happy and didnt care about who had agro. He was there with SA back in June, Im sure he had his own motivations for being there.<br>
<br>
[2) IV has no right complaining about FCFS in VP considering your previous practices. And yes, you were extremely rude in the whole process, even when Hawx (whos' fairly more diplomatic than I am) wanted to kill.]<br>
<br>
Your hypocrits...you and the folks in your guilds who bashed us back in June for being in VP when SA was there, so now you use that to justify doing it to us. Also, dont EVEN use &quot;practices&quot; plural. We have had one incident in VP and YOUR guild, given ALL of the SHIT its pulled since the server went FCFS has NO right to be judging ANYONE. Hypocrit. <br>
<br>
As far as being rude to you, you got back what you gave out. Your attitudes from the start set the tone for how that was gonna go. Dont even start on us about being rude, youre just making any excuse you can to cover yourselves. <br>
<br>
[3) The only way to kill Phara dar is with a much greator support crew of a magician, rogue, and monk with rez staff, all of which we don't have.]<br>
<br>
Oh you mean bring an actual RAID to VP? God forbid. You were going for some easy plats....period.<br>
<br>
[4) The fact that none of you were willing to stand up for the truth, since you know we pulled that mob and you didn't (honestly ask Judaih and see if he dares to lie), in front of a GM is bullshit. It's obivous that the guide was a moron but witholding the truth is lying in my book. I may be mad as hell but the graceful thing to do is say, &quot;Ok we got FCFS'd lets move onto another mob.&quot; Not to go bitching about it to a GM.]<br>
<br>
Your truth is all that is, your slanted arguement is more like it. You claim you pulled the dragon, but thats all that is, a claim..you didnt pull it yourself Aleolin so you dont know...period. Your asking us to admit to something 99% maybe even 100% dont even know for sure giving the warping that goes on in that zone. We have been FCFS'd it happens. When its happened we HAVE accepted it and moved on. Being gracious and being a doormat for people like you are two different things, we dont lay down for anyone.<br>
<br>
However those who have FCFS'd us usually havent been in a zone that the whole server seems to think is a one raid zone. Can you not see our point? We were berated on Prexus.com for doing exactly what you guys did, since then we havent done it have we? Our guild decided we wouldnt do that again, to try to get along, even though alot of us disagree about the zone, myself included.<br>
<br>
So you are using whatever excuses you can find to justify doing what you did. Those who support you are total hypocrits for doing so, because they should either be for the zone being FCFS or not. If they arent, they should condemn you just as we were condemned. If they dont, then its a personal thing, a vendetta against us. If thats the case, then why should we care what you or they think? <br>
<br>
Either IV is treated like every other guild on this server, with respect to how zones are treated, or theres no reason for us to care about your opinions. We havent been to VP since June, the guild decided it would abide by what the trolls wanted, despite our own internal disagreements over it. Until you guys zoned into VP IV hadnt had any issues like this in 3 months, we have minded our own business and done our own thing. YOU caused this, not us.<br>
<br>
That &quot;guide&quot; your calling a moron may actually know more about the game than you do. You dont know him, you dont know where hes from. You know nothing except what Sumie is claming and maybe Sumie is lying or maybe YOU all are lying? Either way you people put yourselves in that position, you have only yourselves to blame.<br>

<br>
So, you had 30 people for VP, which is exactly the number I said that you needed.  It's a 32K mob, 10 extra people make a HUGE difference, especially considering Hoshkar has a 1200 Hitpoint AE + Dot + 70% slow.  He also gates.  He LOVES to Gate. If out of those 20 you had at least 2 aren't level 60 Wizards; better with 3, then yes.  You would never have killed him.  He would have gated and owned you.<br>
<br>
Phara Dar is EASIER than Hoshkar.  Any mob that you can hide from the AE, is EASIER.  Don't take my word for it  you moron, just look at history. Hoshkar was not killed until after KTF had killed every other dragon there, several times.  Have you never spoken to a member of KTF and had them tell you how much they hate Hoshkar?  Phara Dar also tends to be a longer fight, due to the weaker melee of the mob.  He normally goes OOM so gating is rarely, if ever, an issue.  <br>
<br>
By the way.  We killed Hoshkar with 17 people.<br>
<br>
We cleared VP with 24.<br>
<br>
No guests,  All FA, were the 3rd or 4th guild on the server to do it.<br>
<br>
Grieg, LOL, is SUCH a different type of an encounter than VP Dragon raids.  We've also killed Grieg too, not that it matters.  And Tunare, and Sontalak (the new one) Dain with 27 people..<br>
