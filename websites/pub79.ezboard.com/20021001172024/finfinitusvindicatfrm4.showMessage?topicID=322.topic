IV is a dragon-aligned guild. However, we are done farming HoT for armor, only going there for named. It is highly recommended, but not required, that you be non-kos to CoV. We WILL continue killing Giants, and named in N ToV. If you wish to keep ally, faction is YOUR responsibility.<br><br>2. IV raids a LOT. If, for any reason, you consider raiding as a &quot;waste of time,&quot; then you are advised to search elsewhere for a new guild.<br><br>3. IV does loot based on merit. We always have and always will. If you are unwilling or unable to wait your turn for loot items behind those who have earned them, go elsewhere.<br><br>4. IV is not an epic or a loot factory: if your goal is to &quot;get your epic&quot;or to &quot;get better stuff&quot; as quickly as possible, then you are advised to go elsewhere or be patient.<br><br>5. A great number of IV members are &quot;old school&quot; players and know many people in many guilds. If you have a bad reputation from past actions or misunderstandings, it is best to bring it up immediately and explain it; otherwise, people tend to assume the worst about you. It is also surprising the number of people who apply, or ask about applying, who have bad histories with one or more of our members; if you do, you are advised to work out the problem before applying.<br><br>6. We are getting more and more selective about new members. We have an abundance of some classes and lack others. Please keep this in mind when you apply for membership. An upbeat personality and a positive attitude are the most important factors for membership and always will be, but some people will find simply that they have a harder time shining among all the great members we have already.<br><br>7. TALK TO PEOPLE. If you come on a raid and do not joke, chatter, play around or have fun, you won't make much of an impression, and that won't endear us to invite you into our family.<br><br>8. If you are of the minimum level to join, EXPECT TO XP. 58 is the BARE MINIMUM level to join - it does not mean you contribute as much as others. LEVEL MATTERS. Know this, understand this. <br><br>APPLICATION PROCESS<br>1. Post an application thread in the Membership Application section. Tell us about yourself and what draws you to IV.<br><br>2. All applicants not currently pending vote for admission will now be required to attend no less than ten guild raids before they become eligible for a guild vote for admittance.<br><br>2. Applicants are required to post to the Raid Attendance thread in this forum with the name of the raid, date of the raid, and the raid leader. DO NOT REPLY TO THIS THREAD ONCE YOU HAVE STARTED A POST ON THE THREAD, EDIT YOUR POST TO REFLECT THE ADDITIONAL RAIDS AND GROUPINGS.<br><br>4. Each applicant is required to have two Infinitus Vindicat sponsors to speak on their behalf.<br><br>5. Applicants who have not attended their first raid within 30 days will have their application deleted with the assumption you are no longer interested in admittance to Infinite Vision. Exceptions to this rule will be reviewed by the Council and dealt with on a case by case basis.<br><br>6. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact and join in experience groups with Infinite Vision members. These groupings will speed the voting process considerably. Although these groupings will not count as a raid, you should post to your raids attended with the group leader and where the group was fighting for experience. <br><br>7. The Vote:<br>After you have acquired 10 raids and 2 sponsors, our recruiting officer, will create a post in our members section where members will have one week (1 week) to vote. A minimum of 25 members are required to pass with no more than 5 votes against. After the 1 week period, Our recruiting officer will inform you on the outcome of the vote. <br><br>If you do not pass the vote because you have more than 5 votes against, that usually means you have some issues to work out with a few members before being able to reapply. You will not be able to reapply for a period of 2 months.<br><br>If you do not pass the vote because you have less than 25 sponsors *and* you have no more than 5 votes against, this usually means not enough people know you and you must continue to make friends in the guild and make yourself known to our members. You will be able to reapply in 3 weeks time. <br><br>The &quot;MORTAL ENEMY&quot; clause <br><br>If a candidate has wronged an Infinite Vision member to the point where if that candidate were to join the current member would leave, that candidate cannot continue in the process. Infinite Vision is building our tight family atmosphere by being, well, a tight knit family. Officers will ALWAYS side with the guild in these kinds of matters. It should be noted however that invocation of this clause requires an investigation into the situation between the candidate and the member, and is not to be used lightly. Abuse of this clause is against Infinite Vision policy and carries with it heavy consequences (suspension, guild removal).<br><br>8. The first month: Provisional Membership<br>If the candidate has met the above criteria, then the candidate is invited to the guild by either the Admissions Officer (Carit) or someone she designates. He/she will have access to our guild tag, chat, and private message board. As a provisional member, they are on a one (1) month probational term. During this probationary period the new member is required to do the following: <br><br>1. Learn and follow guild policy. <br>2. Attend scheduled raids (if they are online). <br>3. Attend scheduled guild meetings (unless RL circumstances do not allow). <br>4. It should be noted that the initial month of membership is probational. The guild leaders have the right to remove anyone during their probation period for any reason the officers deem reasonable. <br>5. Failure to meet these requirements at the end of the one month term is grounds for dismissal.<br><br>9. Full Membership <br><br>Full membership is granted to a new member at the end of the one month period provided they have met the above requirements. You now are officially part of the IV family <br><br>Current IV Officers <br>Walker <br>Backalley <br>Farging<br>Carit<br>Raknid<br>Mullzy <br>Atorsh<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukarat56.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karat56</A> at: 8/10/02 9:34:40 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=322.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm4.threadControl?topicID=322.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=322.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=322.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="infinitusvindicatfrm1">The Commons<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm9">OT Discussions and Debates<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm5">Screenshots<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm2">The Inner Sanctum<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm17">Guild Policies<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm4">Membership Application<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm24">Membership Voting<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm12">Strategy Room<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm25">Merit Information<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm13">The Auction House<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm20">Chamber of the High Guard<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm23">Forum Access Requests<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm18">Make Suggestions<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm26">Message Archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/binfinitusvindicat>Infinite Vision</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm4>Membership Application</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com">Infinite Vision Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <body bgcolor="#333366" text="#FFFFFF" topmargin="0" leftmargin="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">  <tr>    <td width="100%">      <p align="center" class="smalltype">      <a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/index.asp">IV Home</a> | <a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/about.asp">About IV</a> | <a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/news.asp">Guild News</a> |       <a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/membership.asp">Membership</a> | <a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/roster.asp">Guild Roster</a><br>      <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/binfinitusvindicat">IV Forums</a> |       <a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/library.asp">Library</a>      </p>    </td>  </tr></table></body> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
