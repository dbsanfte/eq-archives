<br>
OOC The series that follows explores the dynamics of enemies ... and may at times contain adult themes...so be forewarned... <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Selilya had finally made the decision to visit the new land. She detested the cold, but had heard many positive reports of the untapped wealth to be had. The Violent Harvest had even been invited to join General Zirrix T'Rhennic in a hunt. He proposed warring against the spiteful Coldain in an effort to forge an alliance with a previouly unseen tribe of followers of Rallos Zek. <br>
<br>
Some of the Harvest had already journeyed to the new land and had whetted her appetite with stories of amazing creatures to hunt, new peoples to conquer, and treasures unseen previously. She wanted to investigate these Coldain herself to ascertain why the General found destroying them so palatable. She was not adverse to killing dwarfs, in fact, she relished the opportunity. <br>
<br>
Her husband, Ernseax, had healed nicely from the wounds he received from his misadventure in Guk, and he had already left for the hunt again, leaving her alone once more. Perhaps it was for the best anyway, for her duties as Winnower had priority in carrying out the will of the Father. <br>
<br>
She completed furnishing her backpack and extinguished the lanterns in the cottage. With a lingering glance over the cottage she called home, she tried to drink in all the images of warmth to sustain her for the cold, dark trip ahead. <br>
<br>
She met Dephiler at the entrance to Neriak. He had offered to transport her to the new land. He was a rather new recruit to the Harvest, but she instantly saw the raging fire of hate burning within him and knew he had found his place amongst the Chosen. <br>
<br>
&quot;Winnower, you will want to cast invisibilty on yourself. Oh, and be ready to fight,&quot; he snickered. &quot;It can sometimes be...well...a rude arrival.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed?&quot; she asked. &quot;Well, this sounds like fun&quot; <br>
<br>
Dephiler cast his magics and within seconds they had appeared at the teleportation spot. Dephiler bowed and wished Selilya a safe journey. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wish you had brought an escort, Winnower. Your safety is always our concern,&quot; he stated. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I know, my friend. I think I will do better alone. I won't be worrying about any parties.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish.&quot; Dephiler chanted his spell and was gone in a flash. <br>
<br>
&quot;My, it is cold,&quot; she uttered, as she pulled her cloak tightly around herself. <br>
<br>
She gazed at the sights before her. It was a land of white...in all directions. The creatures she saw were truly amazing. It was almost joyful to her to see such wonders....yet she kept a tight fist on her staff just in case. This was not a place where she wanted to meet her end. <br>
<br>
Ahead in the distance, she saw the dragon bridge. It had  been described to her in countless reports, but nothing could take the place of witnessing it in person. Her gawk was short-lived, as she saw some of the more vicious tenants of the land heading her way. Not wanting to engage in battle so soon, she hastened her steps past the giant on watch and made her way across. <br>
<br>
As she stepped off the bridge she scanned the horizon before her. Again, rolling nolls of white in every direction. It would be easy to get lost here, she observed, and she was grateful she had such keenly developed navigational skills. She wanted to pass through these Eastern Wastes quickly. She didn't want to be out here when night fell. <br>
<br>
She checked her flimsy map once again and set out towards the valley leading to the Great Divide. It was difficult for her not to linger and explore the new structures she saw. She saw some Coldain and some Orcs even...and she steered clear. No, she had to press on. There would be another time...and she made her way into the Great Divide. <br>
<br>
Selilya decided to sit for a moment and nibble on a fishcake she had brought and take a drink of water. She again gazed on the the terrain before her before setting off. She knew from her map that Thurgadin would be off to her right. So she warily set off in that direction but then paused. Supposedly this was also where wurms abode as well. She was most curious to espy one and decided it would be just a slight delay in her trip to head to the wurm caves. There were some steeper hills and more boulders visible as she neared the caves. <br>
<br>
She observed a group of hunters off in the trees, knowing they were waiting to snare a wurm. Not wanting to distract them she made her way atop the wurm cave to cross over to the other side of the stream undetected. She knew the waters would be most unpleasant should she choose to wade across, so she took a quick survey of the shoreline...and then she saw what she was looking for. Not far upstream were six smooth boulders jutting out of the water's surface. These would be perfect for the brief hop to the other side. <br>
<br>
She was halfway across when a Guardian Shardwurm roared behind her, the very force of its blast knocking her into the icy water. Selilya's mind didn't register the shock to her system. She was scrambling away to avoid the sharp claws. Unfortunately she felt the flesh in her shoulder being ripped viciously by one one its talons. Her body shook violently when she plummeted into the snow drift trying to evade the monster behind her. She barely heard the shouts of the closing hunting party as they taunted the wurm away from her. <br>
<br>
Then the snow began to fall...and the wind seemed to howl in gale fury from the north. Despite the sharp pain and biting cold that tore into her consciousness, she knew she had to get up and make her way to Thurgadin. An icy death awaited her if she failed to find warmth soon. <br>
<br>
Blinded by the stinging shards of icy snow, she pressed on in the direction she felt would lead her to the city. She stumbled on rocks and slipped on icy patches of earth. The minutes seemed to become hours. Soon, there was utter silence. The blizzard left as quickly as it had come...and Selilya had wandered... <br>
<br>
Terrified, she quickly assessed her situation. She was trembling from the biting elements and quite lost. To top it all off...she was perched upon a minor cliff... and, although a fall would not result in death, it would be most painful. She began to look for a way down. <br>
<br>
Her eyes began to focus on the terrain below. And there he was. Of all places to encounter an enemy, he was here. The barbarian, McMad. She must have made quite a ruckus as she was trying to orient herself, because he was glaring at her even now. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ha!&quot; he cried. &quot;You still spy on me, dark one?&quot; He seemed to gloat. In that moment, however, he failed to see the pair of dire wolves approaching him from the rear. <br>
<br>
&quot;McMad! Behind you!&quot; Selilya screamed...without even knowing why. She began to take a step forward to see if she'd been heard...and then the cliff gave way. <br>
<br>
Her whole existence seemed to come to a crawl as images of seasons before flashed through her mind. She tumbled headlong into darkness...her head finding its resting place on a boulder at the bottom of the precipe. <br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
McMad takes a deep breath, inhaling the crisp cold mountain air. He is a big man, big even for a barbarian. Heavy furs are strapped over his deep blue armor to fight the cold, giving him the appearance of a great roaming beast from afar. A huge finely crafted bastard sword is strapped to his back, arranged so that it can be drawn quickly. A wicked looking long sword rests in its sheath at his side, its hilt shaped to resembled a striking adder. Slowly he scans the horizon, searching for the best path to climb out of the ravine, his gaze coming to rest on a figure studying him from a rather precarious position on a cliff above. A small chuckle escapes his lips as he recognizes the form of the Teir’Dal female. Selilya. He would know her anywhere, even from this distance. She had followed him to this new land? She was more stubborn than he thought. The big man shakes his head. Obviously she had not been prepared for the cold as she only wore a single cloak and the dark robes that marked her as a necromancer. He grins to himself, wondering if he should tell her she is standing on a snow bank. The fall won’t kill her, but it will teach her a lesson. <br>
<br>
Chuckling he raises his voice to a shout. “Ha! Ya still spyin’ on me dark one?” He struggles to hide the broadening grin crossing his face, “Well ya might want ta..” <br>
<br>
The look of fear crossing her face interrupts him. Stepping forward she shouts “McMad! Behind you!” Her step causes the snow bank to crumble and she falls. McMad takes a step towards her to help, but before he can complete it he is struck from behind, the force almost knocking him to the ground. <br>
<br>
He recognizes the growling immediately. A dire wolf! Cursing his luck, he reaches for the sword on his back and whirls to face his attacker, but before he can get the sword drawn, once again he is hit from behind, the force pushes him forward and he is quickly covered by a snow. <br>
<br>
“By tha hammers, she went and caused and avalanche,” McMad growls quickly trying to push his way out of the snow before the wolves take the opportunity to make him their supper. Breaking the surface of the small downslide, McMad quickly draws the sword from his back and glances around for the dire wolves. He sees them off in the distance some ways, apparently deciding their meal had been buried and searching for easier prey. <br>
<br>
“Good choice ya made!” He shouts in the wolves direction, “Ya woulda found me harder ta eat then them rabbits.” McMad turns and searches for his pack muttering, “Woulda been a better meal though.” The big man chuckles at his own joke, spotting his pack lying in the snow. “Damn woman, ain’t got any sense. Standin’ on a snow bank fifty feet in tha air. Oughta just let her freeze ta death,” he growls, “would serve her right. She was probably getting’ ready ta ambush me as it is.” Stooping, he picks up his pack and scans the ravine for the necromancer, finally seeing her lying twisted in the snow. He slings his pack over his shoulder and walks to where she lay. She is unconscious, the snow around her is red with blood from a deep wound in her shoulder. Her clothes are covered with ice and quickly freezing over, its obvious she fell into water somewhere. She will be dead soon if McMad doesn’t help. He crouches down and examines her wounded shoulder. <br>
<br>
“Ya found the wurm caves, eh Selilya?” he asks not expecting an answer. “Well ya ran tha wrong way, ya were right by tha dwarven city. ‘Course I’m bettin’ ya wouldna have found shelter with them.” The big man sighs, looking at the setting sun. “Well I don’ have time ta get ya anywhere safer than a cave tonight, ya’d be dead before we got ta Thurgadin.” <br>
<br>
McMad pauses a moment running a weathered hand over his scarred face. Why did she warn him about the wolves? Was it payback? McMad had spared her life in battle once before, turning his blade as he was striking the deathblow. Selilya and he had formed a respect for each other. McMad held a strong belief that Selilya could be turned from Innoruuk and their last meeting at the shores of Northern Ro had solidified that belief, but still, the guild she led had slain his brethren. Gently he reaches down and lifts the dark elf from the snow. She was so light, so frail. It still amazed him how much hate and power her small form could contain. He knew Innoruuk sought him, but he also knew Selilya had failed her god in her attempt to capture him too many times for her to still hold that duty. Cradling Selilya in his arms, McMad begins the trudging walk. <br>
<br>
“I’ll take ya ta a good cave. Camped there last night myself. Got a strong smell o’ bear in it, but I am pretty sure tha bear ain’t coming back. Well we can hope anyway, eh?” McMad hopes she can hear him; he wants to keep her mind active. “We’ll get ya ta tha cave and get ya patched up. Heat up that blood runnin’ through yer veins.” <br>
<br>
McMad is thankful it is a short walk. He had chosen to stay near the cave and was planning on camping there again tonight anyway. He had been scouting, helping the Coldain locate the Frost Giant camps. Finally reaching the cave entrance he carefully lays Selilya on an outspread fur, covering her gently with another. <br>
<br>
“Lie there a sec and I’ll get tha fire goin’, then I’ll tend ta that wound.” McMad chuckles softly. “Talkin’ to ya like we were friends instead o’ enemies. Good thing ya can’t say nothin’ probably just make me rethink my decision ta help ya if ya were preachin’ at me like ya usually are.” McMad gathers the wood he had laid near last night’s fire to dry. After a few minutes work, he gets a small blaze started. <br>
<br>
“All right Selilya, let’s get ya outta those wet clothes and have a look at where that wurm introduced himself to ya.” McMad loosens the armored gauntlets he and removes them along with his bracers and steps back to the still form of Selilya. <br>
<br>
The big man pauses a moment, unsure how to proceed. He certainly had never imagined this, not with Selilya. Steeling himself, he begins to untie the cord that fastens her robe. He gasps as the robe falls open, quickly turning his head. Selilya is beautiful, in a dark sense, no man can deny that. He feels somehow like he is taking advantage of her in her weakness, knowing how ashamed she will be when she wakes. He turns back to her, gently reaching out to touch her cheek. His stomach churns and he feels his skin flush. His mind drifts back to their last meeting. He had seen her vulnerable then. They had talked for some time there at that fishing village. She had told him of her mother’s death, and McMad had brushed a tear from this same cheek. He had felt her insecurity that night. He knows she can be shown how to release her hate. Gently, he lifts Selilya from the bearskin letting the dark necromancer’s robe fall away. He tries to ignore her nakedness as he lays her on her stomach and covers her once again. He stands, drawing a deep breath. <br>
<br>
“I don’ know if this is worse fer you or me Selilya. I tell ya what, I would rather be lyin’ on that bearskin lettin’ some nice young woman patch me up than ta suffer what I’m goin’ through now. ‘Course I imagine if are situations were reversed I’ll still be lyin’ under that snow.” McMad casts a curious glance towards the dark elf’s still form. “Glad I don’ have ta find out if I’m right.” <br>
<br>
McMad bends and gathers Selilya’s discarded robe, hanging it near the fire to dry. He reaches into his pack and removes some heavy bandages. “I’m not a cleric, but I’ve had plenty o’ practice patchin’ up myself. Let me see what I can do with that little scratch.” He feels a little foolish talking to himself, but somehow it helps ease the tension he is feeling. He uncovers Selilya’s shoulder so he can patch the wound, careful to keep the rest of her covered. He carefully cleans the wound, thankful that Selilya is unconscious, otherwise the pain would be near unbearable. He can’t help but admire the sculpted muscles on her back, how alluring her figure is. Mcmad quickly shakes his head, as if he is trying to shake those thoughts out of it. “Damn it McMad keep yer head tagether,” he mutters to himself. Finally he finishes bandaging the wound. Covering Selilya’s nude body once again, the big barbarian stands and quickly strides to his pack, jamming the bandages back into it and withdrawing a shiny flask in the same movement. He spins the cap of the flask off and tilts it back, taking a long drink of its contents. <br>
<br>
“Bless tha dwarves, haven’t found a dwarven city yet that didna have a good supply of strong drink.” He chuckles to himself as he replaces the cap. Sighing, he stares at the flickering flames of the fire. Slowly he turns around and addresses the lump in his bedding as he begins to unbuckle the deep blue breastplate he’s wearing, “Well Selilya, there isn’t but one way ta make sure yer alive in tha mornin’ and ya aren’t gonna like it. See, I am gonna have ta strip down and keep ya warm with my body heat. Now you remember when ya wake up that I’m savin’ yer life here. I am not gonna like it much if ya wake me up with a knee ta tha groin.” <br>
<br>
The big man sheds the rest of his armor, stacking it neatly next to the fire as he does. He removes the padding he wears under the armor and walks to the bearskins. He pauses there, standing nude looking down upon the still unconscious form of the Teir’Dal female. “I could sure use another drink right now, but I don’ think me getting’ drunk is gonna improve our situation.” <br>
<br>
The big man crouches lifting the bearskin then sliding under it to join Selilya, being careful not to touch the fresh wound. He feels his leg brush against Selilya’s still cold skin and instantly his body is filled with heat. Lying on his back he takes another deep breath. “Well at least I won’t have ta worry about bein’ cold tonight,” he mutters as he lays his head back and tries to sleep. <br>

Date Posted: 12/23/00 9:03pm<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The fog was beginning to lift from Selilya's consciousness, but her eyes would not obey the command to open. She was only distantly aware of the throbbing in the back of her head and shoulderblade. Something else had permeated her senses ... the scent of bears...bears had killed her mother... bears were killing her mother. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, don't let her die. you must help her...&quot; Selilya cried. In desperation, she pleaded, no she begged the men to save her mother from certain death. <br>
<br>
&quot;I bet she only lasts two minutes,&quot; chuckled the dwarf. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, she's strong,&quot; laughed one of the other warriors. &quot;She'll last five minutes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; screamed Selilya once again. A rage, violent enough to consume any one or any thing that ventured in its path, welled up within her. She scrambled to her knees searching for anything she could use to punish her mother's killers. Beyond the cooling embers of the fire behind her, she saw her Dagger of Marnek and lunged for it, snatching it up off the cold stone floor. <br>
<br>
Wild-eyed, she turned and glanced around trying to place where she was...and then she saw him. It was his fault...he let her die. <br>
<br>
&quot;You must pay!&quot; she screamed at the barbarian, who was beginning to realize something was amiss as he rubbed the sleep from his eye. McMad's razor-sharp instinct for survival <br>
engaged instantly. He caught a glimpse of the frenzied Teir'Dal and rolled away from her advance. She still managed to inflict a shallow, three inch gash to his left forearm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Woman!&quot; he roared. &quot;What do ye think you're a'doin'?&quot; He peered at her face...there was no recognition...only pure hatred emanated from this wisp of a female. He needed to restrain her, lest his reflexes to counter an attack prove harmful to her. <br>
<br>
As she raised her weapon yet again, he made his move. He grabbed the wrist that wielded the dagger and twisted it until she dropped it. He then pinned her arm behind her back <br>
and unceremoniously deposited her back down on the bear skins, his rough arms atop her to hold her there. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look here, lass,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Snap out of this. It's me... it's McMad. You had a nasty little fall and almost froze to death. Damn ye, you almost took me with you. Now come on, settle down or I'll have to...&quot; <br>
<br>
As she continued to struggle, he saw the tears well up in her eyes. He realized she must have relived the events surrounding her mother's death...it only made sense. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, blast it, Woman,&quot; he sighed, as he noticed her nakedness once more. His body came alive with sensations he'd felt before ...in other times...in other circumstances. <br>
<br>
Without thinking, he bent over her prone form and kissed her mouth, not knowing what to expect from one who had just tried to kill him. As if struck by the sting of a scorpion, Selilya turned her head away from him. He could feel her body trembling beneath his arms and reached out to stroke <br>
her silver hair. Her body tensed... <br>
<br>
The moment was awkward to say the least. McMad wanted to kick himself for giving in to his &quot;urges,&quot; but he was a man of passion and she was undeniably beautiful. As if reading his mind, Selilya turned to gaze upon him. <br>
<br>
Neither spoke...words seemed so unnecesary. <br>
<br>
As the morning rays penetrated the cave they occupied, the shadows on the wall rose and fell until finally all the pure hatred and blind justice trapped within them were released, both were spent, and there was nothing left for them to do but cling to each other and drift into a peaceful slumber. <br>

McMad runs a hand over his scarred face as he studies the sleeping form of the Teir'Dal. A soft sigh escapes the big man's lips as he stokes the fire he is crouched in front of. He knows Selilya will be hungry when she wakes. The combination of her wounds, the stresses her body has been under, and last nights....exertions...will have her nearly starved. He stands and brushes the dirt from the darkly colored kilt he is wearing and softly walks to where his pack lay, rummaging in it. He chuckles as he removes the hard bread and waterskin, knowing that it will not be the breakfast the beautiful dark elf is used to. McMad is so accustomed to eating the hard flavorless tack he carries that he sometimes forgets what a meal in a tavern tastes like. It seems he has spent the whole of his life traveling from one place to another, and while the occasional stop at an inn is welcome, it is a rarity. <br>
<br>
Placing a few of the cakes of bread near the fire to warm, the barbarian once again gazes upon the sleeping form of Selilya. He wonders for a moment if he should dress in more than just his kilt, but quickly discards the idea knowing the clatter of him donning his armor would wake the dark elf for sure. He will let her sleep for now. McMad doubts he is ready for the conversation that is sure to come. His mind almost involuntarily drifts back to last nights events. He had never imagined that he and Selilya would ever find themselves in this position. He chuckles at his thoughts, nae, he would not have imagined he would have been in any of the positions he found himself in with Selilya. It was hard to imagine here in the light of day. The tension between them had been building for some time now. <br>
<br>
It had begun with strife, when McMad had stood against Selilya's guild that day in the Arena. He had tried to help Nostramis, but in the end Nostramis failed and was defeated. It seems that he and Selilya had been destined to be enemies from that day forward. There were many minor clashes with the followers of the Violent Harvest here and there. Then McMad learned he is an integral part of a quest Selilya is on. A quest that, at times, has driven Selilya to the brink of madness. Finally the tensions climaxed in the East Commonlands, where McMad faced and defeated, first the wizard Vinar, and then Selilya herself. He had spared her life that day. He still is not sure why he did. It was obvious to him that the Tribunal had called her for her injustices as her magics had no effect on him, and yet, he had turned his blade on the final blow. <br>
<br>
They had not talked for some time after that. McMad received many threats from the Violent Harvest after that day, yet none would stand against him in battle. Many things happened between the Fellowship of Valor and the Violent Harvest in the following months. McMad had felt something when he and Selilya spoke. He felt that Selilya questioned the hate she had held in her heart for so long. He was sure of this after their last meeting. They had bumped into each other in the sands of North Ro and there at the fishing village, they spoke, not with threatening words or insults, but with respect. They formed an understanding of each other that night and McMad was sure that Selilya was near to turning from her ways of hate. She had told him that night that her god would punish her for her actions...McMad could not help but wonder what her punishment will be this day. <br>
<br>
McMad scratches his beard and wonders. He wonders if that is why he and Selilya had done what they had done last night. He wonders if it is really that they had formed a respect for each other over the past months, if it was just two people of passion acting out, or maybe..maybe Selilya had darker motives. Was she using him? Did she use him? McMad lets his gaze drift over Selilya's sleeping form, slowly looking over her. It had not seemed like she had been scheming. It had not seemed like either of them held any deep thoughts last night, nae, neither of them had been thinking, otherwise it would never have happened. She will wake soon. He wonders what he will say to her, what she will say to him. They are still enemies, he supposes. Selilya still serves the dark god Innoruuk. The big man sighs softly as he runs his hand over his face. He had tried for many years to avoid these types of complications. Of course he had met the occasional woman in a tavern or the gypsy camps, but lately things had taken a turn for the worse for him. First his failed marriage, his bride-to-be not showing for the wedding, and now this. He watches as Selilya begins to stir, rolling over on her side and opening her eyes to meet his gaze. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning ...lover,&quot; she says, smiling a wicked smile. McMad almost winces at the sarcasm he hears in her voice, or was that fear? <br>
<br>
&quot;Good mornin' Selilya.&quot; McMad replies, unsure what to say next. <br>
<br>
Selilya laughs delicately. &quot;Ahh...McMad...you were not so unsure of yourself last night now were you?&quot; She smiles softly at the big barbarian, the reflection of the fire dances in her eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nae.&quot; McMad turns and motions towards the fire, &quot;There's some breadcakes here. I thought ya might be hungry sos I warmed ya some by the fire. Only got bread and water and yer pack was lost when ya fell I suppose so you'll have ta make do with what I got.&quot; <br>
<br>
Selilya laughs. &quot;That will do just fine McMad.&quot; Selilya stands and lets the bearskin fall at her feet. &quot;I wonder if my robe is dry?&quot; She smiles mischievously at the barbarian as she saunters to where her robe hangs near the fire. <br>
<br>
&quot;Selilya!&quot; McMad almost chokes on the cake he was eating. &quot;Would ya wrap that fur around ya at least?&quot; <br>
<br>
Selilya laughs again. &quot;You are angry with me? There are those that would feel themselves quite lucky to be in your place right now.&quot; slowly Selilya raises her arm, brushing tha back of her hand against her hanging robe. &quot;Hmm..it is still damp. I should let it hang for a while longer.&quot; Selilya turns to McMad, running a hand along her stomach she smirks at him. &quot;What do you think McMad? Should I put my wet robe on?&quot; She laughs as she watches the big man struggle for words. <br>
<br>
&quot;By tha Hammers woman!&quot;, McMad stands and walks to where they had made their bed, grabbing one of the skins off the ground and throwing it towards Selilya. &quot;Wrap yerself in that would ya? What are ya tryin' ta do ta me?&quot; He grins at Selilya. &quot;Wrap that around ya and eat, quit torturin' me.&quot; <br>
<br>
The dark elf laughs again. &quot;Ahh...but some torture can be so...enjoyable.&quot; She wraps the fur around herself and sits near the fire. &quot;As you wish though McMad. I don't want to make you angry with me. After all, look what happened when I tried to attack you with my dagger.&quot; She laughs again as she sees McMad's face flush. Smiling inwardly, she takes a bite from the hard bread. <br>

<br>
She heard the rustling behind her and knew he was reviving the fire. She left her eyes closed and lay still, thinking about the last couple of days. In her wildest imagination, she could not have envisioned what took place. <br>
<br>
The surprise attack of the wurm had brought out an almost primal survival instinct...with no time for thought or reason...just movement. It was true, she normally travelled with her undead companion for protection...always good for a few moments of escape from danger. She should have conjured one up she admitted...the dangers in this new land warranted this. Then, the sudden onslaught of snow and ice blinded her and left her with a total sense of helplessness, not a feeling the Winnower ever liked to experience. She was <br>
Teir'Dal...she was a leader in her guild...she was Mistress of the Undead. No, she would be better prepared now in this new land...no more foolishness... <br>
<br>
&quot;Foolishness?&quot; she asked herself inaudibly, thinking back to her cry out to McMad about the dire wolves attacking him. She would normally allow any enemy to be attacked...then watch with great pleasure as they were ripped into shreds and screaming in death's grip. Yet, something deep within her...not of her conscious mind...welled forth to utter the warning. She thought back to their last few encounters. <br>
She thought him to be a fool when he spared her life in the Commanlands. She would not have shown any such &quot;mercy&quot;. That was for the weak ones. McMad was not weak, however, in his battle skills...she had seen that for herself. In fact, it was the strength he exuded that she noted, a strength called for in the new research she had undertaken. Ah, her research <br>
was so very important...a fitting tribute to the life of Miragul. His failed attempts at life eternal had doomed him to an eternity of, well, undeath. Selilya had vowed to find where he <br>
went wrong. Yet, she had already failed in several attempts at extracting from McMad the things she needed... <br>
<br>
She turned her thoughts away from Miragul and his experimentation to the events of the day before. She wasn't totally surprised that he had plucked her up off the frozen rocks...he was behaving in his usual, weak, must-be-good <br>
pattern. In fact, she would live to see more days...and for that, she felt some relief. <br>
<br>
Of course, when she first opened her eyes after the fall, the pain was quite excruciating...and she felt it coursing throughout her entire being. She remembered now the horrible visions of her mother's dying...the sights, the smells <br>
seemed so very real. She chuckled inwardly thinking of how McMad must have felt to see a naked Teir'dal frenzied she-cat descending upon him. She knew he didn't mean to hurt her when he threw her back down on the floor...it was <br>
instinct...and had he not reacted, he would be dead. Then she realized that it had been just a nightmare...and she couldn't stem the flow of tears. She missed Mother. It was a horrid death she suffered...and she still intended to get retribution for that crime. <br>
<br>
She had then looked into McMad's eyes through her tears. She saw his face soften...was that caring she saw? <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, blast it, Woman,&quot; he had uttered. Then he kissed her. She felt repulsed and yet, at the same time, aroused by his advance. The hours that followed had been pure ecstacy for the both of them, she was sure...and as the daylight faded into dusk, they had wrapped themselves in each other's arms for the peaceful slumber that lovers share. <br>
<br>
Now, it was a new day, and she wondered what this day would bring. She rolled over to look at her host... <br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning ...lover,&quot; she grinned. Well, it seemed a fitting greeting for the morning after such passion. They exchanged awkward pleasantries for a bit, and she nibbled on the hard break cakes he had warmed up. She found it a bit challenging to eat and hold the bear skin around herself for cover. She chuckled at his obvious discomfort…he possessed such power on the field of battle, and yet, in this environment, he seemed so vulnerable. <br>
<br>
Selilya washed the bread cake down with a cup of water that McMad had handed to her. Her wounds gave her a not-so-gentle reminder that they were still very much in need of attention. Her head still throbbed from the meeting with the rock, and she thanked Innoruuk for giving her a hard head. <br>
Her back and shoulder were smarting quite a bit, and McMad saw her wince in pain. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ya still hurtin', Woman?&quot; he asked. &quot;I guess I should be takin' a look at my patchin' job. I'm not a healer, ya know, but I can manage.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be quite all right,&quot; she retorted. &quot;What I really want is to clean up. You might enjoy smelling like the kodiaks of the wild, but I don't enjoy it one bit. What I wouldn't give <br>
for a nice hot bath.&quot; She instantly missed home. She pulled the skin around her a little tighter and put her head down on her drawn up knees and sighed. <br>
<br>
McMad began to laugh at the dark elf, and she glared at him for just a moment then looked around the cave. She hadn't really paid that much attention to her surroundings. These caves were inhabited by a rather fierce species of kodiaks, and she knew she would not want to be here if they chose to return. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tell ya what, Selilya, if'n you can behave, I will show ya somethin', he mocked. &quot;Follow me now, and ya be watchin' where ya step!&quot; With that he turned towards the back of the cave and stepped forward, grabbing the small torch he'd apparently set in a crack in the rocks. Puzzled, as well as curious, Selilya groaned and stood, and cautiously edged forward. At the rear of the cave was a small crevice that could not be seen from the cave's entry. It was narrow enough to have kept out most of bears she'd ever seen in her <br>
journeys. She found herself laughing at McMad as he had to stoop and twist from time to time to squeeze through a few of the turns. About fifty feet into the rift, she heard it…the sound of water. <br>
<br>
&quot;So did you fancy bringing me down here to let me wash in ice water, Barbarian?&quot; she poked at him. &quot;I think I would rather smell of bear a day or two than turn a bluer shade than what I already am!&quot; She tightened her grip on the bear skin cover she was still wrapped up in and was turning to head back to the cave's entrance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now stop it right there, Selilya,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I swear by tha hammers, you can be a most contrary wench. I would'n be doin' any such thing to ya, well, at least not in these, uh, times. Look, do ya not see the steam? It's an old hot spring <br>
right here'n the middle of the land o' ice.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sure enough, the small crevice opened into a hollow chamber that was large enough for several barbarians to fit in comfortably. In the center of the chamber was a bubbling hot spring, not very large, but certainly large enough for her <br>
to stretch out and soothe her tired muscles. She pointed her toe towards the simmering liquid and tested the temperature of it and was quite pleased at its warmth. She turned to McMad, gave him one of her infamous grins, and warned him, &quot;I'm dropping this furry covering and stepping in…if you don't want to be here, I suggest you go now…&quot; <br>
<br>
With that she dropped the bear skin, descended into the warm, effervescent liquid, and closed her eyes to the most wonderful feeling she'd experienced since the day before. <br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm headin' back to the front of the cave now,&quot; McMad stammered, as he wedged the base of the torch into the rocks at the side of the warm pool of water. &quot;Er, ya take your time now. I will be right outside if'n ya should need anything.&quot; He quickly turned around and began the slow retreat. <br>
<br>
&quot;McMad?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, Selilya?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for bringing me here.&quot; <br>
<br>
He gave her a curious look, then continued his exit into the shadows to the front of the cavern. She heard him bellow out a curse as he must have hit his head on some of the rock formations in the dark passageway. She chuckled. <br>
<br>
The warm water eased the aching in her sore muscles, and she found herself drifting in thought. So much had happened in these past few months. Much was in store for the future. What was she doing here? Why the sudden passion with the one known as the enemy? What was the next move? <br>
<br>
It was then she felt it. The cold, icy tendrils… black fingers caressing her heated skin... <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, My Lord...&quot; she uttered into the stillness. &quot;Your servant is here. What is your bidding, Master?&quot; She bowed her head before her unseen deity. <br>
<br>
&quot;My daughter, you know what is required. Fail me not this time, else the consequences must be paid in full. Be not fooled by the intentions of your prey... they will only lead to your destruction...&quot; With that, the cold, black tendrils whirled about her once more then vanished, leaving only the wisps of steam from the hot bath. <br>
<br>
Selilya closed her eyes and pondered her next steps. She had set aside the ancient scrolls of Miragul for a time, yet she had really never quit mulling over the end goal. Life eternal, not temporal…service to Innoruuk for all time...her rightful place as one of the elite of the Chosen Race. Her powers were not simply mere incantations that animated desiccated bones, but rather dark, powerful tools that could terrorize and destroy any foe…and that could help her attain what she required to bring about &quot;eternity&quot;. She smiled thinking of the possibilities. <br>
<br>
McMad would be the first of several &quot;volunteers&quot; to provide the two things she needed from him...and she would have them soon. Indeed, it wasn't mere chance that she was in this predicament. The Prince of Hate himself had orchestrated this encounter. She realized she could use McMad's fascination with her to her advantage, and she would continue to do so to obtain her prize. <br>
<br>
She climbed out of the warm bath, wrapped the bear skin around her wet body, and reached for the torch. She really didn't need the light...those of her race could see absolutely clearly in the darkest caves, but she knew the barbarian might appreciate having his sight enhanced. She made her way back to the front of the cave. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ha. I thought'n ya might o' drowned,&quot; he snorted as she made her way towards the fire. He had been cleaning his armor, she noted. The various pieces gleamed. He was obviously very proud of his tools of the trade. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ya want'n me to dress up that nasty gash again?,&quot; he asked. &quot;How's it feelin'?&quot; He looked up at her to gauge her expression. He knew it had to hurt, and he was impressed with her ability to absorb the pain...she was very impressive overall he had to acknowledge. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that would be most...decent of you if you could look at it, McMad,&quot; she replied. She dropped the bear skin to the floor and turned around. He gulped once then stood up. Selilya chuckled softly and merely crossed her arms waiting for him to do something. She heard him shuffling behind her, and then felt his cold hands begin the process of bandaging her shoulder and back. McMad laughed at her when she seemed to jump just a little. <br>
<br>
&quot;Was that necessary?,&quot; she scolded him. You could have warmed your hands a little. It's bad enough that I have a knot on my head and a gash in my back and then for you to...&quot; <br>
<br>
He shut her up by grabbing her into his arms and kissing her. He then set her down on the bear skin and handed her her robe, which was now dry. <br>
<br>
&quot;I supposed you best be getting' on back to where ya came from. It's all I need to be'n on the bad side of your clan,&quot; he muttered at her. &quot;An' I have places to go to. I can't just'n be holed up with ya and not getting' my huntin' finished.&quot; He knelt down beside his larger backpack and began to load it up with his belongings. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are right, of course,&quot; Selilya stated coldly. She saw the large rock not far from her foot, and while he tugged at his armor, she lifted it over her head, and with a slight cackle, brought it down full force on the back of his head, plunging him into darkness. <br>
<br>
She finished dressing quickly and gathered her other belongings. She rifled through McMad's bag looking for anything remotely resembling a container. At last she found a small leather pouch that he had stored some herbs in. <br>
<br>
&quot;I supposed you'll be hating me for sure now, Lover,&quot; she whispered to the prone form of the Barbarian. &quot;I must do my duty...I know you will understand.&quot; She took her dagger and went to work. She pull a lock of hair up from McMad's head, slicing it neatly off, stuffing it into the pouch. Then she lifted his hand, caressed it for just a moment...almost lovingly. She put the hand on the rock, and with one quick thrust, <br>
removed the end joint of his little finger. Tying a bandage on the remaining stump, she laid his hand back down on his stomach, sure that he would be most unhappy with his loss. <br>
<br>
After securing the pouch onto her sash, she knelt down once again by the unconscious McMad. She kissed his cheek, sighed, then headed out of the cave into the cold afternoon sun of her destiny. <br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------  <br>
Pain. That is what he feels, pain. It isn’t the worst pain he has ever felt, but then again he hasn’t opened his eyes yet either. McMad takes a deep breath and tries to prepare himself for the shock that will come when the light of the day shoots into his brain. Slowly, he lifts his left eyelid, letting the light creep in bit by bit. The big man grimaces and grits his teeth as his temples begin to pound in rhythm to the beating of his heart. He rolls over off his back onto his side in an attempt to lift himself off the rock floor of the cave. A shouted curse, vile enough to turn Innoruuk’s face white, echo’s through the cavern as McMad feels burning, searing pain shoot up his arm as he tries to push himself into a sitting position. <br>
<br>
“By tha Hammers! Gfft..arrgh! Damn it that hurts!” The barbarian rolls into a crouching position, cradling his wounded hand in his lap. His great muscles are tensed and knotted as he fights to gain control of the pain and his senses. Soon his breathing becomes shallower and McMad lifts his hand to examine the damage for himself. A thickly wrapped bandage covers the whole of the pinkie finger of his right hand. It is soaked in blood. McMad sighs, not wanting to remove the bandage, or to do what he would have to do to control the bleeding. <br>
<br>
“I am a fool,” he whispers to himself, “A soft hearted fool.” McMad grunts as he stands, feeling the blood throb once again in his head where Selilya had struck him with the rock, now accompanied by the rhythmic pulsing of the pain in his hand. He rummages around in his pack with his left hand until he finds a bright shiny steel dagger, walking over to the fire he places the dagger on a rock so that it’s blade begins to heat over the flames. Returning to his pack, he removes a wrap of fresh bandages, a small oiled leather pouch that seems to hold some herbal concoction, and the silver flask containing the dwarven ale he had partaken of earlier. Slowly, he lowers himself into a sitting position near the fire and begins to unwrap the bandages on his hand. He grimaces as he sees the stump of his finger come into view, then quickly pushes the bandage back as blood begins to spurt freely from the wound. <br>
<br>
“Well, at least she was thoughtful enough ta make it a straight cut, won’ have ta clean it up none.” McMad places the silver flask between his knees and uses them to grasp it as he unscrews the top with his left hand. He tilts his head back and takes a long drink of its contents before beginning to prepare his wound for travel. <br>
<br>
… <br>
<br>
The big man checks the tightly wrapped bandage covering what is left of his little finger before sliding his hand into his armored glove, he grimaces slightly as he forces the bandage to slide into the finger of the glove. The firelight dances of his polished blue armor as he begins to reassemble his packs. He pauses as he pulls the last strap of his pack tight and scans the cave for any belongings he may have left out, as he does, his thoughts begin to drift back over the last few day’s events. <br>
<br>
He could not be sure why he had helped her. He only knew that was not right to leave her to die there in the snow, reflecting back on it now, maybe he should have left nature’s justice to work its own ways. He had cared for her. He had saved her life. McMad had truly believed that Selilya was more than just the hatred she portrayed. He had thought she could be changed, shown the sweet rewards a just life offered. Their last meeting on the shoreline of North Ro had given him a strong hope. Then, when he had looked into her eyes here in this cave, seen the pain and vulnerability, heard her cry out for help, he had felt she was truly a wonderful woman. Now he knows he had been a fool. He had been played, controlled like a puppet. Selilya had reaped from his flesh what she needed to pursue the mad dream of life everlasting she carried. That was all he was to her, a tool. He cursed his ignorance, his weakness. He had failed and now he had to make it right. He had to stop her. <br>
<br>
“Ya made your choice Selilya, and ya made mine fer me too.” McMad whispers to the shadows dancing along the wall. Slowly he turns and walks from the cave into the bright midday sun. <br>
