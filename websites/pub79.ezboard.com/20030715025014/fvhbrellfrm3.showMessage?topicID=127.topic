Chapter 1<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
*In which Vresk has an interesting encounter*<br>
<br>
The meeting for the Violent Harvest started like any other. The Dragon of Hate gazed down from above the Rogue’s Guild, the gleaming in its eyes seeming to pass judgment upon all who stood before it. The Triad assembled, and after being a bit late herself, the Reaper was able to call the meeting to order.<br>
<br>
Those Seeds who were ready were called forward, one at a time, and given the opportunity to show their value to the guild by offering up the items they had been asked to retrieve. Vresk looked on with approval at the fervor he saw simmering in their Teir’Dal eyes. In all honesty, he found the softskins a bit repulsive, and always felt like he had to be careful not to hit them too hard lest he break them. But their seemingly shining eyes always fascinated him.<br>
<br>
He had originally joined the Harvest at the urging of Grand Master Glox, the Iksar monk guildmaster. After a very private conversation, he decided he would find a group of Teir’Dal who would be best able to develop the Hate he secretly harbored within his breast. The Violent Harvest had done well in this endeavor.<br>
<br>
Still, he found their ways disconcerting at times. They always seemed in a rush, quick to make a rash decision. As he gazed at the members surrounding him, he looked at Zirrix, his back rigid, armor gleaming, an unbreakable rod. He seemed to be an anchor upon which the entire race would be able to hang to. No, he realized, it wasn’t the rush that made them disconcerting, was it? Unlike the Iksar, the Teir’Dal were refreshingly different. Although most were aimed at the same common goal, they were largely free to accomplish this goal by their own means. Whether that is through the general’s rigid posture and sharp orders. Or the Mad Prophet’s drunken visions. Overlords Vinar and Faeolin’s sharp tongues. They were unpredictable in personality. Disconcerting as it was, it had its advantages. Vresk had seen them working together, had even joined in it. As a group, the Violent Harvest was terrifying to behold.<br>
<br>
“Hate with Honor!” he shouted as a new seed was brought formally into the fold of the Violent Harvest. The Iksar could feel the Hate wafting from the new recruit. A glance at the Thresher revealed that he too felt it, and approved.<br>
<br>
An electric jolt with through Vresk’s tail, causing it to twitch violently. Nobody seemed to notice. Somewhere to his left, the monk noticed a dwarven rogue, trying to sneak through the meeting unseen. Silently, he alerted the rest of the guild, and the Triad immediately moved to confront the interloper. Dutifully he tried to assist, but a loud buzzing in his ears seemed to distract him.<br>
<br>
The stench of death wafted from his scales, but the tingling sensation in his tail was slowly working his way up his spine. He was unable to notice. The roar in his ears became deafening. The monk used his training to steel himself against the distraction. Dimly, he was aware of the members of the Triad moving to his side in alarm. Fever raged through his body, and his blood felt like it was boiling.<br>
<br>
A cry went up in the meeting, and the members of the Harvest closed in around him. Khasirath moved to his side to help him stand. Thankful for the respite, Vresk tried to lean on him gingerly. Yet another violent surge went through the Iksar, and he crashed into the Thresher. The Teir’Dal, not suspecting the move, stumbled, tried to recover, but was unable to do so. The monk felt himself falling to the ground.<br>
<br>
As the heat seemed to take over his body, he felt healing magics pump into him as the Harvest clerics called upon Innoruuk for aid. The magic seemed distant, however. As the fever took hold, Vresk’s mind wandered. He thought of Alluveal and Sheigh. “I cannot die,” he tried to say. “I haven’t found out why those two are so…” his thoughts drifted away from him.<br>
<br>
He started to float above himself, seeing the gathering around him. As if in another body, he heard himself scream in pain. The younger members of the guild flinched instinctively. They had never seen such things before. It was unnatural. There was a strong tugging on his body. It seemed as if it were trying to follow his outer self. Realizing he was in imminent danger of losing his Self, and therefore the energies that he was trained to use, he fell inward, falling into deepest meditation.<br>
<br>
Then all was dark.<br>
