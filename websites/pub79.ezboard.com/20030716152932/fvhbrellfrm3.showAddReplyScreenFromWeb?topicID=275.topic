Bloody froth spewed from the hapless halfling’s pain tormented mouth as the broad blade was cruelly turned within him.<br>
<br>
A spout of deepest crimson burst from his chest as the searching steel finally found his aorta and severed it, subsiding quickly as the notched sword was withdrawn and the impending corpse crumpled to the stone floor with an barely audible wheeze.  Kneeling on the chest, the same implement cut through flesh and gristle to sever the head, and the mail clad figure stood somewhat awkwardly staring at it.<br>
<br>
‘Since when did I get so vicious?’,  the victor snarled at the lifeless visage of the vanquished, the laughter of madness in it’s chilling tones.<br>
<br>
She had been wandering, or perhaps more to the point skulking, around the quieter parts of the city of the Teir ‘Dal for weeks.  For so long seldom seen in the city of her birth, the once wanderer now seemed to be nowhere else.  Though always somewhat apart from her kind, the former matron of House D’Fral had previously avoided contact with her peers primarily due to her own insecurity, her lack of self worth.  Now, at the peak of her powers, they avoided her.  <br>
<br>
Though outwardly a normal inhabitant in this city of shadows, from her very essence emanated a darkness that was almost palpable. Behind the glazed look and the still set mouth a rage burned, betrayed visually only by a gleam of darkest fire in the ebon of her eyes – but sensible at an almost visceral level to all who came near her.  <br>
<br>
Her rage was fuelled by the power of the father’s hate, certainly, and by righteous indignation at the failure of her race to assume their rightful place in the world outside.  But more than that, it was fuelled by her own sense of futility, purposelessness, and above all loneliness.  Now given a target, a focus, the rage boiled forth within her.<br>
<br>
Casting the head from her as if in disgust, a scream began deep in the recesses of her mind.  Rising inexorably from within it took over her mind with effortless ease, rising in an uncontrollable crescendo, drowning out all consciousness with its din.  Vomiting forth from her mouth like magma from a volcano the cry burst forth upon the granite walls of the Commons, echoing round it’s passages and caverns, across the pools and falls, silencing all in it’s path.<br>
<br>
As the echoes returned from grot and lake, the sound ceased forth but the scream continued. Like a puppet deprived of it’s strings, Crieth slumped to the floor in a clatter of weapons and armour. Flecks of blood and spittle tarnished the pristine chalcedony of her lips, still formed in the shape of that one single terrible thought:<br>
<br>
‘Why?’<br>

You could take months to hear but a rumour of the fall of an empire, but mere moments to be regaled of the meaningless exploits of some low born lightcrawler. The news of the fall of the Violent Harvest  had come but lately to Elixar, Prophetess of the Spires, and the departure of its Thresher had come rapidly afterwards. Though the former concerned her perhaps less than it should, the latter affected her deeply, for Daiunus was her friend.<br>
  <br>
She had first met him when he was but one of the knights of Innoruuk in the Violent Harvest.  He bore the same arms that her old sparring partner, Crieth did - though with considerably better humour - and she had the pleasure of hunting with him on many occasions. On Norrath, Luclin and beyond in the planes of the gods he had led the forces of Hate, and though she fought not in the vanguard of those forces, many a time she had brought forth her healing magics to support his powerful form. <br>
<br>
Though she was sure he despaired of her always irreverent and sometimes downright insolent quips, he was always seemingly laughing with her. He was a fearless leader, having taken her and others many times into the very demesne of the Whore Goddess, and slaughtered all but her and Tunare's most intimate guardians.<br>
<br>
He would also, she thought with a fondness she shared for very few, have made an excellent mate.  <br>
<br>
Though now far removed from the politics of Neriak, Elixar thought how keenly the respected race would feel the loss of the army of the Grange, and it's general of armies. <br>
<br>
Or would they?<br>
<br>
Wryly she admitted to herself that the world cared little about generals and honour these days, and the Children of Neriak were no exception to this sad fact. The priesthood of the spires, herself included, would be as likely to hunt with a paladin of Tunare than hunt them on the hunting groups of Norrath or Luclin.  Even though, deep within, she knew she would miss the Harvest and it's single-mindedness of purpose, a resolution to the fundamental paradox that his retirement represented was no closer to her.<br>
<br>
Why do the gods so singularly choose to take the faithful from this world, leaving the secular masses alone?<br>
<br>
Filing this in her head along with a growing list of numerous other imponderables, Elixar began a murmured incantation to the Dark Father. She would seek for her old friend the caretaker in the city of her birth, and pass on the news - and perhaps share her sadness. In a swirl of argent embers, the Faithstone of Hate coalesced a dimensional gate before her and she stepped forth into it's nothingness. With nought but a brief flash, the gate folded in on itself in a silent implosion, taking stone and wielder with it.<br>
<br>

Prophetess of the Spires<br>

The sound was strangely comforting, and her mind wandered long,<br>
lost in it's sonorous repetition. Consciousness returned to her slowly, as if she had lain long asleep, and <br>
cognition slower still. Fragments of thought flowed through her mind like the ripples through the <br>
subterranean pools, only to fade away into the darkness. Flashes of memory illuminated her thought like the <br>
glimmering of reflected moonlight, only to dim away as the gloom returned.  Imperceptably at first, then faster <br>
the shadows lifted, and light returned.<br>
<br>
Focus rushed outwards from her nose as her vision rapidly cleared, taking in all as it did so. <br>
<br>
A notched blade. A partially dismantled corpse. A congealing pool of blood. A golden boot.<br>
<br>
Feeling returned in a rush along with recognition, and a single sob wracked her frame.  With a croak from damaged <br>
vocal cords she mouthed a soft plea.<br>
<br>
'Elixar, help me'.<br>
