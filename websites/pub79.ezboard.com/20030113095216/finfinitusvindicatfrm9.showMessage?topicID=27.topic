<br>
Now they both are what I would call &quot;good&quot; kids and yes most parents will say they have good kids.  <br>
<br>
But I walk around the store and see kids throwing fits because Mommy won't buy the New Oreoes or Mommy won't get the new Super Sugar Frosted Flake cereal and this bugs me.  What bugs me even more is seeing the parent cave &quot;instantly&quot; to thier child's demends.  Do they think that giving thier kids whatever they want is going to make up for that time that they are not at home with the kids?  or is there another reason for this behavoir.  <br>
<br>
Common manors also seem to be a thing of the past (do parents not teach these anymore) I can not begin to tell you how many times a kid will bump into me or walk inbetween a conversation and not excuse themselves.  ** Note my boys always excuse themselves**.<br>
<br>
I love that I get phone calls from other parents in the school telling my how well-behaved my kids are but my god these calls should not be needed as I believe all kids should act respectful.  But alas it seems I am raising my boys 40 years too late.  <br>
<br>
So what contirbutes to this behavior is my question I guess.  Is it the fact that the States are taking away some of the parents tools of disiplince and replacing it with &quot;timeouts&quot; or is it even deeper and if so could this be at the root of some of the issues you have in the country today (School shooting, the rise the child-commited crimes etc...)<br>
<br>
Just my rant for the day enjoy. <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~shay01/Aberysiggy.gif

<br>
As for contributing to the behavior, i think its a total lack of discipline.  I vividly remember throwing a fit in a store because I couldn't have toy XYZ.  Guess what?  in the middle of the aisle, much to my embarassment, I had my pants down and was getting my ass smacked.  That was the last time I did that.  Other parents/etc didn't look twice.  Today they'd be on their cell phones saying I was being abused.  Or we'd be on the closest phone calling the cops because I was being abused, since I probably learned that in school.  Did I like it?  No.  Was I pissed?  Hell yeah.  Did i learn, and not do it again?  Yep.  My brother learned his lesson the same way.<br>
<br>
If we screwed up again, in some other way...we knew it, and we lived in fear for when dad came home from work.  Burly marine who takes no crap.  He never laid a hand on us...Fear did its part.  To this day, I fear pissing my father off.<br>
<br>
I beg pardon when I have to walk in front of someone in a store who is looking at something on the shelf.  I keep my shopping cart out of the middle of the aisle.  I hold doors open for people (actually gotten yelled at by some feminazi for doing this).  I don't see many of the younger kids doing that these days.  They let the door slam in your face, bump into you and then glare at you like its your fault, and lots of other things.<br>
<br>
That being said, I think kids acting like complete idiots, with no manners or respect for anyone or anything, is the lack of punishment.  What good is timeout?  Woot!  I get to sit in the corner for 10 minutes and daydream!  Then go back to my Nintendo and blow stuff up.  <br>
<br>
Maybe its the lack of being involved in something that requires discipline and order.  I've spent most of my life in the boy scouts.  Since I was..erm..well youngest age i could join cub scouts.  Still a member now, probably going on 25 years.  Probably one of the best things I've done.  What I have noticed in the past 10 years or so, is the dwindling amount of people joining and/or staying.  <br>
<br>
Join a sport (I've played soccer since I was 9 or 10), or whatever (I belong to a car club, and a model railroading club - no real &quot;discipline&quot; per se, but its social interaction, and we do have younger kids who show up for things regularly, 5-6 years old or so).  I honestly think this is whats needed.  Heck with computer games, playstation, etc.  Turn off the games, interact with others, learn how to be a human.<br>
<br>
Humans are only animals.  We're born just like wild animals and act like them until we're molded into society's &quot;mold&quot; of how we should be.  Obviously, this molding is lacking.  At least, thats how I think about it.<br>
<br>
So I guess what it all comes down to...after this longwinded post is:  Lack of discipline, no fear of consequences for their actions, little social interaction, and lack of respect. <p><center>

We act just like animals - we learn.  You learn how to behave in the young years.  In a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; childhood, I would say that you pick up behaviors from all over the place.  The good ones are positively reinforced by your parents, teachers, etc.  The bad ones are negatively reinforced.  What could possibly negatively reinforce a child?  I mean a child young enough to not yet really understand the concepts of respect, disapointment, etc?  of course it is pain of some sort - something that is physically uncomfortable.  And I'm betting that most of you know the rest of the story.<br>
<br>
Most parents that I talk to agree that you should be able to discipline your kids.  Some manage to do it without ever laying a hand on their kids; most end up spanking them - although it doesn't take many spankings for the pain and embarrasment to adjust your base animal instincts. <br>
<br>
What concerns me is the fact that almost every parent i've met believes in discipline, yet we still have these child abuse problems and laws in place.  Even though i consider the laws to be out of control, they are there for a reason.  <br>
<br>
It just seems like the whole world is going to shit sometimes.<br>
<br>
I guess I look at it like this: treat everyone with respect, your kids included.  Treat your children as you expect to be treated, and only use negative reinforcement when necessary, and only as much as necessary.  I will never get on someone's case for disciplining their children - but so help me, if i catch you abusing a child, your wife, your husband, basically anything but a cat - well, it won't be pretty.  But dammit, reign in those kids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udandaeluswyldheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dandaelus Wyldheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/30/02 8:18:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Other people's kids</span><hr size=1> Discipline does not = Abuse.<br>
