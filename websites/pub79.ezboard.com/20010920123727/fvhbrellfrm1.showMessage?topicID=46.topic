Velious Faction ... Decision to be Made<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 Your Triad was discussing the impact of FACTION as it relates to Velious. Some<br>
of us have been there already and find it a most wonderous place. Yet, there is<br>
a consideration for the long term, perhaps.<br>
<br>
FACTION....yes, we've all heard the word. We've all experienced increases and<br>
decreases in faction according to what MOB we've slain or what quest we've just<br>
completed. In Velious, faction plays an interesting role in your ability to freely<br>
maneuver/quest/whatever.<br>
<br>
So, we decided that it is time, as a guild to perhaps choose which way we would<br>
like to align. I have posted some links below with discussions on faction and lists<br>
of MOBs and their faction for you to look over.<br>
<br>
What we'd like each of you to do...is to review the lists and give your reasons for<br>
wanting to go one way or another... If you find other links, please add them or <br>
email them to me at selilya@aol.com and I can add them to this message.<br>
<br>
To let you know...so far I've found the following FACTION groups in Velious.<br>
<br>
King Tormax - The King of the Giants<br>
Kromrif - The Frost Giants<br>
Kromzek - The Storm Giants<br>
Dain Frostweaver IV - The King of the Coldain Dwarves<br>
Coldain - The Ice Dwarves<br>
Claws of Veeshan - The Dragons<br>
Yelinak - The Mighty Dragon of Skyshrine<br>
<br>
It mainly boils down to this...<br>
<br>
Coldain/Dragons vs Giants<br>
<br>
So...read on...<br>
<br>
A General Discussion:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Yelinak:<br>
<br>
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...action=200<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, please review...discuss...and come back here to post your comments<br>
and questions. Let's decide how to align...and go after it!<br>

 Being a wizard i have l have little choice in the matter if I want to use my ports. For those of you who do not know the wakinglands if plagued by a very high lvl roaming dragon that starts out kos to everyone. name is Wushi or something like that. Due to the fact I will be porting to waking lands I will align my faction with the dragons. let it be known that if you choose to serve with dragons in velious You can still hunt the Kunark and Antontica Dragons for they are on different factions. needless to say i will be slaying many giants in the upcoming weeks if anyone wants to join me. <br>
<br>
/ooc BTW they did change faction hits so it is much harder to raise a faction once lowered and high lvl hits are hurting more than low lvl hits. just keep that all in mind.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 During my discussion with the Traid on this matter I brought forth some facts and thoughts that I would like to share with the Harvest as a whole. Consider them my personal feelings and suggestions, but the Harvest as a whole must make this decision.<br>
<br>
/ooc on<br>
<br>
I wanted to empasize what the Winnower was saying, to help explain why this decision should be made. When a person alligns themselves with one of these factions, they become KoS to the others. As a matter of example, if you are friends to the Dwarves, the Giant and Dragon cities are dungeons to you, and everything will KoS you (more or less). One nasty thing they added here is this: Say you die in the Giant city while on a dungeon raid. If a friend of yours is an ally to the Giants, they cannot simply drag your corpse out for you. While dragging your corpse, they will be helping the Giant's enemy, and will be KoS while doing so. The cold truth is (no pun intended) if we as individuals choose different factions, we may be unable to do Guild raids in Velious due to Faction/Alliances.<br>
<br>
During my discussion with the Traid on this matter I brought forth some facts and thoughts that I would like to share with the Harvest as a whole. Consider them my personal feelings and suggestions, but the Harvest as a whole must make this decision.<br>
<br>
So how do we decide our alliance? Some would say loot or experience, or ease. All valid reasons. But we are a RP guild, and I think our decision should be based on that.<br>
<br>
The following beliefs are Khasirath's personal ones, some found in game, some developed through my own play and some borrowed from the Library of the Firstborn (a site detailing and expanding the religion and worship of Innoruuk that I adore. firstborn.eqhq.com/ )<br>
<br>
/ooc off<br>
<br>
We are the Chosen of Innoruuk. I feel we must chose allies that the Father would approve of. The three factions (and there are splinters of each) are as follows:<br>
<br>
Dwarves, called Coldain. The creatures and followers of Brell Serilis, the creaping coward who secreted his filthy children under Norrath to hide them from the First Mother, Veeshan. The Gnomes and Dwarves which are his brood can never be trusted. Innoruuk's hate for them and their master must outshine nearly every other. An alliance with them would be abomination.<br>
<br>
The Giants, called Kromrif and Kromzek. They are the creations of Rallos Zek, and follow him to this day. I am of warring emotions when it comes to Rallos Zek. He did not sign the first treaty of the creaping coward, but he did sign the second. These treaties by the gods of light were designed to steal away Norrath from the other gods, including our own Father! But Rallos Zek has acted against the gods of light, and his creations have been most heavily punished for this. Perhaps Rallos Zek would be willing to more formally ally himself with Innoruuk in light of such events. In his followers I have seen that there is strength and honor and hope. I would be willing to ally with the Giants, in the name of strengthening our relations.<br>
<br>
The Dragons. These are the brood of Veeshan, who first brought life to Norrath. She is one of the true Gods, and never denied Innoruuk His right to create on this world. Of any of the gods creations, beyond the Teir'Dal, I would say these are most worthy of our trust and our alliance.<br>
<br>
Should it come to a formal vote, know that I will vote for the Dragons.<br>
<br>
I ask you all to consider this matter with care, and make your own decisions and arguments. This is no mandate, only my personal opinion. Take it as such, and I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts. <br>

 I have already allied myself against the giants of Velious. I have killed them by the hundreds and bathed in their bloody corpses to celebrate the carnage. I have not executed and of the Coldain and they have nothing to harm me. I have used their banks and vendors and have been my saving grace in the frozen land when I needed shelter and food. As far as the dragons go I don't think I have made bad faction with them. In fact I think the dragon faction got better with the death of the giants. I do not recall any faction hits from shardwurms. Is there any? So pretty much for me the decision has been made. The giants offered me nothing but unwarranted attack and the opportunity for nice weapons to loot from their dead corpses. Screw the giants. Let them all die. I care nothing for Rallos's followers and their plight. I will continue to kill them because the damage I have done already to my Kromrif faction can't get any worse.<br>

<br>
 Now that I am reaching the point where a journey to Velious is feasible, I will lend my opinion to this matter.<br>
<br>
Of the Coldain: It is simple, they are dwarves! How many of us have lost family and armsmates in battle against these wooly rodents? For that reason alone I will give no quarter to them. (incidently, now that I have perfected teh recipe, I have grown rather fond of Dwarf chops. Who would have thought it?) As for my other reasons, I can't state it any better than what Khasirath already has.<br>
<br>
Of the Giants: Although I do not worship Rallos Zek, as a warrior I am familiar with his teachings. They may be leaps and bounds ahead of their rather dimmer counterparts here on Antonica and Kunark. But I would have a hard time trusting them irregardless. I would think that their enhanced intelligence would make them that much more wily, and would deserve closer watch by out eyes and ears. A basic rule of warfare is to attack your enemy where he is weak. We couldn't get any weaker in strength than to have returned from a campaign, and then be ambushed just inside the gates.<br>
<br>
Of the Dragons: Although I have yet to see one, or truthfully even hear one, I know that they have knowledge of things perhaps beyond my comprehension. (I am only of the Indigo Brotherhood you know) How could we not learn from the eldest ones. It is said that the speech of their elders is the language of magic itself. We would be fools if we didn't take this opportunity to learn from them.<br>
It must also be said, that I would like to finally make use of my knowledge of their speech. For those of you who might need my services, I can speak elder Dragon and Dragon fluently.<br>
<br>
I salute you all, and my Innoruuk bless your blades to bite deeply.<br>
