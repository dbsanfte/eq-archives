Okay. I currentl own a lvl 33 merc which i've done everything I can to drag it's lvl higher or drag my wc higher(450 w00t).  I've found my RvR expirience to be quite bland.  Most of the time I find my self either running around casters warding off or killing stealthers.  Or running down individual casters.  I rarely get a chance to run into the thick fo the enemy and when i do im usually dotted, debuffed, and pbaoed so throoughly drawing my weapons is a lost cause.<br>
<br>
Now as far as mythic has told me we're supposedly an offensive class though I'm not so sure of that when a Polearmsman can last longer and kill ppl quicker offensively.<br>
<br>
While I do have a pair of very cool stories(one wher i solo a thane with a big ass axe and a nother where i actually caught to sb's offgaurd.)  I feel more like a deadweight and not much more then a human shield for casters in rvr pretty much the same attitude i afford pallys in pve.(&quot;Just stnad right in front of me mr. pally. Oh dont worry about the rampaging giant im gonna shoot in the toe with the bow you just stay right there.&quot;)<br>
<br>
So anywya I suppose the question that I need to pose is what do the rest of you mercenaries do in rvr? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=locnor>LocNor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#000000>(7/4/03 1:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What do you do in RvR?</span><hr size=1> I haven't RvR'ed much (850ish rp's HA!) as I'm still working up the latter myself.

<br>
I have however grouped with mercs that did the same thing and they are boon to the battle.  The good ones are really single minded in their goal, &quot;I'm probably going to die but that caster is going first.&quot;  Nothing more distracting (outside mez and such) then to have a crazy light tank running around in your back field (goes for all realms).  Pulls the real tanks off your casters and nukes off your tanks just to go deal with you (which admitted doesn't take long sometimes.)<br>

<br>
First, don't worry too much at 33, you still have many moons ahead of you before you hit the dangerous age of 47+.<br>
<br>
Second, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tanks require some Realm Ranks &amp; Realm Abilities before you start being more competitive. A little Purge, MoPain, and Determination, to name just a few, can go a long way to make you kill much more efficiently. You get points really fast at first, so you can actually get a nice base to work from quite quickly.<br>
<br>
Thrid, yes, you will be called on to kill healers and casters first and foremost. There's plenty of tank-on-tank fighting, but you want caster/healer superiority so tanks should try to hit those first. Remember, even a live running healer/caster is not healing/casting, so sometimes death isn't totally nessassary. Just stop the cast so your casters can do their job. (This does require some guarding of your support/casters too, so sometimes hacking down that damn Mid/Hib who won't leave your Cleric alone is paramount to killing support)<br>
<br>
Lastly, running with a well built group, who take at least a minute to work out a few things like cross-healing, Assisting, and Guarding will make a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>massive</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> difference to how well you'll do. Preferably one that has several members who know each other (read: guild/alliance), and just usually know what's asked of them. Pick-up groups will die 75%+ of the time to a smart guild/allaince group, unless moving with a small army/zerg. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lemonade@lighttanksofdaoc>Lemonade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/relic/Xid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#000000>(7/6/03 6:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What do you do in RvR?</span><hr size=1> Well in RVR ya die alot.

I split from my group (Who absolutely better be going after at least some form of caster/healer type) while I keep another caster/healer type busy... Usually I get all of the aggression (Read: 5/6 tanks and caster target) in which I die reletively quick, BUT while I'm drawing all of the aggression, my group has successfully took down that caster/healer type and probably a 2nd before the whole pile standing on my corpse can position itself...<br>
<br>
Now if I don't get the aggro, then I've snuck off and took out their caster/healer type solo, which was a mistake on their part and then I run over to assist the group... Although it will take me awhile to kill my initial target, at least they aren't doing anything while I'm swinging...<br>
<br>
It's a thankless tactic, because if I do good no one knows it...<br>
<br>
And this is if the group I'm in has no AoE Mez, if it does then I go back to the tried and true &quot;Train&quot; tactic and run over all opposition behind the main tank one at a time... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.darkhosts.com/demised/chainwall.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=demised>Demised</A> at: 7/6/03 8:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tatsumaruiii>TatsumaruIII</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#000000>(7/6/03 1:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What do you do in RvR?</span><hr size=1> I believe the role for every tank (even the properly specced paladin) is; Healer first, caster second, everything else after. We just happen to be better at the casters because bladeturn effects us little. Casters kill tanks.<br>
<br>
We arn't what you'd think we should be, as in, we do not do the most damage out of the albion tank classes in frontloading or overtime. We are third in damage(polearmsman and reavers do more), third in defense(arms and pally get plate). Our damage still has good potential, dispite needing improvement. We arn't really useless (if anything, another body is a body casters might hit instead of your casters - and that's what tanks are all about). We can interupt casters (maybe even kill) and healers (not likly to kill). We need an armsman or paladin to /assist off of in order to be effective (sounds kind of opposite of a mercenary, IMO) against other tanks. Our performance differs greatly depending on the situation. If in a good sitation, expect to do pretty good. In a bad situation, expect to do bad. Playing a mercenary to 33, you already have a good idea on how well mercenarys do. Once you hit 35 and do caledonia, it's safe to assume that what you do in there, is what you'll do in final RvR. It will be much different however (in battlegrounds, it can be more group vs group then zerg on zerg). A pretty good way to go about it - think like an infiltrator. While you don't have stealth, people consider you to be one of the weaker classes. While that might be true (more of an opinion), it will most likly cause them to over-look you and pay little to no attention. Use their ignorance to sneak around back and strike at a few casters/healers.<br>
<br>
This isn't the vault board, so there's no need to worry about &quot;uhber leetists haxorz&quot;. Flames are often stomped out quickly, and very few start them. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

If this has been your experience, believe me it's not necessarily typical. A pole armsman with no faster blade to assist will do probably no damage whatsoever since they  can't get past BT. Poles even fully specced also have a horrendous miss rate. They have only a few hp more than Mercs so there's no reason why they last longer. Admittedly they have plate but they don't have evade. The RAs are the same for the classes as well. <br>

I know Barlyic runs with a standard group where he's the PF bitch, basically PFs everyone while people gank, but I'm sure the pecking order is much the same, healers, sissies, support, tanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tigres@lighttanksofdaoc>Tigres</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#000000>(7/7/03 2:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> :D</span><hr size=1> Glad ta be here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
yes, PF is the main thing a merc should do.  PF the bastards mowing down your casters, then once they snared go back to assisting..  A merc assisting = dead target fast.  <br>
<br>
Mids, go for RM's and SM's first, then healers (make the healers waste PR on a non healing class)..<br>
<br>
Hibs, go for bards, druids, wardens first.. Then the casters.. <br>
<br>
hope that helps..<br>

<br>
1- Always wear the best gear you can. Your opponents will have spellcrafted gear and probably even Masterpieces.<br>
<br>
2- Never fight unbuffed unless absolutely necessary. Even if there not top of the line buffs anything will help. Simply put if they are buffed and you are not your chances of survival are about equal to a feminist in a WWF crowd.<br>
<br>
Always group when possible, your group teamwork determine your sucess. Do not expect much if you run around solo. <br>
<br>
Get at least 1 preferably 2 clerics that can heal (a spec of 1 in rejuv is not a healing cleric) in your group. When possible try to get good clerics. (You will know quite soon if they are good or bad)<br>
<br>
Always stick to the &quot;Driver&quot; of the group. As soon as you stop spread out a little so you don't make a giant heap of &quot;Mez Me&quot; targets.<br>
<br>
If it has Zzzz Zzzz over his head and something else has nothing on it hit the one without first.<br>
<br>
If you see a caster with white swirls around him and see in chat xxxxx Casting has gained perfect poise-&gt; you have 2 options: If you are hitting him and he's almost dead, keep at it and pray he does not get healed. If he's full run and pray that you get healed.<br>
<br>
If it has a stick and you play in alb always kill the guys with sticks first. You are lucky and do not have to deal with friars.<br>
<br>
If you see a hib with a spear try to avoid them. They hurt you bad and will outlive you unless you get assistance.<br>
<br>
If you see hibs with 2h weapons except spears just never turn your back to them and you should be fine.<br>
<br>
If you see a lute (guitar) attack whoever is holding it!<br>
<br>
Never charge unless you are sure that others will come with you or that you suprised the enemy. Doing so without those conditions will result in a nice trip to the bindstone.<br>
<br>
Against a pure tank it's best to save flury for later in the fight when he has low life, if you do it right you can kill him before he reacts and uses IP.<br>
<br>
If you see a bow melee them, most are prety weak in melee and only the hunter can prove a slight threath if you ignore him long enough. If you see a stick carier close kill whoever you think will go down first.<br>
<br>
If you see something with a robe and a schyte it's not a caster! Avoid if possible.<br>
<br>
If you see a nice patch of mushrooms stay the hell away from it they will eventually die without your assistance.<br>
<br>
If you see a kobold with a ghostly pet following it and running strait at a bunch of you eighter target him fast and kill it or get the hell away. <br>
<br>
If you are in a keep and are defending it stay the hell away from windows.<br>
<br>
Kobolds, Lurikeens and Elves are not always casters.<br>
<br>
If you keep hitting someone and his life never drops then find a better target.<br>
<br>
When a caster is casting at you and you are running to him do not stop in front of him pass through him and stick.<br>
<br>
If you have End regen availleable always sprint in a fight.<br>
<br>
If you have good determination (3+) never waste purge on a casted stun save it for melee stuns.<br>
<br>
If you can, group a friar they have good resists buffs against very common damage types.<br>
<br>
I could think of a lot more tips but everything comes with experience.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy the field, good luck<br>
