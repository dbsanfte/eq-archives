<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
<br>
Whereas Innoruuk has chosen the Teir'Dal as his favored people, to keep the words and deeds of his power vital and growing throughout Norrath; <br>
and, whereas those who seek to find favor with Innoruuk and his dread presence have come together to fulfill his desires; <br>
and, whereas the vision of the Land-To-Be-Remade has been granted to his Chosen people as a reminder of the paradise toward which their work is directed; <br>
so is called to being the fellowship of the Chosen, which shall be called after this vision of paradise - The Violent Harvest. <br>
Sowed in hate and nurtured in shadow, in darkness shall the Violent Harvest commence. <br>
  <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
MEMBERSHIP<br>
<br>
Teir'Dal <br>
The Violent Harvest refers to the transformation of all of Norrath into a twilight paradise similar to the Nektulos Forest. The Violent Harvest also refers to the harvesting of the peoples of Norrath, the culling of the populace until only the Chosen and their servants remain. It is toward the fulfillment and the vision of this paradise that the Violent Harvest is formed. Only the Teir'Dal are the Chosen, and the Violent Harvest was given into their keeping. Therefore, the Violent Harvest is primarily a guild for Teir'Dal only.  Positions for the Teir’Dal within the Violent Harvest begin with the Seed.  Eventually, the titles of Harvester, Dread Harvester and Dread Lord may be earned through effort and diligent service to the cause.  If deemed truly worthy in the eyes of Innoruuk, Teir’Dal may ascend to the stations of leadership within the Violent Harvest as a Dread Overlord of a Dread Domain, as the Assassin, the Herald, the Dire Lord, or as one of the three governing Chosen comprising the Triad.<br>
<br>
Non-Teir'Dal <br>
Far-seeing individuals of other races, however, may choose to serve the Violent Harvest now in order to obtain a higher place after the Harvest commences.  These select few must swear an oath of everlasting servitude and may ordinarily rise no higher than the station of  Tiller.  As a Tiller, these non-Teir'Dal assist the Harvest through preparing Norrath for the transformation. When the Harvest begins, they shall find themselves above all others, save the Chosen themselves.  Under exceptional conditions, Tillers may be elevated to a position of greater responsibility and achieve the title of Harrower.  This is accomplished through the completion of a Quest of Honor, and through maintaining an active presence within the Harvest community, both in the lands of Norrath and within the Grange.  Posting and responding to posts within the Halls of Hate is essential in being raised as a Harrower.  The Quest of Honor shall be extrememly difficult for the season of the Tiller who seeks it, and will test their ability to assemble forces to aid them, as well as their perseverance.  Once raised to the status of Harrower, they shall be viewed as the highest of the servants of hate, other than the Chosen themselves.  They may meet in The Harrow Council to discuss issues of the non-Teir’Dal members, and voice recommendations to the Triad.  Finally, Ambassadors may be selected to spread the message of Hate to new lands, as directed by the Triad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sponsorship, Culling and the Quest of Blood<br>
<br>
Any Dread Harvester may sponsor a new initiate within the Grange of the Violent Harvest. Such initiates are referred to as a Seed. All Seeds must be sponsored by a member who has achieved the status of a Dread Harvester or higher.  Upon being named as a Seed by the Dread Lord under whose Domain the Sponsor dwells, the new initiate must meet with and fight beside as many in the guild as they can.  The following statements apply to Seeds below their 30th Season.  The Dread Lord may at this time grant guild tags conditionally to the Seed, and the Seed will be given a task to accomplish.  This task, and the accomplishment of it, is referred to as the Culling, for it is through this that the worth of the Seed is determined, and their fate as a future Harvester determined. The Culling quest is given to the Seed by the Dread Lord, and the sponsor is expected to aid the initiate in the task as they deem necessary. The Seed will have two weeks from the date the quest is assigned to complete it.  In addition, the Seed must gain the favor of at least seven Dread Harvesters or higher ranking members by demonstrating the qualities desired in the guild.  The qualities encompass battle prowess, attitude, roleplay ability, and other useful skills the Harvest may need.  When at least seven Dread Harvesters or higher ranking members have accepted the new Seed, they will post a vote of acceptance in the Grange forum.  The Seed has one additional week after the quest deadline to have the votes cast.  Once this is done, the Seed will request a Ceremony of  Binding, at which time they will be counted as a Harvester. Harvesters are generally assigned to the same Domain in which they were sponsored. Occasionally, Harvesters may be relocated to ensure proper strength in numbers in each of the Dread Domains.<br>
<br>
Once a Seed has been raised to the ranks of Harvester through the Ritual of Binding, they may then pursue the additional honor of becoming a Dread Harvester. This is accomplished through a solitary quest that is designed by the Winnower to test the fabric of the Harvester's soul, and the strength of their commitment to the Vision of the Violent Harvest. This is called the Quest of Blood, and it ends with the death and ritual ostracizing of the quester, or their being raised to the exalted position of a Dread Harvester. Either ritual, that of the Blood (naming as a Dread Harvester) or that of Purification (removal from the guild) is conducted by the Reaper of Norrath, and shall be attended by as many of the members of the Violent Harvest as may be roused. Only Dread Harvesters and above may act as sponsors, and only Dread Harvesters and above may vote on the admission of an initiate as a Seed. <br>
<br>
For those Seeds who petition for membership and are in their 30th Season or above, the process of gaining admittance will be similar to that stated above.  They will still require sponsorship by a Dread Harvester or higher member.  However, the Seed, in this case, will be required to coordinate and successfully execute a mid-level raid of a dungeon, leading at least one full group of Violent Harvest members.  This exercise will be overseen by an Officer of the Guild and judged for its effectiveness on varying criteria to include leadership style, planning, creativity, communications, battle skills, and roleplay ability.  The Seed will have 3 weeks to complete the raid and all members attending the raid will give their votes to the attending Officer.  After completing the raid, and gaining the required votes, the Seed may then request The Ritual of Blood, and will become a Dread Harvester. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ritual of The Binding<br>
<br>
When a Seed becomes a Harvester they must drink from the Bloodstone Chalice, an ancient cup that was crafted in hate by the High Priest of Innoruuk upon the completion of the transformation of  Nektulos. The sacred spirits that are used must be crafted by a full member (Dread Harvester) of the Violent Harvest. Upon drinking, the Seed-become-Harvester must swear upon their own blood, that they will abide by the Code of Conduct of the Violent Harvest, that they will remain true to the vision of the Violent Harvest, and that they will do all that they can to aid others so bound to the vision. The oath must be concluded with this, &quot;Let Innoruuk bind my blood in stone if I fail&quot;. This is the Oath of Binding. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ritual of Blood<br>
<br>
When a member becomes a Dread Harvester, they must complete the ritual of Blood, and shed their own blood into the Bloodstone Chalice. The blood seeps into the cup, and mingles with that of all of the Dread Harvesters that have gone before. From this mingling, the cup is given the power to bind, and that power is renewed. The Dread Harvester must proclaim, &quot;Let my blood, and the blood of all who have gone before, enable the Violent Harvest to begin&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>
Emergence as Dread Lord<br>
<br>
Those few Dread Harvesters who illustrate extreme desire to fulfill the Violent Harvest’s promise to prepare Norrath for transformation, may be elevated to the status of Dread Lord by action of the Triad.  This position of high status is earned through a combination of actions.  First, the Dread Harvester must plan and execute a guild raid of acceptable complexity.  Second, the Dread Harvester must be active within the grange, initiating and responding to a minimum of twenty posts within the Halls of Hate.  Finally, a Dread Harvester must seek and complete a Quest of Honor.  This quest will be of great difficulty for the season of the Dread Harvester seeking the quest.  Perseverance will be tested, and duly rewarded.  The Triad must reach unanimous agreement that the Dread Harvester has proven themselves worthy of naming as a Dread Lord.  Once a Dread Lord has emerged, they have the right to sit in full standing at the Dread Council, to discuss guild issues and bring recommendations to the Triad, to plan and execute raids, and to step forward when asked and serve as lieutenants in the field for their Dread Overlord.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
OFFICERS<br>
<br>
The Violent Harvest is constructed upon the principal of three, as was given in the vision of the Violent Harvest itself. The officer positions are constructed under the same principle. <br>
  <br>
The Great Triad<br>
The leadership of the guild is comprised of a Triumvirate, a ruling group of three called the Reaper, the Thresher and the Winnower. While the three positions are equal in authority and power, they are very different in their responsibilities. <br>
<br>
The Reaper of Norrath -- First among equals, the Reaper is responsible for bringing order to the Grange, leading all council sessions, and conducting official business with the leadership of other guilds. <br>
The Thresher of Norrath -- The Thresher is the military master of the Violent Harvest, and is charged with ensuring that the military might of the Violent Harvest is trained and ordered, prepared to bring the Violent Harvest to fruition. The Thresher oversees the Dire Lord and suggests candidates for the Dread Overlord positions to be ratified by the Great Triad. The Thresher also assumes primary authority in times of guild war. <br>
The Winnower of Norrath -- Part diplomat and part zealot, the Winnower is charged with overseeing recruitment and working with the Dread Overlords to design and monitor the progress of those engaged in the Culling and the Quest of Blood. In addition, the Winnower is the primary ambassador to other guilds, though the Reaper is the final authority in engaging in treaty or declaring war. <br>
  <br>
The Special Ministry<br>
<br>
A special group of three members has been set aside to perform unique missions for the Violent Harvest.  This group consists of The Dire Lord, The Assassin, and the Herald.  This group reports directly to the Triad. <br>
<br>
The Dire Lord oversees the balance of the Dread Domains and will monitor their overall effectiveness.  The Dire Lord makes the determinations of skill and strength within each Domain and may, at any time, relocate Seeds or Harvesters to other Domains to fulfill the needs of the Harvest. <br>
The Assassin is tasked with carrying out precision strikes against enemies designated by the Triad.  In addition, the Assassin of the Harvest is tasked with the selection, training, and maintaining of a secret squad for special assignments, known throughout Neriak as the Breagan D’Aerthe. <br>
The Herald of the Harvest is tasked with gathering the chronicles of the Harvest and may act as an ambassador to other guilds or events at the discretion of the Triad. <br>
<br>
The Dread Overlords<br>
<br>
Each Dread Domain is overseen by a Dread Overlord. This person is responsible for ensuring that order is maintained in the ranks in their Domain, and that preparations for the Violent Harvest continue unabated. Dread Overlords are appointed by the Great Triad, and overseen by the Dire Lord. Dread Lords appoint the Culling Task, and lead the Dread Lords, Dread Harvesters, Harvesters, Seeds, Ambassadors, Harrowers and Tillers from their Domain in times of conflict or guild war.  The Dread Overlord is to maintain close ties with each of his charges in his Domain.  The Dread Overlord will hold at least monthly gatherings with the members of the Domain to ascertain its effectiveness in the overall campaign against the misled forces of the Lightborn. <br>
  <br>
<br>
Vacancies and Appointments <br>
<br>
From time to time, vacancies may arise within the Governing body.  If the vacant position is a Dread Overlord or Special Ministry position, the Triad will make the selection of the replacement based on the current needs of the Harvest.  Should a Triad position become vacant, then the remaining members of the Triad, the Special Ministry, and Dread Overlords must assemble and discuss the merits of worthy candidates. This full leadership group is known as the Tribunal. The Dread Council has the authority to recommend their choices for leadership positions to the Tribunal for consideration.  Once a candidate is approved by a consensus, the member will be elevated to the Triad position and the appropriate Ceremonies held.  <br>
  <br>
<br>
Removal<br>
<br>
Any member of the Violent Harvest that consistently violates the Code of Conduct, or who consistently works against the aims of the Violent Harvest, may be removed from the guild. Accusations of such heinous activity can be brought forward by any who have achieved Dread Harvester status or above. Once arisen, such accusations must be investigated by the Dread Overlord of the accused member's Domain, or by the Great Triad should a Dread Overlord or officer be accused. Once the investigation is complete, the Tribunal must meet to discuss the evidence and to hear statements of the accuser and the accused. Once heard, the Tribunal must determine the findings and make a ruling regarding the removal. If ostracizing is called for, the Reaper is authorized to remove the individual. If the Reaper themselves is to be removed, any of the remaining Great Triad may perform the act of purification. <br>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
EVENTS AND PARTICIPATION<br>
<br>
Norrath poses great challenges, as do the other dimensions of existence. Nonetheless, all members of the Violent Harvest are expected to participate in guild events on a regular basis. As a general rule, unless excused by a Dread Lord or one of the Great Triad, members of the Violent Harvest must attend at least one in three events initiated by the guild. These events may include such activities as tournaments, guild wars, festivals, or Rituals of Purification, Binding or of Blood. <br>
