Sending a shiver down her spine. Warily she turned towards it and watched as Shintenshi materialized from the shadows. Without fanfair or flourish he dropped a battered breastplate upon the ground. Kat noted the hole gouged deep into it. The dried blood which stained it. <br>&quot;Been out playing I see?&quot; She chuckled softly as her eyes raised to meet his. &quot;I do not play,&quot; he sneered back,&quot;This was an exception.&quot; Stepping over the breastplate he drew closer to her. His stance geared to intimadate a lesser foe.<br>Amusement remained in her eyes as she raised her gaze to his. She showed no fear. &quot;You wished to speak to me?&quot; he questioned without preamble. She nodded and turned her back to him. &quot;I need to speak with Faeolin.&quot;<br>&quot;What makes you so sure I know where she is?&quot; he asked her calmly. Portraying little emotion or reaction to the name. Glancing at him over her shoulder, &quot;She is your Captain. I'm no fool Shintenshi. I know full well that you know where she is. I would speak with her.&quot;<br>He studied her in silence for a moment then nodded briskly, &quot;Very well, but.. if this is a trap.. &quot; He left the threat unspoken. And then he was gone, vanished near as quickly as he had appeared.<br>Her meeting with Faeolin started nearly as subtly. Faeolin had tracked Kat down. Had watched warily waiting for the right opportunity to make her presence known. Once she had ascertained that there was no trap she stepped out to face Kat. <br>It had taken much convincing before Faeolin would even agree to take part in Kats plan. If the plan backfired, well the consiquences where such that neither wanted to even consider them. The only saving grace to Kats plan was the fact that both Nospiratus and Vresk had agreed to help in it. <br>Faeolin too had left, needing time to think. She would be in contact when Nospiratus returned from his quest. <br>Kat snapped from thoughts of the earlier days events and glanced at the clock once more. It was late at night, and Kat was again pacing the dark bedroom. Four days had passed since he had left. This odd meloncholy that had fallen over her upon his leaving did not seem want to let up. Now add to that the sleepless nights that she found befalling her. She wished she could pinpoint what was wrong with her. This behavoir was odd.<br>Nospiratus had gone to seek council from the Father. And would not be back for several more days. Till then she would have to be especially careful in her conduct and her actions. She would have to make doubly sure not to step on any toes. She would avoid Tzlar and his brother Zirrix at all cost for now. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/unospiratus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nospiratus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mad One</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/02 11:32:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fall from Grace.. the meetings.. </span><hr size=1> *She stood upon the ivy covered battlements in a simple white dress, her hair pulled back in a long white braid that fell to the middle of her back.  The back, like the rest of her, was human.  In one hand she held a staff of glittering gold, in the other a book.  She stood upon the walls, alone and undefended, but the people cowered before her - or rather, they awaited her next word like chickens anticipating a handful of mullet.  Flames licked the air about them, the cries of the orphans shattering the night, but they waited upon her with the vain hope that her words would bring salvation from the dark hand of Hate.*<br><br>Nospiratus shook his head in amazement.  Never, not since the first visions as he floated in his mother's womb, had it been so effortless, so simple, or so painless.  All he had to do was turn his mind to the inner focus, and tap the seething cauldron of Hate that threatened to consume him from within.  His silver flask lay unopened upon his desk as he sat and stared at nothing in particular.  His scribe had been dismissed for the day, the lap-desk he relied upon resting unused in his hidden alcove.  Everything was different.<br><br>He wanted to think he did not know why - he wished he could feign ignorance - but he could not.  So sure he was that he had left everything and returned to Innorruk to make a demand.  A small smile curled at the corner of his cruel lips at the thought.  He had communed with Innoruuk and made demands of his Master.  The mouse insulting the eagle, he had defied the Prince of Hate in language, thought and deed.   Innoruuk's response was not at all what he had expected.  Laughter is seldom heard on the Plane of Hate, and Nospiratus hoped that never again would he have to bear the sound.<br><br>Shifting his weight to ease the pain rippling along his left side, Nospiratus picked up his pen and dutifully recorded the vision he had seen.  As for the rest, this recent dialogue with his Master would not be shared with anyone...except the one that casued him to act with such foolish abandon.  He had learned what he had to know - he still had the power of foresight and the visions were still channeled through Hate.  But he had learned other things as well.  Feeling the couldron burning white hot in his own black heart, Nospiratus smiled as he recorded his visions and his prophecy.  No more riddles it seemed - the meaning was clear.  <br><br>At the bottom of the page, Nospiratus wrote, &quot;The city of Qeynos will fall to darkness, fire and sword, but the people of that land will bow to a word form the clarion voice of Nimhiriel Innoroki.  Upon that day, dark chains will be shattered.&quot;<br><br>Nospiratus smiled, wincing form the pain that lingered upon his body from the power unleashed upon him by the laughter of Hate.  Nospiratus smiled, feeling the gift within his heart as it fed the cauldron of his purifying Hate.  Their time was nearly at hand.<br><br>Nospiratus K'Thalion<br>Mad Prophet of Hate <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=241.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
