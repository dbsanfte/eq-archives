<br>
It all started in Beta Phase-3 with a Human cleric named Nexa.  Nexa was a very kind and giving cleric who spent her time healing those in need.  When beta ended I began my EQ life on Veeshan as a Rogue and this rogue gained some fame and status but due to the server dynamics there I decided it best to leave my fair rogue and head off to greener fields.  So was born Raya Starshyne on E'ci and taking up Nexa's old creedo Raya advanced quickly as a Druid and once again after reaching some status and power Raya ran haedlong into POLITICS.  And so then was born My Warrior on Tarew Marr but after reaching level 20 I decided a warrior was not for me and moved on.  Then my first wizard was born on Rathe but after a short time there I happened upon Prexus.<br>
<br>
And so Xuna was born and shortly after Abery was born onto this world.  Xuna leveled quickly and gained maybe friends and of course a few enemies as does everyone on thier rise to power and glory.  Once at level 12 or so Xuna was sitting in EC getting ready to travel to NK to gain some levels when a scream went across the land.  A Wood Elf warrior had made a public call for help as he had been poisoned by a dark weed snake.  Xuna feeling the pain of this poor Elf called out to him telling him to run to her at the Nek forest Tunnel and she would help.  After a few moments a near dead wood elf crawled before Xuna and plead for a cure to the poison that coursed through his veins.  Xuna stood and walked over to the poor Wood elf and took his fragile face in her hands and whispered to him &quot;Today is not your lucky day Pale elf for I am unable to heal you but I wanted to see you die&quot;.  the wood elf's eyes open in panic as he decribed begin bound all the way in Gfay and that he could never get back here in time.  His bitter curses at Xuna meant nothing as he turned to go to a source of help that was also offered at the first inn but alas he took two steps and fell dead.  <br>
<br>
Xuna's time from then all was spent learning about the other lesser races of Norrath and through grouping and helping other she found that her actions early in life where misguilded and since then she as sworn to help all those in need whenever she could do so.  Xuna has seldom soloed being known instead as an excellant grouping wizard.<br>
<br>
Abery's life has always been spent helping others but unknown to them all of this help has been to further her own life in Norrath or so she likes to tell herself this.  Abery has become known as a fast acting Cleric with a knack for saving foolish enchanters that get in trouble.  Abery's must memorable moment was on an IV juggs/trak raid before she guilded to that great people she has gotten to know.  Garvan a friend and powerful enchanter was in her group when 12 or 13 mushrooms decended upon the group due to a missed snare.  Garvan's wonderous actions kept the masses mezzed as Abery's healing arts keep up not only Garvan for the entire fight but the rest of her group and one other enchanter.  At the end of the epic battle her group stood strong not a one had fallen sadly all the other clerics had fell, but the encounter was successful.<br>
<br>
Now I have several other persons on Prexus and in time hopefully you will meet them all Xunaberry (named for a combo of Xuna and Abery) Xunia the cute and deadly 43rd level Rogue who is quickly winning a spot in my heart, Kissaya created really only to get her the surname Kissaya Booboos, Dominat the sexy SK, Derobmai Necro created because well look at her name backwards and you decide, Novalene the halfling warrior about level 30 but now naked in GD so that I could equipment my son's character Stoody the mighty Dwarven warrior.  If you ever see Stoodly be nice he is 12 years old and really trying to learn the game.  Yes he got twinked but he has not seen one level of PL I want him to learn the game.  So throw him a buff or two and tell him you like his name.  He described Stoodly to me once as &quot;Stoodly the mighty from Butcher Block mountains and slayer of the goblins of runnyeye.&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I lost a corpse at 6 at deleted him. Kato the monk was made, with the Evil Dormmamu the Necromancer falling behind him...Used to play with Brant, Dirt, Deckk, old Artifice / Omni / Fist...crazy guys - helped me a mess...then came my big guild days...learned a lot, met a bunch of people, disappeared from fame...played odd hours in a foreign asian guild as Solarus and Carramon - back when a Runed Cowl and SMR weren't ever sold, and a 10 warrior with full crafted was like full cobalt...had some bad &quot;patience&quot; issues when leading big raids...decided guilds were not for me...resurrected Nidar and played Huri a lot in search of epics...I think I know 60 percent of Prexus old folks now...after finding an old char of mine was deleted, started playing a bard again... <br>
<br>
Met some IV people (Jaharad, Carit, Meno, Gruberman, Ajahn, Moonie) all because of my LFG Tag...rest is history pretty much. I had an invite to Unity, and was being recruited by DD for awhile...liked the &quot;closeness&quot; of Infinitus Vindicat tho. All honesty - I liked the &quot;no-nonsense&quot; attitude of Jaharad and Ajahn...Jaha reminded me so much of Dirt and Halkhan, and that is about the best compliment I could ever give someone. Besides, watching Moons nuke Jaharad sealed it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And having Ajahn tell me &quot;no speed after that comment&quot; actually made me laugh IRL...much better than being pissed off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
