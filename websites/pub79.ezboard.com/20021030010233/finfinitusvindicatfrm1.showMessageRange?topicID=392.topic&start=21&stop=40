I've seen a lot of conversations on this thread (the commons) that have reduced to someone(s) in IV stating &quot;this board is IV, wtf are you doing here saying anything?&quot;.  If you want to sensor people's opinions, wouldn't it be better to close the forum to non IV members?  I don't understand what some of you are looking for.  Is it &quot;we want people that post on this forum to support every idea and statement of any IV member?&quot;?  If so, you are better served to close the forum.<br>
<br>
That said, I think people should look at sanctions as &quot;business is business&quot;.  It doesn't mean that an individual is not your &quot;friend&quot; because they hold a different opinion and support measures to bring about change.  I wouldn't presume to think that friendship can outlast direct participation in behavior of &quot;questionable honor&quot; though.  If you are a member of a guild that knowingly and willingly bunks the &quot;system&quot; as it's supported by a majority of the community, then be ready to take the heat.  You WILL be judged by the company you keep. <p><P align="center"><font face="Blackadder ITC"><font color=#5A753E"><font size=+3>Cecarlyn Ravenwind</font></font></font><br><font face="Castellar"><font color="#FFCC99"><font size=-1>55th Preserver, Circle of Druids</font></font></font><br><font face="Castellar"><font color="FFCC99"><font size=-1>Sword of Fate,  Prexus</font></font></font><br><font face="freestyle script"><font color+"#5A753E><font size=+2>and thong totin' wife of Brewt Phorce</font></font></font><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uajahn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ajahn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~jtparris/_uimages/IV.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/01 11:01:54 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~jtparris/_uimages/Doll2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stasis FCFS' KTF on TRAK</span><hr size=1> Good post, Cecarlyn...and very true. <p><img src="http://home.mindspring.com/~jtparris/_uimages/AjaLuzt2.gif" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uballadragingboars.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balladragingboars</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Councilman</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/01 1:34:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stasis FCFS' KTF on TRAK</span><hr size=1> Utael, for all you have done, remember we have been there to help you get all those shells, its been a mutual relationship.<br>
<br>
While you could have got others to help you...maybe...we have always been there to help you. I have helped 2-3 times myself.<br>
<br>
I dont know what problems you have with who, but Stasis stance right now is counter to the generally accepted rules of fair play used by the players on Prexus, ie the rotations.<br>
<br>
They have made their own bed and must sleep in it. While I am disappointed you joined them, you are correct in thinking you will get no further assistance from me while wearing that tag. <br>
<br>
I had alot of people I considered friends, and liked very much in Stasis, I raided with them alot. But our idealogical differences have caused me to re-evaluate our relationship and the very fact they have even considered jumping a raid for this guild has made me very angry. Its a lack of respect for other people thats intolerable to me. IV has never jumped someone elses raids OR forced a share on a certain area, we have always respected others rights to be somewhere first. We also realize that the calendar allows us, as well as others to plan for big events and this gives us a peace of mind FCFS will take away.<br>
<br>
FCFS is for kiddies, its for the impatient, its not for people with any level of maturity because anyone with half a brain realizes its an &quot;uber mentality&quot; behind it. <br>
<br>
Of course the big raid guilds want FCFS because they CAN. If you can do fear with a group or 2. Whats to stop them from pharming Hate, Fear etc for epic pieces constantly? If it only takes a group, the opportunity to do those planes becomes even less. Sure IV can do alot of this as well, but I remember what it was like being in a smaller guild, being treated like I was by these elitist pricks. Some people play to actually STAY with their friends and not for the &quot;best things&quot; &quot;first&quot; or &quot;before&quot; anyone else. <br>
<br>
The Calendar is an inconvenience to the greedy, its an obstacle. Nothing more. <br>

However I feel that before long our calendar is going to disintegrate, ESPECIALLY if Krozar is nominated to admin it since he is pro-fcfs.<br>
<br>
I understand that youre disappointed that I joined their ranks, but at the same time im disappointed in the actions of people who flamed me for camping Lodizal so much when they were there to kill him half of the time, and some of them actually walking away with loot because of it. What nerve.<br>
<br>
I don't know where people come off thinking everything has to be handed to them on a silver platter because a: they work, b: they have family, c: they have an outside life, d: whatever other excuses that can be thought up. I fit 3 of these 4 categories and I managed.<br>
<br>
This game is meant to be competetive. It's meant to reward the strong, and its meant to be fun while doing it. Right now the Calendars allow people to assume that they are owed something, when in reality nothing is owed them. They have taken away the competetive edge that this game is DESIGNED around, and they are being exploited by the smaller guilds to meet their own greedy needs. This is intolerable. Therefore I opt for FCFS, while my view is different from yours i respect your opinion and I admire the position you take for defending it, as much as I disagree with it.<br>
<br>
The way I see it is this:<br>
<br>
FCFS moves in, which it more than likely will at this point, even if it is in a hybrid state. Small guilds come to the realization they had it good when the calendar was in place, because suddenly they can only raid half as much if that, provided the new system is respected. Small guilds will then begin to whine about how unfair it is that they dont have the luxury of raiding any time of the day, that they cant muster up the forces to go raid when they manage to get their hands on the plane, etc.. etc.. blah blah cry me a river.<br>
<br>
This leads to yet another revolution, but this time where the playing fields are level and not skewed in the favor of the zergling mini guilds, because nolonger do the small guilds hold the dominant power due to sheer numbers in the now non-existant calendar system. They are then forced to compromise. Even in the chaos that you dread that is FCFS, in MY opinion, it will be therapeutic. People need to get their heads out of their asses and realize noone owes them anything in this game. The calendars are a luxury, not a right, and one easily taken away, as Stasis and Domus have now proved. They have bitten the hand that feeds them in assuming that it is their god given right to reserve a plane and have it tucked away neatly for them until they are prepared to invade it.<br>
<br>
Again these are my opinions, I respect yours BA and anyone else who is involved or decides to involve themselves in this conversation, I would expect you to respect mine and I can perfectly understand your compassion for the little guilds, but I see them as the plague that brought FCFS about now, which is pretty astounding considering I came from a small guild. Our system has been perverted, and now its time to play by new rules.<br>

I suppose until VI or another company produces a game that doesnt rely on camping this will always be an issue. It would be nice if they could develop servers for the hardcore gamers that want FCFS and for those of us that do have a life or dont mind playing nice...<br>

<br>
Before Unity originally stepped on SoM's PoF raid to FCFS CT and initiate the process of setting up a rotation for him, small guilds who held the plane on days CT was up would demand BRIBES from the guilds arriving to godstrike. If their demands werent met they would sell out the right to kill CT to the highest bidder. People allowed this to happen because they were afraid of the repercussions it would bring on the public boards.<br>
<br>
It's perversions like this that I am talking about. Granted CT is on rotation now and the godstrike guild has every right to trample over the PoF raiders for that day, they dont, and again it is the small guilds who benefit from this. I see more bickering about the calendar issue coming from the small guilds than i do the large guilds for that matter too.<br>
<br>
They have a word for the scenario's mentioned above.<br>
It's called BLACKMAIL.<br>
<br>
**EDIT**<br>
Jabnael, thats what guilds are about, not what EverQuest is about. <p><html>

More unneeded flames Jabnael. I refuse to reply with a flame, because I still hold a modicum of respect for IV and I wont sully their boards with one. Thats a great way to debate the topic, flame me for my views instead of trying to post something constructive or attempting to sway my views and show me the light of why FCFS is so bad. Keep in mind, Domus is FCFS now too. How long till other guilds follow suite. Just last week IV members were defending the honor of Domus on their own boards! Want a link? My opinions reside outside of my guild, infact the reason im in the guild that im in is they have similar opinions on the situation. I doubt any of them are even reading this thread, they know that sometimes its like reasoning with a brick wall. However, I will continue to pursue it until my point is heard. If FCFS was such a demonic and evil thing you wouldn't see the slew of support that has suddenly arisen on the prexus.com boards for it. Fact is a lot of people are fed up with the system in place being abused. If IV wants to continue to subject themselves to that abuse then it is they who will suffer in the end, because while they're busy observing the calendar, which doesnt even have a moderator at this point in time, guilds like Stasis, Domus and what now sounds like Fallen Alliance possibly, from the way Maddie is posting on KTF's boards lately (although I don't presume to speak for FA) will be busy satiating their members needs. <p><html>

I dont see how KSing a small guild is the same thing. Now if they cant hold a plane or leave it, that's different. But denying them the opportunity to even try....that's wrong per above post.<br>
<br>
I heartily disagree that this isn't a family type game as well. If that wasnt the case, VI wouldnt care if people were hogging spawns or not. And it's unrealistic to compare an otter spawn in CS, for example (where players do have a &quot;camped&quot; policy), to rare or planes spawns. The reward is like apples and oranges. Furthermore, if this was such a beastial game, there wouldnt be naming restrictions and such.<br>
<br>
Like someone else mentioned, if its best of the best action your after, I suggest going to a PvP server. I can personally attest to a much more extreme &quot;rush&quot; one gets from player vs. player action, primarily in UO, but that got old for me. I doubt many of the current FCFS view holders have the gumption to try that, however, which is why it appears they try to impose their &quot;bully&quot; attitude on the normal servers....<br>

I want a ring side seat to the day the server goes FCFS, I want to watch as the small minded see in 20/20 clarity the error of not being careful what they wish for.  It will be some small consolation to watch as the same old cheaters and spoil sports from my childhood once again walk from the field bored and looking for something else to wreck, being bitten in the ass the whole way by their own actions.  <br>
<br>
Believe me, if the good guilds of this server are forced to play your game of FCFS, brains and passion will always win out over greed.  I think you will find it will become a very &quot;personal&quot; reaction.  People just don't like being slapped in the face, and shouldn't have to.<br>

My ethics in real life are most certainly somewhat different from those in game as are most peoples I would assume, what is so greedy about FCFS if the whole calendar is abolished. Will IV Begin FCFS'ing? Or will they conform to the non-extistant calendar? I'm willing to bet they'll begin FCFS'ing because thats what they'll have to do to grow. Granted the server may not be FCFS yet, but it will be, I'm certainly betting on it, and if Stasis hadn't made the move to FCFS first someone else would have. So why are Stasis now the black sheep of Prexus? It's perfectly acceptable to not agree with decisions a friend makes in real life, but still be friends, that is what makes us individuals. The way IV is coming off on these posts states otherwise however. I have many friends who have done some VERY questionable things in life, things that I would not agree with, yet they remain friends, and I respect the decisions they made as their own, while I may not agree with them. If you had a family member who commited capital murder, say your son, would you still love him? Or to support the analogy, a friend whom you had grown up with and known closely for 20 years, do the same thing. I'm pretty sure I would find it extremely difficult to sever those ties. I know what you're gonna say, noone on Prexus has known anyone long enough to form that kind of bond, but it is the closest analogy i can think of off the top of my head, im sure there are better examples out there. The bonds have formed regardless of time if you've commited yourself to friendship, time only reinforces that bond.<br>
