I've often said that nothing pleases me more then parrying Legion, or in some cases, double parrying him.  It's as if the clash of weapon on weapon is an affirmation of my class role.  Anyways...<br>
<br>
First, Anga, I have copied my Blademaster, Kenolil, over to Pendragon, and am enormously interested in setting up some logging sessions regarding Parry.  I've done some informal duelling, and found that I parried less then expected, but never attached raw data to it.  I also don't really have any connections within the community to make something like this happen.<br>
<br>
Second, I've always wondered why I don't Parry a great deal in RvR.  In addition to the problems they had with the grouping thing, and this mysterious &quot;bug&quot; that made it harder to do so, there are some other things that cause it to work less effectively in our case.<br>
<br>
For example, let's look at who uses Parry.  Assassins and Archers do not, neither do casters.  So, it comes down to tanks.  In my opinion, 3 types of tanks exist: Large weapon(Polearms, 2H hammers, 2H swords, Spear), Shield/Weapon, and Dual Wielders.  Of all these, Large Weapons deal the greatest amount of damage right away, making them optimal for RvR.  Shield/Weapon users can not only protect themselves, but are useful for countering archers targetting casters, and have solid offensive skills.  Dual Wielders rely a bit more on speed and craft to accomplish their ends.<br>
<br>
Of these three, only two spec Parry as a primary defensive skill: Dual Wielders and Large Weapons users.  The reason is fairly obvious, Shield users spend their points on Shield(which by the way is greatly improved as of 1.53)<br>
<br>
So, compare Light Tanks vs Large Weapons.  First of all, Light Tanks are required to spec 2 other lines, so their parry may not always be up to the level of a person who needs to spec only a couple of lines.  Large Weapon and Spear Heroes can take Parry to 50 and never really feel a great deal of lack as a result.  Some light tanks, like myself, believe that from parry, they can use reactionaries that will benefit them and win them fights.<br>
<br>
Large Weapons are 2 times as hard to Parry.  This greatly disadvantages any other class who specs Parry, primarily dual wielders because they usually will have fewer HP's, and with the exception of the Berzerker, the incapability to deal damage in large chunks.<br>
<br>
Dual wield is 2 times harder to block.  Disadvantages shield/weapons users, obviously, but fortunately, they have little to fear because they will almost always have the anytime stun, and superior defense to us.  Also, 1.53 has made block far more attractive, and I noticed a lot of my dual wielding hits being blocked regardless of their penalty.<br>
<br>
The only ones who do NOT receive a penalty of these three types of tanks are the Large Weapons users, the ones who already are the leading damage dealers in terms of RvR.  1.53 adds another interesting factor that improves them, while not truly improving the other tanks.<br>
<br>
It became painfully obvious as I duelled Large Weapons users that after 1.53, not only will I hit for less then them, I will hit less FREQUENTLY then them.  Since this parry bug has been fixed, they parry a great deal.  In one fight(which I lost horribly), I parried a total of 1 time.  The person I was fighting parried 7 times.  He's a polearmsman.<br>
<br>
So, it's hard to conclude that this parry fix is going to help us.  If someone who has 56 Parry with items and Mastery of Parry to 3, and without the RA parried Legion 5 times in a row, including a double parry, cannot make Parry work for them in RvR, it'll be even harder for those who went with only 28 Parry.<br>
<br>
Besides this, the way reactionary styles are based generally makes them near impossible to get off in RvR.  Reactionaries currently go like this.<br>
<br>
You parry!<br>
You prepare to perform your Tornado(or whatever)!<br>
Kewldood hits you for 110 points of damage!<br>
You fail to perform your Tornado perfectly!<br>
You hit Kewldood for 45 points of damage!<br>
<br>
Kewldood's hit in this case BREAKS your reactionary.  An assassin will almost always have fast weapons, sword shield users use weapons as fast as mine, always, and I'm lucky if I can get my weapons out before I'm half dead if a LW user wants to take a shot at me.  Why is it like this?  What I envisioned was more like this.<br>
<br>
You parry!<br>
You prepare to perform your Tornado!<br>
Kewldood hits you for 110 points of damage!<br>
You perform your Tornado perfectly(+60)!<br>
You hit Kewldood for 105 points of damage!<br>
<br>
And a failure would look like this.<br>
<br>
You parry!<br>
Kewldood hits you for 110 points of damage!<br>
You prepare to perform your Tornado!<br>
You fail to perform your Tornado perfectly.<br>
<br>
Or...<br>
<br>
You parry!<br>
You hit Kewldood for 45 points of damage!<br>
You prepare to perform your Tornado!<br>
You fail to perform your Tornado perfectly.<br>
<br>
See, the trick here is that a reactionary should be based on YOUR reactions, not how lucky he is on the timing of his attacks.  In the failures I listed, the person parrying was too slow, because Kewldood got another hit in before you prepared the attack, thus negating the &quot;parried last attack&quot; requirement.  The second failure listed, it was negated because after parrying, you already attacked, missing your chance at a reactionary.  Currently, these are already the case, you'll fail in both, but you will also fail if they hit you in the midst of preparing the style, which sometimes takes a full second or two to go off due to the pause.  Do they ACTUALLY expect us to use reactionaries in RvR with the system set up as is?  It's a problem for all parry users, not just Light tanks.<br>
<br>
Overall, 1.53, through my limited testing, seems to benefit Large Weapons users a great deal, and us a very small amount.  It seems like it separates class competency levels even further then they are, and they're already pretty far. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukethryndc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kethryn DC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#000000>(9/19/02 4:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Analysis of Parry and problems for light tanks</span><hr size=1> Yes, its a big problem for parry users. We spend the same spec points as shield users, wether we are zerks, bms, mercs, 2 handed users, etc... yet get nothing to show for it.  We can't find a better &quot;parry-item&quot; to get a better bonus to parry like they can get shields, we do not get anything other a slightly improved chance to parry as we spec higher whereas shield users get better shields and styles to use.<br>
<br>
Also, the only class that can spec parry higher then anyone else without lowering there damage is the hero. I'm sorry for ya hibernian types, but the hero with the new changes has went well past the polearmsman as most overpowered melee type.  With the ability to spec 50LW/CS (one or the other) and 50 parry without losing damage where as all of us duel wielders have to spec both our primary weapon and our duel wielding skill to stay viable.   Also, its a dead horse, but they also get there stag form which just pushes them over the top in terms of balance vs. other melee types.<br>
<br>
One melee has to be the best, ya can't get around that, but for one to a large amount ahead of the others is unbalanced.  Mythic has made changes that put all of us light tanks on more equal footing.  I personally think the latest string of changes will push you blademasters and the mercenaries ahead of the zerks by quite a bit.  Because triple wield and dirty tricks will be much more viable then frenzy even with the longer timer between uses.  They both also get flurry, which may not be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but with the advent of greater defense, and less hits per fight, the ability to do damage that can't be blocked, parried or evaded is huge.<br>
