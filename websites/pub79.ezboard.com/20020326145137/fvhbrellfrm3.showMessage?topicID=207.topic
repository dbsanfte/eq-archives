Of late, he had spent much time leading the Violent Harvest in forays into various places in Norrath, and even Luclin.  He was quite proud of how the guild had performed, and was happy to see that the Harvest was prepared for battle.<br>
<br>
The skirmishes, however, had left the Iksar drained both physically and mentally.  It was time to take some time to recuperate.  His regenerative powers, enhanced by countless seasons of battle began to do its work.  His older, scarred scales began to drop off, falling around him, to be replaced by brand new ones.  Within an hour’s time, the process had completed.  His entire skin had been cast away, and his new scales, so new they still shone with apparent wetness, were visible.  The only mark that lasted from one shedding to another was the sigil of the Dragon of Hate, branded upon his right bicep by Lord Cazic Thule as a constant reminder to him of his failure to the Lord of Fear.<br>
<br>
In the shadows, however, something watched the Iksar, carefully calculating when it would make its move.  Already the Prophet of the Harvest had been…disposed of.  The Dread Overlords were being hunted down as well.  With them out of the way, along with the meddling Ambassador, the plans could continue.  There were rumors the Iksar never slept anymore.  No matter.  The monk wasn’t the only thing here that had patience.  The patience of the Eternals would be of use.  The thing’s fangs dripped in anticipation of the hunt.<br>
<br>
This had been a long time in coming.<br>

Something had interrupted his meditations, and he didn't like it.  For the first time in what seemed ages, Lord Thule had again invaded his thoughts.  Vresk was taken from the quiet place in his mind to a blasted plain seemingly devoid of life.<br>
<br>
The part of his mind that demanded an identity to every place struggled to place a name to the features, but was unable to.  For lack of anything else, he assumed it was some place on Luclin.  His eyes scanned the horizon, searching amongst the numerous boulders that were the only things to disrupt the otherwise featureless landscape.  Nothing stirred.<br>
<br>
Quickly, his forked tongue darted out, flashing side to side before dashing back.  Vresk tasted...blood on the wind.  Behind him, a rock tumbled, disturbed by some undetected presence.  The monk turned, his Will already summoning the magics from the Celestial Fists he wore.  He was surrounded by pulsing magics.<br>
<br>
Before him stood the God of Fear.  His enormous Will invaded Vresk's own, and the powerful magic of his gloves sputtered and faded out.<br>
<br>
*Vresk* came the overwhelming, but simple summons.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark tidings, Lord Thule,&quot; Vresk replied in his own tongue.  &quot;Why have you deemed it necessary to disturb a Child of Innoruuk?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule's response was immediate and harsh.  The azure light from Vresk's brand flared blindingly, enveloping the monk in Runes of Pain.  He tried to cry out in his agony, but found the pain too great.  Every nerve cell, every fiber of his being was on fire.  Desperately, he floundered for his Center, that which his training had provided for him.  It was gone.<br>
<br>
The God chuckled, a nasty sound that the Iksar dimly compared to rusty nails scratching on granite.<br>
<br>
*Have you had enough to remind you to whom you speak?*<br>
<br>
The pain lessened just enough for Vresk to manage a nod.<br>
<br>
*Very well.* and the pain was gone.<br>
<br>
The Iksar barely caught himself from collapsing to the ground.  He stood and glared at Cazic Thule balefully, the Hate evident in his blue eyes.  &quot;Why have you brought me here, Lord Thule?&quot;<br>
<br>
*To show you what will be.*<br>
<br>
The image of Cazic disappeared, replaced by a horde of vampires.  By their hulking shape and unique form, Vresk was able to discern that they were indeed from Luclin.<br>
<br>
*You miss the point, Whiff.*<br>
<br>
Vresk bristled at the derogatory term.  &quot;They are vampires, Lord Fear, nothing more.&quot;<br>
<br>
The vampires hissed as one in response to his statement.  *Aye, this is true, Lost One.  They may represent little danger to yourself, but what of your friends?*<br>
<br>
Instantly, the images of his friends and family, Nospiratus, Khasirath, Shaede, Daiunus, all of the Harvest appeared.  The moment they appeared, the horde of vampires fell upon them.  There was a desperate struggle.  The Thresher and Reaper's blades flashed, as did the two Dread Overlords.  Spells erupted from the middle of the battle, and he saw Shaede, Wynnreaver, Payle and others brandishing their powers against the enemy.<br>
<br>
But despite a tremendous battle, the horde was too many.  One by one they fell.  And one by one they rose again, their fangs extended, blood in their eyes.  Vresk felt the bile rise in his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;You wouldn't dare, Lord Thule!&quot; he shouted.  But Cazic did not respond.  &quot;If you wish to return me to the cowering of my people, this will not work!  Feel the Flame of my Hate!&quot;<br>
<br>
*You do not listen to the lesson here, Whiff.*<br>
<br>
And the images of the vampires disappeared, replaced yet again by the images of thousands of slithering snakes.  Each snake, enormous in size, had the upper torso of humanoids.  Some wielded weapons, others were obvious spellcasters.<br>
<br>
*If it is Fear you wish, then you may have it.*<br>
<br>
An altar appeared, and before it stood a gigantic snake-man wielding a curved, jagged dagger dripping with a foul-smelling black substance.  But what chilled the Iksar's bones was the figure strapped to the altar.  There was a monk, his fists torn and bloody, his body broken.  For a stunned minute, Vresk realized he was looking at his own sacrifice at the claws of the Shissar.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot; he screamed in rage.  His Will formed unbidden in his mind, and he was surrounded with magic once again.  Again, he summoned his Will and his feet glowed with a mystical power.  Blindly he charged into the tremendous horde of Shissar.  As one they rose to meet him.  Bellowing his righteous wrath, he lept in the air, his foot connecting to the jaw of the nearest snake.  There was a sickening cracking sound, and the snake fell dead, its head and skull crushed.  And then they were upon him.  Above the battle, he could see the altar.  The Shissar there caught his eye, smiled wickedly, and plunged the dagger into his heart.<br>
<br>
Vresk came back to reality suddenly.  His body shook violently, but with Rage or Fear not even he could tell.  Slowly he got his breathing back under control.<br>
<br>
When he once again had his emotions in check, his nostrils flared, and he once again tasted the air.  And then he stopped again.  Something was in the air near him.  From the remnants of his meditations, he was able to recognize the scent.  Blood.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere in the Grange, the one who had been watching the Iksar chuckled deeply.  He had seen much in watching the Iksar.  If he indeed had a weakness, it would have something to do with that sigil on his arm.  He would do research.  There had to be a way to gain control of him using that.  And if not...then he would be disposed of like the rest. <p><img src=http://starwave.smartdesk.net/www/kooK/vresk1.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=207.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=207.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.violentharvest.com/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
