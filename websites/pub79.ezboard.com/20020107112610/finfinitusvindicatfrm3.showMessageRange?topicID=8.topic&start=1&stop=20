<br>
Gahhl obviously started out in Oggok, as a lil Shadowknight back in March of 2000.  My best friend and current roommate (ogre by the name of Koggo in-game) basically convinced me to start playing EQ instead of Ultima Online.  While I was a little unsure (I already had a well-developed powerful character in UO), but he wanted to be able to play with me... Even said he would buy the game for me if I would try it.  I cuoldnt exactly turn that down so I started out Gahhl.<br>
  -it should be interestign to note that Gahhl Beta v1.0 was a troll.  The little bit I had read about SK's seemed to make me think trolls would be better.  But Innothule swamp was so teribly laggy for me, I got frustrated after dieing to many times and never being able to find my body.  But I wanted to play a SK, so Gahhl graduated out of Beta and into the ogre you all know and love.  <br>
I came up a somewhat oldschool SK (42 levels under the old experience penalty /shudder).  I started in the Feerrott, and Lanoril quickly made sure I moved to EC when I hit lvl 8.  Level 8 was also cool, because then I got guilded to AO.  I had all the fun experiences of having to get used to hitting enter BEFORE i tried typing... (also known as the &quot;accidentally hitting &lt;A&gt; when talking to your guildmaster syndrome), from EC I moved to N Ro and dervs... ( I remember actualyl sellin Derv Rings for plat.. hehe), from there Oasis, Oasis to Lake Rathe and the birds, then to South Karana with aviaks and treants... I was quite a merchant back then... I liked to brag that I was &quot;self-twinked&quot; because of the gear that I was wearing and he deals that I had wrangled.  My best deal came at 27 though, when I bartered some Rubicite armor I got from the GM event in Najena for a Mithril 2-handed sword.  I still have it too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Kunark came out about the tiem I hit 30 or so, thoguh I didnt head over until I as around 34.  Since then, I've had a lot of fun... Did my first planes raid 1 bub into 46 after buging Mork for things I should NOT do.  at 46 I got to start on my epic which has sorta kept me from levelling until now.  (funny that I got the hardest part of the epic on my first Hate raid, but I couldnt get a Soul Leech to save my life until recently... but No more Fear Raids for the ogre now unless they are guild ones. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I really love playing this game, and interacting with all the people I have met.  I love this guild, the things we can do, and the potential we have as a guild.  I love playing Gahhl so much I actually dont have any other characters other than a lvl one mule i use for transferring stuff for people on occasion.  anyways, thats Gahhls history in a nutshell.<br>

<br>
Mullzy is a name I have used in various games since around 1993 when it became my RL nickname.  It is a play on my last name which has most of the same letters - and apparently you need a nickname in high school basketball, so I got one too.<br>
<br>
Mullzy's first MMORPG was Ultima Online (/shudder) which I started playing VERY late in that games existance.  I started Mullzy up in May of 2000 when I moved to place with a better internet connection.  I played UO every time I could for about 3 months and hated it in the end.  I was trying to be a blacksmith/warrior (like everyone else) and my stupid pack mule kept getting stuck on the server line/zone crossing outside the mine.  I would spend as much time trying to get him through that damn zoneline as making anything.  /rude UO<br>
<br>
An RL friend introduced me to EQ in July of 2000.  You know him today as the Enchanter - Jabnael, but back then he was the level 17 Human Monk named Zeddy.  I started a Shaman because we thought that a monk/shaman duo would be a good combination for touring around Norrath and kicking some arse.<br>
<br>
So Mullzy was born again to the MMORPG world on July 31, 2000.  I did a LOT of reading up on how to play a shaman (when trying to decide if that is what I wanted to play) and took forever to get to level 20.  I adventured in Halas until around level 15, and then started heading into the Karanas.  I usually grouped with Zeddy, who had now started Jabnael, whenever we could and picked up a couple extra people to do whatever we were up to.  In our little encounters (usually trying to charm/solo mobs in the Karanas) Jabnael died ALOT while my better ac and hps allowed me to zone most of the time.  CR was a HUGE deal back then lol... =)<br>
<br>
The biggest thing about starting a first character in Halas is that you have NO IDEA what an exp camp is.  Everything wanders around out in the plains and the goblin camps all have really long spawn times.  Nothing like the Derv/Orc camps exists in Everfrost and mobs are few and far between.<br>
<br>
My gear at this point was a full set of Banded, Ebon War Spear, Totemic Boots (highlight of my EQ career to this point as I quested them at 19) and various newb stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I joined the &lt;Pearl Fellowship&gt; at level 15 as they had simply the nicest looking website around.<br>
<br>
Level 20... this was a huge step.  I came to LOIO and was simply overwhelmed by the playing style change in real exp groups.  I think I made 30 in 2 weeks (I only played a couple hours a night back then) and was simply loving it.  Dalnir still has a special place in my heart as the first real dungeon I entered... I still love nothing better than being the only group in a deserted dugeon that is VERY hard, if not impossible to zone out of.  Fight or Die!<br>
<br>
It was sometime around now that I figured out what slow and sitting on my butt were all about.  As I had never played a melee based character I assumed that the damage I was dealing out with my spear was not bad.  I think I learned how wrong I was when my cousin spent a weekend with me and wanted to start a character.  His totally nekkid, rusty sword toting, dorf warrior was doing more damage than me by level 10 (I was 35ish at the time)... I started meditating and healing a lot more after that little lesson lol.<br>
<br>
The 30 to 34ish - Dalnir, 35-39 Overthere, 40-46ish Dreadlands, 47-49 City of Mist, 50+ Any dungeon I can get a group in.  From 30 to 50 I would generally exp for a couple weeks and then spend 3 or 4 days doing some quests.  I did all the totemic quests except for the BP along with starting work on tradeskills.  Even now I take some time and do quests when I get burnt out on exping.<br>
<br>
The Pearl Fellowship was teamed up with Amorphous Order and Sword of Fate back then in terms of raiding the planes - but I wasn't able to do my first Hate raid with them.  I went on a raid with Alliance of the Griffin and pulled in Legs, Helm, Arms and Boots as the only other shammy there just go his BP as his last piece.  You could say I was freaking out every time a golem was pulled. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I started my epic around 44 when I found out I could do a lot of the first part solo.  Doing quests has always been a really fun part of the game because usually it is something you do on your own.  I finished everything except for 3 steps by 47 (Kirn, Tear from Fear and final CoM encounter) and have been patiently waiting since (I think that was around March of this year).<br>
<br>
That pretty much brings us up to now.  The Pearl Fellowship began to split as the 3 guild alliance became shaky and people went in different directions.  Talk of a new guild got me very interested as I was ready to do more than just sit in groups and get exp.  IV has been a really sweet deal although sometimes generating a lot of extra work too (darn guild banks).  I hope to hit 60 with Mullzy and continue to enjoy the new things that we will be able to do as a guild.<br>
<br>
I had always tried to keep my tradeskills moving between exp sessions... so when velious was released I think I already had over 100 in my tailoring skill.  A couple of us starting pushing each other to increase tailoring and reported in daily with our new totals.  I raced from 115 (old max) to 162 and was simply burnt from all the darn farming that is required.  /rude tailoring<br>
<br>
My twinks are Jriton (31 warrior atm) and Jrilon (someday super rogue who might be remade as a gnome before I starting playing him hardcore.)  I plan on splitting Mullzy to a different account so that I can get my warrior and rogue to 45+ as soon as possible.<br>
<br>

I started playing Eq sometime in the middle of 1998 I believe. Before Eq, my only experience with online gaming was Neverwinter nights on AOL. My very first character on Eq was a High Elf Wizzard, which didnt last through lvl 4.  next was a chanter that I think made it to lvl 8.  The Original &quot;shadowfall&quot; was borne and i quickly found that i really enjoyed the shadowknight class. Unfortunaltely &quot;Shadowfall&quot; was lost in a misshap in befallen at lvl 15.  Which brings us to Shadowfal.  I spent the usual 1-5 around freeport. from there moved to the commons.  at lvl 18 or so i went to the oasis and kill crocs and deepwater gobblin pets. Also part of that time was in hh killing orcs, and then pickcalws in the basement of hh keep.  at around 25 i went to the karanas and kill treants.  Fast xp and good loot i must say. At 30 I went to cazic thule. I like that dungeon.  Althought at the same time i kind of hate it.  I managed to obtain all the decayed for my darkforge by lvl 33.  I still hung around cazic for a while. I think I was almost 39 by the time i left there.  I learned a lot in cazic about groups, which for the first time in my eq experience became organized. I had soloed a lot before then.  I learned how to pull quite well there actually. While in Cazic for all those lvls i was recruited into The protectors of the Eternal flame. this was my first guild experience, and well it was somewhat disappointing. The guild started a major campain to expand after the original leader left. The personality of the guild changed so i contemplated leaving.  I headed over to SOLB about that time.  I had lvled to about 45 when one nite i met some people in the circle room.  Sol b was packed and the lists were overflowing with tanks. These people turned out to Be Leiflen, Steren, Izaiah, and i think Arktanis poked his head in for a bit. Leif extened me an invitation into their group.  That had to be one of the best groups i have ever been in.  I had a blast.  I went away that nite and made the decision to Quit the protectors.  I stayed unguilded for a few weeks, and then decided to apply to the Dragonknights Council for membership.  I went though the Squireship, Squired to a Paladin I might add.  Arktanis, I miss you my friend. I hope you are well.   <br>
    I lvled to 50 in SolB and ouside groups at Karanors then decided to move on. About this time my work and family life began to put a damper on Eq.  I could only play sporaticly and usually only a couple of hours at a time.  Still I managed to make it to a few plane raids, but most i missed.  My play time situation hasnt changes as of yet.  At 50 I went to Timorous and killed spirocs till 53. From there its been Wyvers in CS till 54.  <br>
  Equipment to date: Umbral wilth a Darkforge helm, gauntlets of the black, and BE vambraces.  Cloak of shadows, thanks to Arktanis.  Circlet of shadows, again thanks to Arktanis.  Rygorr Neckguard. Sarnak earing of station.  that earing off the cats in Iceclad [sorry forget its name atm]. Crested spaulders.  Moss.  Chitin shell shield. Velum Claidmore. <br>
       I am not to sure what is next for Shadow. I have come to sort of an impass. I guess only time will tell.  <br>

 Shadowfal <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ushadowfal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowfal</A> at: 9/5/01 4:01:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/umorkenlar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morkenlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Councilman</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/8/01 10:47:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Character History</span><hr size=1> Wow, nice posts.<br>
<br>
Mork started as my primary, on day 2 or 3 of the server.  Myself, and several RL friends started at the same time, and I made a cleric because, well, everyone else was a melee or nuker, and we needed one.  (little did I expect how truly important clerics were back then).<br>
<br>
I started in qeynos (do people even start there anymore?), and quickly earned the rep as the person that could get lost faster than anyone else.  I think Saryon (doesn't play anymore) and Herne got my corpses out of Blackburrow more times than I can count.<br>
<br>
My first dungeon forray other than BB was a TOTAL disaster.  I went with a monk friend we were 14ish, I think) and we went exploring Runney Eye, and we had the misfortune to be maybe 5 minutes behind a higher level group - so nothing was up, and we simply kept wandering.  Little did I notice how many stairs we'd gone down, til we opened the door and met the king.  We died fast, and were completely unable to do CR (and I had just spent all my hard won cash and had been UBER in my full suit of banded!).<br>
<br>
After this, I did the normal wandering, oasis, lake rathe (I lived at the arena spawn for a while - I hadn't yet figured grouping out, lol), then SK, Mistmoore, where I figured grouping out finally.  Then I discovered Cazic Thule, and lived there til around 35, when I reached the holy grail of not having to stare at the spell book.  I then moved to lower guk, and REALLY liked it there, though I had to bind at the dead side zonein, cuz I never could find my way through upper guk . . .<br>
<br>
At 46, I started raiding (fear much more than hate, but hey, it was all pickup stuff for me, I was the high level person in a small guild.  Besides, if you wanna learn how CR works, do a lot of pickup fear raids, lol).  Did my first fear raid with Darkikon, back when he was in the Birds of Prey.  XP from 46-51 was all soloing specs in oasis, as I wanted a change of pace from lower guk . . . did ALL of 51 in hate/fear (don't ask how long THAT took!).  AT 52 I found Karnor, and promptly went broke spending money on stones . .  then around 52.5 I found Sebilis, and promptly moved in.<br>
<br>
Did every pickup raid I could, and was prolly on every RB/SoD (and later, AFI) raid that happened . . . then Raptus was formed, and raiding got better/easier.  Got my epic in here, around level 57/58.   Added to the alliance so we could do VS for ranger and druid epics (back when VS dropped them) and things were pretty good, despite some bumps in the road . . . then we had the big break with SoF, and shortly thereafter we merged the alliance guilds into IV . . . been happy ever since.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You all know the story from that point . . . I made 60 in IV (and CLEARLY remember Jaha yelling, wanting to know who dispelled him and why, when I memed and cast aego on him w/o saying I had dinged). <p>

<br>
It all started when almost all my RL friends disappeared.  I still saw them at work, or at the occasional party, but other than that, they'd dropped off the face of the earth to play EQ.  Being the sensible person I am, I decided that there was no way I was gonna get sucked into that.<br>
<br>
Then my girlfriend at the time started playing.  And the last couple of RL friends who weren't already playing started.  And I realized I wasn't ever going to speak to anyone again unless I started too.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, Derrien (who should have been Darian, but it was taken, and is an old character from my free-form RP days) wandered out of Freeport, found his pals, and they began a reign of terror from Freeport to the edge of Kithicor.  We were actually going to form a guild ourselves, but we were just too chaotic to get it organized.  Around the time we moved on to Highpass to become the orcs' personal nightmare, we sort of drifted apart in-game as several of my friends decided they weren't thrilled with their original character selections and started over... but I was happy with my meat shield, and I'd made some friends there during the drive from 15-21 at Highpass, so I stuck it out.  So, Scuffles and Shinazazi and I moved on into High Keep, where disaster struck:  Derrien met Angelicos.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After 12 levels worth of goblin slaughter, several of which involving Angel and I verbally abusing the intellectually-challenged majority of the HK denizens (and annoying the non-challenged minority), I decided it was time to wander.  Didn't do me much good experience-wise, but it was a turning point nonetheless.  I'd decided after the original &quot;start our own guild&quot; thing fell apart that I was going to remain unguilded until I found The Right Guild... one that I could reasonably say I wouldn't regret joining.  After meeting some of Angel's buds, I decided I'd found it, and to my surprise, all I had to do was ask, and boom, I was a Boar.<br>
<br>
Wackiness ensued, and the next several months were spent plugging away at levels, raiding the mid-level dungeons, and getting suckered into becoming an officer.  Fortunately for the Boars, when it comes to those things, I'm anal-retentive enough to have gotten lots of things better-organized than they were; unfortunately for me, I placed too much responsibility on myself... levelling slowed down, and I was spending so much time helping other people that the level-to-equipment ratio was becoming dangerously out-of-whack.  Derrien's first plane raid found him carrying a Yak and a Dragoon Dirk... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is what happens to people who don't care about loot.  Mind you, it didn't really bother me any, but BA was beside himself.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Shortly after that, though, real-life concerns forced me into a bad position. I got transferred into a new department, which meant I could no longer rely on my position as the Old Guard Guru Who Everyone Comes to for Answers, and therefore had to focus my attention on work.  I'd put on 25 pounds sitting on my can playing EQ all the time, and that simply wasn't acceptable.  So, in January, I took what was originally going to be a month's break... and I ended up not coming back, because the layoff scare was in full force as the tech market plummeted.  So, although I knew about the merger, I wasn't around to change the guild tag when it happened...<br>
<br>
The last layoffs, however, were followed a day later by annual reviews, and I realized I wasn't in any danger after all.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I decided it was time to come back.  And since being an officer of a still-somehow existing guild with no active members didn't seem very entertaining... here I am, finally, much to the joy of at least a few people, and probably to the annoyance of the rest...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I started playing EQ in November of 99. At the time, my friend Dandainm (who was a druid in his mid 30s when I started, and RL friend) got me playing. He still plays today, and is in this guild as his &quot;new&quot; main character, Tuuan, the 59 Necro.<br>
<br>
He helped me along, giving me stuff here and there so I could live as a true, newbie, pos ranger. He even got me /guildinvited to the Raging Boars, back when they had all the people that moved on to Unity (Uberwolf, Nytfall, Maelios, Gixon, Mabey, Beralt, Tuco/Tuko, and a few others). Hehe, I remeber getting offended the first time I met Shaka, when he asked me &quot;who's twink are you?&quot; - I didn't realize he was just making conversation....I thought he was calling me a rude name /LOL<br>
I also remember Wendanya giving me a Trueshot bow at level 5. I also remember the tragic horror I felt when I lost it. I was level 5, hunting in Qeynos Hills.....got killed while going LD, and then the Server crashed. After waiting like 2 hours for it to come back up (which it didn't), I had to log for bed. When I logged in the next day to do CR, all my stuff was gone. I didn't realize the 1/2 hour pre-level 5 corpse rot rule /cry.<br>
<br>
Anyways, enough digressing. I then worked my way through levels as a Boar for as long as I remember. I became close with Aluron (Then GM of the Boars), Angelicos, Ravon, Arcite, Walker, Jammall, Cantaro (now Niivag), and a few others. Many of us would hang together, and I would often lead mid-level raids for the guild. I eventually became an officer, and worked to try to get many of the mid-level guildies things they needed, and lead raids for fun and loot. Ahh the good old days.<br>
<br>
Then I got into my Plane's capable days. I remember my first Fear raid vividly. I was so scared, I could hardly move when we charged that portal. I also remember many LONG hours of CR in that accursed zone....and the rewards that seemed so uber at the time, yet were so few and far between (/finger Verant for your crappy drop to mob ratio).<br>
<br>
Then I met a lot of DKC folks, and we formed an alliance. That was fun, because I think both guilds were forming at about the same pace, and we kind of worked our ways through our late 40s, early 50s together. We then formed what our current guild is with all of you from the other guilds.<br>
<br>
This tale I am living out behind this glass screen has been a rocky travel for sure, with its ups and downs, but it becomes more and more paved every day.....It also has no ending....yet......so until the rest is written......<br>

<br>
I started playing February, 14, 1999 ... to alleviate the pain of getting dumped.  So I got EQ (since I didn't have any friends around to play AD&amp;D, this was the next best thing).  Started out with a Human ranger.  Didn't know any better.  Started out at Surefall Glade.  and I was getting frustrated, I didn't know anything and there was never anyone around.  So erased him, and made a  Wood Elf ranger, known as Lachlann.  So there I was, playing the ranger, really having a good time. I wandered around for quite a while, not really knowing what was happening.  I finally somehow found my way to freeport, started fighting in the East Commons.  Whats a bind?  At that time, I didn't know... So a lot of CR via the boat to freeport and someone was nice enough to tell me.  I worked him up to I dunno, around level 20 or so, and I met Izaiah and someone else whos name I won't mention.  They were in a guild.  what a neat concept.   They dragged me to a meeting, and I met Leiflen, Delara, Dandaelus, Frostdog, etc there.  Through a series of mishaps and bad connections, it took me forever to get into the guild.  I did my little test in Runnyeye to pass the guild's Test of Leadership.  We all bound in Rivervale and set out for the fabled Blackened Iron Bastard Sword.  5 minutes into our first go, wipeout.  I was a little upset.  So we went back again, and we camped that sucker for 4 hours.  Was getting late, the guy had not popped, and we were all tired.   So we left.  Went to the next guild meeting, Leiflen said I passed, as the test was for leading, not for a sword.  And then I was invited to join the Dragonknights Council.  At my knighting, I was given the BIBS.  Sadistic guildleader of mine got it right before we went in there!  I also recall Menoldar being down there as well. <br>
<br>
So time went on, had a great time with the guild.<br>
Filled out my inventory with Banded armor!  woohoo!  Then we went and got me my ivy etched bracers.  And did some other stuff... like camping the Ghoulbane for our Paladins.  That was always a blast.<br>
<br>
Then we were short on porters.  Steren and Leiflen's druid were always being swamped for ports.   So Tearloch was born.  I leveled the hell out of him to get to 29 (usually about 5-10 levels a day).  And he became my main character, I enjoyed the freedom and the ability to run real fast, which was a new concept.<br>
<br>
Then I met a few Boars, we did raids.  We grew up enough to do planes raids.  Friendships formed, alliances established.  I felt that the Boars were like my second home.   the Dragonknights got bigger, I was made an officer.<br>
<br>
Then Leiflen mentioned to me about reforming a guild with the Boars and a bunch of other guilds who I didn't really know.  I thought it was neat, we can do anything on Norrath just about (which has proved pretty true so far)<br>
<br>
After that...its all history.  Infinitus Vindicat was born.  And its changed my whole view of the game now.  Instead of stagnation without being able to do new things that the &quot;big&quot; guilds did...the world opened up once I got that guild invite.  Planes raids, with only the guild, Dragon raids.  Misc &quot;we're bored&quot; raids.  Impromptu &quot;lets go make Talendor dead&quot; raids.  Its a whole lot of fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

However, the economy and the guild mentality on Mith Marr left a lot to be desired (Ever play on a server with constant guild wars?) Thus, on July 25, 1999 Burrn Firrestorrm of Prexus was born, along with Toan Deaf the Distraction, can't call him a twink when both are level 1?<br>
<br>
I would normally log in Burrn until someone showed up on the friends list.  Would then arrange to meet up somewhere and log in Toan for some group action.  Over time, the friends list was replaced with the formation of Raging Boars.  Won't even go into the challenges we had getting all ten (there were only ten for a looong time) of us on for the period of time it took, then the whole Prexus guild problems they had, forcing us to do it all again...<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the small group quickly spread in levels due to the fact that some played 2 hours a day, others 8 hours a day.  From the need to have groups, we opened our guild to the people we were grouping with.  Before you know it, Boars was a sizable guild, but no true &quot;structure&quot;. Boars just had a global shout channel called /guildsay.  Able to do minor raids, but unable to do plane level raids became frustrating to people and problems arose that just made it easier to join some other guild and follow along with the Phat Lewtz crowd.<br>
<br>
That cycle repeated a few times and was about to repeat again earlier this year when in a bold new idea, instead of just jumping to another guild, why not join up with a couple other guilds that would make us big enough to satisfy the &quot;High End&quot; game, without leaving behind the &quot;slow levelers&quot; like that damn Burrn (What?  Level 54 with 128 days played? What have you been doing?  *meditate*)<br>
<br>
So now, I proudly were the &lt;Infinitus Vindicat&gt; over my head and will continue to until you kick me out!  And I won't go quietly I say! *foams at the mouth*  BWHAHAHAHAHA!<br>
<br>
/sigh Sirran seem to be the only one who understands me.<br>
<br>
*mumbles something about rabbits*<br>

Well at level 20 i went to loi and soloed there till about 30 at which point i went to fm and hunted giants till about 32.

<br>
Denzil my main is I guess about 8months old now, and some friends at work convinced me to join. And every since I started I've had either &quot;Welfare Case&quot; or &quot;Loser&quot; on my forhead... let me explain a bit more...<br>
<br>
My first memory was bats in Gfay, after getting to level 2, I had finally managed to buy Strike, thats when I met Cutnell a Vicar in La Catena, who informed me that I had distruted my stats wrong. He convinced me to restart, and gave me 25 plat to help with my spells.(And so the Welfare begins)<br>
<br>
My friends at work gave me some newbie gear nothing special but I was able to solo orcs until level 8 and then I tried crushbone.... while in crush bone late one night a warriro who I can't remember gave me all the componets for a Screaming mace. This was right around the time I learned that Crushbone just wasn't safe, so I took off to EC. Well asside from the lousy spam EC seemed pretty cool. This was around the time I got to about level 12 fighting Orcs, then progressed to dervs, right around here my friends did a nother &quot;Installment of Welfare ness (Aka twink)&quot; and managed to get my wis to 170 by level 13.<br>
<br>
So everyone assuming I knew what I was doing, I was often asked for groups, at around 14 it was off to Oasis, and from there to LOIO.<br>
<br>
Here I met a twinked monk up on the hill outside the skele hut. Now this twinked monk had a Powerful Chanter main, and decided he wanted an FBSS. So I held the FBSS for this gentleman who in turn gave me a +7 wis ring (That was the bomb back then. (You remember that at all Jabnael?)<br>
<br>
Well Lake held me till about 30, from there it was off to OT (The rest of the group of friends where very twinked), well another friend from my M.U.D. Days on Shadowdale had some equip to give me, and low and behold I had 200 wis.<br>
<br>
Now from there it turns into a blur of people giving me stuff.  We spent alot of time in OT which sucked butt (I still don't like walking through that zone) which progressed into DL. In DL my leveling slowed right down, till all my friends were several levels higher. But then came KC..... KC not only caught me up I passed all my group.<br>
<br>
But in the end, now at level 52 I've been able to stand on my own to feet. Given back some loaned items, I'm actually starting to make money instead of asking for it. <br>
<br>
I have decided to go out on my own, away from my good friends I started with, to try and get off of thier &quot;Coat Tails&quot;<br>
<br>
But because of thier excellent start in training me how to play a cleric.... &quot;SIT DAMN YOU.... Don't you DARE swing that mace.... DAMNIT SOMEONE GET THIS BOY 2 Books and tell him he's a warrior&quot; even though I may be self sufficient now, it was thanks to all those wonderful people for helping me.<br>
<br>
Now I've gone on some raids with IV.. (Sure you guys have heard of them :P ) and I've discovered a whole new world of the game I never knew existed... <br>

My first character was a Mage - Kramaknord.  I played him for quite a while about 6 months I guess.  Got him up to 35 or so.  Then I conned my wife into playing and I reccomended she started a druid cuz I was tired of spending all my money on ports!  And I liked the whole idea of out running mobs with SoW.  And making money porting people, lord knows I had shelled out enough!<br>
<br>
Anyhow she started the druid and I Pled her up to about 35 or so best I could with a mage.  Around that time we joined Lords of Honor.  I found my self taking over her char a lot and just fell in love with the druid class.  I could actually solo!  My wife was not pleased to say the least.  And @ that time was constantly harrassing me about the ammount of time I spent playing EQ and on her character!  <br>

One night I got tired of the constant comments and the time I was dumping into EQ, Mehl (The Druid, we were playing) was about 45 @ this time, and gave away all the gear I had on both chars and DELEATED them.  I removed EQ from my puters and vowed to be done with it.<br>
<br>
Haha needless to say time ticked on and both my wife and I regretted that we did that as we were itching to play constantly.  So what did I do?  Lol you guessed it!  $500 later and I'm back on with a new druid.  Luckily this druid came with some god gear and a good rep and I had been able to grab him @ the same level 45.  <br>
<br>
I remember my first Plane raid when I told Backalley hey (forget name) said I could come to hate with you guys.  He was reluctant @ first but finally let me come.  In the LAST port group up.  But I remember that night being so much fun, we killed Inny and I became a member of Raging Boars!<br>
<br>
Around 52 I was having a real hard time figuring out where I could solo and get decent exp.  I bumped into walker @ BB portal and introduced my self as I hadn't really talked to him prior to that.  I asked him what he was up to and he said he was getting ready to kite raptors in TD.   I had tried on my own to kite the raptor prior to that and managed to train the folks @ ss and take a death with out a rez a couple of times.  Walker said &quot;Ill take ya and show you the ropes&quot;  I was in heaven.  And Walker was and has been the most helpfull person I know in this game.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, finally I could quad and was getting massive amounts of exp.  Unfortunately around that time alot of other folks were hearing about the raptors and I managed to get trained a few times as I had trained the SS when I had been exploring.  I got tired of dying and loosing exp @ Raptors in Tim Deep but I could finnaly see the light to 60 because I could actually see my exp bar moving.  So I spawned Bababo.  PLed him to 49 and camped him there @ raptor camp.<br>
<br>
Around 57 moved to CS and discoverd Otters!  Hello 60!  Hmm what do I do now?  Teek was born..<br>

Mnilin - I knew the original and kinda wondered when I found out you got Teek to 60 in 13 days if you were the original, he wasn't quite that determined a player.  Question, does your wife still play? <p><center>

She pretty much wants to do everything on her own. <p><center>

He was a total EQ addict. If you can't beat em...join em. I was afraid to play at first, and he sat next to me and I learned. First Character I made was Pytch...my bard. I had fun with her, and learned how to weave  4 songs while Meleeing. I lvl'd Pytch by request from 1 -49 in about a month and a half, so that she would be able to do raids with my then guild Ebon Claw. After Pytch got to lvl 52, I parked her. Got discouraged. I began Faeline, and HATED her from the beginning...lol. After sometime, and easy groupage, I learned to love her. Shes lvl 55 now, and soon will be lvl 56. Shes so close to her epic I can taste it. I pride myself on being the best cleric I can be. I created Steamy Enhott my Barbarian Warrior, because I seemed to be getting a lot of armor through Randoms for warriors. Now Steamy is lvl 30, and is tough, I hope to make her a powerful and useful warrior for IV. And then theres Dealya...my lvl 9 Chanter. Who knows when she will grow up...maybe after I get Steamy to 55?...lol<br>

Nanelane, Nanelane, Nanelane. I have had quite a history. I began in the early June of '99. It must have been one of the first days of prexus, cause i think prexus opened like June 9th. I started quite early, despite my lvl, for it took me a long time to discover who Nanelane really was. Nanelane started as a human mage. I put a lot of points into str and was known as the tanking mage, until I was about lvl 16. I lost my corpse and quit for a couple months.<br>
 <br>
I began playing again once some of my RL friends began playing, from my influence. The first was Jubeii. He has quite a history behind him too. After that came Kemian to the game. Once I restarted playing, I became Nanelane the human monk. I worked my way up to about lvl 20, I decided to stop being a monk. At that time monks were probably one of the weakest and worst classes. I then began a time where I could not find myself.<br>
<br>
I wanted to be a SK, and tried a troll SK. I stopped, and began Nanelina the enchanter(i still have her, but never use her). I got to about lvl 12, and started a troll SK again. I stopped once again, and became Nanelane the DE SK. In my fledgling days I was in a guild called Minion of Naofa Darkness. I was in there for a while, until I eventually left. I stayed guildless for a long time. I went by, day by day, leveling, and this was still in the days of the huge hybrid xp penalty. At this time Kemian was already in Raging Boars. More and more time passed. In my mid 40s I finally joined Raging Boars. I was in there for a while and we merged becoming IV. I leveled, made friends and gained power, and thats where I am today.<br>
