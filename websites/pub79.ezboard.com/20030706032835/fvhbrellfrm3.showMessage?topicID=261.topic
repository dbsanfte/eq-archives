For months she had been out on her journey, finding a new person, a re-newel of her soul. No one in the Harvest has been informed of her plans; she simply packed up her supplies and went out on her way. Traveling with her favorite water elemental Gekn, she saw the many wonders of Norrath. One of her favorite activities was to go view the waterfall in High Pass. None of the guards would bother her there because they knew their power was no match for a magician of the 57th year. Tenzing also always took care of the orc inhabitants when she would visit. It was a bit of a mesmerizing site, the water falling over the rocks, a never-ending cycle. A few days of working on her trade skills and she was off again on her journey. She went up to the frozen lands of Ever Frost and viewed the ancient statues of the powers that once inhabited the area. Nothing really stood in her way, she killed what ever opposed her, leaving nothing but dead bodies behind her. Month after month passed, and still Tenzing did not find her true self, something just wasn’t working. One day Tenzing went back to get her revenge on the Erudite who had injured her in her 12th year. Apparently she had felt her powers had enabled her to believe she could take the Erudite. She was wrong, Tenzing’s powers were still nowhere near the power of that one Erudite, and she was slain. Her body was burned until nothing remained, not even ash. The light had diminished in Tenzing’s life; the after life awaited her....<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Walking through the streets of Neriak gasp after gasp went up. Some residents fainted. A familiar figure wearing a red robe was walking casually through the town. Tenzing had returned to her home, alive. She passed Vresk, and he tried to stop her and talk to her, but she continued walking.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are dead, how can you be here? Where are you going Tenzing, hey sstop and talk to me.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tenzing continued on, and another member of the harvest saw her. It was Daiunus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tenzing! It can’t be true. You can’t be the real Tenzing, who are you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stopped and looked over at Daiunus. She took off something from her neck and tossed it over to him, cracking a small smile. She walked on more. Vresk ran over to Daiunus. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What, what iss it?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Its Tenzing, this is Tsneria’s symbol. I was there with Tenzing when we slaughtered Tsneria, and Tenzing removed this from her neck and made it her own. Lets follow her.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tenzing stopped in at the Blind Fish, her favorite watering hole. Inside was Vinar, relaxing at the bar with some ginesh. Finding a nice spot on the floor by the window, Tenzing takes out some of her Egg Nog XXX and sits down.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alright Tenzing, what happened?” Daiunus threw down the symbol back to Tenzing, she put it on as Daiunus waited for a reply. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I decided to go out and find myself, but you don’t want to hear about that. “Well, I’m sure you all heard that I died.” The group all motioned they had heard. Well, it is true; I did meet my demise at the hands of that damn Erudite. I figured by now I had gained enough knowledge, and power to avenge my injury. I was wrong though, my pet was dead and seconds, and I followed shortly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where have you been thiss whole time?” You could have at leasst told us where you were going-<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tenzing quickly interrupted Vresk. Quiet! I’m not done talking yet. Vresk quickly got up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How dare you talk to me like that. Who do you think you are? Get up right now, no one talkss to me like that. Tenzing looked up and nodded her head at something behind Vresk. Vresk suddenly felt a cold breath upon the back of his neck. Tenzing’s air elemental was directly behind Vresk waiting to strike on Tenzing’s command.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sit down Vresk, I did not mean to insult you, but I will kill you if I have to.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, if you didn’t mean to then perhapss we shouldn’t let thiss get violent. So I will let thiss it go thiss time. Continue Tenzing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Anyway, I was sent to the after life. Since I pledge allegiance to no god I was sent to a sort of purgatory, an enormous white oblivion. I was stay there for all eternity, but with the help of Vinar, I was able to cheat death. Vinar had taught me the art of leaving my essence behind, in a place of my choosing. I chose on leaving it buried under a rock in Nektulos, there, nothing would happen to it. After I died Vinar felt my passing, and went to the spot. He uncovered the rock and dug down a few feet into the ground, there my essence was preserved in a glowing piece of onyx. From that Vinar took out the onyx and placed it near the hole on the ground. Using his mastery of the arcane magic he brought me back to life as I appeared out from the onyx, back to my full power. And here I am today.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why would Vinar do this for you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She saved my life once, I owed her something, and she asked me about the art of Wizard preservation. I showed her how to do it and saved her life, and now my favor is repaid.” Vinar turned around and ordered another ginesh at the bar. Tenzing got up and brushed off her robe. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, spread the word, Tenzing is back, and just as powerful as ever. As Tenzing started out the door, Daiunus spoke up to stop her<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tenzing, did you find yourself out there?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, and I learned that where I belong is here. Farewell all, be seeing you.<br>
<br>
