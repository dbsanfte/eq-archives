The trees rustled lightly in the breeze, still sprinking fat drops of water from their leaves. Xilau ignored it all, her concentration focused in the clearing ahead of her. She squatted behind a tree with her whip in hand, watching the ongoings of the small camp in front of her. Two adult Koada'dal were feeding a small campfire with the few fallen branches they could find that were still dry. The female huddled uncomfortably on a rock, wrapped tight in her cloak and robes.<br>
<br>
The warrioress shifted slightly and glanced around at the campsite. The male had his back to her, bent over the small woodpile he'd collected. Tempting as it was, she resisted the urge to drive her dirk into his backside as he collected wood from the pile. Instead, she checked the surrounding area of the clearing. This area was rather removed from the main intruding party of Koada'dal near the portal. The Indigo Brotherhood sent out regular scouting parties to try to clean the area of the paleskinned elves, but they seemed determined to keep intruding on the Teir'dal homeland. The two before her must be replacements. Xilau wondered why the Koada'dal were so bent on wandering the forest here when they had an entire continent of their own to live their petty little lives on. Between the halflings and the humans who'd raided the far side of Nektulos, and the Koada'dal that attacked her people on this side, the Teir'dal had to keep constant watches set up throughout the forest. The Council was determined to learn what the purpose of all the invasions were, but Xilau didn't care much for politics. She hated the Koada'dal, especially those who invaded her homeland. <br>
<br>
She had already vowed that these two would not leave this clearing alive.<br>
<br>
Silently, she placed her whip on the ground and drew the long staff from it's place at her back. Picking up the whip in her free hand, the warrioress half stood and stalked catlike around the clearing, still behind the trees. She got to the far side and watched the male. He was feeding the small campfire now.<br>
<br>
Xilau shot out of the trees and planted a foot firmly in the male High Elf's rump, sending him sprawling into the fire. The female stood and began casting a spell. Xilau snapped her staff around, smashing the butt of it into the female's face. The female reeled back, and Xilau kicked her hard in the stomach, knocking her over the rock and disrupting the spell. Hearing a curse behind her, Xilau spun about. The male Elf had rolled out of the fire, singed and muddied. With a battle cry, Xilau snapped her whip out at him. The barbed tip snapped at his chest, and he cried out in pain as the weapon drew a bit of his life force, feeding it to Xilau. She grinned broadly and snapped the whip again. He stumbled backward, trying to get out of range of the weapon and prepare a spell. She chased him in her half crouch, enjoying the game. She was about to clock him with the staff when the explosion hit.<br>
<br>
The female! In her excitement, Xilau had forgotten the other elf. Gasping for breath, she struggled quickly to her feet and turned about. Now both of them were casting, and she had to dodge quickly about the camp area to keep from getting hit again. She managed to snap her whip out at the female again and disrupt her casting as she zoomed by, but the male light elf got his spell off and Xilau was scorched again. She knew she was in trouble.<br>
<br>
An arrow shot suddenly shot out of the trees and planted itself firmly in the male High Elf's chest. He staggered, and went to one knee, gasping in disbelief. Xilau instantly focused her attention on the female again, using both the whip and staff to drive her back. She snapped the staff about once, twice, three times into the female's face, crushing her nose and splatting blood everywhere. The whip snapped out again as the female stumbled, catching her squarely in the throat and tearing a coin sized hole into her windpipe. Xilau stepped back a couple of paces and watched as the female went down on both knees, cluching her thoat and making a sickly gurgling noise.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a young one to be out killing mages.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau spun about. A male Tier'dal stood on the far side of the fire, casually plucking the arrow out of the now dead light elf's chest. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Long enough to see that you would have been killed had I not intervened. Did your guildmasters not warn you about these pale elves?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They did. but there were only two, and I thought-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That was your first mistake,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;Never underestimate your opponent, now matter how frail or ignorant they appear to be. These were mages, both of them. They might appear to be an easy kill, but they have spells that pack considerable power.&quot;<br>
<br>
She remained silent, pondering his words. He was right, she had underestimated the Koada'dal pair. Facing off against one of them she would have been fine, but two was too much, obviously. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said at length. &quot;Who are you, anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled warmly and bowed. &quot;I am Xareth, of the House K'Thalion in Neriak.&quot; He stood again, and this time she spotted an insignia on the breast of his armor. She wanted a closer look, but didn't want to seem overly curious. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well met, Xareth. I am Xilau, a common soldier of the Indigo Brotherhood. They've allowed me to leave the city to get some firsthand experience in battle, and I wanted to test my skill.&quot; She kept her voice passive. &quot;It seems I still need to train harder before I go against these wretched lightborne.&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed. &quot;You are honest in admitting your shortcomings. That is an admirable trait. Many of the Teir'dal would have pretended that they knew what they were doing, whether they did or not.&quot; He put away his bow and gazed at Xilau. She tried to not look uncomforable, but it must have clearly shown, because he gave her an impish grin. &quot;Relax, young warrior. I see potential in you that the Indigo Brotherhood may not see. I seek an apprentice, and you would clearly fit the tasks I would teach, should you be willing to take on the responsibility.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau watched him warily. &quot;What... sort of tasks?&quot;<br>
<br>
He waved a hand distractedly. &quot;Nothing that would not be an honor to learn, I assure you. You hate the High elves, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
She almost snarled, but held herself in check. &quot;Yes! they invade our home, and attack our people in our own forest! They have killed several trainees so far, and-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Xareth interrupted. &quot;Yes, I see your Hatred quite plainly. It needs a bit of shaping and molding, and I can teach you how to focus it against your enemies to make you more powerful. Unless.... you perhaps do not follow the Father?&quot; He raised an eyebrow inquiringly.<br>
<br>
This time it was Xilau who laughed. &quot;Of course I serve the Father! Any respectable warrior of Neriak does, even if the Queen thinks we do not. I believe that if all our armed forces were shadowknights and necromancers like the Queen wishes, Neriak would fall to even so weak an enemy as the Feir'dal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Then I wish to train you in the ways of Hatred. Teach you to focus that Hatred and make it grow. Many of my guildmates would be more than willing to aid in that department should I ask. I will also train you to be a leader.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau blinked. A leader? She had no wish to replace the guildmasters of the Indigo Brotherhood, if that was what he was implying. Still, she was intrigued. Then something occured to her. &quot;Your guild? Don't you belong to the Indigo Brotherhood? You're a fellow warrior, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
He did that impish smile again. &quot;Of course I do. come with me, and I will explain on the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
She briefly considered declining, then thought against it and followed him through the trees. After all, she could still decline his offer, since she hadn't agreed to anything yet.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Xilau learned a great deal on the trip to Neriak. Xareth turned out to be a member of the Violent Harvest, a respected guild of Neriak and devout to the ways of Innorruuk. He told her stories of adventures he'd had, both alone and with members of his guild. He told of far off lands, and she listened intently when he told her about Faydwer, where he'd hunted Fier'dal in a forest near the elven cities there. there were tales of almost every place that was known, including the various excursions he'd had on Luclin. She found it all fascinating, and resolved to visit Luclin when she got the chance.<br>
<br>
He led her deep into Neriak, past the training hall of the clerics and past a number of passages and doors. Finally, they reached a large unremarkable building. He led her inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to the Grange, the guildhall of the Violent Harvest,&quot; he announced quietly. The place was mostly deserted, save for a few slaves. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where.... is the rest of your guild?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are all out, as usual. Most do not stay here any more than a day or two at a time. As it stands, I am normally only here to file my reports for the Triad.&quot; He started off before she could ask, and she hurried to catch up. He led her down a short series of hallways, up a set of stairs, and through a door. <br>
<br>
It was a small office. It didn't look as if it had seen much use, though there was an inkwell and quill, and a small stack of parchment was set neatly on one side of the desk. The rest of the office was sparsely furnished, with just a chair on either side of the desk and a small bookcase on the far wall. Xareth went to the chair behind the desk and sat.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right. I've told you a great deal about us. I'd like some information about you, especially since I expect I'll be tutoring you.&quot; <br>
<br>
What an assumption! Xilau didn't know what to think at first, but so far, she'd liked what she heard, so she obliged him. She told him of her family first, beginning with how her father had been a vauled warrior of Neriak, who had been sent to Faydwer to seek a missing messenger the guildmaster was expecting. Her father had never returned, and her mother had abandoned her shortly after, leaving the city entirely. Xilau told of how she'd lived on the streets of the city for several months, and finally, still a child, went into the warrior's guild to seek information on her father. She learned he'd been killed, but they allowed her to stay and train. &quot;I'm sure you're already aware of the basic training they give, being a warrior yourself,&quot; she told Xareth, who'd listened quietly without interruption.<br>
<br>
He sat forward in the chair and leaned on the desk contemplatively for serveral moments. &quot;Yes, I remember those days. Was a long time ago. They sent me forth to do my personal training ages ago, when I looked about your age. That was when I was found by the Harvest.&quot; He sat up and gazed evenly at Xilau. &quot;Well, now. I have given you my offer for tutorship. What do you think about it? Will you accept?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau watched him back, thinking carefully. Declining would mean more aimless wandering around the forest, killing intruders. She'd certainly enjoy it, but that sort of existence seemed empty, even if it did aid the city's defenses. But if she accepted.... &quot;I have a few questions first, if that's all right.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled. &quot;Of course. Ask away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;First, I understand what you told me about focusing my Hatred. What I didn't get was your remark about teaching me leadership. Why leadership? And why are we here, in your guildhall? Do they allow common soldiers here? And what is this Triad you spoke of?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xareth burst out laughing. &quot;Ah yes, I was hoping you would ask. It's wise to never accept an offer when you don't know all the details. To begin with, I brought you here because if you accept, I will admit you into our guild. You'll be directly in my care, and I will teach you more about being a warrior than what the Indigo Brotherhood teaches. The Triad are the guild leaders, whom I've already spoken with on this matter. They have already accepted my taking on an apprentice, though you'll have to meet them a bit later. I think they'll accept you, but your staying is their decision. Now, the reason I want to teach you about leadership.&quot; He stood slowly and paced slowly about the room. &quot;Once I am through teaching you, I must leave on an extended journey. I will be gone a long time, and I will need someone to hold my place. Someone with leadership skills. I cannot very well allow someone without that skill to take my place as Dread Overlord. It would be disasterous.&quot;<br>
<br>
She blinked, surprised. Dread Overlord? <br>
<br>
He must have seen the question on her face, because he grinned. &quot;Yes, you'll be an officer of the Violent Harvest. You will work directly under the Triad, and use your skills and talents to bring about Hatred to all, with the Father's blessing. It's not a light job, I assure you, but I feel you would be well suited to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau stood and faced him. &quot;I... don't know what to say. I didn't know you were a...I mean-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, don't bother. I usually never ask others to call me by title, so long as they show proper respect as Innoruuk wills it. I'm not about to start being formal now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau sat down again and thought for a long moment. What an interesting offer! &quot;I think... I'll accept. I always suspected that there was more to learn about being a warrior than what they taught. I mean, they just teach you how to use the very basics at first and expect you to figure out most of the rest. I had difficulties using my staff at first, because they didn't cover it in basic weaponcraft. As for learning to... take your place, I am intrigued. Why didn't you pick someone from your guild for the job?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xareth didn't answer for a moment. &quot;Well, I've never been known to do things in the usual manner. I beleive we could always use another fine warrior in the guild. We have several already, including my own tutor, Faeolin. She taught me most of what I know about my profession and my job in the guild. I spotted you in the forest, and noted your technique. Your guildmasters most certainly didn't teach you that, you must have done it on your own. Not many of the warriors I've ever met use a whip with a blunt weapon. It worked quite well, considering your skill.&quot; He went back behind the desk and brought something from under it. They were twin sabres. &quot;I made these in hopes of locating a young warrior for an apprentice. These are infused with the magic of Hate, smithed by my own hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau was fascinated. The sabres were finely crafted with the special metals the Tier'dal used. The hilt on each held a small sapphire. &quot;Are these Indigo Sabres?&quot; He nodded. &quot;May I see?&quot; she inquired. She felt like a child, asking, but they were so wonderful!<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course. They are yours, after all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau picked one up gingerly and removed it from it sheath. The blade curved backward and met the flat in an angled point. She tested the balance gently, noting the way the blated was well fitted with the hilt and pommel of the sword. She loved it. &quot;This is a very fine gift,&quot; she said. &quot;I will use these well.&quot; She replaced the sabre in it's sheath and belted the swords at her sides. &quot;When do I begin training?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xareth headed for the door. &quot;We begin now.&quot;<br>
