Back and forth. Her mind lost deep to thoughts of old. Past, present and the future to come played heavily upon her conscious. Her hand moved absently to craddle the weight of the child growing within her. He would be born before the bonding. He would come to be in fire, hatred and death. In the heat of battle. While the city he would grow up in was destroyed and made new. <br>
This child, was not destined to be of the Chosen race. He would never know his parents. Never know the guiding hand of the true followers of Innoruuk. He would never learn to swing a sword at the Captains tutoring. <br>
He would never learn to weild a spell at the Chancelors teachings. Nor would he ever learn the true power to be found in the spires set deep in the heart of Neriak.<br>
No, his path lay elsewhere. His banishment would be the punishment of his parents. How Nospiratus could stand the though of his child growing up without him. She would never know. Nor could she ever explain how such a creature as herself could feel such a deep emotional sadness at the though of having to leave him in a city she would bring distruction to. <br>
She smiled faintly as she felt him kick against her palm. He was strong already. It was as if he sensed her thoughts and had begun to move restlessly within her. She sighed softly, sadly as she took a seat near the hearth. Her emerald eyes locking upon the fire. <br>
&quot;One child will follow the path of the blade, the other the path of the Chosen.&quot; Aye, this child would follow the path of the blade. His song would draw men and women to his side. It would gear them to battle. She could see him, standing upon the hill over looking the battlefield. His voice raised. The song he sung so sweet, heartwrenching, otherwordly. <br>
The tone so clear as to bring a tear to the eye of even the most seasoned warrior. Helplessly she watched as the enemy fell upon him. She could not interefer as he battled his way from beneath him. His allies closing around him. Never would he know her. But never would he want for anything either. Not so long as there was breath in her's and Nos's breast. <br>
They would watch over him. Like dark guardians. From the shadows they would see to his needs. Only the best tutors would be chosen. His armor would be only of the finiest to be had by smithers and crafters. His instruments of distruction would be those made from lores and legends. <br>
She leaned back in her chair. A slight smile now playing upon her lips as she seemed at least satisfied with that much. It was all they could give him. It would have to be enough. Never did she regret how he came to be, or his fate. For to do so would be to regret this bond she now shared with his father.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=249.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=249.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=249.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=249.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
