We all know what happened a few months ago and at that time IV's stance was that VP was FCFS, the Prexus community disagreed. I can remember reading posts on Prexus saying that if IV was in VP, its FCFS but other guilds would respect the &quot;first guild in&quot; rule.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> IMO VP is a non reservable zone, therefore its a FCFS zone, irreguardless of whatever antiquated &quot;forms of thought&quot; are out there.

Sorry but some traditions gotta change with the times. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This was a quote from BA I took from the FC?FU! thread on P.com<br>

Has IV's stance changed? If it has maybe the community should know, to avoid occurences like the most recent?<br>

<br>
Sapiens, Ianthia, Taxi, I'm begining to see what the &quot;new&quot; IV is all about.  These three representing your greater population, how can you not be embarassed?   While I only know of Taxi from what I've read here, the other two are well known serverwide idiots.  I don't say this as a personal jab because I can't counter what they have said.  I say this because they continue to repeat the same crap over, and over, and over again.  They reply with half statements, twisting words that are not even close to the point of a message.  Prefering to pick apart posts for the smallest inconsitency.<br>
<br>
I can play the quote game too Sapiens.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Not up to you to decide what we can or cannto kill.. and if you don;t believe me that we wcould have... just read Abery's post. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taken out of context.  I said in a previous post that you should be grateful that they killed Hoshkar for you, because 20 IV were not going to Kill him.  I wasn't deciding what you can and can't kill, I was arguing a point about mob capability.  I stand by those words.  While in the future perhaps you will kill him with 20, as of that day you do not have the capability.  Part of my job as a raid leader is to assess the other capabilitys of other guilds.  This is a complicated matter surrounding FCFS and the such, that I won't go into further.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Well he was told we were there first and that we didn't want to random.. and he said they were going to manaburn a dragon no matter what... When we said ok.. take pahra dar.. thent hey said no... How diplomatic was he with the &quot;we are MB something no matter what&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I find it really hard to believe that he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option.  I think it was a remark made because he very well knew, that you had to kill Hoshkar and Silverwing before you could move on to Phara-Dar.  He knwe that would be a long wait for them, as you guys were obviously waiting on more people so you could kill Hoshkar.  If he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option, I think you guys should lynch him.  Most likely though, he was offering this as an undoable option.  That's not diplomacy, that's impossible negotiation.  Diplomacy is compromise somewhere in the middle.  This was not offering something in the middle.<br>

<br>
Nope it wasn't.  Every guild considers VP a one raid zone.  IV violated that agreement, through the use of a bugged Hoshkar.  Your leader <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  continues to declare </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that VP is a multi-raid zone.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  No one from IV </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> leadership or otherwise, not even yourself, has posted that you are now on board with the rest of the server.  So until you can learn to play like everyone else, a different set of rules will be there for you.  Why is this so hard to comprehend? You want it to be different? Fine! Then simply state that you (collectivly) now feel that VP is a one raid zone, and we can be done with all this.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Not a grudge? You tell me if this doesn;t sound liek a grudge... </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's not a grudge.   It was a reaction.<br>
<br>
The difference between you and I Sapiens is so simple.  I'm willing to concede to people, when they are right.  You, Ianthia, perhaps even this Taxi person; are not willing to concede.  You will repeat yourselves over and over again, making silly points that no one else even comes close to agreeing with.  When people tell you politely that you are wrong, and should just give it up, you don't.  That's when you just keep pushing, and pushing.  <br>
<br>
Do you realise that you are now looked upon in the same eyes as people see Ianthia and Warador?  I'm not talking about the general population, I'm talking about the intelligent debators that can identify the difference between someone arguing a point, and someone just posting nonsense over and over and over again. <br>
<br>
Since this is your messageboard, I will allow you to have the last word.  I have no doubts it will be more unintelligent drivel that will be a further waste of time to respond too.  It's sad that this could be so easily resolved, yet your weak leadership is unable to do any sort of damage control.  <br>
<br>
If you want to have me respond to something, you know where to look.  Otherwise I leave you now, with the last word of undoubted flames and attacks, taking my words out of context; and tossing in a &quot;Tool&quot; or &quot;You're a little fly who no one listens to&quot;,<br>

Maddie, yes Sapiens argues alot but he puts in info practically everytime he posts something and the info is relevant  to his material.

Build a bridge and get over what happened.  One thing that separates a man from a boy is being able to be held accountable for ones actions.  Be a man and stop making lame excuses.  This is not a flame.  This is being real with you.  Be a man bro.  Stop the spinning and excuses.  Step up to the plate and be a man...  Otherwise just pipe down and go away.  Because we really do not want to hear your whinning and nonsense.<br>
<br>
On another note and this is my own opinion.  You don't like Backalley and that is fine.  Do not come here in our house to smear him or IV.  It is childish.  And yes I did call you a tool.  Because look at your actions here and in game.  Maybe you need to take a hard look in the mirror and reality check yourself into why people have the opinions of you that they do.  Hell just look at this thread and use it as a example.  As I said.  Be a man!! <p><P ALIGN=Center>

The bottom line is this Ajahn.  People in your guild chose to do something against the rules and got caught.  Nothing IV did or said put those warnings on those accounts.  As I said be and adult and be held accountable for your actions.  I know it is a hard concept to grasp.  But that is also along the same lines as having integrity and honesty.  Being able to say we made a mistake and got caught.  It is about accountability.  You guys got caught doing something wrong.  Take your punishment and live with it.<br>
<br>
And along the lines with Maddie.  He came here ranting about our leadership with more of his nonsense.  He should really learn when to pick his battles.  This was a one sided fight.  As I said in the prior post.  He needs to be a man.  I have yet to see that in the guy.  I suggest you walk away and do some self analysis on what happened.   <p><P ALIGN=Center>

To be honest with you, I don’t see the point arguing back and forth who was right or wrong or whose fault it was that 6 EQ players got a warning. The fact remains some one jumped a mob that was not theirs to start with (according to EQ authorities/police) and got their little fingers burned. Fuck them. Who really gives a shit? <br>
I see IV in the same situation as Stasis was a year ago except for the fact that the whole argument is about one zone – VP. It is obvious that Prexus community will not respect IV’s presence in VP. Hence, IV should take advantage of this. If there is something up in VP, regardless of who is raiding the zone; IV members should find themselves competing for the spawn with the guild that is raiding VP. The question is. Is IV capable of pulling what Stasis did a year ago and by doing so redefined Prexus community? <br>

Thanks, Iliia.<br>

<br>
[OK, let me get this straight. In June BA declares VP an FCFS zone and FCFS's SA, server disagrees,]<br>
<br>
Since when are the trolls on ass.com &quot;the server&quot;. I see maybe 3-4 guilds there posting most of the time, most of which have laughable reputations and have zero right to be pointing fingers.<br>
Also, I am not the leader of Infinite Vision. I am an officer. I have a gdamn right to have an opinion on anything I want to. Infinite Vision decided when we reformed that we would not interfere with raids in VP, despite whatever opinions some of our members had on the zone. Those who felt VP should be FCFS went along just to get along and not deal with the headaches of June. <br>
<br>
[Team MB FCFS's him in VP, and suddenly it's wrong of them?]<br>
<br>
We werent FCFS'd...we were FFA'd. We cleared the roamers to pull a dragon, and whether Judaih or Sumie got agro first or not, a dragon came. Under FCFS, being the first RAID present we should have had first shot on the mob, but were FFA'd when the mob showed up. Aleolin has already admitted Sumie has never pulled VP. The GM assisting the mob got Judaih (our monk) as a target. Unless Aleolin is godlike and can tell from the back of the cubby who had agro first, the facts point to us having agro first, as well as pulling mobs to GET the dragon in the first place. Jaharad, if Talionis and IV were in a zone, Talionis was there first and was pulling mobs to get a named mob, and we pulled the named mob, while standing WITH you guys, would that not be FFA? FIRST come FIRST serve. Had they pulled from another location, that would have been acceptable FCFS because they dragons roam. But they didnt did they? They were with us in the cubby. HOW can this be acceptable to ANYONE unless your hatred of us is more important than the truth.<br>
<br>
[If you changed your mind BA, is this IV policy or what? Is NTOV and sleepers included?]<br>
<br>
What about these zones? We have NEVER FCFS'd anyone there. We have never waited behind someone to FCFS them on named in ST. Until the last 2 days, we also never sat behind anyone for Aaryonar or NTOV either, but Unity set that precident by doing it to us. If you recall, the only time IV has been in a FCFS situation was when Talionis waited for us to wipe on the Prog in ST, which we didnt. But Learoy, being played by someone else at the time (Stikkus brother, cant remember his character..beltran? not sure) at the time, told me you intended to do him if we failed. Thats the only FCFS issue IV has ever had in ST. I dont care if you deny ST Jaharad, I was talking to Learoy the whole time, he made it CLEAR what your intentions were, and YES this was before SA and VP. Fucking tired of this double standard bullshit we keep getting.<br>
<br>
Ajahn<br>
<br>
[And some of you claim that IV is not trying to make this an FA/IV issue?]<br>
<br>
Yes, members of your guild were present. FA has to answer for them. It is an FA/IV issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Hell, the majority of FA didn't even know this was going on.]<br>
<br>
Ok, now you know...now what? Do you accept this?<br>
<br>
<br>
[Because Hawx decided to air the issue on the FA boards because those threads don't get locked down the moment words get testy, it is suddenly FA vs. IV]<br>
<br>
It was FA vs IV when people wearing your tag zoned in and FFA'd a mob. Question now is, how will FA respond? Oh, and we lock played out threads...Why? Because after seeing people go back and forth over and over, covering the same things theres no point and it becomes an eyesore after awhile. We allow people to get whatever they have to say out of their system, then we move on. Sorry we dont leave them open ad infinitum, but this isnt ass.com. Go there for endless, meanlingless banter.<br>
<br>
<br>
[How about you keep the issue between Team Manaburn and IV where it belongs, eh?]<br>
<br>
It involves FA because your members were there. Your no less accountable for the actions of your mates than anyone else on the server. Question is...do you care?<br>

Knobbie<br>
<br>
[Jaharad after the VP/SA incident.. when did IV do FCFS on VP/ST/NTOV?]<br>
<br>
We havent Knobbie, but that doesnt matter I guess. Also, we have never FCFS'd ST...we have raced and beaten or been beaten there, but never FCFS'd it. Until Unity decided NTOV was FCFS by sitting behind us doing Aaryonar, we never waited behind anyone there either.<br>
<br>
<br>
Robustus<br>
<br>
[Btw... When you FCFS.. do you pull on top of other people?]<br>
<br>
Not unless your just plain rude or hate them, no. If its a simple case of FCFS, thats not done, that would be training.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jaharad<br>
<br>
[The point isn't whether you ever did or didn't fcfs vp/st/ntov again, ba declared that he would do it again, and as far as the server knows he has not changed his stance.]<br>
<br>
Yes that is the point actually. Also, Im not the leader of this guild, my &quot;proclamations&quot; dont speak for guild policy. If you want to know our policies on these zones ask Walker, hes our GL. Once again, we have never FCFS'd ST, or NTOV. <br>

Aleolin<br>
<br>
[Ok Ok Ok... you are all missing the point... Hoshkar was pulled single by a monk that never actually pulled VP... /nod]<br>
<br>
<br>
So your saying he has no experience pulling in VP, but is SURE he had agro first? MMM HMM. Thanks for clarifying that for us. You have a monk pulling a zone hes not familiar with, and your 100% sure HE had agro, standing at the back of the cubby with the rest of us, what a joke.<br>
<br>
<br>
[If you know it was wrong you could at least do the right thing. Heck you could have done it at the time. You all knew what was going on, yet you didn't. That is weak.]<br>
<br>
<br>
You keep talking like we agree with you. We DONT. You put yourself in that position. Had an inexperienced monk pulling for you, pulled WHILE we were pulling WHILE standing next to us, yet somehow...someHOW...this is our fault...<br>
<br>
<br>
[Most guilds on the server accept the FCFS environment. If they get beat, they move on... seems IV has yet to mature to this level... ]<br>
<br>
We HAVE been FCFSd before, it happens. What you did was FFA however. FCFS is FIRST come(US) FIRST SERVE(US). We were there first, were ready first, and were pulling first. You FFA'd.<br>
<br>
[And for the 100 billionth time Sapien, we pulled next to IV's raid force because that is the only location in VP we can pull Hosh or Silverwing too without the use of a monk with rez staff/mage/rogue to open doors. ]<br>
<br>
You didnt have a &quot;raid&quot; you had a glorified exp group. Seven people isnt a raid. You didnt belong in that cubby with us. We were there ahead of you. In FCFS people dont occupy the same place to pull mobs. Thats never done. Beyond being courtesy, its &quot;the accepted form of FCFS&quot;. Whoever is ready and pulling to a spawn gets first shot at it. You knew we were pulling cause you asked me when Judaih started pulling roamers. You then sent your monk to pull, thats FFA, not FCFS. If you wanted to trully FCFS you should have brought more people or done so from another location. We never even saw SA when we were there with them, and we sure didnt interfere with their pulls or intended mobs. You were using us to shield you from any potential adds you might get on pulls. Thats not acceptable, thats training. Even if you thought you could pull a single dragon, you COULD have pulled adds and that would have meant we tank them or die. You want people to believe you were trying to be fair, but at no time were you fair. <br>
<br>
Knobbie<br>
<br>
[Ok, so now we have FA and Stasis saying VP is FCFS. I really wish these people could make up their minds. All the sanctimonious bullshit they chimed in about 3 months ago don't pertain to today I guess.]<br>
<br>
Exactly, I guess VP is FCFS now..thanks for the heads up FA, Stasis and KTF.<br>
<br>
<br>
[This was not FCFS. This was a blatent leapfrog to MB a mob while a raid was doing a CR]<br>
<br>
CR was done when they sent their monk to pull, we were buffed and pulling. Thats why Aleolin asked me if we were pulling. He saw his chance to get the green scale slipping away. <br>
<br>
<br>
Treston<br>
<br>
[if SA would have /petitioned us a few months ago, IV may have been in the very same situation the MB team is now.]<br>
<br>
No, thats incorrect. VP is not a Verant &quot;one raid zone&quot;. Thats a server tradition. Also, we didnt pull anything SA was pulling at the time, nor did we go anywhere near them. We never even saw them. We didnt interfere with their raid in the slightest fashion, except by making them mad that we were there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aleolin<br>
<br>
[Nm, there's obviously no point in arguing with you Sapien. Its a circular argument that comes round again even if I try to explain it to you.]<br>
<br>
Sapiens/Robustus arguements make sense. Yours are all a desperate attempt to cover your asses. You guys FFA'd a mob, and dont want to be blacklisted for doing so. All the facts point to that, anything else is just pure garbage and misinformation.<br>
<br>
1) The zone was occupied by a raid when your 7 people zoned in. (you admit this)<br>
<br>
2) The cubby was occupied by that raid force. (you admit this too)<br>
<br>
3) You moved to the exact spot that raid was. (you admit this as well)<br>
<br>
4) The raid was buffed and pulling mobs when you sent your monk to get a dragon. (Right here you violate FCFS and it becomes FFA.)<br>
<br>
5) You had a monk with no experience pulling VP so he cant be 100% sure he ever had agro first. You have only his word, and him being dead only means FD could have failed and Judaihs didnt. I can guarentee you, from pulling a dragon by myself by accident in that exact spot. Hoshkar only needs to see you there, even if your backs on that wall. Throwing one shuriken to get agro wont guarentee youll get it if hes already sight agroed on someone else. Seboh shot Aaryonar last night during a pull and he never got agro from it. It happens, so accept you COULD be wrong pls. (you admitted your monk had no experience pulling there, and the rest of you were back in the cubby with about 30 people, you cant know he had agro, you cant.<br>
<br>
6) You started MB the second the mob came into sight.(you admitted this) <br>
<br>
7) Gm assisting the mob on the pull, got our monk Judaih as the mobs target. (this is a known fact)<br>
<br>
These are the facts....please dispute these if you can...everything else is immaterial.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You FFA'd, you were rude in both the way you spoke to us, by setting up next to us in the cubby and by pulling WHILE we were pulling. Nobody, and I know NOBODY, would be polite, diplomatic or nice during such a situation. Dont you DARE come here and say how rude we were.<br>
<br>
<br>
[I didn't want to go into the situation but based on BA's past history I wasn't going to bend over backwards to be nice]<br>
<br>
YOU dont know me, you and I have no past history. If you are going off what some other people say then your an idiot. You dont know the situations Ive been involved in. You dont have all the facts to make a determination like that. I have represented a guild that competes for some of the most prized things in this game. By that very fact alone you know I have to deal with people who have an agenda similar to ours and who may or may not be diplomatic, respectful or reasonable in my dealings with them. Their job is to look out for their guild, as was mine. IV wont lay down or kiss ass to some people and it drives them crazy. Not to mention the ex-guildmates who still carry a torch for me. You were rude to me..you KNOW that. You know you could have handled it better but you didnt, and it set the tone for what happened. We didnt zone into your zone, or stand where you were first, or pull mobs while you were pulling while standing next to you. Take ownership. Be a man. For whatever utter crap has been said about me on ass.com. I have always taken ownership of my decisions. Thats what being a man is, now its your turn.<br>
<br>
<br>
[When I sent her a tell asking what had happened and why she was in zone, she said her raid had just wiped to Hoshcar. What raid? IV. By your own raid policy that means you wiped to a mob and can be FCFS'ed now.]<br>
<br>
For the record...we got Hoshkar AND Silverwing when we pulled a wurm. They both warped on top of us with the wurm already engaged. That was how we wiped.  We were not pulling those dragons when we wiped. Secondly, you werent ready to FCFS as Trabius MB wasnt up as you have already said. In order to FCFS you should also be READY to do so. We ressed back and were ready in less than 15 minutes...NOT 30. It took 30 minutes before we pulled because you were sending me tells and I was asking the guild what they thought. We could have just started pulling instead of wasting our breath with you, but I wanted the guild to know what was going on. That still doesnt excuse you being in the cubby with us, not having a sufficient raid force is another tenant in FCFS. Your problem of not having enough people wasnt our problem. I'll have you know that most guilds make a determination on what a raid force is capable of. You guys had one cleric and a monk. Who was gonna tank adds if you got them? We were or we would die. Thats training. You didnt have a sufficient raid force to be pulling there. Despite your ability to kill ONE mob...you knew if you got adds you would die. Or at the very least your monk would pulling. But having us there removed that threat, and having us pulling roamers also helped.<br>

[This thread was started by an IV member in the open forum which means that you’re inviting others to add their opinions and comments]<br>
<br>
Thanks for explaining that Moonshine...now please explain why you are posting here? This thread has nothing to do with you. Ah I see, its a chance to take a shot at the guild that booted that asshole you call a husband. BTW, whos using the brain atm? You or him?<br>
<br>
<br>
[So when anyone posts an opinion that you don’t like you insult them]<br>
<br>
As opposed to Prexus.com or Talionis boards where theres never any strife. I see, we should just shut up and let people walk all over us. You cant possibly be that naeive can you? This is our homepage, we do what we want. If you dont like it...do us all a favor and dont come here.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Anyone who had read the posts on this thread and the one on fa’s board can see that the consensus of opinions by those other then IV are the same.]<br>
<br>
They are hypocrits, if you cant see that theres nothing we can do about it. Your treating this like we deserve some kind of punishment for having had a difference of opinion. If thats how you feel then fine Moonshine...your opinion of us is clear. So why are you here again?<br>
<br>
<br>
[He posted out of frustration that no one posting for IV seems to understand what others are trying to say in their posts. ]<br>
<br>
Moonshine for fucks sake. We DO see what they are saying. They are saying that we FCFS'd SA so now everyone else can FCFS us. We also see that we got yelled at for doing this to SA, yet now its OK for anyone else to target US for this shit. Then on the other hand, we got yelled at for FCFSing guilds like yours and Wamps old guild, just because they never FCFD'd us. How is this different? Its NOT. People are saying to us <br>
<br>
1) IV..anyone can FCFS you anytime anywhere.<br>
<br>
2) You cant FCFS them back or FCFS other guilds<br>
<br>
3) Server traditions can be broken by anyone other than you, if you break them, we will flame you. <br>
<br>
This is whats being said to us, and we see it VERY clearly. <br>

<br>
[VP is FCFS if IV is in the zone. This was dictated, and remains that way by your very own Guild Leader, or main guy behind the Guild Leader, Backalley. He even says in this thread that it's an FCFS zone.]<br>
<br>
You start by saying lets be clear about something...then go on to say im the leader of this guild. I can tell Im already gonna enjoy making you my argumentative bish. My opinion of the zone, is not in the best interests of the guilds mindset so we chose to not FCFS VP. This was done at our reformation. Oh and we dont owe the trolls on ass.com an explanation or notice. <br>
<br>
<br>
[If it's not FCFS, then Backalley says &quot;We agree it's a first guild in, one raid zone.&quot; He doesn't though, in fact mulitple times in the thread he claims that it's not a one raid zone.]<br>
<br>
Yes...the &quot;we&quot; part would be the guild decision....the &quot;my opinion&quot; part would be just that....things getting clearer? No? How about this...IV is of the opinion that VP isnt worth the headache and hasnt FCFSd anyone there since June. That doesnt mean everyone agrees on what the zone is or should be. But we agreed its better to just not deal with all the BS. We hadnt even zoned in since June, just didnt want to bother. We also hadnt had any issues with other guilds since our reformation EITHER thanks. Your guildmates participated in this mess. Its not FA or any other guilds job to police us or issue punishment on us and expect it to go unnoticed. The fact there was maybe 2 FA and not 50 there doesnt mean we dont notice your reluctance to address the main issues here. The facts of how this FFA was carried out. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Lets clear something else up. Mobs do not magically warp in VP like what can happen when pushing mobs into walls in TOV . You know why you guys got Silverwing + Hoshkar + a Guardien wurm add? One of two reasons. 1. Your monk fucked up the pull. 2. One of you were too close , and caught LoS agro, again this is partially your monk's fault for not being patient and waiting for the mobs to be in the right position.<br>
<br>
You dont know everything, Maddie. We had people watching the two dragon spawns, they were no where near the wurm that was pulled from right in front of our cubby. One was up by the next SS/rancars the other was over the bridge headed towards the zone in. I can see the one by the bridge adding if there was some ghosting going on. But the one way the hell up top shouldnt ever have agroed. Either way you werent there, your guessing at best. We arent new to VP thx.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Lets be honest here BA. Hoshkar was bugged back in June. Had he not been bugged, you could not have gone unnoticed past the SA raid.]<br>
<br>
IF, woulda, coulda, shoulda. We didnt...thats the fact Maddie. We didnt interfere with them. This statements false. It didnt happen so I dont have to address it. SA never saw us..thats a fact.<br>
<br>
<br>
[That's one of the reasons we're able to still kill mobs like Tunare, Dain and Sontalak. Even when our numbers are a bit short, we have strong enough relations with other guilds to recruit the extra help we need, while also not getting FCFS by the bigger guilds.] <br>
<br>
Yes, having good relationships with other guilds is important, we have outside attendance on raids too sometimes. More often than not we have enough to do the job however. Maddie I am diplomatic and respectful if treated likewise. In fact, the only guild I cant seem to talk to is Unity.  You and I never speak, and we dont run into other guilds doing what we do most of the time. Walker handles all of that if hes online as Im usually too busy doing the groups or whatever. If someone is genuinly interested in being fair to us, we will respond in kind. Those folks who zoned into VP were rude from the second they opened their mouths. I know you wouldnt tolerate being spoken to that way, neither did I, and neither did this guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
[First Backalley, swallow some of that pride]<br>
<br>
HAHA...no its &quot;roll over Backalley, roll over&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
[Then you say &quot;Hey, back in June we were wrong. We were taking advantage of Hoshkar being bugged and tried to sneak past the SA raid. We understand now, that the entire server respects VP as a one raid zone, and we would like to play ball with those rules.]<br>
<br>
To say that Id have to agree that the zones a one raid zone...I dont. Its not about pride at all, its my opinion for christ sake. You have no choice but to accept it. Secondly, that we would &quot;take advantage of a Hoshkar bug&quot; is laughable. Stop making assumptions pls. Lastly, dont presume to speak for the &quot;entire server&quot;. Maybe 6-7 guilds are VP capable. Even in that long thread someone in FA mentioned that you yourselves had people who disagreed that VP should be a one raid zone. Not everyone is going to agree, and they shouldnt HAVE to. IMO VP can sustain multiple raids easily. Its only a by tradition thats its not that way. Whats even more funny is those people, when asked if the zone was nerfed would it still be a one raid zone, replied &quot;no, it would be a different zone then&quot;. Oh really? Bullshit. The only difference is who needs loot there. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Had your leadership ever made that claim, then Hawx and Sumie would of had to deal with me, for doing what they did in VP. As of right now though, your leadership (despite what your greater member base seems to believe) is still running with the old partyline &quot;VP is a multiraid zone&quot;. ]<br>
<br>
This is just wrong. Your not in our guild, how can you possibly know what our leadership is thinking? Oh and stop listening to Morkenlar, jesus, he was all but kicked out of this guild, you really think your gonna get facts there? Please. Also, stop with the innuendos about us misleading our members into thinking we have a different stance on VP. We changed our stance months ago cause we were tired of the damn headache of a zone thats worth doing for maybe 2 mobs, maybe 3 if you still need the mage staff. They are all on the same page...know that.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Argueing semantics like where the pull was at.]<br>
<br>
Oh I see, so we can come and sit WITH FA next time...and FCFS you guys? Ok...just wanted to know what your guilds partyline was.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Look, VP is a multiraid zone kill whatever you want just stay away from our raid.&quot; ]<br>
<br>
I told them exactly that....that if they wanted to FCFS us, fine, but to do it from another location and I DID suggest the zone in FYI. They refused Maddie.  From the moment they showed up at our spot, I knew it wasnt going to go well. While some argue that what we did was unprecidented, what they did was as well. Your guildmates just set the standard that the cubby is now a multiple raid pull spot. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Of course had Team manburn done that then the nakid clerics at the zone would have bitched that they had Hoshkar pulled on them ]<br>
<br>
If you bothered to read Aleolins post you would see they werent ready because Trabius MB wasnt up. Our &quot;naked clerics&quot; at the zone werent there long at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
[So, you had 30 people for VP, which is exactly the number I said that you needed. It's a 32K mob, 10 extra people make a HUGE difference, especially considering Hoshkar has a 1200 Hitpoint AE + Dot + 70% slow. He also gates. He LOVES to Gate. If out of those 20 you had at least 2 aren't level 60 Wizards; better with 3, then yes. You would never have killed him. He would have gated and owned you<br>
<br>
Yes we know the mob, we know how to pull him, and we did pull him with ONE monk only...wtg Judaih!<br>
<br>
<br>
[Phara Dar is EASIER than Hoshkar.]<br>
<br>
Hardly...Hoshkars a little bish.<br>
<br>
[By the way. We killed Hoshkar with 17 people.<br>
<br>
We cleared VP with 24.<br>
<br>
No guests, All FA, were the 3rd or 4th guild on the server to do it.<br>
<br>
Grieg, LOL, is SUCH a different type of an encounter than VP Dragon raids. We've also killed Grieg too, not that it matters. And Tunare, and Sontalak (the new one) Dain with 27 people..]<br>
<br>
<br>
And my dicks bigger..whats your point? We havent bothered with Tunare or Dain, we have people working on quests that involve then and have a high concentration of elves in our guild that makes doing Tunare undesirable. Yes we have done the new Sontalak and yes we were second on the server to do so, sharing that honor with Talionis. Theres no question we compete with each other, but it wasnt until certain ex members of our guild joined FA that there was ever any friction between us or even competition for that matter.<br>

<br>
[The thing that I find most interesting is that of all the posts on this topic no one has disputed it was my pull,]<br>
<br>
Man did you and Aleolin go to school together? Hello? I disputed it was your pull. Do I have to shout it from the top of the statue in FV? I dont think you have the experience or the knowledge necessary to know for sure if you had agro or not. As Aleolin said, youd never pulled there before. Doesnt take a shuriken to agro Hoshkar...<br>
<br>
<br>
[IV people did not say a word. That to me is cowardice, no more no less.]<br>
<br>
Maybe because nobody knows who pulled him. You CLAIM to have done it. But we were all back in the cubby. They only things we have to go off is your word, a guide assisting a mob, and Judaihs word. I dont know Judaihs position, but given what wiped us before, its hard to say who had first agro. Either way..you were FFAing...not FCFSing. <br>

<br>
I have had better things to do then to respond to this thread...but rest assured here I am to set you straight Maddie. IV leaderships tired of the double standards, lack of regard for our members and lack of respect we endure in dealing with these so-called &quot;better&quot; guilds. You want us to work with you, yet you are only rude, condescending and manipulative with us. Im sorry but that doesnt wash with us. You talk about ownership, yet it seems to apply to us only. Im too tired to list the numerous examples of instances we have had &quot;precidences&quot; set for us and only us and been ignored when we complained about it. IMO theres little reason to care about those guilds who treat us differently.<br>

[Taken out of context. I said in a previous post that you should be grateful that they killed Hoshkar for you, because 20 IV were not going to Kill him. I wasn't deciding what you can and can't kill, I was arguing a point about mob capability. I stand by those words. While in the future perhaps you will kill him with 20, as of that day you do not have the capability. Part of my job as a raid leader is to assess the other capabilitys of other guilds. This is a complicated matter surrounding FCFS and the such, that I won't go into further.]<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  ....hi ego.<br>

[I find it really hard to believe that he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option. I think it was a remark made because he very well knew, that you had to kill Hoshkar and Silverwing before you could move on to Phara-Dar. He knwe that would be a long wait for them, as you guys were obviously waiting on more people so you could kill Hoshkar. If he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option, I think you guys should lynch him. Most likely though, he was offering this as an undoable option. That's not diplomacy, that's impossible negotiation. Diplomacy is compromise somewhere in the middle. This was not offering something in the middle.]<br>
<br>
Actually I was offering him as a sincere option. We didnt even intend to do Phara Dar until we got to him. Reason being we had one monk to pull and didnt think we could get him single. Sorry Judaih, wont doubt you again bro <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . But yes it was sincere. No, we werent waiting on more people...Maddie you werent there ok? When I was talking to these guys we had our full raid there. Something like 32-34 people. We actually were pulling some wurms to make a hoshkar or silverwing pull easier when they sent their monk to pull a dragon. As far as diplomacy is concerned, let me enlighten you with the decisions that have been given to us by some of the guilds we compete with. Ntov...Unity whos wiped doing aaryonar..who the day before had COHd past us while we were already in Ntovsays...you guys can move ahead as long as you go left (not right where aaryonar was exploited to..wtg Unity) also where Feshlak, Dagarn and Kreiz are spawned...only named up left was Vyemm. Unity in HOT.....in the middle of doing CR from someone opening the door while we were prepping for Dozekar, &quot;You have 5 minutes to pull Dozekar or we will be going past you and doing him&quot;. The MB team in VP...&quot;we are going to be killing a dragon no matter what&quot;. Pick one. KTF in Ssraeshza after the zone went down. &quot;We are gonna be doing the Rhags since you just killed them before the zone went down, Oh and if any commanders spawn, they are ours.&quot; This is how we are talked to Maddie. If you think we are gonna be in the best of moods after hearing that shit, your out of your mind. You talk about diplomacy, we only get demands. <br>

IV reformed what 4 months ago? Its old news. Our drama is overwith and has been. Since that time we havent had any issues with other guilds outside of the normal competitive stuff. People say we deserve this because we zoned in to do Phara Dar with SA there, yet what we dont see is if they are so strongly opinionated about this zone, they shouldnt be supporting their own guildmates for doing the very same thing. Its hypocritical, pure and simple. Also, if you read my posts you will see that I personally didnt care that they were there, just that they used OUR pull spot to set up at. They were also very rude and the only choices they gave us werent choices at all. We gave them options, Phara dar..or pull dragons to the zone in....they refused them. They werent even a raid, only by the grace of Verants stupidity were they even able to kill Hoshkar in the first place. Otherwise they woulda been his lunch.<br>
