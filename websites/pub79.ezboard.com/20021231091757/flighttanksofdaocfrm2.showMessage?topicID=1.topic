<br>
For instance, assassin classes have CS and Poison which no other class gets and thus define those classes.<br>
<br>
As a mercenary i get Weapon, Dual Wield, Parry and Shield. Nothing that noone else gets, and thus no clearly defining skill. We sacrifice armor to be a &quot;light tank&quot;, but the ability to take damage is in no way balanced with the need for us to avoid damage. If we drop our second weapon and use a shield instead, we now can tank as well as an armsman, except we don't get plate. So that is clearly pointless.<br>
<br>
From the quests a Mercenary gets and from the fact that we are in the Guild of Shadows, it is clear that we are not the knightly warriors that armsmen/paladins are, but rather a rough sort who will do anything to win, including those dirty tricks. Personally i haven't gotten far enough to get dirty tricks, but it seems that having a 30 min reusable ability is a poor way to define a class.<br>
<br>
What i was thinking is this. Armsman is a pure class. Infiltrator is a pure class. Mercenary is kind of a hybrid. He's a fighter in the shady guild. So why not play more on our shady side. There are 2 obvious skill lines that can be added to flesh out our class. One is Dirty Tricks line that others have suggested and which i think could be great. The other is poison which already exist and thus would be very little work. Assassins already get 2 class defining skills, so sharing one shouldn't really be that much of a problem, and it would fit in with the Mercenary style of rotten fighting.<br>
<br>
If mythic still thinks we are going to be tanks that can compete in the tanking department, they should also add some more Evade in my opinion. Evade 3 as max perhaps. Or make Evade into a skill and put caps on it as they do to other skills. (Infil/Friar caps at level, Mercs/Scouts at half level, etc).<br>
<br>
Now, i am still rather young as a merc, and i am having a lot of fun, but i can already see pretty clearly the difference in what i can do compared to an Armsman, and it looks like i am sacrificing lots to gain very little.<br>

If we look at armsman, that class doesn't really have a class defining skill either, but he has a defining role instead as the main tank. That is why i think we are not going to get any specialized new lines since it would be made only for mercenary and that is quite a bit of work for the very few people that play one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It seems to be a real Catch 22.  There are not a lot of us because there is no class defining skill/style and there are no class defining skills/styles because there are not a lot of us. <br>
<br>
I would hope that if Mythic isn't going to fix the damage out put that we do, then they at least try to make our character more fun by adding to Dirty Tricks.  We are the fighters of the Guild of Shadows and we should be some nasty folks to tangle with.  <br>
<br>
I love my merc, and I wouldn't play another character class to 50.  I've heard it said that we are the &quot;roleplayers&quot; class, if that's true, then give us a few more &quot;tricks&quot; to play around with.  My character is not &quot;uber&quot; and apparently never will be, so please, make her even more fun to play.<br>

One other thing that I've thought of, that other mercs have agreed with, and just kinda makes sense for the RP aspect of our class ... why have protect 3? why not trade prot 2+3 for evade 2+3 (hell, even evade 2)?  We're mercs, we look after #1, seems to make sense to me anyway.  I also think that the parry rate should definitely be higher when using two weapons (also, just seems common sense).  One other thing that I've thought of, and I'm not sure how difficult it would be to implement ... but it would make shield spec viable for our class .... is to have shields hit just like any other offhand weapon, that way we're not gimped with a shield equiped, and a shield merc would just be way cool then.  Alright, there's my 2 cents, lemme know what ya think :-)<br>

The problem with this is, we don't dish out more damage than a polearmsman can (aside from enemies with PBT), given the fact that we give up a very large amount of defense being limited to chain (which evade 1, even with the new 360 degrees doesn't make up for), we should be dealing a fairly significant amount MORE damage than our plate wearing brethren.  The two suggestions that I've seen that seem to stand out the most in terms of setting the Merc apart are:<br>
<br>
1. Apply style bonus to offhand damage on a dual hit, at LEAST with DW styles, if not all styles.  And also, revise the DW line so that it's styles, especially chains, are usable in reality.  I've got 3 styles on my quickbar (at 45 - full spec Slash and DW) Amethyst Slash, and the Reflection - Hypnotic Darkness chain (have YET to have the chance to use this in RvR).  Someone said that the 50 DW style was nice, I can't say yet, but I hope it is.  The only reason I even have that chain on there though is for the stun, otherwise Amethyst Slash does more damage.  A lvl 29 Slash style, making all the DW styles up to 44 pretty much useless doesn't really seem right to me.  Could be that I'm missing something, if any of you other mercs have found otherwise, please let me know.<br>
<br>
Edit: Sorry, forgot to point out that I thought each successive move in a chain should do SIGNIFICANTLY more damage since it's harder to do. Okay, done now, I hope :-)<br>
<br>
2. A line of Dirty Tricks.  While I absolutely LOVE Increase Fumbles (once every half hour - when it's NOT resisted), having a whole line of tricks would be cool.  This is definitely something that no other class in Albion has.  I'm not sure exactly what effects they should have, or if they should be granted by level or spec (may have to consider going to 2.25 x lvl spec points if it was spec based).  Maybe we could start another topic based on new Dirty Tricks we'd like to see.<br>
<br>
Alright, well, I'm done pissin' and moanin' for now, hope I didn't annoy anyone too bad :-) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/unirala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirala</A> at: 8/31/02 12:22:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ucarach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#000000>(9/3/02 10:59:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: dw 50</span><hr size=1> Well here is what I see as a 50 Merc. I am specced 45 Slash, 50 DW , 34 Parry. Our dmg output is ok but not what it should be. This biggest problem with dmg is in the DW styles. If you look at the styles you will see most are only medium dmg. The 50th DW style Dual Shadows while somewhat effective also carries a medium defense penalty. I have questioned this numerous times with Zauron and Mythic. Why as a merc after all these levels have my final style with such a large defensive penalty, did I suddenly become stupid after all the time it took to get there?<br>
However Lets look at the styles for DW/CD/LA. Notice anything &quot;wrong&quot;? I dang sure do. As  Mercs we have 2 high damage styles, and only available from a back position (the Shadows Edge/Penumbra combo). BMs and Zerkers have 5 High damage output styles within CD/LA. The BM 50th style in CD actually is Very High Dmg output, granted its 3rd in a chain but also carries a +defensive bonus. Side styles are not that hard to execute in RvR, Rear positional styles are way more difficult in that you are using them usually when trying to chase down an opponent and we all know what thats like, &quot;so and so is to far away to attack&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here also I think is where BMs and Mercs fall way behind in dmg to a Zerker look at the basline weapon just slash for now.<br>
Zerkers have 11 High dmg output styles in axe. What do Mercs/BMs have in baseline weapon skills? Kinda sad if you ask me.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong I like my mercs and have waited since beta 2 for Mythic to &quot;fix&quot; us. Maybe one day that'll happen, but for now I think these are some issues that need to be addressed to Mythic.<br>

Defensive wise i seem to be doing good, having more Evade would rock tho, thats for sure. Offensive i'm pretty happy too. I do quite a lot of damage and by using positional styles i can deal a lot. I wouldn't mind dealing more damage tho, but i can see it being overpowering just to add more dmg with our current weaponry. Thats why i'm still thinking another line of damage or dirty tricks would be the way to go. Berzerkers should do more damage than us in pure melee considering what they are, but we should make up for it by kicking them where it hurts, etc.<br>

and the styles need a bit of a revamp, I have to agree... somewhat lacklustre... <br>

But I don't think we're that broken apart from the general tank crapness in RvR (which *hopefully* the next patch will address...

Heres my thoughts<br>
<br>
dirt issue . fix it lots of good suggestions easiest though is no resis / lower timer<br>
<br>
dw stun. long duration stun like slam.<br>
<br>
parry. with two weps we use should we get double chance of parry. Im no prgrammer but would it be that hard to actually make this happen. Or how bout at least 1.5 times yer parry skill lvl<br>
<br>
flurry . has anyone else noticed that the dmg output of this move has been reduced since it first went live<br>
<br>
a detect hidden. make like infil passive skill enhances yer chances to see a stealther when they are close by. this would address the guild of shadows issue mentioned in previous.<br>
<br>
Other then that I wouldnt be any other tank class. Ive played friends armsman 50/50 ss and quite frankly armsman are just plain boring.<br>
<br>
Love the mercs! Give us respect <br>
:P<br>

<br>
Hypnotic Darkness is a medium duration stun that must chain off another style (which is reactionary to Parry). Though many Mercs like this combo, it is very difficult to get off and doesn't stun for very long (thanks to cheaper Determination). <br>
<br>
It is definitely sub-par when compared to the Defender's Rage combo, the Dragonfang style, Annihilation (LW stun style), Shield Slam...need I go on? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uavandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Avandor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Axe-Wielding Maniac</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#000000>(10/7/02 10:11:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webinnovations.dk/av/avtop.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skils?</span><hr size=1> Hypnotic Darkness combo is great in PvE, and I do use it a lot, working very well especially with ver fast weapons (I manage to get 3 hypnotic darkness combos in one stun).<br>
<br>
But RvR wise I am yet to see being able to pull one of these stuns off... *sighs* <p><br>_________________________________
