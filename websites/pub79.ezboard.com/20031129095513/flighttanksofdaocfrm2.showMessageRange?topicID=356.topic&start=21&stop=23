<br>
I am a huge supporter for making DW changes more viable and useful for the Merc class. My main 2 classes are Paladin and Inf. Just wanted to throw my 2c into this from the Inf perspective.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see Talifer's point about how the inf and the merc are always gonna be linked somehow through this spec being readily available, but apart from Mythic looking at the DW line and saying &quot;le's not make infs any mroe powerful, let's leave the whole line as it is&quot;, I don't think improving DW would make infils any better or 'overpowered'.<br>
<br>
Here's why.<br>
<br>
No infiltrator ever uses any DW style, unless he's an idiot.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Wrong, the Mercflitrator spec is becoming more and more popular day by day. I have been a merc spec inf for sometime (coming close to a year now) now and find it very useful. Why? PA damage has gone very downhill since the advent of SC and maxing of resists. With using the Str/Con debuff posion, the PA becomes useless essentially. If you would like a further detail explanation, please post back or contact me directly.<br>
<br>
So, with our biggest weapon/attack being so low as it is (currently, wasnt always like this), the Mercflitrator spec was created. Going with 50dw has many benefits, more off hand swinging, almost guarentee to land 2nd posion, DT off evade (primariy for slash based infs), and DS as anytime (almost). I personally love the flank chain and use it whenever possible.<br>
<br>
If Infs were given more of a reason to spec higher DW, we would. 2.5pts makes it very nice to spread our points across our spec lines. Adding in a dex/qui debuff to a style, as suggested, I would expect to see many infs trying to get that style (unless it was off a parry reactional). This IMO would way overpower infs. Being able to land Str/Con debuff then get off Dex/Qui debuff../shudder<br>
<br>
Also, new tests are showing that when a class dual wields, aka swings both weapons, halfs the opponents evade rate. This is huge deal for the stealth classes, where evade is our only defense. This is a definite plus in our &quot;Stealth Wars&quot; at amf. For further details, visit the safehouse board and/or the VN albion rogue class board.<br>
<br>
&quot;Simply put, CS is a very, very well designed style line. It's amazingly good. The only none-CS style any infiltrator uses is Dragonfang.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- I would have to disagree. CS has 4 part evade chain (next to impossible to get off in Rvr) where the last 2 styles do less dmg than than the first 2. In addition, the last style in the chain, the lvl 50 style, is and has been acknowledge to being broken since who knows when.<br>
<br>
The anytime style has big defense penalty (granted so does DS) but is huge end hog. Best part about this line is the first 2 styles in the evade chain. The PA can be devastating, but hasnt been like that in many, many months. DS still has higher growth rate than Garrote. <br>
<br>
There is no back positional style in the line (that does not require stealth) Granted most would use the back positional in their base spec line, even over the DW, but just wanting to prove a point.<br>
<br>
When you look at the style as a whole, the majority of the styles have Defense penalties. IMO this comes with the territory of &quot;Critical Strike&quot;, but very unappealling none the less. The plus side to this line is that the snares and slowed are in very nice places. Would agree the placement of the styles and reactionaries are in good shape too. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mythic probably doesn't plan on ever bumping our growth rates up. That's not even what I'm hoping for, either. Utility is the real melee tool.<br>
<br>
We already don't have to worry about DTendril and Dshadows becuase Mythic gave us improvements and cut the inf out of it. We could probably assume that if they added a Dex/Qui debuff to Tendrils, they wouldn't give it to the inf. Also- Dragonfang still beats this as an evade-reactionary, and the Hamstring chain (4evade reactionaries, can be done after Dfang) is so purely destructive that using a 90%move, even with a 12pt bleed and a stat debuff, is wasteful.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- No offense, but getting off a 4 chain evade style is very difficult. Esp when you do not see any benefit using the 3rd and 4th style anyway (as mentioned before, lvl 50 style is broke).<br>
<br>
&quot;FLank and 'Rain could be compared to Pincer (x2) with added utility of a snare/speed slow, but it's not a style any inf is gonna spec 44dw just so hs can have it.<br>
<br>
Really, I think Mythic should look at the infil and say &quot;That man has two style libraries but he's only using one of them. How can we make DW styles more attractive?&quot;<br>
<br>
--Very true, but i love to use Flank when I can, just wished it had a to-hit bonus for my PvE fights.<br>
<br>
Please no flames, thought I would throw in an Infs perspective since someone was concerned about it. <br>
<br>
Personally, when they do the style review, I would expect to have DW split out into 2 seperate lines due to the popularity of Mercflitrators. 1 being the same DW line as is for Infs, and 2nd being updated version for Mercs.<br>
<br>
IMO a mercflitrator is a very powerful class and does not need any more power. Just think u should rethink that train of thought. <p>Lorac Avalonian- lvl 50 Paladin<br>

My concern is not how it would affect the infiltrator but the fact that it WOULD affect the infiltrator, good or bad.<br>
<br>
This is what I want to avoid<br>
<br>
Mythic: OK let's add a debuff to Flank to help out the Merc<br>
QA: Sounds good, but the infiltrator will also get that, so we better add some testing time to see how it affects the infiltrator into our QA time line<br>
Mythic: Hmmm we don't have that much time, let's just change it for the Merc and not the inf<br>
QA: That's good to, but we'll still have to add some QA time to make sure it hasn't broken the infiltrator.<br>
Dev: And we'll need extra dev time for the additional code changes for doing that<br>
Mythic: Hmmmm, ok let's leave that one for now, it's not a big problem.  OK how can we make savages even better....<br>
<br>
This is the type of discussion I don't want Mythic to be having <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
