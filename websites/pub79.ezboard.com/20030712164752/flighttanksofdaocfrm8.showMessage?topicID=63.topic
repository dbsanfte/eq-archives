Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Test Version 1.62a Release Notes <br>
<br>
Tuesday, April 22, 2003 <br>
<br>
===================================== <br>
<br>
Version 1.62 is going to have many class updates, tweaks, and re-balancing. 1.62a (this patch) concentrates on Hibernian spellcasters and hybrids. Later 1.62 test patches will tackle other issues such as light tanks. <br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- We slightly adjusted combat style (and combat style only) bleed effects so that higher versions go above 7 damage on the initial &quot;tick&quot;. <br>
<br>
- /mbuy is now added to the command history (accessible by pressing Shift-Up Arrow) <br>
<br>
- /clock now toggles display of a new window that shows the current time of day (real time, not game time) <br>
<br>
- Renamed several keys in the keyboard config to make their use more clear. <br>
<br>
- You may now delve items in your vault to see additional information about them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Chat Tab Changes <br>
<br>
You can now modify your chat tabs to change chat channels to talk in Alliance or Officer chat by default. When you change the outgoing chat type for a tab, the tab will now change namees to reflect your choice. <br>
<br>
Right click on the name of the tab group, and right click on the name of the message type that you would like to talk to. Your chat tab will change names to reflect this. You can set it to: Say, Broadcast, Group, Guild, Alliance Chat, Officer Chat, or Chat Group. <br>
<br>
To control what messages are visible in this channel, check or uncheck the boxes to the left of the message type. <br>
<br>
To change colors for a specific message type, click on the name of the message type and use the arrow buttons. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HIBERNIA CLASS UPDATES <br>
<br>
Valewalker Changes <br>
<br>
- The Valewalker base melee ability has been increased. Valewalkers will now do more damage every time they hit a target with a melee weapon. <br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
- Many Valewalker spells had inconsistent icons. These have been fixed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Animist Changes <br>
<br>
- Many Animist spells had inconsistent icons. These have been fixed. <br>
<br>
- Animist pets will no longer attempt to attack monsters that are set as &quot;no kill&quot; - merchants, gatekeepers, etc. <br>
<br>
- Animist pets will now target all enemy players. Previously they would not attack gray or purple enemy players. <br>
<br>
- Animist pets will target purple monsters. Previously they would not attack any monsters higher than red. <br>
<br>
- Corrected an AI bug in the Essence of the Tree, Guardian Emissary, and Woodspirit Sheath bombers that was causing problems with buffing other targets. <br>
<br>
- The Constraining Spirit line has had its range increased to 1500. <br>
<br>
- Bomber speed has been increased. <br>
<br>
- The Grove's Assailant line will now display correct information when delved. <br>
<br>
<br>
Eldritch Changes <br>
<br>
- The Lesser Mana Ripple line has had its cast time reduced to 2.5 seconds, making it similar to PBAEs in the other realms. <br>
<br>
- The spells Blank, Obliterate, and Extinguish Coordination have had a radius component added to them, making them similar to the Lesser Health Dispersal line. <br>
<br>
- Reduced cast time of the Ethereal Concussion line to 2.6 seconds; this brings it in line with the Gleam Ray line. <br>
<br>
- Added a baseline single-target strength debuff shout in Way of the Eclipse: <br>
<br>
8 Cancel Strength <br>
15 Negate Strength <br>
21 Unmake Strength <br>
29 Abrogate Strength <br>
35 Void Strength <br>
43 Vitiate Strength <br>
50 Null Strength <br>
<br>

25 Void Web <br>
33 Void Clamp <br>
40 Void Lock <br>
48 Void Chains <br>
<br>
- The Lesser Kinetic Dispersal line has had its attack speed debuff component replaced with a snare component. <br>
<br>
- Eldritch class special RA Negative Maelstrom has had a cold resist debuff component added (and its base damage slightly reduced to compensate). <br>
<br>
<br>
Enchanter Changes <br>
<br>
- Tuned pet AI to allow pets to melee better while on the run. <br>
<br>
- Raised threshold at which the underhill ally will heal. <br>
<br>
- Changed underhill zealot AI so that it will no longer charge opponents instead of casting. <br>
<br>
- Fixed underhill zealot's resist debuffing spell to properly debuff heat damage. <br>
<br>
- Changed Dazzling Flash line to be a single target melee damage debuff. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mentalist Changes <br>
<br>

<br>
- Decreased the cast time of the Delusion line to 3 seconds and increased the range to 1500. <br>
<br>
- Changed the Curative Trance line to be a true Heal-over-time. It lasts 10 seconds, has a 2 second frequency, and has had its cost and healing amounts adjusted accordingly. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hero Change <br>
<br>
- Stag Form ability is no longer usable while sitting. Hopefully this should eliminate some &quot;misfires&quot;. It also now has an appropriate icon. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OTHER CLASS UPDATES <br>
<br>
Shaman Changes <br>
<br>
- Changed the Minor Earth Invigoration line (fatigue regeneration buff) to be realm targeted concentration buff. If the target of this buff moves more than 1500 world units away from the caster, it will stop affecting the target until he moves back within this range. As with all concentration buffs, if the caster is killed all the buffs he is supporting will drop. <br>
<br>
<br>
Realm Ability Changes <br>
<br>
- The Wizard class special Realm Ability Volcanic Pillar has had its damage and radius increased. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Item Notes <br>
<br>
- We have enhanced items in one dungeon per realm to increase the dungeons desirability as a hunting ground. Note that these changes are retro-active. If you have any items from the following dungeons; Koalinth, Tepok’s Mine, and The Cursed Tomb, give them a check. Many items from these areas were increased in effectiveness. <br>

<br>
- Each realm now has a suit of &quot;roleplay&quot; clothes, available on the existing roleplay hat merchants. Just like the roleplay hats, these outfits are intended for looks only, so they do not qualify as armor pieces. <br>
<br>

<br>
- The Lightbringer sword (Albion) now increases the slash skill instead of chants. <br>
