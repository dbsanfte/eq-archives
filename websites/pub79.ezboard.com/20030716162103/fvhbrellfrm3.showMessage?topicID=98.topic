By: Siaorah<br>
<br>
It was a dark and stormy night. <br>
<br>
Well, as much as it ever stormed in Qeynos. It was raining, and *was* dark... which is just as Siaorah preferred it. He could stand the light of day.... but he didn't care for it, now, not at all. Not that he would've seen it here, inside Crow's tavern. The upstairs was nicely dim; he couldn't see into the shadows any better than any human, even now, after... but the shadows were comforting... and suitable for tonight. <br>
<br>
Sabnie, the barmaid, came upstairs to see if he wanted anything; he motioned her away with a flick of his hand. She would do that all night, he imagined. She seemed to think she was an important operative for her boss' masters, the Unseen Hands... though in reality, Crow used her disdainfully, to entice new arrivals to the ciy, like that fool Tubal; the locals knew well enough to avoid her, most with looks of disgust she pretended not to notice. He wondered idly if she even considered actually double-crossing Crow and running away with one of her marks... he thought not. He had no fear of the Unseen Hands - indeed, they regarded him more warmly now than his former compatriots below the city - but he had respect for their reach, and the sharp knives usually found at the end of it. No, he decided, Sabnie would stay, and continue to do Crow's bidding, in this and who knew what else. He shrugged mentally; even if it had been his concern, her eventual fate interested him about as much as flies around a corpse, and in much the same way. There had been a time when it might have, but now... his vision of what was important had been broadened, and deepened. Hence, his presence here, tonight. <br>
<br>
As if summoned by thought the way some demons came to their name - not a totally inaccurate analogy, he realized - she appeared in the door way. She stood there for a moment, allowing all eyes to find her; it was purposeful, he realized. With her reputation, had she wished, she would be beside him before he knew it - and quite possibly dead in the same moment. <br>
<br>
Which was exactly why he had sought this meeting. <br>

Re: Plots (cross posted from VN boards)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A dark woman stood at the entrance to the door of Crow's Tavern in Qeynos. She stood with the door open, the rain of the Karana's falling behind her like wet tears or perhaps some cleansing force. She was hooded, and slumped over, shoulders pulled forward and face down. <br>
<br>
She waited, with that door open, the cool breeze of the season blowing the candles out on tables and sputtering the fire at the far wall. A group at a table some ways back growled angrily at her and approached. There was three of them, large broadshouldered humans with maces and muscles and scars. The didn't speak, the barked and hooted and burped like beasts. Thier cacophony only grew in anticipation as they noticed this dark robed one was a woman, and the thought of the pleasures they might have by her poisoned thier dim heads. <br>
<br>
The barkeep stood solidly where he was, made no move to call the guard. The other patrons watched casually, knowing a fight was coming and drank with anticipation. <br>
<br>
The mob approached closer, and made a semi circle around the woman. The drinkers in the bar leaned side to side and stood up to get a better view of the woman who was now hidden behind these men. The tavern waited, the men poked and chortled, the stopped quietly, thier senseless sounds chocking off slowly. There was a rustle of cloth. <br>
<br>
The men backed away as they looked at each other uncertainly. As they parted a face came into view, it had shoulder length soft white hair, now slightly matted and unkempt from the rain and the hood she had just removed. Her face was dark like the sky hours after sunset. Not black, but more blue/black. Her eyes were dark, and her face soft, but calculating. The room quieted and watched her, the men who had accousted her backed to a corner and sat, eyes wide. It was unclear if they feared her, or were merely stunned by the fact one so unholy was so deep in thier safe city. <br>
<br>
The woman swept the cloak off her shoulders, water sprayed in every direction, people flinched when it dropped on them, recoiling from the thought of such unclean water. Beneath the cloak was revealed a woman of battle. She wore adventurer's armor, slung a rapier and dagger to her belt. Her armor looked well worn and used. Not the fancy armor of a guard that saw little action, but that of one who went into those little known places, daring the certainity of foe and danger to the rewards of riches and fame. <br>
<br>
The woman stood just inside now, the door still open and scanned the bar room. Her eyes finally settled on a figure that looked at her without fear in his eyes, but perhaps held some in her heart. He sat in the shadows made by the fire, the play of orange light illuminating a human that looked of plots and danger. <br>
<br>
With a look around her, the woman walked directly to the man's table. A busty waitress with red locks ran to the door and shut it. The chill disapeared near instantly, and the room's partons resumed the conversations they had held a moment before. The dark woman came at last to the man's table, being carefully ignored by all but the man who sat there. He looked at her and smirked. She looked at him and did the same. <br>
<br>
&quot;Have a seat,&quot; He offered. She nodded politely, all the while seeming controlled anc cautious. <br>
<br>
After she had sat, she reached into her cloak and withdrew a note. <br>
<br>
&quot;You need my services?&quot; she inquired. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye Lady X'Tai, and in a very special way...&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;Have a seat,&quot; he offered. She nodded politely, all the while seeming controlled and cautious. <br>
<br>
After she had sat, she reached into her cloak and withdrew a note. <br>
<br>
&quot;You need my services?&quot; she inquired. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Lady X'Tai, and in a very special way... I sent the note to you... or, rather, I had it sent to the one I hoped was you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Xosha, the Thrice Bladed,&quot; she said, narrowing her eyes at having to repeat herself. &quot;You need my services then?&quot; <br>
<br>
Siaorah kept fighting the impulse to duck his head, to hide from his surroundings. He was different now, in ways he didn't even completely understand... yet, even so, old habits kept creeping in... the woman noticed. &quot;Relax my friend, I shall order us a drink. BARKEEP! Two of your best, please!&quot; <br>
<br>
This one was testing him. That much he could tell. She knew she had nothing to fear here; none would dare touch her. Even as friendly as he was with the Unseen Hands, should this one say the word, he would be dead and disappeared before her steps left the city... though he was not the person they thought he was, not anymore. And perhaps, that would be enough of an advantage, here... he nodded at Crow, if only to show his own familiarity with the organization, then continued. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes... and no.&quot; He hesitated. This would not be a normal request; how would she react? &quot;I am in need of an unusual service... but one only someone of your skills could perform.&quot; The woman sat still, waiting, not giving anything. He leaned forward; only boldness would serve, and he had his master's support in this. The woman smiled warmly and leaned in as well, playing at intimacy, no doubt to throw him off. Ignoring it, he continued. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is a person.. a young woman, who's life must be put in danger.&quot; Siaorah paused as the voice of a priest of Rodcet Nife floated over the city, urging all to cease conflict, to seek salvation... old irritation bubbled to the surface and broke across his face at the sound.. his attention returned as she asked, &quot;I see. How in danger?&quot; <br>
<br>
He focused. This was too important to go awry. &quot;Mortal danger,&quot; he answered. &quot;She, and everyone around her must believe she is to be killed.&quot; The assassin leapt at the qualifier: &quot;She is to BE killed or IS killed?&quot; <br>
<br>
Sabnie chose that moment to bring the mugs, most likely Crow's own Special Brew. She'd been too far away to eavesdrop, and the suddeness spoke to him, that she was trying to catch some of their quiet conversation while they were unaware; not likely, given that he knew her and her habits, and the assassin was unlikely to be surprised. He smirked though, as she snarled at poor Sabnie, who simply didn't know how over her head she was. Watching her already pale skin drain of blood was appealing, however, the image stirring something within him... <br>
<br>
The waitress quickly finished with her duty, then scurried away finally. Once alone again, Siaorah placed a firm hand on the table. &quot;She is NOT to be killed! That is of paramount importance! But - she must absolutely believe that she WILL be!&quot; <br>
<br>
The woman raised an eyebrow, whether because she was intrigued, or disdainful of his fervence, he couldn't tell. He began to speak, but she cut him off, shaking her head. &quot;I don't need to know.&quot; &quot;This much, you must,&quot; he pressed. &quot;She must believe that *I* have saved her from certain death. It will help if any onlookers believe also, though that is secondary.&quot; The next part would tell; he took a deep breath, then cast the dice. &quot;You must attempt to kill her.... and I must prevent you.&quot; <br>
<br>
The assassin was obviously shocked, disbelieve apparent on her face. &quot;YOU defeat... ME?&quot; Siaorah attempted a grin, his face completely unused to that motion. &quot;You see, then, how much relies on your skills? I could, of course, do no such thing.&quot; &quot;I do see... but how will you reward me for losing such face?&quot; <br>
<br>
Inwardly, Siaorah smiled. She had not committed, yet, but interest was shown, and the compensation issue approached. Outwardly, he simply nodded. &quot;That would be the question. I do not know what to offer you that would not be insulting. Perhaps you can tell me, what would be sufficient?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Money will mean so little to me, though it would also be nice to cover expenses,&quot; she replied. He nodded, expecting that. She pondered a moment longer, then added, &quot;Something tragic I think...&quot; Siaorah raised an eybrow to that, as she went on, more decisively. &quot;Hmm, may I ask WHY you need to save her?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; His response was immediate. He knew his master's feelings on this. It was not something he would reveal... or possibly even *could* reveal. He wasn't sure... and felt no desire to test it. Still, he may be able to satisfy her curiousity, to a point... She was already shaking her head. &quot;I need to know, sorry.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have... certain instructions... that will be easiest to accomplish if the girl trusts me. This would ensure it. There are other ways to gain her trust, to be sure, but none so swift and complete.&quot; She pondered this for a moment, staring at him intently as if to determine his resolve. &quot;Then I will need to know who have given you these instructions,&quot; she said finally. This time, it was Siaorah shaking his head. &quot;No. That is forbidden. I could not tell you if I would - and I would not. If that is a condition, then we have nothing further to discuss.&quot; He sat straight, prepared to leave.. or defend himself, for all the good it would do against one of her skill. <br>
<br>
Sudden inpiration came, as if across the Void. He knew it showed on his face, but in this case that was not to his detriment. &quot;I can tell you this,&quot; he offered, watching the assassin *not* move, either forward or away. &quot;It is whispered that the Thrice Bladed seeks one thing above all - supremacy for her kind.&quot; She nodded slowly, not fearing the truth - making her all the more dangerous, he thought. &quot;You are wise, sir,&quot; she replied. &quot;The one whom I follow does not threaten that, in anyway. The aims I am set to pursue may, indeed, indirectly *aid* that.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And how is that then?&quot; she demanded, not willing to be mollified easily. Siaorah shook his head sadly, saying &quot;I am prevented. I can say no more clear than that. Only that these are followers of light, as you would have it, and my instruction will lead to their downfall.&quot; <br>
<br>
She sat, staring at him, that inscrutable Tier'Dal face betraying nothing. Even knowing what he knew now, he culd not help but admire her training. She allowed the moment to stretch, and stretch, I am intrigued, enough to acept at the standard offer of 200 platinum coins for an action, and NOT a piece of work.&quot; He pondered her price... &quot;We shall see how I want to handle the action, that is up to me; do you have the 200?&quot; <br>
<br>
He sighed. &quot;I do not. But I believe I can get it before you will be required to act.&quot; &quot;That will be satisfactory. And the name of the woman?&quot; He breathed a small sigh of relief, knowing that the action was agreed to. &quot;Irys, a young half elven ranger of Surefall Glade.&quot; <br>
<br>
She stifled a gasp, but not before he caught it. Interesting... &quot;I know this one, it shall be done.&quot; He nodded slowly, a little thrown off by her almost eager acceptance. Well not his affair, as long as the action was accomplished satisfactorly. &quot;Very well. She has been known to seek the company of a more seasoned ranger; he would not be able to prevent you, but he could possibly interfere seriously. I will contact you soon with a time when I can insure he will not be around&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I understand,&quot; she replied, looking thoughtful now. Siaorah nodded, then hesitated. In his previous life he would have done certain things, but now... she noticed, and smiled, somewhat unpleasantly. &quot;Shall we shake on it then? Informal, but a tradition.&quot; Feeling a bit of relief, he accepted the offered hand. &quot;Then I shall hear from you in the usual fashion?&quot; Siaorah paused again; &quot;What way would you prefer?&quot; &quot;Contact the dark elf outside the gates of this city, he will know my network. I await details on time and location then; I also await the coin.&quot; He nodded affirmation. &quot;Yes. You will receive both.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then I am off. I must meet others it seems...&quot; He stood with her, moving his chair aside, turning to see... she was gone! The shadows were still and thick... and she was more at home in them then even he. No matter; it was her skill that he required, that and her complicity. Things were coming together nicely... and now, to contact his master, who would undoubtedly be pleased... <br>
