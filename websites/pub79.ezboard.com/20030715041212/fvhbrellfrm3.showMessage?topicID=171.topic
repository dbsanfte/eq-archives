In a short time, they had begun to come in answer to his calling. Most of the Violent Harvest had found a way to travel to this miserable, sunshine drowned speck of dirt and wood. It was not at all like his beloved Nektulos Forest which was cool and dark, with a constant mist swirling through the trees. The Faydark was a place of Pixies and Morning Dew, a breeding ground for weaklings and parasites. The Nektulos Forest was a place where only the strong survived, it was the playground of the Children of Neriak. Now, as twilight began to settle across the darkening landscape, those same children would choose a new place to play for a time. Once the Harvest was assembled, Zirrix led them to a place just outside the walls of their objective. It took Zirrix all of his discipline and control to concentrate, being so close to the thing he hated so very much. His entire being was taunt with anticipation of the night’s coming events. He could hear in the distance, over the walls, the many voices of his enemies. He could hear their high pitched conversations and gentle laughter, smell the scents of their food and incenses. Taking several deep breaths, he willed the red haze of battle to subside from his vision…for just a little longer. After assigning his forces, there turned out to be two full attack groups. Also, he had a number of auxiliary units to support them. It was not just the Teir’dal that hated the High Elves. Meanwhile, the bulk of the Imperial Strike force had assembled in the woods beyond view, and would be waiting for his signal. At his command they would attack the front gates, giving his two groups a chance to penetrate into the city itself. Then would the Time of Vengeance begin, then would the honor of the Empire be satisfied, then would the will of the Dark Creator Innoruuk be served. As the first stars began to sparkle in a clear Norrathian sky, Zirrix pulled a small whistle from his belt and gave a long, loud, shrill call.<br>
<br>
Almost instantly, a wave of flowing black hatred, composed of armor and swords, stormed out of the forest and crashed into the wall guard’s defensive positions. At the same instant, several balls of orange/red fire streaked from the same forest and smashed into the walls of the city itself. As battle was joined, Zirrix nodded once to his Casters, and both his groups suddenly vanished from sight. Moving under the spells of invisibility, silence and stealth, the General led his force past the carnage at the gates and into the city. Zirrix observed that the outside guards, while hard pressed, where holding their own against the Teir’dal attackers. He was not surprised, in fact he had planned on such a circumstance. He knew the Koada’dal were always on alert for such attacks, although none had every materialized in such force. Zirrix knew the many spies and traitors to the Empire that would have alerted the High Elven Council to an impeding attack. But, even if those miserable vermin could have guessed at Zirrix’s true objectives, they would not believe it. Such a future that was about to happen, was beyond the Koada’dal leaders to accept…and that would be to their everlasting torment and sorrow. Moving quickly past the gate guards, Zirrix felt the various High Elven protections and preventive magics dance like invisible lightning upon his skin. He knew the others in his force felt the same, as they all passed the many magical wards and spells protecting the entrance of Felwithe. But, Zirrix had with him the strongest, darkest and most skilled of Arcanists in all Norrath. The magical protections of Tunare and her bloodless freaks gave way to the forces of Innoruuk and, in a very short time, the members of the Violent Harvest did enter the city of their most hated foes.<br>
<br>
It took a few minutes for Zirrix to compose himself, and he could see the distress and momentary illness in the faces of the others in his force. Powerful magics not withstanding, Zirrix and the other followers of the Dark Powers stood now upon hollowed ground dedicated to Tunare and her creations. The emanations of Felwithe itself were harmful and sickening to the Respected Race and all who revered the Dark Gods. But, in a short while, the assault force was once again ready for battle. How many eons had it been since the beginning. How many times had these bloodless freak Lightcrawlers dare invade the Nektulos Forest and slay the noble guards within? Now, all that would be paid for by the Koada’dal people in pain and death. This night, the so called “Children of Light” would feel the wrath of the Dark father and the vengeance of the Teir’dal Empire. Looking to his assembled host, Zirrix gave the signal to begin. Thus, was the first page of a new chapter in the annals of Norrath written by the fury of the Empire, in the blood of the Koada’dal…<br>
<br>
Later, after the attack and for many years afterward, Bards sung sorrowful tales of the assault within Felwithe. They told of the strange silence in the city of the High Elves, and the Faydark forests beyond, where before the wind had carried Elven voices and music raised in joyous harmony. They told of the Teir’dal capture and ruination of the Golden Bridge. They told of the “Dark Terror” that had advanced deep into the city. They told of the desecration and polluting of the Pool of Harmony in the very heart of Felwithe by the forces of the Violent Harvest. They told of the scores of dead and maimed, all wounded and struck down by laughing shadows of blackest doom. They told of the chilling Teir’dal shouts of victory and passion which rose above the High Elven screams of pain and terror. They told of the Knights of Felwithe, cut down and slaughtered almost to a man, while making a futile attempt to stem the wave of death and destruction that washed over their beautiful home. They even sung of the single deep voice, clear and strong, that shouted over and over again praise and dedication to the name of Morrigu the Red Hand. The other races of Norrath did not need wonder at the sudden withdrawal of many High Elves from the landscapes of Norrath following the attack, of their somber and slow return to their forest covered continent. In time, the stories began to surface that there had in fact been no attack, that it was all a story created by the agents of Darkness to frighten and intimidate the other races of the world. But, one had to only look into the many haunted and anguished eyes of those Koada’dal who refused to speak of that night to know the truth of it. The truth of the power and might of Innoruuk, the Empire and the Violent Harvest. A truth that was long overdue...     <br>
