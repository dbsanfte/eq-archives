My name is Gofar.   I’m a Wanderer of the great Prexian guild, Blood Circle.  This morning, I had the unpleasant occasion of meeting Nulaak, a Heretic of you guild.  I had been camping the AC for some time in the hopes to obtain (of course) the ring for Jboots, for a guildmate (a wedding present to be more precise).  I had snared the AC early this a.m. and layed my first Starfire on my chosen enemy, when Nulaak crested a hill and proceeded to slaughter my target with great enthusiasm.  Now, you know and I know that the AC has a very broad camping rule.  As I understand it (and continually to follow by) is a first come, first serve policy.  This does not mean however, that the person who lays the most damage at a more accelerated rate, is the rightful owner of said corpse.  When I brought this to Nulaak’s attention he said, “I killed everything in the zone and had done all of the work, so this ring is mine.”  He then quickly looted and zoned heading in a southbound direction.  Now, I have to admit that I was surprised by how quickly he had dispatched the Sand Giant he had been fighting, as I had begun my attack on the AC.  However, in the game where “fairplay” is a goal, we all strive to abide by the same unspoken conduct.  Nulaak violated that conduct and it is the sole purpose of this post that this be brought to light and hopefully corrected.  I had attempted to solve this issue in game and had even gone to the lengths in locating an officer, Mullzy, in order to receive some assurance that this infraction would be revisited.  How you deem to correct this wrong I leave to you and Infinitus Vindicat’s personal honor.  Until that time, may your Gods (or Goddess’s) look over you.<br>

That I hope, had been established in my first post.  There is no doubt that between Nulaak's Necromatic Art and his horrific pet that he laid waste almost the entire zone.  I, for my part, kept to track and killed as often as I was able.  I concentrated on a formula given to me by a guildmate on killing spiders during the day and undead at night.  The killing of the undead, spawn various giants, in the hopes that by their deaths, you might trigger the AC.  I hadn't appeared in the zone to take advantage of Nulaak's efforts, but put forth my own to ensure that I too might have a crack at the AC.  It has been my understanding, that he (she <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) that initiates the attack and is able to (&quot;without assistance&quot; has been given as a qualificant as well) kill the mob, is entitled to its spoils.  Now, as we all know this game is random, hit and miss, and for that reason &quot;fair-play&quot; needs to be instituted.  Did Nulaak kill more mobs than I?  Certainly!! As a 56th Necromancer he should be quite skilled at killing.  Does this entitle him to the mob that randomly spawned near where I was hunting and had successfully engaged? No.  This is the issue and sole issue I wish to address.  I've heard nothing but good about IV and further, that Nulaak has a reputation for a fair player... just in this instance, that I have chosen to address, he is found lacking.  I appreciate the aid offered by his guildmates and would gladly accept it, as I myself am only in the endeavor of assisting one of my own.  Again, resolution is my only goal...<br>

This is a direct quote from Verant on kill stealing:<br>
<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission.<br>
<br>
Or you can look at it like this.<br>
<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of the &quot;AC&quot; for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing &quot;Gofar&quot;  without &quot;Gofar's&quot; specific permission.<br>
<br>
According to Verant, if you have engaged the monster, and do not give permision to another to kill it you are kill stealing.<br>
<br>
The AC in South Ro is FCFS, there is nothing in game that is FFA, that breaks the rules set forth by Verant and can get you warned, banned, or maybe just a stern lecture from a GM.<br>
<br>
This person who did steal the AC kill thought he could own the whole zone, Gofar was there, clearing things to get the AC to spawn also, he had the same right to be there as anyone else and he engaged the AC first.<br>
<br>
The question is, does your guild care about the behaviors of it's players?  I know Blood Circle does, and we have booted people over issues where honor was breached.  I will not tell you what you should do, or not do.  But cleary rules were broken and some one proved they are not very honorable. <p><br>

I had a Druid helping me track and keep me sowed, there were total of 3 in the zone when I arrived , Me , Druid and a lower level Troll. I was keeping the zone almost clear of all mobs like a wrecking ball throughout the zone, when the zone started getting more populated with 50ish casters perching themselves on top of the odd hill waiting for the AC. A couple of SG's, and Hatar were KS'd from me and nothing said. At the end of my 2-3 hour run through S Ro there was 5 of us hunting for the AC and I didn't stand a chance, so I left.<br>

I have read so many posts on the prexus boards in my EQ time about KS'ing of the AC, wether it be in Sro, OOT or wherever.

The spell in question, Starfire, the largest in my repetoire does significant damage.  However, what I did not have at my disposal was a pet, coupled with Necromantic spells that thrashed the AC before a 2nd Starfire could be cast!!  As you may or may not know, Defiler, is that the Starfire casting time is more than significant.  Could I've handled the AC alone? Aye, I could.  Discuss that in your council.  But what truly was the disturbing thing was the casual way Nulaak killed, looted, and zoned on an obvious KS issue.  To say that I was shocked is an understatement.  Foo, if you had taken the time to actually read my post, you would have noticed that the JBoots were not for me (thanks for pointing at the obvious: That I do have the ability to cast SoW - others only reading the post might not have understood that a Wanderer = a Druid, as you yourself had struggled with that concept).  I sincerely offer my apologies to all of those of IV whom I've bored with this issue.  Had I thought that IV's position was that of Foo's: &quot;I really think nothing will become of this incident because the words muttered by most that read it are &quot; Ugh, not another AC KS'ing&quot;...&quot;, I would not have bothered.  KS'ing apparently is something that us 52nd Wanderers will just have to accept, if a 56th level Infinitus Vindicat member is in the zone.  Thanks again for you time...<br>

Obviously a necromancer will be MUCH more effective in clearing a zone than a druid because of his pet. So surely he did most of the work.<br>
<br>
However, who did most of the work is irrelevant really, since what we are talking about here is the actual spawn itself. Its hard to know WHO acutally triggered the AC but he did spawn and you say you were on it first. <br>
<br>
Ok, well as anyone who camps the AC knows...theres extreme lag there especially if the zone is crowded. You cant tell if a mob is damaged..and from afar a snared mob looks to be just chugging along, no way to tell.<br>
<br>
I have seen countless incidents where the people involved believe they are seeing something they arent. Sometimes its lag, sometimes its pathing, sometimes ghosting. <br>
<br>
What you are asking for here, is not a resolution, its restitution. If we take your word, the word of a person we dont know, who may not be in possesion of all the facts, or outright lying, we are basically telling our guildmates we wont believe THEM over strangers. Fact is the only 2 people who know what happened is you 2.<br>
<br>
So you came here asking the GUILD to rule or make restitution for an event it was not a part of. You are asking us to take sides in a conflict between 2 people and make it a guild issue. When it is clearly NOT a guild issue. <br>
<br>
IV did not come along and KS BC's Ancient Cyclops, the conflict was between you two. We cant rule on this because we arent in possesion of ANY facts, just 2 versions of the same story. No conclusive proof you were on it first, no proof YOU made it spawn, only your word that you did...and that you were on it first and we dont know you.<br>
<br>
Would I think Eryls support would lend credibility to your story? Perhaps, if we just took his word and didnt realize he is speaking for you on behalf of your guild. He is doing a leaders job and thats commendable, but it doesnt change the fact that theres only 2 peoples opinions here. <br>
<br>
I guess what I am getting at is all the time people look to guilds to make a determination of an event and choose between a guildmate and a complete stranger.<br>
<br>
We cant do that..we cant make a decision with no facts, we CERTAINLY dont condone Ksing, and if Nulaak had even a few occassions of doing this in the TWO years ive known him, he might be suspect. But I am not going to stand here and condemn him for one incident after 2 years of knowing him to be an upstanding guy without more than your version of a story. However our council looks at this I will oppose a decision rendering a judgement. We have no basis to form one.<br>
<br>
In my mind, a guild/guild issue is something like when Bonds of Faith came to the arena and forced our smaller group out because they just wanted to. Thats a guild issue, an incident involving two people who happen to wear guild tags with no officers present saying &quot;this is policy&quot; or no guild people there in an official capacity is NOT a guild issue, its a personal one.<br>
<br>
Jumping someones calendar reservation or spot on the VS rotation is a guild issue, incidents of KSing are not guild issues if they are not a consistant act of the guild.<br>
<br>
I am sorry there was a conflict here, but I wasnt there and neither were any of the other officers of IV. Had we been there and seen what you say happened, we would take your side immediatly, but unfortunatly we werent. I will talk with Nulaak about this further in an effort to find out what happened.<br>

Now we have all been Ksed in this game I have even been Ksed on the AC when I was younger . Why have we not heard from Nulaak on this issue ? <br>
<br>
   Now I do not have a problem with your guild ,I have know a few of you from your younger days but I am sorry to say I do not know Nulaak ,and all I can say is from what I know he is lacking in Honor and has done a disservice to your guild and I'm sorry to all that this affects <br>

Whether a spell is resisted more often than not or another class does twice the damage really has no bearing on this matter.<br>
<br>
We have a druid who is claiming to have engaged a sought-after spawn.<br>
<br>
We have a necro who came upon him and outdamaged him to take the kill.<br>
<br>
They both claim to have been clearing the zone of mobs to trigger this spawn.<br>
<br>
There were no witnesses to this altercation, were there?<br>
<br>
As Backalley stated, it comes down to a druid's word against necro's situation.<br>
<br>
Now, I know neither person involved in this matter.  But, Gofarther, what would you have the IV Council do?  Believe you outright, thereby dismissing the word of and withholding support from their own guildmate?  Remember, it is your word against his.  How would you feel if someone went to your guild, presented the same story about you to its leaders, and your guild stood behind this other person?<br>
<br>
All that's been served by bringing this matter to a public board was to stick the IV Council between a rock and a hard place of either taking your word and betraying their own, or standing behind their own and dismissing your charges.<br>
<br>
Not a pleasant position in which to be.<br>

A GM could hear of this and ban your necro ,I dont think this is the intent or the responce that was ment . The fact that your Necro was a jerk ,looted and zone as fast as possible on the day it happend is what really pissed Gofar off  . What you guys plan on doing is your own choice not ours or Gofars ,as far as I am conserned ,until he proves me wrong your necro has no HONOR and by that has no sence of real loyalty to IV  for one does not dishonor his family ....<br>

To you all that I know ,<br>
Hope your days are going well and we get a chance to party in game and have some more fun .<br>
