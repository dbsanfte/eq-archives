  Steps from the Shadows..<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 Craken stepped towards the dark door. He took small steps, as to avoid being detected, but knew he was watched. After all, he is a warrior, and warriors tend to make noise. He quickly posts his message to the door, and runs off, making clatters with each step.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings Violent Harvest,<br>
<br>
The name is Craken Shadowshield, I write this note to request a meeting with your guild. I offer a time of relaxing, and a place to tell many stories. Perhaps this event could bring our halls closer together, or perhaps not, that is yet to be seen. I wish you well dark ones, and do hope this note is received well.&quot;<br>
<br>

ooc Making a RP event with 3 guilds, Evoluxa, Violent harvest, and Solus The time and date are yet to be announced. It will be a story telling event, much like the GM event that I attended in the tunnel of EC. Perhaps we can dismiss any interuptions and some of the younger folk can see what we are about. <br>

 Alluveal slips in and stands to the side of Craken. She bows. &quot;Greetings dark brothers and sisters. Aye, my guildbrother is correct, we wish to gather and speak of tales and learn more of one another. I know I am awaiting such a meeting with anticipation. My only concern is that Vresk will still be missing. He is missed greatly and I wish to speak with someone who would have me aid in his return. This has gone on long enough. If I must go through Innoruk's minions to get to him, so be it. I look forward to the challenge....&quot; <br>

 Vresk steps from a deeper part of the hall, intent on some destination. Upon hearing voices, he enters the main hall. He is little changed since his absence, at least in appearance. On his right bicep a tattoo made of velium ice stands out. It takes the form of the Dragon of Hate, and it catches your eye, it seems to move as if alive. Occasionally the Ambassador to Kunark absently brushes it with his taloned hands with a grimace, otherwise it is ignored. As he enters the main hall and sees those gathered he bows deeply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark tidingss, all. Hate with Honor Winnower. And to you as well Alluveal. I'm afraid a detailed search for the Plane of Hate will be largely unnecccessary. However, if you wish to go anyway, I would gladly join you in a hunt.&quot; <br>

 Alluveal's eyes widen slightly upon seeing the iksar meander in. She listens without interrupting, cocking an eyebrow at Vresk and crossing her arms in front of her chest. &quot;Well, back from our vacation are we? Dare I ask what trouble you caused?&quot; A coy smile teases the corners of her mouth. Her smile suggests a sense of relief upon her comrade's return, though she says nothing further, knowing she may bring about an uncomfortable tension in the room. &quot;Ahh, you wish to unleash your hatred on the plane OF hate? Indeed, I can't imagine what Innoruuk will do with you once you are up there . . .&quot; she smirks. Nevertheless, I am glad you have returned. Sheigh and I have something planned for you. So, prepare, scaly...&quot; <br>

 &quot;Very well, as you wish,&quot; Vresk winces once more. &quot;However, I will be away for thiss coming weekend. I am passt due in Cabiliss. From the ssound of thingss, they are nigh prepared to invade over the losss of their Ambasssador.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bowing stiffly, Vresk leaves the hall. To those who know little of him, he brings an air of stillness. To those who know him better, however, it is obvious that whatever he experienced in his absence left a mark on him both physical and...more. The younger members who pass him on his way deeper into the hall instinctively sidestep out of his way, not out of fear, but more a sense of distaste. The monk however, seems not to notice and is soon out of sight in the shadowy halls.<br>

<br>
 The Thresher watches Vresk depart, his violet eyes lingering upon the Iksar's back. He can sense the dis-ease in the one he calls scaled brother. The Reaper also had disappeared, and Khasirath is deeply concerned over the effects they both seem to be suffering.<br>
<br>
Inwardly he offers a mantra of Hatred to Innoruuk, praying that He will guide His Chosen, and that He will protect them from this lingering touch.<br>
<br>
Turning to the visitors with an appraising glance he nods his head thoughtfully. &quot;This sounds an interesting opportunity. I am wondering when you might be planning to hold this event. If my duties allow I would be very interested in attending. Learning the tales and dreams of other races and cultures has always been what you might call a hobby of mine.&quot; <br>

 Creapiing looked at the note that hung slightly askew on the door of the Violent Harvest guild, as if someone had hurriedly posted. She smiled, it was not uncommon for the very walls of this place to intimidate. She read, her eyes narrowing slightly. A place for the telling of stories...would it be a hall filled with noisy bards? Loud boisterous drunks ranting? Fundamentally it did not matter. Any place where the stories of Norrath were told was a place of importance for the Violent Harvest. <br>
<br>
ooc sounds like a great time for everyone, I look forward to a time and place <br>
