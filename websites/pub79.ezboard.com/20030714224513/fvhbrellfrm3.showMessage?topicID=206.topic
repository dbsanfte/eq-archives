Stretching, then wincing, she reached to the bedpost where her robe was carefully hung.  Not wanting to disturb Vidraj’s slumber, she made her way silently to the living chamber and sat in front of the hearth.  She placed a few new logs into the hearth and watched as they became consumed by the glowing embers. <br>
<br>
She closed her eyes and drank in the warmth of the fire.  The hurts of the morning subsided somewhat, but she knew in time they would once again intensify.  Even the elixirs that Payle had supplied her no longer masked what was happening.  The years of battle and crusading were taking its toll, even if she was unwilling to admit it.<br>
<br>
With a gleam of defiance in her eye, she stood up and turned to the large shelf on the south side of the room.  She made her way to it and pressed her palm on a bronzed plaque adorning the wall beside it.  Silently, the shelf rolled to the side, revealing an entrance to a cavern below.  She lit the lantern that was sitting on the floor just inside the door, then began her descent into her private work chamber.<br>
<br>
She recalled the first time Pravdameer had been invited here.  He had been quite surprised at the extent of her research.  She had often since sought his counsel on various experimentation techniques.  He was, without question, a master of … the darker arts after all.<br>
<br>
She lit the other lanterns on the table and looked for the tome.  It would be the key to completing her objective.  Her pursuit of eternal life had all but dwindled after the failures of her previous attempts.  She had all but resigned herself to servitude to the magics and potions of the shamaness.  Then she had received word of the unearthing of the final tome penned by Miragul the Necromancer.  She knew she would secure it, no matter what the cost.  It would, of course, end up costing her soul, but nothing else mattered … nothing<br>
<br>
It had taken almost a year of  tracking, bribing, assassinating, manipulating, and extorting, but she was finally led to the gnome enchanter that now possessed the tome.  As she glared at the elderly enchanter, she noted the fear in his eye.  It was a most intoxicating feeling.  She knew she was revered and feared throughout Norrath.  The Violent Harvest was indeed delivering the message of Hate.  Those not of the Chosen race could do nothing less than succumb to the will of Innoruuk.  Foolish ones that resisted met painful ends to their existence.<br>
<br>
As she exited the enchanter’s home with the Tome of Miragul, she nodded to a shadow at the side of the house.  There would be no word of what happened here today.  There would only be the discovery of a rotting corpse.<br>
<br>
Selilya laid her hand on the tome.  The time had come, she knew.  She thought about the steps she’d already taken.  It seemed so many, many years ago that she started this journey into madness.  She’d followed the instructions given in the notes, the scribbles, the tattered parchments … she harvested the components called for.  She glanced up at the shelf that still held the extracts from McMad's finger, Minz’s eyes, and some young paladin’s ear.  Strength, Stealth, Stamina….all required to defeat death.  Yet, the resulting potion failed to deliver.  She watched as several “volunteers” writhed in agony after drinking the potion.  She screamed in rage as they crumbled to the floor and almost instantly became dessicated shells.<br>
<br>
After the failures, she threw her efforts back into the Harvest.  She fulfilled her duties as Winnower relentlessly, dutifully, almost joyfully.  The Violent Harvest was spreading its tendrils of influence on every continent.<br>
<br>
But the tome…she didn’t have the tome.  <br>
<br>
Upon returning from the enchanter’s abode, she pored over its pages.  Now it was time.  There were going to be more journeys required.  More harvesting.  More madness.<br>
<br>
But she decided it was time.<br>
<br>
She reached for a pen and sat at the table.  She wrote two notes.  One for her husband.  He would understand.  He knew the madness would someday return and steal his wife’s existence as he knew it.  He had always loved and cared for her, even if he never truly understood her.<br>
<br>
The other note she addressed to the current Reaper of the Harvest.  This was quite a difficult task for her.  She’d devoted her whole life to the cause of Hate.  Many years of spreading the message had taken place.  She was so very proud of what had been accomplished.  With a lump in her throat, knot in her stomach, and a tear on her cheek, she penned the words of resignation.<br>
<br>
She picked up the notes and the Tome of Miragul and crept back upstairs.  She would drop the note off for the Reaper later.  For now, she dressed, then packed some belongings in her travel pouch.  The journey to find Life would begin this day.  <br>
<br>
She lightly kissed her sleeping husband, laid the note on his dressing table, and made her way to the front door of the cottage.  She sighed heavily, but walked out into the morning mist on her way to the guild hall.<br>
<br>
The guards at the grange gate saluted crisply as she walked by them.  She made her way to the Reaper’s office, laid the note on his desk, then swiftly turned and walked out.  As she passed through the gate, she turned, gazed upon the place she knew as “home” all these years, and nodded.  Home, indeed.  It truly was.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the mist seemed to swirl about Selilya, Winnower of the Harvest.  As the air cleared, the guards noted that she had vanished.<br>

With this story, Selilya concludes her tenure with the Violent Harvest.  The time has come for her to pursue other interests in the world of Norrath.  She's still just as evil, but now, consumed with a mission.  Look for more stories in the future.<br>

It was very nice bit of work there.  Your research failed, if it had worked.  The Rangers and Druids of Tunare would be after it to destroy it, because Tunare didn't create eternal life, and she didn't want anybody to create an elixer for it!  /kneel<br>
