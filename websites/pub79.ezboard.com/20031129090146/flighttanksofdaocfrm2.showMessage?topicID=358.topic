Getting used to your own class I suppose. I mention the infil because we share, or in their case abuse, the DW line.<br>
<br>
What puzzles me is that we all know your Base melee skill, Slash/ Crush/ Thrust dictates your minimum damage done. Your &quot;Advanced&quot; skill (mercs dont have) dictates your chance to do maximum damage.<br>
<br>
Presumably in this case DW is the infils base skill and CS his advanced. As DW is his base (auto nerf mercs maybe) then why, and I've seen this alot wit infils taking purps in DF, do infils raise their base DW to nothing and still do massive damage almost all the time?<br>
<br>
My Bro's infil has CS at 50 and DW at....wait for it.....10! thats right 10, and it seems to make almost no difference to his abilities. Many infils have now told me this. They ridicule DW at best (who can blame em) His argument was that he needed the points for Stealth and Envenom of course but...sheeesh...<br>
<br>
I know many Merc's here have done constant tests. Many other pallies, Arms too. It is always argued that there must be a minimum base otherwise diminishing returns, unstyled you'd suck, often even styled you could suck.<br>
<br>
Are infils a special case? I thought there were no special cases?<br>
<br>
This is and has got to ba a basic math excersise after all.<br>
<br>
My base is 39 with items making it 51. Due to Mythics earlier comments about going above 50 getting real minimal returns I didn't take it much higher. I'd be frightened to go much lower.<br>
<br>
Why is this? Are we all making a mistake and need to learn the infils secret? Have they just exposed a flaw?<br>

<br>
Without putting any points in it a merc/inf/ranger/bm gets 37.5% chance to double swing. Now add in +11 from items and a spec of 25 in it. And that inf is now swinging a bit over 50%. Having 50 base dw will only add another 12.5% but cost a huge amount of spec points better spent elsewhere.<br>
<br>
That 12.5% extra chance to swing translates to even less damage, because the offhand doesn't benefit from styles and misses more, making a very small amount of the total damage in actual fights. <br>
<br>
Now consider that most of the dw styles are pretty mediocre/poor and can easily be replaced by  CS/weapon spec lines. The only dw style that I use regularly myself is the L50 style dual shadows as a merc, that and flurry for mercs only give something extra and because as a merc there isn't much else to spec in it makes it worthwhile to goto 50 but hardly for an inf.<br>
<br>
(There are a few other styles in dw spec like the stun chain which is useful in specific conditions to a merc but one can do without but totally useless to infs who can't parry and have better stuns (dragonfang and perf. chain) available to them).<br>

I challange you to prove this. I would really like it to be the case, but i've seen nothing in my own testing, or in other peoples tests, that shows this to be true. I would really love to be proven wrong though, since i'm spec'ed 50 in DW. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nirala>Nirala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mercenary Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 695<br> <font color=#000000>(10/1/03 11:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Question from the back of the room!!! please...</span><hr size=1> Okay.  The Growth Rate (for simplicity's sake, the style multiplier) is based on your spec in the line of the style you use, DW in this case.  This is then multiplied by the base damage (generated by your Base weapon spec of whatever type you're styling with).  Now, the easiest way to verify this would be to respec on Pendragon.  With 50 Base weapon spec, test one of the low lvl styles (not the starter style) on one of the grays outside Cammy with super low DW, then spec it all the way up, and see what your new cap is. <p>Nirala Kindred<br>

Thanks, for the clear concise explanation. you have, I think answered my question. I think you nailed it, as I said I' not experienced with an infil although I know many here have them. The sharing of our DW line always makes us curious about others that use it and their benefits from it - if any. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Xainder,<br>
I agree with your point. In my own tests there is no DW style (DS the jury is still out on that one due to a re-spec) that increases my damage signifigantly over my base style in general. It is not only that DW styles are poor, but we must continue to use our base styles for results in many situations.<br>
<br>
My argument remains the same; Many classes receive an advanced weapon spec with unique abilities and or damage etc. They never go back to their base styles nor have to.<br>
<br>
The Mercenary receives, no matter how you wish to define it, the equivalent of two &quot;base&quot; weapon styles. And, remember, the Merc also receives the same penalties of having to spec two weapon styles that all other AWS characters have without the benefits.<br>
<br>
The only &quot;defense&quot; I am given is that it gives the Merc more &quot;chance&quot; to swing the off-hand. This, as some try to argue DW is AWS, is an awfully poor substitute.<br>

He is absolutely correct. The unstyled damage isn't based on DW but your style bonus when using DW styles is based on your spec in DW. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xainder>Xainder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#000000>(10/1/03 3:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The question...</span><hr size=1> I stand corrected. DW Spec does in fact directly effect the 'damage bonus' and the 'damage cap' of a given DW style. my tests were very quick, and with an old copy of Xainder, but the results are obvious.<br>
<br>
DW: 44+5 (6 Attacks)<br>
Flank: Damage Cap = 233, Average Bonus Damage = 537<br>
<br>
DW: 50+5 (6 attacks)<br>
Flank: Damage Cap = 241, Average Bonus Damage = 573<br>
<br>
As i said, these were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> quick tests, but conclusive enough for me to show that a higher DW spec does in fact give you higher damage and damage caps when doing DW styles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nirala>Nirala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mercenary Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 696<br> <font color=#000000>(10/1/03 4:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The question...</span><hr size=1> Grayswandir, I'm curious what styles you use.

Don't compare your brother's inf DW with your merc's DW. Infs did not get a damage boost with v1.62, just mercs. Our DW line is no longer the same as inf.

And flank chain is on toolbar 4 for keep gates (they are good for one thing, low endurance!) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A> at: 10/2/03 12:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danyan@lighttanksofdaoc>Danyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#000000>(10/2/03 2:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The question...</span><hr size=1> Hmm I use flank in RvR all the time.

This will determine your standard unstyled or offhand damage, modified by your offensive stats.<br>
<br>
The same goes for a merc. Let's clarify this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The style bonus which is applied to mainhand is affected by your spec in the 'advanced' weapon spec. Basically, the advanced spec is the spec with styles you can do with more than one type of weapon (eg pole arms, DW --as long as you have 2 weapons--, 2Handed and Critical Strike moves.<br>
<br>
Speccing and +ing to CS or DW will mean when you do a CS or a DW style you have a higher damage cap. I am slightly curious how this works, seeing as style modifiers are supposed to be fixed (is flank really 85% is you don't have any DW spec??), but. Honestly, I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>way</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> through caring. My non-SC'd merc chews up orange slash-resistant mobs with no offensive RAs at all.<br>
<br>
OK. The DW styles are sucky. Nothing much has changed, maybe a few dodgy% here and there, but DS and DT have their benefits (probably 1 or 2 fumbles from an OJ mob means you are spared about 120 damage?). What the DW styles do have going for them is utility.<br>
<br>
Not perfect utility, because we have evade1 and nothing amazing coming off that compared to our parry-stun, but at least we have a parry stun which I use on Needletooth devourers in Barfog, and also that Skald who I got twice in Doden's gruva. Haha.  But we have a Bleed that we can refresh whenever we like (even if it don't interrupt casters at all) and if we attack a Neutral mob, we can nerf their attacking speed (which helps us a lot) before the fight has even begun. <br>
<br>
Our Anytime sucks, but don't use it. Use Slash-Crush-Thrust anytime, or get in position (you're probably already in it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and use DS. Ration your Endurance if you're in a long drawn- out fight and do DS every 3 or 4 hits. Who said only Paladins get Gain over Time?<br>
<br>
DW styles offer a lot of choice and utility for PvE, a bit harder to make the most of them for RvR. We could still use something to make Tendrils worth using, a back-based equivalent of Flank-Rain (or of Flank-Dark for RvR, seeing as we have 3 styles in this weird triangle and they have been forsaken somewhat) and an anytime that people don't laugh at, but we're not missing out on all that much. At least, not unless you're like me and you want Body bleeds to stack with Cold bleeds.<br>
<br>
-Blame, EXCAL<br>
<br>
I used to hate DW styles, then I realised they were actually sort of acceptable.<br>

As you can see it's modified by your spec in the line in question and also by your base weapon spec (since that affects unstyled cap). <p>----<br>

It's a constant value to compare different styles.<br>
<br>
The growth rate is not the multiplier and cannot be used as a percentage. You put the growth rate in the formula and you get the multiplier. It's the multiplier that changes based on your spec and swing speed. Which then you multiply to the base dmg to get the style bonus. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A> at: 10/5/03 12:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Old-Timer</span><br>  Posts: 523<br> <font color=#000000>(10/5/03 3:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> clarification</span><hr size=1> I'm a bit confused here, and we're off on a tangent but...<br>
<br>
OK, so you take your DW spec and your growth rate (100% say) and you end up with straight 50, if you've got 50+0 for example.<br>
<br>
So then you times this 50 by weapon speed, which is a super-heavy axe of 5.0sec, meaning you've got 250? And this is the Multiplier, if I'm following this (bah early morning).<br>
<br>
So then you divide the 250 by your base damage cap (mmm, say 200, this guy is a mean Troll)<br>
<br>
What I ended up with for my style cap result is 1.25, which sounds a bit low <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When you combine the spec and the growth rate, should you use the growth rate as a straight figure and not a %?<br>
<br>
In this case, the styled cap would be 125, which sounds a tiny bit more reasonable, but still a rather low.<br>
<br>
The bit that gets me is dividing the multiplier by your base cap... won't this mean that somebody with crap base damage will have a much higher damage cap?<br>
<br>
I mean, if our Trol had a base damage of 2, his style cap would be in the region of 1250.<br>
<br>
I'm getting that feeling people have, when they know they're missing something huge and obvious.<br>
<br>
My initial point, however, was that to reap full benefit of the growth rates, the person must have 50 in that spec. Any less, and their growth rate is gonna be taxed before it comes into play. And if the person does have 50 spec, their style multiplier will use the 'whole' figure.<br>
<br>
Ohh, my head.<br>
