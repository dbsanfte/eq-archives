The Human said in an almost shocked tone of voice.  <br>
<br>
Rayneth Sithren was a great prophet, unsurpassed in wisdom and care. How in allthe hells would one such as you even get CLOSE to him? Methinks you're lying priest. You KNOW I disapprove..&quot; the Human sighs &quot;I guess since you choose not to cooperate, I will kill you now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the Human could get his spell off, Darkrayne spoke to him in Koada'Dal. &quot;I am the bastard child of Zenthra Versayth and Merthiste D'Arnak, High Priest of Innoruuk slain by the hands of your people!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Human's spell was interrupted. &quot;YOU! You are the son of Merthiste? So you are in fact the one that slew the great prophet. What an amazing find then. I shall take you back to the Feir'Dal, the rewards they will offer for your head, especially alive to torcher you themselves. My campaign to take over the monarchy of your pitiful city will be funded for the rest of my life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what will you do when you take the throne Lighty? No one will accept you.&quot; Dark said. &quot;Then they shall die instead.&quot; The Human responded. &quot;You have far worse enemies to worry about then myself, by slaying me, you will achieve nothing but wasted time&quot; Dark said a flood of thought racing into his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Begging for you life? How degrading to your race. You should be ashamed of yourself.&quot; The Human said/<br>
&quot;It is you that will be begging for your life. For you will never claim the throne, you haven't the  man or magic power to destroy our whole race, let alone the forces that will be marching upon you through the Ambassador's daughter. Humans, Dark Elves and others alike will fight side-by-side once they realize your true identity.&quot; Dark said. &quot;How is that so priest? I see no reason why they would help the likes of you.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, not because of who we are. You are correct in that. However, you will pose a threat, genocide of one race will only lead you to have to do such a thing again and though none will care about us, they do care about themselves. All Norrath will be coming to destroy you. But you wouldn't even get Neriak, let alone anything else, why, you can't even keep one scrawny priest in your clutches.&quot; Darkrayne said running out the door that was open. The Human tried to get a spell off but it was too slow to cast. He moved out into the hall to try and snare the cleric there...but the cleric was gone...<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkrayne wearily darted into the main hallway and down the next door, he remembered this as he was dragged through the halls. Stopping at his chamber of imprisonment, he snatched up his garb and gated out of the Underground's lair and into the Bank of Neriak, surprising a few civilians of his lack of cover, which was not a priestly thing to do, Dark readied himself there.<br>
Still very weak from his beatings, Dark sat and invigored himself as well as curing his wounds. He had bought himself a little time at least. He would make his escape to Highpass. The Human would not seek him there, as the guards and Dark didn't exactly see...eye-to-eye.<br>
<br>
Dark set off, taking the river the whole way out, he soon was greeted by the earthy scent of Nek forest, and the sights and sounds were most beloved as to what he had been seeing....A faint clap of thunder and the first drop of rain dripped on Dark. Not caring this time of Karana's tomfoolery, Dark started off to Highpass.<br>
<br>

<br>
I originally believed that Feir'Dal were Wood Elves, but i was told otherwise by some that i hold in high regard. So i changed my beliefs going with the more experienced one's word. <br>
<br>
Turns out i was the correct one afterall. <br>
the Koada'Dal are the High Elves, not the Wood Elves as i have in my story. There are a few references to that in my story, but i'm too lazy to change them so i wish to clear up any confusion...from henceforth i will refer to the different Elvish races of Norrath correctly.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading  my story thus far, soon to come, my blunderings at my Ceremony of Binding. if you weren't there to see it, you'll get an in-character and out of character view on it i hope it brings you a good laugh or two...<br>
well i bid you a good day..<br>

<br>
Dark was now well known in Highpass, he had gained a reputation of his deeds and no longer would the guards treat him like a common orc, or a lowly Ogre.<br>
<br>
Dark, though his hatred for the followers of the followers of light was quite evident, grew accustomed to working with them in a common cause. Choosing to just sit back and keep quiet, Darkrayne survived his encounters, curing any battle wounds the warriors took. He knew full well if he were to open his mouth only unpriestly things would come out. <br>
<br>
Tolerance was his biggest ally in these slightly dangerous parts of Norrath. These orcs were no deathfist scouts, they were mean, some even took on skills of the rogue trade. Some were intelligent enough to form bands, guilds if you will. Dark struck one down that was of the Wicked Crown.<br>
<br>
During his stay in Highpass, Darkrayne was approached by a Half Elf speaking so fast her words came out as gibberish. <br>
She was asking of his skills it turned out. But not those of being a healer, those of what his reputation had grown to be.<br>
About a week ago, the Half Elf was with her newly wed husband when they were attacked by a Griffin in the Karanas.<br>
The Half Elf's husband sacrificed himself for her to get away.<br>
She ran here to Highpass where she heard of a being that could just speak a word and his foe would fall. She now sought after him, to not save her husband as he would by now be griffin waste, but for Darkrayne to kill said monster.<br>
The Half Elf also said something about this Griffin to be legendary as well and needed a legendary hero to defeat it.<br>
&quot;Grim Feather ate my husband, please...help me put my husbands soul to rest.&quot; Darkrayne laughed once, but the look she gave him meant she was serious. &quot;I prayed to Tunare that she would send you to my aid, please! I beg you do this for me&quot;<br>
<br>
After a pause Darkrayne spoke, &quot;You approach me, claiming a message from your goddess? AND you ask me to do something in HER name? Were you not serious, I would almost have to....I must tell you now, I am no hero, and ESPECIALLY not the servant of that being you mentioned. It is folly for one such as you or I to mess with beings so great as is Grim Feather.&quot; Darkrayne was interrupted, &quot;But...the stories about you, they say you can strike any foe down with just one word&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, if the one word summons my magic and strikes an already weakened being down yes, just the one is all that's necessary.&quot; Darkrayne smiles evilly &quot;But...the stories&quot; Darkrayne interrupted her &quot;Are just that, stories.&quot;<br>
&quot;And my husband's death?&quot; The half elf spoke<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, if you have any remains of him, i could attempt to ressurect him..don't know how clean he will be, might be a bit smelly too.&quot; <br>
&quot;HE WAS EATEN WHOLE&quot; the Elf protested<br>
<br>
&quot;Then that would make for remains tough to come by wouldn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The follower of Tunare sadly departed his presence. <br>
<br>
Darkrayne walked into Highkeep to visit a certain banker.<br>
<br>
More to come... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udarkrayne2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkrayne2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/17/02 2:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Young, full of hate, a formless arm of Innoruuk appea</span><hr size=1> Upon resting up, engagning in rigorous activities of slaying hapless orcs, Darkrayne's big day approached. <br>
<br>
He was going to increase rank in The Violent Harvest. <br>
<br>
He was excited..something that irked him. Excitement was for the weak...even he couldn't keep it down though so he went through with the misery. Darkrayne used his gating ability to make a fast stop near Neriak, where he visited The Grange.<br>
In the library he dug up tremendous numbers of scrolls, some of which seemed to be a bit burnt for some odd reason. <br>
<br>
More books...more scrolls. Darkrayne looked for the charter of The Violent Harvest for inside that Bible, was everything he needed to learn for the upcoming ceremony.<br>
 Muttering an unpriestly word he slammed yet another tome shut. Dust flew into his nose and he sneezed up a storm.<br>
After about an hour's worth of looking, Dark finally found The Charter...shoved in with common books...obviously the last user was either drunk when they put it away or didn't realize what they held in their hands as the book was upside down and greatly misplaced. <br>
<br>
&quot;Someone in the Triad needs to get one of the slaves to get their butts in here and clean up, this is NOT how a library should be. And WHAT in the hells is up with these burnt pages? Why are they still here if they're so important, shouldn't someone retranslate them onto a clean sheet?&quot;<br>
<br>
more gripings of that sort escaped through Darkrayne's study time as he read up on how a Harvester to be was to act at his ceremony..a very humbling experience. He still rubs his knees from kneeling so long. <br>
<br>
A paragraph caught Darkrayne's attention. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Seed-become-Harvester must swear upon their own blood, that they will abide by the Code of Conduct of the Violent Harvest, that they will remain true to the vision of the Violent Harvest, and that they will do all that they can to aid others so bound to the vision. The oath must be concluded with this, &quot;Let Innoruuk bind my blood in stone if I fail&quot;. This is the Oath of Binding.&quot;<br>
Violent Harvest Charter pg. whatever paragraph whatever <br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo...I must swear upon my blood to uphold the Harvest. I can do that. I will prepare a speech to awe even the Reaper...mayhaps I'll get a bit of a raise in my pay even&quot; *Darkrayne chuckles to himself*<br>
<br>
The following day, Darkrayne gathered with everyone at The Dragon of Hate. His helm removed and his weapon belted, as was customary being at such divine presence. <br>
Showing up late was the last thing Dark wished to do, he had had an encounter with the Underground that very day just 15 minutes before the ceremony was to begin. There was only one would-be assassin so Dark smote him down and hid the remains where some needy Troll would probably devour it. Running to the Dragon of Hate Darkrayne finally arrived, embarassed (another weakness he despised in himself) he shirked off a passing prostitute's remark of being cute and purple or something like that.<br>
<br>
At the ceremony, many things went on, his Sponsor, the now Dread Overlord Shaede gave him the rest of what he needed to do minutes before he actually had to do them. Thanking her for laying such stress on him in such timely fashion he went through the entire ceremony flawlessly...until the oath came.<br>
<br>
Being expected only to quote &quot;Let Innoruuk bind my soul in stone should I fail&quot; Darkrayne rattled off his speech smoothly...<br>
After giving the cleric a weird look, Khasirath, the Reaper of Violent Harvest, finally spoke in calm composure &quot;Repeat now the Oath priest. Let Innoruuk bind my soul in stone if i fail.&quot; <br>
<br>
Darkrayne opened his mouth to protest but could not overcome his embarassment...he turned 3 shades of purple hitting close to beet even before he stumbled about and finally blurted the oath properly.<br>
<br>
Laughter arose from the crowds but was soon silenced and the Ceremony continued...this was Darkrayne's first and last time, so he thought, that he would ingest the brew of the vine. <br>
<br>
<br>
() () (- that was the incharacter view now for my out of character view.<br>
<br>
i was all proud of my speech i wrote out on a little piece of paper and had sitting in front of me when i had to do the oath, which i DID say at the end of swearing by the blood that flowed yadda yaddy and stuffs.<br>
<br>
but it was to be said as a stand alone phrase. <br>
<br>
when i found out i was just supposed to say that one line, i actually got a big grin on my face in the real world behind this computer screen. it was a good laugh and i was informed that someone else had done the same thing as well so everything was all good. Wasn't the end of my follies, because i had to work that night i had to leave the meeting early. i missed many important things, i still addressed certain people as titles they no longer were...and really messed up in a few other things also. oh well, i hope those of you that got to sit through my ceremony again (if anyone even READS these lol) <br>
got another chuckle...that's how things should go in life, take everything with a grain of salt and a bucketload of sugar =)<br>

<br>
Pain was Darkrayne's companion, pain and the tip of the poisoned blade that remained in his body near his heart from a failed assassination attempt from The Wicked Crown.<br>
The poison was of the kind that degraded, not just one's body, but also their mind. <br>
<br>
What seemed an eternity ago, but was just two days, Darkrayne was travelling the Southern Plains of Karana. It was during one of his meditation sessions to his lord Innoruuk, that one of the Neriak underground found him...vulnerable. Stealthily creeping up to Darkrayne, he applied his poison carefully and plentifully. One slice, and it would be over, one jab, and Darkrayne would soon be his to take back to Neriak for the bounty on his head, 35,000 platinum and a title for the kidnapper of Ambassador Rylan's daughter Natori. Not to mention the additional 5,000 platinum and a finely bred war horse from the underground leader himself. The assassin, now right behind Darkrayne, reaches out to slice his throat. Darkrayne moved at the last second though, unintentionally avoiding his doom. Muttering a curse the assassin backstabbed the cleric. Spinning on his heel, unbelting his Morning star in one motion the Assassin was knocked onto his back, dazed. Darkrayne spared no moment to heal his wound, unaware of the potency of the poison in his system. Seeing the symbol of the underground, Darkrayned disposed of the assailant with one more well-placed blow to the assassin's head.<br>
<br>
It was about at this time Darkrayne realized there were still underground spies even this far into Antonica. He sought after his parter, Natori, and together they killed most if not all of the scouts this far out. It was during the eve of their last day of fighting, also the day before Natori traversed the great world of Norrath visiting Kunark and The Overthere. That Darkrayne really started feeling the effects of the poison for it was this day that the toxic brew struck his heart. Everything the cleric used to be was thrown to the wind like seeds of grass to be tossed about. Darkrayne, notorious for his unfeelingness, started experiencing weird sensations, that of frustration, anger, love, helplessness and confusion all mixed into one. Delusions and temporary dementia flashed into his mind. Darkrayne stalked off into the more forested region of Karana, there he grew dizzy and fainted not waking until the morn. <br>
<br>
Come daytime, the sounds of a lumbering treant that was VERY close woke the cleric up from his unrestful slumber.<br>
Groggily Darkrayne turned to see one headed straight his way. Readying a spell in his mind should a confrontation be imminent, Darkrayne reached fo rhis morning star...it was not there.<br>
<br>

<br>
storymode on<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering the previous night Darkrayne, in a fit of madness had thrown his morning star down at Natori's feet in the uppermost room with the Aviaks of South Karana. <br>
<br>
He was no match for pure mind attacks against the druidic treants, much to his chagrin. He had no choice but to dive into a nearby bush and hope the treant hadn't seen him.<br>
<br>
Slowly slowly, the treant passed the spot Darkrayne once was  at and paused...but continued on..brething a sigh of relief, Darkrayne retrieved his morning star from the Aviaks. upon his arrival, he found Natori had gone without a trace.<br>
<br>
After a few days, Darkrayne got word that Natori had run off into the lands of The OverThere in Kunark...away from all activities of The Wicked Crown. Knowing she would need his healing powers being a warrior, Darkrayne, not having anything better to do left for Kunark.<br>
<br>
Much time and blood was spilt in Kunark, a few unmentionable things happened too, as Darkrayne's mind was becoming more and more confused from the poison. During his time there, Darkrayne felt what would have been called feelings and emotions for Natori, between you and i. After a bit of care though, he was soon on his way to recovery, and he soon became himself again, with only a few brief waves of emotion which Darkrayne shrugged off. However, after having experienced such emotion...he may never again be able to be completely rid of those diseases (emotions).<br>
<br>
Eventually Darkrayne received a summons from a peon to show up to the Dragon of Hate for a meeting. Little did he expect the things that would take place, or the people he would...or would not...see.<br>
<br>
During the last bit of the ceremony, Xilau had been named a Dread Overlord, and almost, as if on cue, the second she was named such a worthy title, snipers from the Wicked Crown, until now hid in shadows, had a clear shot on Darkrayne as he stood up to greet a newcomer..each one took a shot and not one missed. Dark fell to his knees murmuring a spell of healing to alleviate his pain and to lessen his injury before passing out. But it was not until another heal spell from a guildmate that Dark was able to begin recovery. He spoke of the Wicked Crown, the faction and conglomeration of Teir'Dal, Feir'Dal a very unlikely alliance, Humans Dwarves, everything. Their sole purpose, is to overthrow the Queen, to return power to the people. Ambassador Rylan was the last uncorrupt person that stood in the underground (Wicked Crown)'s way. He had to be removed...and his daughter Natori Rylan...just to be sure.<br>
<br>
Now that you are aware of Darkrayne *ahem* my situation, and my responsibility to the Queen, for she does not know that even her most trusted Vizier is corrupt...now that you know Natori's situation...she is the only one that can prevent this entire change fromtaking place...you MUST let her live, even if my life is forfeit...you must do what you can, in my next chapter of memoirs, i will write, my will, and i will tell all i know about The Wicked Crown...so that you may identify them in your travels and dispose of them. I have seen the leader but i could not handle him on my own...please i am begging you as a brother of the Harvest, take care of Natori, for i soon, may not be....strong enough...or have the will...i bid adieu.<br>
<br>
*Darkrayne closes his book, turns his head and closes his eyes...a tear actually drops from the corner of one. Ashamed of his weakness, he retires to bed, defeated* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udarkrayne2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkrayne2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/02 11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Young, full of hate, a formless arm of Innoruuk appea</span><hr size=1> The wind blew chill. Ill things were about to take place. Glaring into the unwarming sun, Darkrayne shouted curses to the inhabitants of The OverThere.<br>
<br>
Accepting his challenge, a Sarnak, whip in hand charged. <br>
Dodging the first strike barely, Darkrayne drew the creature back into the ambush...soon after all was done.<br>
<br>
It was about this time a messenger appeared from his former student Natori. &quot;The mistress wishes you to answer her summons in the frozen lands of Velious, along the beaches of Ice Clad Ocean.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;So be it, I must take leave of you now...were we more then just allies, I would request your presence..but this time..I go alone.&quot;  Darkrayne said no emotion marring his words.<br>
<br>
Swallowing a foul brew, Darkrayne was soon surrounded by a brief Lupine aura. Making his trip to the outpost short. <br>
The boats were having problems, so a little gnome awaited him, using her ability to translocate from one place to another.<br>
<br>
It was but a matter of moments that Darkrayne was at yet another gnomish caster, she too translocated Darkrayne to the Iceclad Ocean. Upon arriving, Darkrayne needed tend Natori's wounds for they were mortal. Not many words were spoken, none were needed.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until Darlkrayne and Natori slew Midnight that anything really happened. <br>
&quot;Darn, I need the other leg bone, not this one&quot; Natori said. <br>
&quot;Perhaps you will get lucky. I wanted to congratulate you my student, you have done well...you are now a full fledged Harvester, you have grown strong in arm and will. Soon it shall be time for me to make my final step.&quot; Darkrayne said.<br>
&quot;I would not have been able to reach such a level without your guidance. But...may I ask, what final step do you speak of?&quot; Natori asked. <br>
&quot;BAH, I only pulled that which was inside of you out. You are the one that got yourself this far. You had potential, and I allowed for yo uto access it, that is all. The final step which i speak of is my attack on the Underground.  I MUST put this folly to an end. We don't need another incident like what happened at the last ceremony. It is time, I will find their lair, sneak in and assassinate the Human Druid, for without him, their ranks shall surely fall. It is then t hat you will ride in with a legion of your own troops, and you will crush their miserable hides and drink of their blood freely.&quot; Darkrayne said<br>
&quot;The Thresher tells me all of the Harvest is behind you on this.&quot; Natori commented. &quot;Aye, I do not doubt that is so...but I must do this alone. We must bloody their nose, Crush their spirits, then humiliate them...What they did on sacred ground cannot be forgiven. Innoruuk will not stand for such, nor wil I!&quot;<br>
Darkrayne near started preaching. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I do not know fully what is up with this Human, but he is a key...a key to my past...and to my future.&quot; Darkrayne turns his head. &quot;Now...is the time...you must know of everything about me.&quot; Darkrayne took a deep breath for he knew what he was about to say was very controversial and would greatly affect his relationship with the warrior and ultimately the view others in the guild had on him. &quot;I...am the bastard child of Zenthra Versayth and my father, Merthiste D'Arnak, High Priest of Neriak.&quot; Before Darkrayne could finish, Natori went berserk, she knew where ths was leading. &quot;this is TWICE now that you have betrayed my trust, you, YOU said you were the only one I could trust yet you've betrayed me yet AGAIN!&quot;<br>
&quot;The time was not right Natori, I did that for your own safety. This is a truth you WILL accept or die. For I cannot allow you to have such knowledge and yet breathe. Now, choose warrior.&quot; Darkrayne unbelts his hammer after saying this.<br>
&quot;And do you really think you could bring me to my end?&quot; Natori challenged. Darkrayne stares, unemotional. After a moment Natori speaks, &quot;You are not worth the time in dulling my blade&quot; sheathing her weapon. <br>
<br>
&quot;That is fear I sense child!&quot; Darkrayne shouted.<br>
&quot;should we have fought I would have slain you. Fear is a weakness and until you get a grip on all of your emotions you wil lnever achieve your fullest power. There is one more thing I must teach you. Within there is a power of Hate so strong it would make your magical defenses stronger. This discipline is called resistant. Once you are able to control your emotion, you will be my end.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My Hate and my Anger are what keep me strong&quot; Natori says.<br>
&quot;Then, prove your hatred, fight!, I AM NOT AFRAID&quot; Darkrayne steps up to Natori and stares into her eyes, piercing her through her soul, his challenge still ever present, he waits for her decision. &quot;Fight me or accept these truths...&quot;<br>
<br>

Is it yet another lie? Perhaps you are doing the will of the Wicked Crown?&quot; Natori spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why would i have plans for the assassination of the Leader if i was doing their will?&quot; Darkrayne defended himself.  &quot;More lies? i do not know what to believe.&quot; Natiori said.<br>
&quot;I tried to save your father, if only you were there to witness such, i exhausted myself trying to save him.&quot; Darkrayne's head hangs as he speaks this. &quot;You kidnapped me when i was young.&quot; &quot;i did this to save you,&quot; Darkrayne spoke. &quot; More lies?&quot; Natori asked &quot;All i know is that you kidnapped me when i was young, what if it is the Underground that is trying to help me and you the corrupt one?&quot; &quot;I heard them say such.&quot; Darkrayne said. &quot;There were no problems until after you took me away.&quot; Natori fired. Yet it seems they have been after you for quite some time.&quot; &quot;Only about a day or so if even before i took you. I overheard their plans to poison your father and to slit your throat. I saved you&quot; Darkrayne said. &quot;How do i know this?&quot; Natori said.<br>
<br>
Changing the subject, Darkrayne speaks &quot;You have grown in hate Natori&quot; &quot;It is a shame most of it is directed at you&quot; she replied. &quot;Let us hurry and finish this.&quot; Natori continued. &quot;I agree, we must finish this so that i can continue with my plan. To assassinate the leader.&quot; Darkrayne said.<br>
&quot;For now, the Underground is our common enemy, we will dispose of them, but then i want you out of my life forever.&quot; Natori said &quot;I am a part of your past, past is pain and agony, both tools of The Father, if you slay me, you kill your past, do you really want this?&quot; Darkrayne asked. &quot;Will this make you stop bothering me?&quot; Natori asked. &quot;I am the past, you can't forget me, i will always be there, after we defeat the Underground i will leave you be as you wish.&quot; Darkrayne spoke.<br>
&quot;Please get on with this, i don't want you in my life anymore.&quot; Natori said. &quot;And i don't care to be part of it&quot; Darkrayne responded. &quot;But you still won't alleviate the pain.&quot; He continued. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you ever shut-up?!&quot; Natori asked getting quite impatient.<br>
Darkrayne takes a few steps back and challenges Natori &quot;Very well, choose now warrior, fight? or do we work together against our common enemy?&quot; Darkrayne asked. <br>
<br>
Without a comment Natori charged, her weapons drawn.<br>
<br>
A Brutal battle ensued, Natori's spear and sword tearing into the Cleric's weak armor...blow after blow he sustained, and his counters barely scratching the warrior's armor. &quot;Oh my god! i hit you harder then i hit the monsters&quot; Natori taunted.<br>
Ignoring her remarks, Darkrayne steps back and stuns Natori, blinding her and rooting as well, he was testing her magical defenses, and...much to his dismay, they were strong.<br>
&quot;You have good magical defenses Natori&quot; Darkrayne spoke.<br>
&quot;So you've noticed?&quot; Natori retorted landing several more blows on the bruised and bloody Cleric. After rooting himself, Darkrayne decides it is best to beat a hasty retreat, after testing Natori out...he now knew what he was up against.<br>
&quot;Do you realize i hurt myself more falling down the steep part of the cliff then what you've done to me?&quot; Natori taunted.<br>
This was when Darkrayne rooted and blinded Natori, retreating a great distance. &quot;Now you run and hide? Why don't you stand and face me if you have the courage&quot; Natori's taunts kept coming...Darkrayne had backed out of range of Natori's arrows and out of her sight, there he restored himself full. Calling out to Natori Darkrayne spoke, &quot;It would seem Innoruuk favors you this day...no matter now we begin round two....things will change shortly&quot; Darkrayne now taunted.<br>
Starting out aggressively, Darkrayne called massive amounts of wrath of the gods to strike Natori down..within minutes she was more then half dead...however, she kept coming, and..taking her final lesson to heart, she summoned all the hate within her soul and her magical defenses skyrocketed.<br>
Out of mana and too worn physically (still not fully recovered from his injuries at Natori's ceremony of binding) Darkrayne was defeated...he turned to face the warrior toe-to-toe and..moments later, the frozen tundra of Iceclad was stained pink from the cleric's now lifeless body.<br>
<br>
Natori had, infact...killed her past...shaking her head in disgust at the inanimate shell, she turned away..unemotional.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Innoruuk had found Darkrayne's service no longer useful to him, so he was done and his death, unlike Natori's belief, was permanent...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I Drinseth G'Naltha, state my final will and testiment. <br>
If you are reading this, it has been finished, the last chapter and ounce of my strength has been spent. I hope and pray that the Wicked Crown is no longer, but if my demise was premature, it is my last wish for Natori to be kept alive at all costs until she is able to come a thousand thousands strong to take back Neriak from the Underground. I have hid my possessions, only one that is fated by the gods to find them will I take their location to my grave, wherever it may be. There is one thing i wish Natori to have, it is in the drawer in the library. There is a brew there for her to take to her father. It is my life work...i have taken many recipes and ingredients from all over Norrath to create this super-tonic, i believe this is the cure to the malady that her father was stricken with. I was a bad father for her, the kid deserves a<br>
REAL father...though the Ambassador was not my first choice, he will do just fine...I wish to thank all the family i had, for allowing me to be part of the legacy that is The Violent Harvest. I leave you with one gift, i took it upon myself to straighten up the Library, those tomes were in such disarray, everything is now in chronological order and is grouped by type and context.<br>
<br>
Hate with Honor all, and farewell...All...Praise....Innoruuk<br>
