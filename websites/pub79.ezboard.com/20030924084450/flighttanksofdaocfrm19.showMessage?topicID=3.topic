<br>
There wasn't a full group of Albs against a full group of Mids.  We ran into each other at the crest of a very steep hill in Uppland.  Throughout the fight I kept trying to target one of their healers but couldn't.  I hit F8 and targeted one of their Shadowblades (Alkeistarte).  I kept strafing trying to get a healer targeted, so that's why there's so many missed Pierce styles (rear positionals).  I eventually got a healer targeted and switched to him (Gluch) but it was too late to even get 1 kill by then.<br>
<br>
Things of note:<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:07:48] I landed a High Damage, Medium penalty to defense, Rear positional style against a leather wearing class (resistant to thrust) for 159(-47).<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:08:06] I landed a Medium Damage, Medium penalty to defense, Front positional lvl 50 style (Dual Shadows) against Gluch, a chain wearing class (vulnerable to thrust) for 108(-21) + 65(-12).<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:08:13] I again landed a Dual Shadows for 105(-20) + 64(-12) against Gluch.<br>
<br>
For Alkeistarte, a shadowblade who was meleeing me with slash, a weapon type that is neutral to my chain:<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:08:07] he hits me for 292 + 52 + landed poison and then again, at the same time stamp, he hits me for 110.<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:08:09] he hits me for 259 + 70.<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:08:11] he hits me for 191 + 80.<br>
<br>
At time stamp [23:08:13] he hits me for 203 and I'm dead. <p>Kerrec Snowmane<br>
