Her hair was stark grey, a contrast to the normal white of her hair. She sighed looking everything over.  Her research was taxing her, pulling from her own energies and now...Now this.<br>
<br>
She sweapt the papers off her desk an a sudden outburst of rage.  Thousands of platinum went into the procurement of these ancient maps of Neriak.  Old tunnels and catacombs and escape passages carefully mapped, all of them useless.<br>
<br>
Countless amounts of resources of House K'Thalion where spent in the last few days.  People, platinum, magic, all of it gained the House nothing.  Shaede growled in frustration.  She had to find Nospiratus.  She knows Mythral has him.  She is powerless to stop any of this.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot;, Shaede called out.  Immediately two attendents were opening the door.  Her two personal custos always at ready since her last trip to the Grange. Would it be her last trip, she wondered to herself?<br>
<br>
The Harvest was torn.  Faeolin acting in ways not normal for the tempermental warrior.  Vresk, acting undiscplined and confused.  Even the Reaper showed an outburst of emotion, an unchecked response to Hatred, that betreyed his normal control of his emotions.<br>
<br>
She dismissed the two custos without an explination, the two left without argument, leaving her alone to her thoughts.  She sat back into her chair, aching with the need of Xareth, the need to feel him next to her confirming her existance.  She leaned back, a dark wicked smile playing across her face.  For the first time in weeks she felt the dark play of Innoruuk's hatred play across her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mythral, you have made a fatal mistake my friend.&quot;  Shaede started to call forth a spell, and at the moment of completion, threw a malachite in the air.  She watched it swirl, then dissapear as it coallesced into her elemental. Opening a small chest of summoned items she placed them on her elemental, knowing full well that these items would make it near invulnerable to magic.  &quot;Oh yes, you brought the accusations against me to the Harvest, hoping to break me completely.  The Mad One is gone,&quot; she wrapped the blanket around her own shoulders, feeling the magic emcompass her &quot;but the Mad Ones wisdom is bound to his house.&quot;  Her eyes flashed darkly, &quot;And you...You should never have backed me into a corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reaching to her desk she grasped a book and some maps and placed them into a dimensional pocket.  Calling to her custos she bid them to enter.  &quot;Talis'shar, K'rillian come with me.  Carry these.&quot; She pointed to a stack of the dimensional bags.  As she walked out she left explicet instructions with her house.  Immediately runners went to find Xareth, in Nektulous and Daiunus.<br>
<br>
Quickly with her two custos and her pet behind her Matron Shaede K'Thalion, Dread Lord to the Harvest and Elementalist of Innoruuk stood before the gates of House S'Therik. Stepping toward the gates she spoke to one of the skeletal guardians, knowing the Reaper would be given the message.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell Khasirath I have arrived, the time is upon us.&quot;<br>

It waved one metal spiked fist before the gate and the bones parted, tumbling back upon one another with a life of their own. The gristly cracking sounds of the gate shattered the calm of the lake which House S`Therik crouched on the shores of, deep in the secrecy of the Third Gate.<br>
<br>
Shaede and her custos and elemental were ushered to the door of the manse by another one of the skeletal servitors. The bone gate crawled closed behind them with the same unsettling noise. At the door the skeleton turned back to patrolling as Shaede and her guardians entered the House.<br>
<br>
In the foyer, a wizened servant by the name of Naneth bowed deeply before Shaede. She knew the old Teir’Dal well, as he always met her there when she visited Khasirath. He wore the charcoal grey livery of the House, with the silver House sigil neatly pinned to his shirt.<br>
<br>
“Hail Matron K`Thalion. I shall take ye to see Master Khasirath, but your servants shall have to wait in the main hall.” He said, his voice quiet and well schooled.<br>
<br>
A slight frown of concern creased Shaede’s brow, but she nodded, “Very well, if that is how it must be.”<br>
<br>
Naneth bowed deeply again, “I apologize for the inconvenience, Matron. Please follow me.”<br>
<br>
The servant led Shaede and her guardians down the richly appointed halls of the manse, pausing before the great hall to show the custos and elemental where they could await their Matron. Once they were settled Naneth led Shaede deeper into the manse, through the halls and out a door into the courtyard.<br>
<br>
The buildings of House S`Therik were four in number, all contained within a single natural chamber in the underground haven of Neriak. The buildings framed the courtyard, the large area smooth-floored and bordered by a narrow and elegant rock garden.<br>
<br>
In the center of the courtyard Shaede saw the Reaper of the Harvest. He was fully armoured, and in the middle of what seemed to be a duel with a large and powerful Kobold, obviously one native to Nagafen’s Lair. The Knight and beast circled and clashed, snarling at one another as they fought.<br>
<br>
The beast wore a wide metal collar, and laid into Khasirath in a fury of claw and fang. Khasirath fought back with great skill, armed with his shield and a wooden practice sword that was curved something like a saber. In the background of the fight stood two servants, one male and one female. Each held a strange wand, and the female had a whip coiled at her hip. They watched the fight silently.<br>
<br>
Shaede recognized the female as Alartha, one of the Reaper’s personal servants who worked at times in the Grange for her master. Naneth led Shaede just into the courtyard, and motioned for her to wait. Carefully the old servant neared the battling pair.<br>
<br>
Shaede stood back and watched the fight curiously. The Reaper was a brutal fighter whom she had hunted with many times over a great many years. She noticed that as he fought the Kobold he was not using his dark magics, simply the force of sword and shield, and his agility in dodging and turning the monster’s attacks. It was quite fascinating to watch him fight the frenzied beast. Yet his pace seemed relaxed, as if he did not seek to best the creature, only to prolong the battle.<br>
<br>
It did not take long at all for Khasirath to notice Naneth’s approach. He nodded once to the servant and took two steps back from the Kobold. Before the beast could charge again, Khasirath thrust his shield hand forward, palm out. A writhing black aura surrounded his hand instantly. “Rr’kek! Halt!” he commanded.<br>
<br>
The slavering Kobold’s ears flattened at the command, and its eyes rolled in fear as it noticed the aura around the Reaper’s hand. Instantly it fell to the ground, writhing as it bared its throat, letting out a deep whimpering yowl of submission.<br>
<br>
The Reaper let the aura of the Father’s Touch fade away as he motioned to the two servants. He handed his practice sword and shield to the male, and instructed Alartha to return Rr’kek to his pen. Shaede noticed that the fierce Kobold followed the servant off to one of the low buildings at the back of the compound like a dog on a leash, its scraggly tail half-wagging submissively.<br>
<br>
As the servants went about their tasks, Khasirath walked over to Shaede, pulling off his helm and holding it under his arm. His long moon-white hair was bound tightly back at his neck, and a light sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead from the workout. <br>
<br>
Khasirath bowed his head in greeting as he stopped before Shaede.<br>
<br>
“Hate to thee, Matron. Let us go inside so that we may talk.”<br>

<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Khasirath led Shaede back into the manor house and through the halls to a small library furnished with a pair of tables, each with a pair of high-backed chairs beside them. A few mage-light sconces provided dim violet light, more than enough for Teir’Dal to comfortably read by. After they entered he shut the door behind them to ensure their privacy.<br>
<br>
Shaede swept one of the tables clear and opened her dimensional bag, pulling out the maps and books she had brought with her.<br>
<br>
Khasirath raised an eyebrow at the mess she was making, but waited silently for Shaede to prepare.<br>
<br>
Shaede said, “I do not know where to begin Reaper. I stand accused of two crimes now, neither of which I can disprove immediately.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded, looking Shaede over slowly, noting the unnatural grey of her hair and the intensity of her eyes.<br>
<br>
Shaede continued, returning the Reaper’s glance, “But the second...” Her eyes danced with dark hate, “I WILL prove my innocence on.”<br>
<br>
She shook with barely controlled rage, “I did not take the Prophet. I may have issues with the man but I am not a kidnapper nor am I a murderer of Teir’Dal.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded, “Despite the conclusion many could draw that the disappearance is linked to the charges he would bring against you, I have not believed you would be capable of such an act. I know your deep devotion to your House, Matron. And since you yourself confessed to me and the Thresher the things that brought Nospiratus to doubt you before he was taken, his disappearance would not prevent the inquiry entirely at any rate.”<br>
<br>
Shade looked deep into Khasirath’s eyes, “My guilt or lack of guilt in the first matter is nothing worse then I have faced in the past. I would sooner kill myself then allow anything to happen to Nospiratus.... or Xareth.”<br>
<br>
“I understand, Shaede. On the first charge... I think Innoruuk Himself is the only one who can make that determination. As to the second... The Prophet must be found.”<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded, “For now...We need to find the Prophet.”<br>
<br>
Shaede pointed to the maps. “These are ancient maps of the tunnels beneath Neriak. These were drawn up at the time of their construction.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded as he bent over the table to study the old maps. “Indeed... These are quite a handsome find. I imagine there may be some newer additions, but this is a good start.”<br>
<br>
She then pointed to the first tome. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   ‘The Rites of Final Destruction’ </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was penned in Elven on the cover. “These are the rites and rituals used by ancient magi to battle those of the blood.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath looked at the book with distaste, “A Tome of the Spurned, then?”<br>
<br>
She shook her head, “No, older then that. Rumor has it that it was from before the Koada`Dal were driven from Takish Hiz by Solusek Ro.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath raised an eyebrow in surprise.<br>
<br>
Shaede said, “It would seem the lightcrawlers have a use after all. Their fanatical beliefs in the false ones caused them to call a Jihad against those of the blood.”<br>
<br>
Shaede touched the cover of the book thoughtfully, “These are arcane rites, not divine ones.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded slowly as he looked at the Tome. “I have never studied the magics other than Necromancy... I do not know if I would be able to make out what the book contains.”<br>
<br>
She opened the tome to a marked page. “This shows weapons and mundane items to force them into a slumber so that the rites may be performed.”  Turning to another marked page she said, “This shows how to protect oneself from their charms.”<br>
<br>
She lowered her head, disappointed, “I have not located something to break the charms on one that is already captured....”<br>
<br>
Khasirath sighed deeply in thought, “Still, this will be most useful. It will help those who have not yet fallen. And perhaps we can find other tomes. Remember, the Thresher was once so cursed, and we helped see him cleansed of the taint.”<br>
<br>
“What now though... That monster, that creature,” she spat with hate, “is going to rip us apart from the inside out? The Harvest cannot survive this sundering.”<br>
<br>
“We must survive, Shaede. And we must seek Innoruuk's guidance in this. That is what I plan to do this very eve...” his eyes grew dark as he looked away from the table, “It will not be an easy thing, you understand. But with the Mad One missing, and Pravdameer unavailable I feel that I must.”<br>
<br>
She watched the Reaper, a look of respect and admiration on her face, “You and I have not always seen eye to eye... However, I have always respected you for your control and countenance. I will stand with you and the Thresher against anything, and I will stand and guard you while you commune with the Prince.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath looked back to Shaede with a ghost of a smile on his lips. “You are very brave, Shaede. And I am pleased to see that you have come out of the first shock of the accusations willing to act. If you truly wish it, I will allow you to be present, though there is little need to guard me. My physical body will be secure enough, ‘tis my soul that will be sent before the Father, and none can protect me should He find me unworthy.”<br>
<br>
He paused, thoughtfully, “In fact, I feel it may be better for you to spend the time translating and distributing the information you have found, perhaps finding others to help in further research while I do this thing.”<br>
<br>
“I can do so while my pet and I watch over you. I will not take any risks with Mythral involved.” Her face glowed with hatred as she mentioned his name.<br>
<br>
Khasirath nodded, “As you wish. It will be done this eve, here in House S`Therik where I can be sure of my safety. My sister, the Prophetess, shall be assisting me in the actual offering and communion.”<br>
<br>
She nodded sharply, &quot;You are a far braver man then I. I remember all too well the pain that the Father offers...”<br>
<br>
Khasirath nods again, determination and haunting memory of that pain mingled deeply in his eyes. &quot;For the Harvest, I will face whatever I must.”<br>
<br>
The Reaper looked over the maps and tomes again. “I am sorry, Shaede. But I have much to prepare… If ye wish to remain, I will have a servant assigned to getting you what you need. There is a guest suite where you can take your things, and I will have your custos and elemental brought to you there.”<br>
<br>
Shaede nodded slowly, “That will be fine, thank you.”<br>
