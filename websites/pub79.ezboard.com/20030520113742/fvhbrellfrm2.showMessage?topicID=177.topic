If you do the numbers, you will find that this happens very rarely outside of a bard's elaborate stories.  These are merely tales of some poor stubborn (and often not too bright) fool who received a bit of luck at the end of their plight.  These are then glorified to create inspiration and a sense of awe for those who will listen.<br>
<br>
Those stories aren't worth a damn.  I will tell you a story to riches and power that does not involve a shining knight upon a white horse with a sword of flame.  Listen well for I may never repeat this again.<br>
<br>
While away hunting, my wife and two babes were butchered by bandits on our farm in the Karanas.  Returning home with fresh meat, I arrived to see my wife staked out in front of our cabin.  She had been abused then disemboweled.  My two babes were lying on the floor of our cabin; blood stains on the wall showing how they had been slain.<br>
<br>
With shock replacing grief, I reverently placed my wife's body within the cabin alongside our children, grabbed a few inherited possessions that were hidden under the floorboard, then walked outside and lit the cabin ablaze.  While staring at the 30 foot flames, a cold sense of purpose settled upon me.  Even though I wasn't a skilled tracker, anyone who must hunt for his family will know enough to be able to follow a band of murderers.  Especially when they made no attempt to cover their tracks.<br>
<br>
It took a few years, but I was able to finally track down the bandits.  Since some of the bandits had prices on their heads, finding one meant the bounty would finance the search for the next.  Word began to reach the remaining bandits when news of an unnamed assassin was killing their comrades.  I can imagine the paranoia they felt wherever they went, not knowing which face in the crowd was the killer.<br>
<br>
Despite what most people will tell you, after I had killed the last bandit, I was not filled with an emptiness...it was elation!  Not one of them died in less than 24 hours.  And those lonely nights of the hunt makes a man oftentimes introspective.  After the final bandit was killed, I finally realized what I had become and what made me that way.  I had become an assassin and had built a deadly reputation...something I could never had done had I remained the somewhat docile family man I once was.  It was hate that spurred me to take up the hunt.  It was hate that inspired me to torture the bandits.  And it is hate that make bards sing of some of my more darker deeds when the lantern oil began to burn low late at night within the taverns.  I have sat within a few such taverns before.  I will admit that much of what they say is untrue, but a deadly reputation is a powerful ally.  However if you repeat that, you and those you told will never know when I will pay you another visit.<br>
<br>
I am not a very religious man, but when I first visited Neriak, I overheard a conversation about a god of hate.  After realizing what made me so rich and powerful, this naturally piqued my interest.  I have never seen Innoruuk nor have I heard his voice in my mind.  But a priest within Neriak told me that it was indeed Innoruuk that filled me with the purpose to hunt the bandits.  Perhaps this is true, but I still remain skeptical.  Perhaps one day all will be revealed.  Word has it that Violent Harvest is the key...<br>

After playing EQ since it came out, I am very much looking for a change from the kill kill kill exp exp exp mode of playing.  So I decided to take up RP.  I tried that when I first played, but gave up when no one responded.  VH has been highly recommended as an evil RP guild.  As of now, I am a Human Rogue, level 4, worshipping Innoruuk as a deity.  I will be leveling up fast...not to powergame, but to at least be high enough to where I can actually RP without a level 1 orc attacking me...and also to do RP/raids with the guild.  I've done the high level game and will eventually get there with my rogue, but I plan to RP along with leveling.  I plan on having a lot of fun RPing, helping out fellow guild members, and trying to make a change in the way I play EQ.  If anyone has any questions or issues, feel free to ask. <p><b>Cadoras the Stalker</b><br>

&quot;bring this scroll to the rogue, I am sure you will find him once he knows you seek him.  Tell him he must seek out our Dread Overlords..... then he must seek myself and the Reaper.  I believe he can be guided in his hate to serve the Father's will, and I will soon need all the help I can get.&quot;<br>
