From a distance it appeared to be no more than a jagged pillar of darkness, but on closer inspection one noted the door, and windows etched into its stone walls. The stone shone like liquid black, catching the silvery light of the moon on occasion, sending it back to the observers eyes in small shimmering waves. <br>
She sighed softly, it had been so long since she had returned to this place. Here was her haven. Not many man nor beast could breach its walls without her permission. A slim, pale hand ran over the smooth, silken textured stone as she contemplated what she was about to do. <br>
Drawing in a deep breath, she released it slowly as she uttered the enchantment that would unseal the door to her, and slowly, moving as though age where the weight upon her she entered the tower, perhaps for the last time. <br>
The door slid silently to close behind her, hiding her from any prying eyes that may have watched her entrance. <br>
Inside on the main floor, a circular rug helped keep the feet from a long exposure to the cold stone. The circular walls bedecked by row upon row of bookshelves crammed full with every map, book and partchment she had ever came across. Organized in a way that made sense only to her. Some shelves held various items used in her experiments. Others held jars and vials of potions, elixers and various sundry. <br>
The shelves where broken only by the fireplace that called to one to come and rest. Placed before it a soft, overstuffed chair begged the weary body to seat itself, beside it a small table held a tray, which sported a single glass and a bottle of dark amber liquid. <br>
To her right a spiral staircase would lead her to the next room above. There where three in all. The second held her study, where she conducted her experiments, incantations and evocations. The last was her room, that was by far the most spartan of the three. Only a single bed, dresser and closet graced it. <br>
Still moving slowly she slid from the tight Kael boots, boots of the invoker they called them, and settled into her chair. Deftly without a glance, she poured a single shot of brandy and sipped at it absently as her gaze rested upon the cold hearth. More a thought than an utterance had a fire suddenly spring to life and wearily Grey's silver eyes watched the dance of flames as she contemplated what her next move would be. To hole up here till death finally found her, was certainly the easiest way out. <br>
Her mind fluttered to past glories, adventures and even the misadventures. The failures, the losses and even the gains. For every step forward two back had been taken. It had'nt been an easy life filled with companionship and mirth. But one of mostly solitary wanderings. <br>
Most folks tended to shun, and even fear a wizard in their raiding parties. Unless serious damage was needed. So a wizard learned quickly how to fend for themselves. She recalled a conversation she had just the other night.. <br>
&quot;Whom do you serve?&quot; He had asked her, it was a good valid question and yet one so hard to answer.. who did she indeed serve? Her god Karana had long abandoned her ages past when she lay near death, her soul taken. Innoruuk had battled hard to keep her alive, but for what means she had never found the answer. Tunare had never done anything but bring her rage and grief. And this goddess of love.. pshaw! Love was an illusion that mortals used to chain one to their side till that ones usefullness had ended. So who in fact did she serve? <br>
Chaos, and Ballance.. those where the gods she served. For now, the Drow could be considered the &quot;Underdogs&quot; in this battle, for their numbers where few, though thier power made up for some of the lack. The &quot;Lightborn&quot; races far outnumbered them in sheer populace alone. And so, for now, till the balance was met, she would work to even the odds some for them. To give them a more equal ground to stand upon. <br>
She lunged suddenly to her feet with a feral growl of rage, her glass still half full shattered loudly againts the back of the hearth, the brandy feeding the flame to a roar. She fell back into her chair, so confused now as to where that had come from. These sudden urges.. and outbursts of rage, anger, pain. What where their origins, she could not say, perhaps one day she would learn the answer. Her hand moved to cover the pulsing ruby that dangled from a slender chain about her neck. Its glow simulating the beat of a heart, a soul entrapped in smooth, beautiful, cold stone....<br>
Madness, sheer chaotic, beautiful insanity.. <br>

Threatening to tear her mind asunder. A soft moan escaped as she clenched her fists to her temples, her eyes scrunching close in protest to the blinding ferocity of it. Then the voice that had become a constant reminder of the past whispered insidiously to her,<br>
&quot;You cannot escape me, even here... &quot;<br>
She growled low, as she pressed back against the chair. Her clenched fists moving to press into the armrests of the chair. She would not give in, not this time. <br>
Soon both voice and pain passed. She relaxed once more as an Idea took shape. A plan of action. She rose and moved to one of the many shelves and from it a small crystal ball was taken. Softly uttered words of an ancient incantation where spoken as her hand passed over its gleaming surface. With each passing the ball began to glow brighter and brighter till it hovered over her palm, no longer resting in it. <br>
&quot;Go now, and find him, He will know what to do with you should he need my services.&quot; Like a shot the ball flew from her and towards the open window. It sailed high into the night sky its destination etched firmly upon it.<br>
An hour or two later it wizzed passed the neriak guards. The jumped towards it but where unable to intercept it as it whisked its way through the foreign quarters, then commons and on to third gate. <br>
The grange guards too attempted to stop it and still it evaded them as it made its way to Khasiraths office. And there it came to rest upon his desk, waiting.. <br>

Then bringing it to a slow stop, deft fingers used sculpting tools to methodically form the Idol. <br>
The clay glinted dully in the light. Tiny specks of gold, red, and blue could be seen refracting the light back at the sculpter. <br>
Sitting back she sighed softly in satisfaction as the lump of clay now perfectly resembled that of a god. Innoruuk. The likeness of it unmistakable. <br>
Muttering softly to herself she rose and retrieved the liquid needed to complete the process. Pouring it slowly over the idol she watched as the the thirsty clay soaked up the essences of the liquid. <br>
The gently lifting the likeness she moved to the kiln to fire it. Turning away from the heat of the kiln while the idol baked she moved to cleans the grime from her fingers. <br>
Not a single step was taken as the ever haunting pain returned. This time so severe as to drive her to her knees, a keening cry of suprise wrung from her as her clay encrusted fingers clenched into the ebon curls at her temples. <br>
Then darkness fell, as Grey collapsed to the cold stone floor unconcious. <br>
The voice, her only companion in the abyss of shadows she found herself in. Despair at once more returning to this place of half life welled inside of her. <br>
&quot;You cannot escape me.. even here.. &quot;<br>
The voice, as insidious as ever, filled the void. Echoing all around her. She curled into a fetal position, unconciously attempting to protect herself perhaps.<br>
&quot;Leave me be.. just go.. or finish it.. but do something.. end this.. &quot; she hissed softly as she came too. Her eyes blinking slowly open and realizing that she was once more safely enscounced in her tower. <br>
Safety.. but for how long? <br>
Madness, sheer utter, beautiful madness. <br>
With a worldweary sigh she rose and moved to take the idol from the kiln. It had over cooked, and splintered. Ruined.<br>
Growling softly in anger she tossed the broken idol to the bin, and returned to the potters wheel once more to begin again.  <p><center>Greystorm Ironheart</center>
