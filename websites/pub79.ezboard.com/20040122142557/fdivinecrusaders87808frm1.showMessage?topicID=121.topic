 Posted: Thu Aug 01, 2002 1:27 pm    Post subject: Classes in Everquest   <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
Beastlords actually have a really sweet buff at 59-60 (I forget which). But there's only like one 60 beastlord in existence, I think he was a bet. Just pretend they don't exist, it's more fun that way. Cracks me up watching them trying to explain their class at every raid. Accuse them of making stuff up for a real hoot. <br>
<br>
Warriors are needed, unless your monks are bored. But, even if they aren't, you only need like 3-4. The others just show up to get loot, greedy bastards. <br>
<br>
Clerics are needed, but I don't think they exist anymore. Real clerics, I mean. The ranger slapping a CH hotkey on a 2nd computer doesn't count. <br>
<br>
Enchanters are needed. They're needed for tash, mana regen, haste, (unless you have more than one shaman; then the 2nd shaman will have something to do!) and needed for mez/charm. Unless, of course, you have a lot of those shifty warrior-types, then you can just have them tanks the extra crap. If you're a real sadist, you can have them beg the 2-boxing ranger for a heal. Rangers don't seem to forget getting snubbed for a group when they were 20. <br>
<br>
Monks are needed. Monk FD is sweet, monk damage is sweet, and monk defense is also sweet. Sweetest of all is giggling like a schoolgirl when you see: xxxx has fallen to the ground. xxxx tells the group 'ass.' xxxx has been slain by a screamin_meanie! <br>
<br>
Mages are needed. DS, CoH, and least we forget it, those yummy mod rods. Pets aren't bad either. Not sure about their DD. <br>
<br>
Shaman are needed. Well, one is(dont forget to remind them that they aren't above being buff bitches like enchanters and druids). It's not bad if they have Torpor, but I wouldn't ask them directly if they have it. You might loose a finger. I did. <br>
<br>
Necros aren't really needed. If you have some, try not to get more than 2. Necro one will gloat a lot and spout off how much damage he's doing. Necro two will kinda sigh and not really talk about how much damage he's doing. Necro 3+ will be soloing quietly off in the corner. If you want to have to &quot;twitch&quot; people, I would group them with casters and make sure there's a mob with mana around for them to mind wrack. If you want them to do the direct &quot;Twitch&quot; spell, forget it unless they offer. They can also do some really unique pulls. On a side note, if you ever see a mob turn into a skeleton immediately have your wizard port to Fear, disband the necro and port the group back down to hunting. Necro's like this, it makes them closer to their god...I promise. <br>
<br>
Wizards are either not very needed, or very very needed, depending on the target and expansion. There are some older content mobs that were pretty much immune to wizards, sadly. Luckily, those are disappearing, and in SoL it's a wizi playground. Either way, the best thing about wizards is they stack. You can *never* have too many wizards. If they have epic, you won't even have to heal 'em. Can't beat free damage, and tons of it. Can be habitual AFK'ers, keep an eye on 'em and send them random tells about kittens, oh and watch those that live in their parent's basement and have manaburn, sometimes that itchy trigger finger of power can destroy an orc pawn or something instead of an important mob. <br>
<br>
Rogues are like wizards, but you also need one for locked doors/traps. Yeah, bards can do that, but they're sorta flighty and get distracted easy. Rogue damage stacks pretty well, but not as well as wizards (mob A's ass is only so big). Best part about rogues is unlike wizards, you can prevent the rogues from stealing XP. Just have the tank switch sides when the mob enrages. I would log the following guildchat, it'll be priceless. <br>
<br>
Bards are nice. They're usually mean and not very fluffy =\. They're needed for some things, and the rest of the time are total DT magnets, so it's fun to take them to places like PoA. <br>
<br>
Druids can kick ass, or really, really suck. They get points off for the high number of assling druids. Well played druids, while not needed, can replace and support many of the 'needed' classes. Poorly played druids like shifty warrior-types, but without all the armor and hitpoints. <br>
<br>
Paladins are very very very not needed. When they ask to come along, ask if they have their summoned horse yet. If they don't, laugh at them and put them on ignore. If they do, laugh at them and put them on ignore. Sure, they'll try to convince you they don't suck anymore, but they're lying. Ignore any so-called 'facts' or parsed logs showing them out-damaging the shifty-warrior types. No, I have no axe to grind. Really. <br>
<br>
Shadowknights aren't really *needed*, but they're nice. Nice aggro, can fill in for monks on FD pulls. Decent damage. Beware of the ones that 'roleplay'. On second thought, just follow the above suggestion for Paladins for Shadowknights as well, why take chances. <br>
<br>
Rangers with lots of AA are scary. You'll know which ones have lots of AAs because all the wizards keep giving them dirty looks. Ones without lots of AAs are really nice. You can throw never ending supplies of them at a mob to eat away until a real tank shows up...and for some reason they never complain.<br>
