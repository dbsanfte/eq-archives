<br>
I tested Dark Tendrils, Flank/Shadows Rain, Dual Shadows against a lvl 50 Merc in SC'd armor and a lvl 50 Cleric in SC'd armor.  Some of it was unbuffed, some of it buffed.  I left the buffage in the chat log so you can see when the buffed damage starts.<br>
<br>
Conclusions:  Flank does about the same damage as Dual Shadows does on the live servers.  Shadow's Rain does about 20-30 more style bonus damage above Flank.  I'd venture a guess to say that Flank is now the most damaging style for my spec.  It used to be Reflection/Hypnotic Darkness, but the style list was rearranged (Hypnotic Darkness is no longer a lvl 44 style) and I didn't confirm to see if there were no changes to damage on those styles.  Details:<br>
<br>
Flank (unbuffed vs 16% thrust resist) :  <br>
<br>
140 + miss<br>
136 + 69<br>
<br>
Shadow's Rain (unbuffed vs 16% thrust resist) :<br>
<br>
147 + 76<br>
<br>
Dual Shadows (unbuffed vs 16% thrust resist) :<br>
<br>
177 + miss (+17+16+15)<br>
145 + 67 (+17+16+15)<br>
             <br>
Flank (buffed vs. 16% thrust resist, fully buffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
166 + 98<br>
176 (single hand attack) <br>
<br>
Shadow's Rain (unbuffed vs 16% thrust resist) :<br>
<br>
205 + 86<br>
208 + 92<br>
<br>
Dual Shadows (buffed vs 16% thrust resist, fully buffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
179 + 100 (+17+16+15)<br>
171 + parried (+17+16+15)<br>
<br>
Dark Tendrils (buffed vs 16% thrust resist, unbuffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
181 + 80<br>
194 (single hand attack)<br>
191 + 83<br>
<br>
Dual Shadows (buffed vs 16% thrust resist, unbuffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
212 + 98<br>
222 + 89<br>
168 + 109<br>
<br>
Dragonfang (buffed vs 16% thrust resist, unbuffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
194 + miss<br>
<br>
Flank (buffed vs 16% thrust resist, unbuffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
176 (single hand attack)<br>
219 + 91<br>
169 + miss<br>
<br>
Shadow's Rain (buffed vs 16% thrust resist, unbuffed opponent) :<br>
<br>
208 (single hand attack)<br>
211 + 128<br>
218 + 106<br>
<br>
Things to note:  The &quot;fixed&quot; group parry/block bug may have increased Parry output in solo battles.  In our attempts to test Dark Tendrils, we parried ALOT more than we evaded.  Maybe Evade was affected in some manner.<br>
