What follows is something I had trouble tracking down, but after reading so many wonderful background tales, I felt the need to re-post Prav's. This was written a long time ago (over a year I think), but it gives some idea to some of the background I've developed for Prav. Hope you enjoy the first of three parts reposted as they were originally written.<br>
============================================================================<br>
*ooc* NOTE: This character is violent at times, harsh at others, and not nice most times - this tale however, is not too graphic. Read as you choose. It's also rather long, but I tried to make it as succinct as possible. It was actually going to be longer with more details of certain areas...but...*shrug* I wanted to get it up ASAP as I think you'll see at why at the end. For those who read through - enjoy.<br>
============================================================================<br>
It was the middle of the night when he first heard the voices.<br>
<br>
&quot;Praaaavdameeeeer...&quot;<br>
<br>
He sat bolt upright in bed and looked about. He had always seen better at night than most everyone he knew, and he no sign of anybody in the room. He wasn't sure though, so he sat still for about 10 minutes just listening and watching. When he didn't see or hear anything he lay back down to go back to sleep. That's when the dreams began.<br>
<br>
He saw a small group of armed men and women (4-6 or so), a couple in full plate armor, and they were cutting a swath through a group that was 3-4 times their size of Freeport Militia. Aside from the 2 in full plate, there were some in robes flinging spells and such and a couple in leather armor as well, but he could never make out any particulars. Then one of the armored ones drew his attention. She (at least he felt it was a she) was mowing down all who stood in her path. Around her neck he saw a symbol he had never seen before, and it was this that grabbed his attention. It almost seemed to glow in his dream - drawing him to it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pravdameer, wake up son.&quot;<br>
<br>
He felt a soft hand shaking him out of his deep sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prav, honey, time for the morning chores.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grumbled a bit as he realized his mother was waking him for the morning ritual. Morning chores. Hah! More like an excuse to get him away from the inn so as not to drive off business. So many of those who came in always seemed to make snide comments at Pravdameer. He would rather be away from this place during the day anyhow. He had come to prefer being away from most of the townsfolk in fact. It gave him some peace and quiet. No more bullies humiliating him. They would get theirs - the more he thought about past events, the humiliations and ridicules his parents forced him to endure in the name of &quot;just getting along&quot;, the angrier he became.<br>
<br>
He stopped himself and did as his mother had taught him - slowed his breathing to calm himself - after all, it wasn't their fault...they were good people. His parents meant him no harm and only wanted to help. All of a sudden he realized that he had gotten cleaned up and eaten his breakfast without even realizing it as caught up in his thoughts of past wrongs and future revenge. That was not right. He needed to be more aware.<br>
<br>
He gathered up what was needed, and went on the trek out to gather up the herbs and other things that his parents wanted. It was not easy because some of the things required him to go into Freeport itself, and a lot of the merchants there also treated him like garbage - either they wouldn't trade with him, or if they did, they always gave him the short end of the stick.<br>
<br>
His mother was a good woman - she had descended from good wood elf stock she said (his father said that was in part why the inn was so far from town). His father was a good man who had fought hard in the Freeport Militia until he retired about 16 years ago. He was getting up in years now (especially for a human), but he still had his wits about him.<br>
<br>
*whomp*<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh? Oh, I'm sorry sir...I should have watched where I was going.&quot; He kept his head down so as to seem that much more humble to whomever it is he just bumped into.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should be more careful, boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
That voice - it was the one from last night's dream.<br>
<br>
Pravdameer slowly looked up to see a man - at least he felt it was a man - dressed in pure black plate mail from head to toe. His armor was as dark as night, and on his chest he bore the same symbol Pravdameer had seen in his dream the night before.<br>
<br>
The head nodded. &quot;That's right boy, you remember. The dark lord has decided you should remember still more however.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the armored creature laid his gauntleted fist upon Pravdameer's head and there was a flash. He saw everything for what it truly was - he saw the woman from his dream the night before...he saw that she was in fact his true mother. That this group of people who had called him son were of no true relation to him. That they had lied to him his whole life. He saw how they had used him to drum up business - come see the freak. He began to feel the hatred deep into his soul. He began to realize how much of his past had been a lie, and what he had to do to make things right.<br>
<br>
When the visions departed, he was alone on the roadside and it was approaching nightfall. He was supposed to be home and he hadn't even been to town yet. Oh well, that was ok - he had other plans.<br>
<br>
He went home, and when he got to the inn, he saw the lights were on with noise inside - probably celebrating his expected demise - that was why they always made him go these routes. They wanted him dead. He would show them. He moved about silent as a mouse and proceeded to bar all the shutters from the outside with branches he had gathered on the way back. Then he got to the doors, and secured those by saying some words that all of a sudden came to his mind. The doors glowed and he saw that they were effectively locked. Then he got the tinder and other kindling and placed it all around the bottom of the inn. He heard a noise at the door as if someone was trying to open it just as he struck the flint to steel and saw the sparks fly. The tinder caught as if it had been soaked in oil. The inn began to burn, and he watched for a moment as he saw the second floor catch and began to hear the screams, but nobody was getting out.<br>
<br>
He smiled in satisfaction, an evil smile, as he said under his breath, &quot;Now you know what hatred truly is...mother and father.&quot; and he spat as he made reference to the liars that called themselves that. The voices and the visions had shown him the truth. How his mother was an unholy warrior for the only true god. He knew now what that symbol she wore was. He also knew what he must do. He knew now that the god had chosen him to return to his true home. He had a message to bring - it was time for a change, and he was to preach the change to any and all in his true home. Yes, he had no worries of finding where he was to go next, the Voices would tell him. They would show him with visions the home where he and his dark skin would be welcome. He was off to Neriak.<br>

Here's part 2 - sorry for the delay, but RL has been kind of active of late. *chuckle* And thanks, Payle - hope you continue to enjoy. *grin*<br>

*ooc note* This is not as violent as the previous, but may be somewhat disturbing to some. *shrug* I'm not sure, but read as you so choose.<br>
Now, on with the journey home. Oh yeah, as always, any constructive criticism is welcomed via PM - destructive criticism is routed to /dev/null, so fire away. *grin*<br>
<br>
==================================================================<br>
<br>
It had been about 12 hours since Pravdameer took his revenge. He had been wandering the forest all night as the voices had instructed. The search parties from Freeport were finally dieing down - none had come close for a couple of hours or so. He grinned a sadistic grin as he remembered the hatred they were expressing. Yes, they were serving the Father's will with out even realizing it. Fools that they were. The visions had shown him the cave he was to sleep the day in. It was up ahead somewhere, he should be able to see it anytime now. He was searching the distance carefully, traveling in the directions the voices told him, when he tripped and fell into a small cave. This was it - it had to be. There was no way the search parties would find him here. Inside was a pile of berries and some meat along side a depression that seemed to hold rainwater. He smiled, gave thanks to the Father, and ate for the first time in almost 24 hours (well, other than those berries and things the voices had told him to eat along the way). He was famished.<br>
<br>
After he finished eating, the visions came back with a vengeance. They were much stronger than before. They began as they always did with flashes from the past. Memories of things done by neighborhood bullies and inn guests who seemed to take an instant dislike to him just because of the way he looked. The voices had explained this to him. They were jealous of him because he was a member of the Chosen Race. The Father had Chosen those like him to spread his vision of the way the world should be. What was it the voices called those creatures who humiliated him? Light dwellers...yes, that was it. This time, as the visions were reaching the climax of the glorious blaze he had set the night before, he saw movement at the entrance. There was a figure dressed in a hooded robe of purest black. The hood was pulled down so that the face could not be seen. A new voice sounded in Pravdameer's head. This voice screeched in rage, yet felt comforting in some way he could not explain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you done as you were told?&quot; The voice said.<br>
<br>
He was felt numb sitting near this creature. He could just manage to nod. He felt the creature grin with pleasure at what Pravdameer had done.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hence forth you shall know me as Atoxus. When you hear my voice, you will know that what I say is true. Come here now child, we have much to do in preperation before you are ready to enter the 3rd gate of Neriak and approach the holy temple.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pravdameer wobbled to his feet and stumbled up to Atoxus. He reached out a bony black finger. As he touched Pravdameer's forehead, Atoxus began to chant As he continued, he began to make some symbol or other with a warm sticky substance, it began. There was a burning so intense that Pravdameer wanted to scream from the very bottom of his soul. He felt a part of himself being ripped away, and a new part opening up in it's place. When he had finished Atoxus spoke again in Pravdameer's mind.<br>
&quot;I have torn you free from the bindings placed upon you by your past. In so doing, your mind is now opened to the knowledge you must receive.&quot;<br>
<br>
Atoxus began to chant again, but this time it was different. This time he moved his bony finger along the boy's mouth. Again it was warm and sticky, and had a faintly familiar scent to it (was it blood?). This time, instead of a feeling of something being ripped from his very essence, he found he was feeling as if his core was being crammed with information. Images of people, places, and things thrust at him all in a language he didn't understand at first. As he began to understand the language, he realized he was being shown the language of the Chosen Race. He was also being shown faces and given names to go with those faces. Paths and routes within Neriak itself. After a time, he found he was passing out, and yet the images continued to come.<br>
<br>
He awoke the just as the sun was going down outside his cave. He was not at the entrance to the cave as he had remembered Atoxus having been, but he knew the day before was real. He had a job, but first he had to wait here in this cave. He had much to learn before he could enter into Neriak. The Father would provide for his basic needs. Over the next week, things went the same. Each night he would spend contemplating the events of the day before - trying to understand as much as he could of what he had learned. Each day, just at sunrise, Atoxus would come and repeat the ritual of the first day and fill the boy's mind with more and more information.<br>
<br>
After the seventh day, Pravdameer awoke to find note beside him on the ground. Atoxus had told him it would be there. This was the note he was to give to the High Priest in Neriak. There were also some rolls and a worn canteen to sustain him on his journey. In addition to all that, he found the scrolls Atoxus had told him he would understand better once he had gotten to the temple and seen the High Priest. He picked up these things and the club he had harvested from some tree struck down by a bolt of lightning the Father had sent. The Father had done that so he could defend himself...yes, he was sure of it...it was the Father's doing.<br>
<br>
He stepped outside, but things looked different. Suddenly, he realized why. He was nolonger near the outskirts of Freeport. He was just outside the entrance to the Foreign Quarter - in the hills nearby. The Father had seen to his needs indeed. Now it was time for him to do his task. There were the ones fomr his dreams he had to find now. The names came to him with the faces - Ferall, Alamir, Mephala, Zirrix, and the general's brother Tzlar. Yes, Pravdameer must find them for his role would then begin. He was sent by the father to proclaim the coming of a new day - the day when his children would unite in force and cleanse themselves of the impurities. Then they would reshape the world about them in the Father's image. Yes, he had much work ahead.<br>
<br>
At least he was home now. <p>Pravdameer Pravdamorte<br>
