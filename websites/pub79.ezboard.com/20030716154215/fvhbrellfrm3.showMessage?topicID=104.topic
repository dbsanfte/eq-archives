General Zirrix sat within the war room of T’Rhennic Keep, deep in the heart of Neriak’s 3rd Gate, and reflected upon the last few weeks. He had returned from the Battle of Kelethin victorious, and entered his 46th season as a servant of the Great Battle God Rallos Zek as well. He had also been formally accepted as a Dread Harvester in the Dark Creator’s guild of the Violent Harvest. It was a busy few months. Never had such an attack been planned and executed by the Respected Race against an enemy so far away. Upon his return to Neriak, Zirrix and his army had received a hero’s welcome. His troops marched through the streets, into the courtyard of the Imperial Palace itself. Zirrix then broke with custom when reaching the Palace gates. Rather then enter at the place of honor, at the head of his army, he allowed the few dozen bodies of his fallen troops (those who were physically too badly damaged to be revived), to be placed at the front of the column. Each corpse was wrapped in the flag of the Teir’dal Empire, and carried upon a small silver/black and scarlet colored wagon. Accompanying each corpse, a member of the T’Rhennic House Guard carried the House Banner of the fallen soldier upon a pike, which fluttered in the slight breeze of the Underdark. Slowly they all marched in solemn procession thru the Imperial arch of the Palace gates. Stopping at the steps to the Royal Castle, Zirrix stepped forward, fell to one knee, and bowed his head in respect and obedience before their Imperial Majesties. The silence of the moment was shattered by wild cheers of jubilation, upon the King’s order for Zirrix to rise as a Hero of the Empire. The celebrations of the city lasted for days. <br>
<br>
Later, as was custom, their Imperial Majesties asked what boons they might bestow upon Zirrix for his great victory over the enemies of the Respected Race. Zirrix, who had previously conferred with his brother Tzlar, presented a list of requests. Chief among them was that no House who had been made leaderless due to the battle be allowed to fall into ruin. All members of any Line that lost their Patron or Matron in the battle, would either be given an Imperial decree to establish a new House, or granted funds to sustain itself until it’s own resources could be made secure again. No Child of Neriak would feel misfortune after such a great victory. The word of Zirrix’s provisions for his troops had found it’s way into the general populace. Anywhere else, with any other race, that may have been a good thing. But, this was Neriak and the race were the Teir’dal. Hero or not, loyal or not, the King and Queen of Neriak saw the dangers of having both a popular War Hero and Chancellor of the Imperial Council, both of the same noble line, in Neriak together for too long. So, in a grand show of “Appreciation” their Imperial Majesties had officially promoted Zirrix to the position of “Commander of all Imperial Forces in Velious”. It was both an honor and a precaution. <br>
<br>
First, and most importantly, Velious was far, VERY far away from Neriak. Let Zirrix become as popular and respected as he could, as long as he did it on the other side of Norrath. Secondly, for all the impressive sounding of the title, there were in fact almost no “Imperial Troops” in Velious. Oh, there were various groups of adventurers who were born Teir’dal, but not one single Imperial camp or post. Thus, did their Imperial Majesties both reward House T’Rhennic for it’s service to the Empire, and at the same time protect the Royal Family’s interests. Such was the way of the Empire. As Zirrix prepared to leave for his post on the frozen continent of Velious, he stopped and gave one last look at a map hanging upon the wall. His eyes narrowed in hatred and vengeful fury, and he nodded his head in silent anticipation. Adjusting the burnished golden guild badge of the Violent Harvest which he now wore around his neck, he left the war room to it’s silent stillness. As he left, he silently swore to himself that again soon, the forests of the Faydark would feel the wrath of the Respected Race. On the bottom of the map, in the now empty room, was written one word…Felwithe. <br>
