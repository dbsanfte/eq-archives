The young master of the undead...<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I did not know my father nor my mother, fortunately I was adopted by a couple named Karim and Kuneta Volpasse. They were partners in business running a small vending shop selling herbs and other condiments. They were not very well liked by the residents of Neriak because they were known as pacifists, there were even rumors that they had helped a few severely injured &quot;light skins&quot; that had gotten lost and wondered into the Dark city. I did not understand their philosophy but to me it did not matter, they were my parents. They taught me many things but I was jealous of other young dark elves my age as I saw them learning how to wield a sword or how set things on fire. My parents were against any form of violence and that left me with a void that I could not comprehend. All this quickly changed on the night of my eleventh birthday, it is a night that I will never forget.<br>
<br>
It was a very dark and cold night, the kind of night that you would not want to be walking alone outside in the shadows. The wind was howling and the leaves on the trees were rustling as if they had come alive. Our family was<br>
inside in our small and very modest cabin being calmed and mesmerized by the flames of the fire in the fireplace. We heard a long growl outside the door and before anyone of us could react our front door was no where to be seen and a man walked in with two wolves by his side. People had talked to me about &quot;light skinned&quot; beings and I had always dismissed it as a rumor but now before my very eyes I could see that it was true. He wore a red cape and had a long piece of wood in his hand. As soon as he walked in he muttered something in a language unknown to me and both my father and mother seemed unable to move as if their feet had been planted in the floor. The wolves then started gnawing at their legs as I stood there in horror. The man was so focused on my parents that he had not noticed me in the corner. I could feel my heart beating faster and the blood flowing through my veins. Instinctively, I started muttering words of my own in a language that I did not even realize that I knew<br>
and within seconds a skeleton appeared out of nowhere. The skeleton appeared to be alive and with a loud evil laugh killed one of the wolves with one stroke of his mighty fist. The man, stunned by all of this, retreated taking the remaining wolf with him. Yes the battle was over but the worst was yet to come...<br>
<br>
My parents were still very much alive and were able to move. I noticed right away that they looked at me differently, they were scared, no terrified. Immediately my father yelled that there will be no violence in this house and since I had hidden my powers from them, I could no longer be trusted. My mother packed some of my things and they both agreed that they never wanted to see me again. I was but eleven years of age and already out on the streets to fend for myself. I was scared and did not know where to go. I survived by catching fish in the lakes and eating rats. I slept in the woods. My fear turned more and more into anger...and hatred. How I hated that man for having separated me from the only family I knew. I hated everyone around me and I was all alone.<br>
<br>
I am now 15 years of age and recently heard the news that my unarmed parents had been slain by &quot;light skinned&quot; knights. I did not blame my parents, they were too naive to know the difference. There will never be peace in this world as long as there are lightborns to torment us dark elves. My hatred grows stronger by the minute and with it so do my powers. I will avenge my parents deaths if it is the last thing I do.<br>

/OOC English is not my primary language so there are probably bits and pieces that do not make sense. <br>

/ooc that was excellent writing and made wonderful sense, glad to see you accessing the boards, and ecstatic over this wonderful story.<br>
<br>
Creapiing looked up to see her apprentice hesistantly standing at the door. She had only just finished reading an ultimatum from the Lodge of the Dragon Claw, but had a few moments before she wanted to move on to the next paper on her stack that awaited her attention. She motioned for her apprentice to approach her.<br>
<br>
The apprentice moved forward, carefully averting his eyes as all the good ones did. He carefully held out a scroll and waited for Creapiing to take it, bowing and exiting when she did.<br>
<br>
Carefully she unrolled the scroll, recognizing the seal at once. Reaper, she read, you have charged me with the task of discovering where each member of the harvest draws their hate, their strength from...Here is the story of Kalael.<br>
<br>
Creapiing slowly read the missive, then penned at the bottom of the scroll--Watch this one, his hatred is great, and who knows what other powers he may discover within himself when he is stronger. She rang a bell for her apprentice to return, handed him the scroll, and dismissed him.<br>
