Lets say this character will average N unstyled dps.  Now lets look at the options for using both hands for weapons and forgoing the shield defence.  All these options require putting skill pint into an additional style line and giving up shield defence.  The comparison below is based on my understanding of the game, and as such may be wrong.  If you now any of this is wrong please correct me.<br>
<br>
With a Polearm there is a 40% increase in damage. So this lvl 50 char will average 1.4*N unstyled dps.<br>
<br>
LA always swings twice but damage per hit is a percentage of a normal hit (60 + lvl/2) percent. So with a modified LA skill of 50 the average unstyled dps would be 2 * 0.85 = 1.7*N dps.<br>
<br>
With DW the percentage chance to swing is (25 + lvl/4 + DW/2).  So at lvl 50 with a modified DW of 50 the chance to swing twice is 62.5%.  So average unstyled damage is 1.625*N dps.<br>
<br>
Not too bad for DW.  A bit less than LA but more than polearm.  But the real naffness of DW is when you look at styled damage.<br>
<br>
For all these comparisons lets take a mythical style with a growth rate that gives a 1.8 multiplier.<br>
<br>
Normal single weapon will do 1.8*N dps, and lets call this M dps.<br>
<br>
Polearm will do 1.4 * 1.8 = 2.52*N dps (1.4*M)<br>
<br>
LA will do 1.7 * 1.8 = 3.06*N dps (1.7*M)<br>
<br>
DW will do 1.8 + .625 = 2.425*N dps (1.35*M) (only main hand gets style bonus)<br>
<br>
But it gets worse because the DW growth rates are so bad. The pole arm and LA styles will give bigger multipliers.<br>
<br>
The poor old DW is screwed.  At the very least the style bonus needs to be applied to both swings for DW.  On a personal note I would rather swing both hands every round at the average speed and hit for less with each, just like the LA mechanics, rather than have a percentage chance to hit at full damage.  More predictable, more hits, more procs, bring down PBT more.<br>
<br>
DW has to be improved! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fingoniel>Fingoniel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://forums.barrysworld.com/avatar.php?userid=16042&dateline=1026917502" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 357<br> <font color=#000000>(7/7/03 4:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why merc damage sucks</span><hr size=1> only the mainhand for LA gets the style bonus (it's calculated before the left axe reduction too)<br>

Yes, there are places on paper that say it exist. They're wrong. As with any other weapon you get the dps * spd damage not any 40% addition. Your figures are simply outright wrong for poles. As for styles, let's take a look at the specifics. <br>
<br>
The DW styles are:<br>
<br>
Twin Spikes - .07, Twin Return - .85, Shadows Edge - .64, Inflame .56, Orbit - .85, Eclipse - .86, Misty Gloom - .44, Obscure (detaunt) - .00, Penumbra - .88, Reflectional - .85,  Flank - .73, Dark Tendrils - .85, Shadow's Rain - .85, Dual Shadows - .87.<br>
<br>
Pole styles:<br>
<br>
Defenders Cross - .61, Deflect (detaunt) - .00, Defender's Faith - .36, Executioner - .90, Distract - .11, Crippling Blow - .43, Disabler - .68, Phalanx - .70, Mangle - .80, Defender's Rage - 1.19, Poleax - .65, Defender's Revenge - 1.00, Defender's Aegis - .92.<br>
<br>
Both lines have a couple of low level styles that suck badly, but they're low level and quickly outgrown. You might look at poles and say that Defender's Rage and Revenge are fantastic until you realize that although they're the highest damage in the game, they also require being styled on. NO ONE is stupid enough to style against a pole at least not after the first time. The Poleax style is so low it's totally worthless yet it's the 3rd highest pole style. Taking out the Rage/Revenge chain, all of the high level DW styles are better than the pole styles except for Defender's Aegis. Aegis is slightly higher damage than DS but it's also the 2nd in a rear positional chain.<br>
<br>
I really see no basis for your contention that Merc damage sucks. <br>

As far as the DW styles go:<br>
Twin return - Don't evade much, not much use<br>
Orbit - Don't evade, don't Twin return, not much use<br>
Misty Gloom - What the hell is this about, High end, .44 growth rate!!!!<br>
Penumbra - Isn't this just Eclipse with no slow affect<br>
Flank - Not much use, misses more than hits<br>
Dark tendrils - See Twin returns (yet another evade style)<br>
Shadows rain - Missed Flank<br>
Dual Shadows -  Hit me more please<br>

Relflection, Hypnotic darkness chain is great, and Shadows edge, Eclipse/Penumbra is good, but thats about it<br>

I three (well four) shotted an elf (must have been sub-50, hur hur) last night with Amy, Dual Shadows, Dual Shadows and Flurry for teh kill spam, and once again, felt like a man in my tribe.  I dunno if I would use it in a straight up fight against a heavy, but I haven't really felt the sting of the defense penalty.  Not to mention that I'm perhaps one of the fastest attackers out there, so I suppose I could always DS and follow up with an Obscure or something to negate the penalty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rosimond@lighttanksofdaoc>Rosimond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#000000>(7/7/03 9:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why Merc damage is good</span><hr size=1> Yes in fact pole armsmen are at least somewhat gimped, since they have the double spec requirement, extremely slow weapons and low parry. On top of that they have a large variance even with a 50 pole/50 damage spec and a high miss/fumble rate. The growth rate for Misty Gloom is bad but no worse than the rate for Crippling Blow that's the pole anytime style. The advantage for a Merc is we have access to the anytime style from our damage type which you don't while using a pole.<br>

I like the idea of hitting for max potential damage, but I don't like not-swinging it. It's like you're telling me i'v trained for years to swing an offhand, but half the time I just don't feel like swinging it?<br>
<br>
Training that long, i'd assume i'v grown pretty adapt at it, and would be able to style with it. After all, our DW style animation uses both weapons, why can't we have the bonus on both?<br>
<br>
I believe our problem with damage stems from no bonus to our offhand and our growth rates for styles are not advanced-spec rates. They are only slightly better than slash styles growth rates. If we got more growth rates, bonus applied to our offhand, then I'd feel we'd be much better off and a threat. While I believe not using my offhand at times is completly illogical, there needs to be some sort of cut to make sure we arn't overpowered, even if it isn't realistic (sometimes, you just gotta do it). The best course of action, in my eyes, is to allow a bonus to be applied to our offhand (perhaps, make it happen with DW styles only as to not make Infs anymore uber), and see how we are with that (Personally, I'd feel we'd need our DW styles look at considerably in this case, as our styles from that line are lacking. While the idea of having it applied to two weapons is very appealing, the styles themselves may still yet be undesired when compared to other choises).<br>
<br>
Over-all, my damage isn't sucky. It's not good, but it's not sucky. It needs more modifications (what I suggest, or by other means) to become more feasable and attractive, but it's not currently useless. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

It's only slightly lower (and in fact equal or better in some cases). What makes it substantially lower in hard figures as opposed to rate is being applied to only one hand. <br>
<br>
Having the off-hand completely unstyled seems unreasonable to me. Mythic is rarely willing to raise damage but I really beclieve that DW styles should affect BOTH hands or else WHY are they DW? I also agree that the % chance of hitting with both hands is too low. Either they should make the style bonus apply to both hands when you use a DW style or should make a much higher (I'd say 90% with a 50DW spec) chance of hitting with both when using a DW style. (Both would be nice but it'll be a cold day in hell.)<br>
<br>
I don't see Mythic doing this but I think it would be reasonable and would improve Mercs somewhat lackluster damage. I don't agree that Merc damage is sucky but it does seem it could use beefing up.<br>

Dual wielding isn't better than polearms (or any other 2Handed) in term of pure damage while styling. Only when pulse bladeturn is concerned or when out of endurance will dual wield do more damage.<br>
<br>
Style bonus is a multiplier *based* on your base dmg, the higher it is the more benefit you get from styles. So let's say your style is a 1.5x multiplier.<br>
<br>
if you do 100 base dmg., 100*1.5 = 150 dmg with style.<br>
add in offhand dmg (100) at 62% swing rate = 62 dmg<br>
total = 150+62 = 212 dmg<br>
<br>
while polearm gets 40% base dmg increase for being 2Handed.<br>
(100+40) * 1.5 = 210 dmg with style<br>
<br>
As you can see both do the same dmg. when styling if they have the same multiplier (derived from a similar growth rate).<br>
<br>
I have both a 50/50/30 polearmsman and merc. They don't really perform any different than each other in RvR. Polearms has better styles, albion 2H has even better styles, dual wield styles are not really important for a merc as they don't offer anything more than baseline styles, it's only for flurry and swinging your offhand more. <br>
<br>
And mythic will never give styled bonus for offhand weapons, they want to keep 2H/DW/CD etc damage close. It's been suggested since beta by players.<br>

Ummm, you're not using your class's abilites to their full potential then.  DW styles tend to have a pretty good amount of utility to go with them, as well as better damage than most baseline styles, they just take more practice and skill to use properly than amyslash4tehwin! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally I only have 2 slash styles on my Qbar, Amyslash and Backslash, I think I've used Backslash more, though these are the 2 styles I use when in a situation where the other one's won't work (i.e. behind, or in too much lag to even consider a positional)<br>

i.e. <br>
a mythical speed 5 1h weapon doing 100 damage <br>

would do 140 damage if it was 2h and you had 50 spec in 2h. (or polearm)<br>

As for style damage applying to offhand - it's a nice idea and would look cool.... but it's a lot of coding effort for little effect <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (as to keep it balanced they'd have to cut the mainhand style bonus) <p>Fingoniel MacAlpine<br>

<br>
Not sure if i'd consider it a little effect, specially if it warented a cut to the mainhand style bonus.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, we would not need any reduction if this were to be added. It's not like we're doing a whole lot of damage (the whole idea of this is to increase our damage, I very much think our damage output isn't up to par compared to the shear amount of effert that is required of our class). Keep in mind, it doesn't swing all the time and is subjected to misses/block/ect - without the current to-hit bonus, our off-hand is missing much more then I believe mythic intended.<br>
<br>
The only reason I see this as not happening, is because it would need to happen for all light tanks (savage and zerker included). I don't believe Mythic would grant only mercs (and maybe blademasters) this ability and forbid the others, as it just seem too illogical. Even for mythic.. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

It may be great doing all that damage for an unstyled melee but does not take a brain surgeon to figure out that LA has the advantage over DW. First with disrupting casts while target has BT. Next ask yourself how many rounds of combat will you live through to pray to the oh mighty mythic code god that your left hand swings for that dependable 60%+ of the time before you die? If that is not enough to boggle your mind then just take into the consideration of damage adds. Mythic has made this class into the fluffy hosed down damage over time gamblers.
