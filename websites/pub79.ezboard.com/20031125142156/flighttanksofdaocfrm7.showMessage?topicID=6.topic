Read on to find out just why so few players interested in a pure tank choose a Mercenary.<br>
<br>
Bugs:<br>
<br>
Missing Ratfang Thrust Style - Fighters and Mercenaries do not receive the second thrust style, Ratfang, which is used to chain into Wolftooth and Liontooth. Rogues do get this style. It is believed that this has something to do with the fact that Ratfang is a reactionary style going off of Evade, which Fighters/Mercenaries don't have when they get this style. In fact at the time this is normally received (it is only 4 spec points to get it) Mercenaries don't have Parry either, so the only thing the style could react off of would be Block, which you don't find a Mercenary doing very often since they don't use shields. The style is not received when Mercenaries get Evade later either, so Mercenaries never get it and thus can never do Wolftooth or Liontooth either.<br>
<br>
Problems with /stick - Two problems - first the new reduced range of /stick is too extreme, the range should be at least the range of a healer's heal spell, or at least the range at which the names appear above enemy's heads. Second the /stick command sometimes does not work when the target is moving away from you. You move up to your target but are told that they are just out of range. This is most prevelant in laggy conditions where the client/server updating is not very quick, but can also be seen in non-laggy conditions if the target is moving full speed (even if you are moving just as fast or faster). Slightly lowering the distance /stick places you from your target or increasing the range at which you can hit a target in melee would resolve this. Either that or have the server know when you are using /stick and place your character in the appriopriate spot server-side for you. <br>
<br>
High level styles not received: After a certain total number of styles are received, no other styles are received. I believe it's somewhere around 25-26 styles. Because of autotraining and the fact that we learn styles from both our primary weapon and from Dual Weild, it's likely that this cap will be reached before all our styles are received. This is a known bug according to MattF in his comments here.<br>
<br>
Major Issues:<br>
<br>
Damage output - It is widely believed that the reason the Mercenary gives up defensive skills, platemail, and hit points is to have a higher damage output using Dual Weild. However, we have found that Mercenaries are outdamaged by the other melee classes even when using the weapon configuration Mythic recommended (two very fast weapons). Considering this, what are we giving up armor and hit points for? Mahrin Skel commented on a thread about this recently regarding blademasters, and concluded that they do in fact suffer from lower damage output, stating that a change would be looked into. He later confided in me that a change to blademaster damage output would most certainly affect Mercanaries as well.<br>
<br>
Dual Weild styles - Most Mercenary players are suprised to discover that although the graphic of a Dual Weild style shows an attack being made with both weapons, it is actually only one weapon hitting unless we successfully roll a Dual Weild attack like a normal attack. We feel that making the Dual Weild styles always trigger a double attack will make more sense and will do much to resolve the issue of Dual Weild doing less damage overall than other classes (see above).<br>
<br>
Receiving Dual Weild - Every dual-weilding class except Mercenaries and blademasters receive Dual Weild or its equivalent at level 5 (this includes Infiltrators, Shadowblades, Nightshades, Rangers, and even Bezerkers). Mercenaries and blademasters do not receive the Dual Weild skill until level 10. Considering that Dual Weild is the Mercenary trademark skill, it seems odd that Infiltrators get the skill before them (Case in point: The web site doesn't even mention Infiltrators getting Dual Weild, but it does mention Mercenaries getting it, so why are Infiltrators getting it so much sooner?). Dual Weild should be granted at level 5 instead.<br>
<br>
Receiving Parry - Not getting Parry until level 17 (later than every other class in the game that gets it) really hurts the class in numerous ways. First, when Dual Weilding, Parry is the only defensive manuever Mercenaries get besides Evade. The other primary Dual Weilding classes (Bezerker and blademaster) get the skill at level 1, as well as having Evade I by level 5 (Merc's get Evade I at 10 and that's the highest one they get). I see absolutely no good reason why Mercenaries should be missing this skill for so long. If the concern is that they have added defense with Chainmail while Bezerkers and blademasters only get Studded/Reinforced, I would like to point out that those classes already get higher levels of Evade to offset that and they get Evade sooner as well.<br>
<br>
A bigger concern with missing Parry for so long is the detrimental effect it has on our styles. Looking at the Dual Weild styles, you’ll see the second Dual Weild style, Twin Return (granted at spec 4), is supposed to chain off of Parry. Since we don’t have Parry by that point, it instead chains off of our very rare Evade. This makes it so every Dual Weild reactionary style we get is based off of Evade which we hardly ever do since we only get Evade I (the exception is Reflections which is based off of anyone in the group parrying). It would be better to have more reactionary styles based on Parry since if we spend any points in Parry it will go off more often than Evade. The current system severely hampers our ability to do reactionary style chains. This is really unfortunate since one of the few advantages of having fast weapons is the increased chance to pull off reactionary styles .<br>
<br>
Parry needs to be granted at level 5, or at the very least 10. In fact, I would say give it to Fighters at level 1 like Vikings and Guardians – why are Albion fighter types lacking this skill for so much longer than Midgard and even the magical realm of Hibernia? If Parry is not going to be granted at level 5 or lower, than at least make the second Dual-Weild style that goes off of Evade, Dark Tendrils, chain off of Parry instead so we don’t have so many styles dependant on our extremely low Evade skill.<br>
<br>
Reactionary Styles Problems - Reactionary styles are difficult to execute in laggy conditions or when fighting double-hitting monsters (why can monsters double-hit with two handed weapons anyway? No player class can ever hope to double attack with polearms, so why can humanoid NPC's?). The reason for this is that just after parrying/evading and pressing the reactionary style button, by the time the server gets the message that you want to do that style the monster has already attacked again and the style fails (epsecially if it's a double-hitting monster and it was the first hit of the double-hit that you parried/evaded, then it's completely impossible). This game traditionally has tried to avoid forcing people to have “twitch skills” but these styles are difficult to do even for the experienced twitch gamer. I suggest instead of forcing it to be “after the action but before you get attacked again” have it be a straight timer like “within 3 seconds of when you parried/evaded” regardless of whether or not you were attacked again during that time.<br>
<br>
Style endurance costs – Because the bonus damage from styles is based on a % of the base damage of the weapon, and because Mercenaries are generally expected to weild two quick weapons, the Mercenary is forced to do several more styles in order to have the same bonus damage as a slow weapon user.<br>
<br>
To demonstrate this, please examine the following example. Let's take two classes that do the same damage over time, a slow weapon user and a light fast weapon user. We'll call them Slow and Fast.<br>
<br>
Assume both Slow and Fast are doing the same style. Assume this style does 10% bonus damage.<br>
<br>
Slow's weapon normally does ~50 damage per swing. He can get 2 swings off in 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
Fast's weapon normally does ~20 damage per swing. He can get 5 swings off in 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
We'll ignore misses for now, just assume they are both hitting greys (we're concerned with endurance costs not which style does better damage).<br>
<br>
Now let's say that each of them has 10 seconds to damage the mob, and that they execute the style on every single swing.<br>
<br>
Slow does 55 damage per swing (50*10%=5 plus 50=55) and gets 2 swings, doing a total of 110 damage.<br>
<br>
Fast does 22 damage per swing (20*10%=2 plus 20=22) and gets 5 swings, doing a total of 110 damage.<br>
<br>
As you can see, doing the same style on every swing ended up with the same damage for both Slow and Fast since the style's bonus damage is based on a % of the base damage and they both had the same base DPS. However, Slow did the style twice and Fast did the style five times, meaning Fast lost 5 times as much endurance to do the same bonus damage! This means the Mercenary goes through Endurance much faster. It has been suggested that the endurance cost of styles be dependant on the weight of the weapon, such that it would take the same endurance to do the same amount of bonus damage for both small and large weapons.<br>
<br>
Of course if Dual Weild styles always do a double attack as suggested above, this may be less of an issue for Mercenaries but may still be an issue for other classes that wish to use light fast weapons.<br>
<br>
Minor Issues:<br>
<br>
No Thrust initiate weapon – When becoming a Mercenary at level 5, you are given the option of a [slashing] or [crushing] initiate weapon, but no option for a thrusting weapon. Believe it or not, sometimes non-rogue tanks want to try out Thrusting, they should also be given the option to get a nice free initiate weapon in their chosen spec path.<br>
<br>
Lack of spec path variety – This may not really be much of an issue since some would consider this a benefit (less decisions, more focused power), but there’s really very few paths open to the Mercenary - most just max a weapon and Dual Weild and dump the rest in Parry. Some may argue that you could put a lot in shields, but there is absolutely no good reason to do that – if you wanted to have high spec in shield and sacrifice Dual Weild, you’d be better off with an Armsman or Paladin who gets all the same skills plus better armor and more HP. The only thing you’d be missing is the short bow at an earlier level but Armsman get crossbows later on and I really don’t think having a bow a few levels earlier would be worth losing out on plate mail and more HP. Perhaps Shield spec should be replaced with a different spec altogether, one unique to the Mercenary class to set it apart from the Armsman as more than just a weaker Armsman that can Dual Weild (but still ends up doing less damage ).<br>
<br>
Lack of compelling reason to play a Mercenary – Especially with the problem with Dual Weild damage output, there seems to be little motivation to be a Mercenary. After polling the populations of 8 servers (ranging from the crowded Merlin to the empty Iseult) I found that out of the 3 Albion Fighter classes Mercenaries were only 16% of them (Paladins and Armsman came out to 43% and 41% respectively). Also, I interviewed many level 25 and higher Mercenaries and most confided that they thought their class was &quot;okay&quot; but many wished they had chosen an Armsman instead. I believe the current mentality for choosing an Albion Fighter is that if you want melee damage output, become a Polearm Armsman. If you want high defense, become a Paladin.<br>
<br>
I think one of the problems here is that a Mercenary has nothing unique to offer. Originally when the Mercenary was first created, Dual Weild was unique to them and made them interesting. But now that 6 other classes get the ability, there's nothing interesting about a Mercenary. The biggest example I can see of this is comparing a Mercenary to a Bezerker. The Bezerker is similar and has many of their own problems, but they do have unique abilities that make them insteresting – the bezerk skill and the later ability to change forms. Mercenaries have nothing unique or interesting about their class – they are basically a weaker Armsman that gets a long range attack a few levels earlier and Dual Weild (which has questionable value, especially in light of the fact that thief classes also get Dual Weild plus a lot more). Thought should be given for special unique skills for Mercenaries to make them stick out (Perhaps a &quot;Second Wind&quot; skill on a long timer that restores your endurance when you use it - would be helpful to chase down enemies fitting our description as a light fast tank, or to perform a few extra styles in an emergency.)<br>
<br>
Balance:<br>
<br>
Using Mythic's standard balance measurements, the mid level Mercenary isn't doing too bad even though they are weaker than an Armsman in almost every way. They can solo blues and can contribute in groups. They make decent pullers in a pinch. However, this does not mean that they don't need a lot of work done to become a fun, viable, and desired class to be. There is a general feeling of being shafted by this time while playing a Mercenary. The lower level Merc is a bit more on the weak side since they get so few of their abilities until 10 and 17. I don't know how a high level Mercenary fares at this point, although I've heard that with the increased Dual Weild rate that they start to close the damage gap a bit with the polearm Armsman.<br>
<br>
Quick Breakdown<br>
<br>
These are the changes we'd like to see made in a quick summary in no particular order:<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Give Dual-Weild and Parry skills at level 5 instead of 10 and 17 to match the majority of other classes and to fix the problem of most of our styles having to chain off of our very limited Evade I because we don't have Parry when we get the styles.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Consider making the Dual-Weild styles always hit with both weapons to match the class theme and fix complaints of poor damage output.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Fix /stick to work better when chasing enemies with it, and increase its range to a more reasonable distance.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Fix the missing Ratfang Thrust style bug and the missing high level styles from hitting the style cap bug.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Improve reactionary styles interface to be more lag friendly (by allowing them to be done based on a straight timer rather than &quot;before getting hit again&quot; or &quot;before attacking again&quot;)<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Reduce the endurance cost of styles when using a light weight weapon to balance the cost of endurance for doing the same amount of bonus-damage-over-time as a heavy weapon user.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Replace Shields spec with a more appropriate class spec, perhaps something to make the class more unique since it makes no sense for a Mercenary to put points into Shields anyway (much better off being a Armsman/Paladin if you're planning to give up Dual Weild to spec in Shields).<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Consider adding some unique/interesting ability to the Mercenary (such as a Second Wind skill on a timer that restores endurance) to make them more desirable to play similar to how Bezerkers get Bezerk and (later) Shapeshifting.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
While the Mercenary has the potential to be a fun class and certainly looks good at first glance, a lot of Mercenary players are disenchanted with the class's lack of uniqueness and are dissapointed with how much damage it does compared to other tanks (especially when considering the class's lack of defensive power). Also there is a feeling of being shafted compared to other melee classes, especially those from Midgard and Hibernia, in how late they get their core abilities like Dual Weild and Parry. Overall the class has great potential, cool styles to play with, and has a good concept from a roleplaying perspective, but there is little compelling reason to play one when compared to similar classes and they have a distinct lack of depth.<br>
