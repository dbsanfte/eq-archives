A Tempering Flame/*RP*<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So I sat in Neriak's Third Gate, having returned home to serve and heal in my assigned Guard under Dread Lord Serapis, Director of the Eastern Domain. My mind was receiving clarification, my thoughts readily returning to me. Dread Lord Vinar, had fashioned arms and well polished plate with his own hands, commending them into my care. The Thresher and the Prophet were enthusiastic with my recovery, offering me words of support and encouragement.This was all well and good, still I was yet troubled.<br>
<br>
I was proud to serve in the Order of the Harvest, but something of my allies, particularly those that shared the way of the warrior with me, concerned me. My sisters in arms possessed raw skill, and fierce commitment to battle, but their unbridled rage I veiwed as undermining their end aims. The aim of the entire body of the Harvest, the bringing about of the actual deed, the Violent Harvest in the name of the Dark Creator and the Empire of the Chosen.<br>
<br>
So why would rage and hatred concern me? After all we are children of Hate. The imagine that was most poignant in my mind was that of a forged blade, much like the sabres Dread Lord Vinar fashioned so well. A measure of heat is needed, tempering is required, too much of any one element and the blade will snap and be consumed, becoming utterly worthless. It was my belief, some of the Chosen were on the path to be consumed, and wasted, never realizing their potential due to a lack of prudence and control.<br>
<br>
How much easier will be the task of the enemy if they can goad us, shape us, guide our reactions to their benefit? My Father, General Zirrix T'Rhennic had shown me the sacred Triad of the warrior. Will, Control, and Balance. The warrior must have the will to win. She need not be a frenetic beast with a knee jerk reaction to even the smallest slight or threat. Hatred and emotion can wax and wane, while will, if focused, is ever constant. This directly leads to control. Control of your emotions, control of your weapon and control of the choice of your feild of battle, in the best of cases. Being Teir'dal I recongize our nature is passionate and violent. We walk a tightrope through the land of Norrath, and without balance we fall, bleak failures, consumed. Balance is important to the weapon. Ever notice how much more easily a balanced blade strikes and kills? So it is true for the heart and mind of the warrior.<br>
<br>
The combination of the Triad completes the warrior. Other virtues such as duty, loyalty and honor can not be over looked and should be embraced with equal measure. This core of truth sat in my soul, having been tested and passed down through all warriors of House T'Rhennic since time. It was no accident my Father was a General, and our house one of the first of Neriak. <br>
<br>
I was equally concerned that these views brought forward could cause some to question my dedication to Hatred. Hatred, like my Sabre was a tool, I did not reject it. It must however be guided, shaped, directed and implemented. If our foes could use any misinformation, goad and manipulate us at will, the tool of hatred proper would never really come to bear. Why not just set us at each others throats? Why not select a time and occassion then draw us out into a hopeless slaughter? <br>
<br>
The single most important thing that resonanted in me was not the life of one Teir'dal, but the accomplishment of the charge issued from another scared triad, Deity, Empire, and House. The Harvest itself plugged into all these things at once. If we were to succeed we could not be wasted or consumed. The enemy must be faced with focused hatred, will, tact and control. As they become undone in the heat of battle, due to the lack of refinement, we will continue to brutally pick them apart with cold efficiency. This is the way to victory. In my heart I knew how House T'Rhennic would stand, it was just a matter of how many of the Chosen would awaken from mindless reactionary beastial consumption, and move to our side with dignity and honor.............. <br>

<br>
Creapiing walked through the dark alleys, pondering the simple beauty of the shadowed patterns cast on the streets by dark lights. A familiar voice wafted through an open window. -Hatred, like my sabre, must be directed like a tool. It must be guided,directed, shaped and implemented.-<br>
She stood still a moment and then moved on.<br>
<br>
How like House T'Rhennic to so eloquently word her own ideals. Hate, when acknoledged, is endless strength. And yet, as she had explained to many of the Prejudiced light lovers, she did not hate everything. Hate was a tool, and hate can become a focus to give one advantage over any enemy. Many lightlovers rejected the idea that they had hatred within them. Innoruuk calls the Teir'dal to recognize their own hate and to use it for their strength.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly, Innorruk did not look favorably upon those who indulged in hated and rage for its own sake. This path was blind in its own way. Unfocused hate or rage was a weakness, just as denying ones own hate was weakness.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Zressoth would be a good person to charge to teach the new seeds the nature of hatred, for the House T'Rhennic had more to offer than the simple blood of battle.<br>

<br>
In the words of T'Rion C'Glari, the third child of the Prophet Sirruth Taken'dree (c. 1022 PCA) - <br>
<br>
&quot;Let not the friend misjudge my calm for serenity, my peace for complacency, nor my stillness for apathy. Let not my enemy misjudge my truce for fear, my aide for respect, nor my respect for friendship. My heart burns with Hatred pure and deep, consumed with the brimstone of Innoruuk's kiss. Hatred is the nutrient of my soul, the source of my power and the essence of my being. If I am calm, if I am still, it is because I am one with who I am and one with whom I shall ever be. I am the tool of Hate's desire. That is enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
To know yourself is enough, for in it you shall find the creator. Seek it, know it, accept it; for the power of that knowledge shall set you free.<br>
