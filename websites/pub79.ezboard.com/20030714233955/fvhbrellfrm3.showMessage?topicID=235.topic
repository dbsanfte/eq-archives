War Ends - In Game Log &lt;Betrayal&gt;</span><hr size=1> You shout, 'So this is where you hide tonight, Mythral?'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'Well met Reaper of the Harvest'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'have you come to parley once more, or simply to sling more insults'<br>
You shout, 'It depends, have you forsworn your 'war' and agree to return to the Harvest and work together to find the Prophet?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'so long as the Harvest refuses to act in accordance with it's own law, I will smite it'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'and all who support it'<br>
 Kehle says, 'they're still acting funny, mr. Khasirath.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I support teh General - she stands for honr, and I stand for her'<br>
 You shout, 'We act within our law, Faeolin. Are you still standing with the monster who will see all of Neriak razed and bound to unholy blood in his quest?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I stand for the will of the Father'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'That he supports me, says much for his intentions'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'As I suspected, first you try to coddle me back, tehn openly declare me a monster - you wish to get cloise neough to use your touch on me again?'<br>
 You shout, 'House Mistmoore was banished long ago for doing what it is trying to do again now. You support an outlaw House.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'then let us embrace Reaper'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I support no House'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'this was never about my House'<br>
 Kehle says, 'ew, he wants to kiss you!'<br>
 Kehle makes a face.<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'The one House that I would swear fealty too, was taken from me long ago'<br>
 You shout, 'Then who creates all the Revenants, Mythral? Surely not one man, vampire or not, can do so much.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'My House has used me as have you all - never before have I truly stood on my own, but now I chose for myself.  I choose to side with loyalty - and I follow the Renegade'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I stand with the Renegade Faeolin R'Danya!'<br>
You shout, 'You have always stood on your own side, Mythral. Housed within the Grange, openly declairing you serve no god, not even the Father. You used His Chosen for your own gain, and you still do.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'you twist the truth like a basket weaver in rivervale.  Perhaps you missed your calling.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I name thee Khasirath Lieweaver'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I also name you Khasirath'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I name you Khasirath Oathbreaker'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'The Alliance stands in defiance.  The Prophet is not here, show him and I will surrender myself.  Until then, the war will shake the very bowels of Brell's domain.'<br>
 Khasirath saved.<br>
 You shout, 'I twist no truths, Mythral. And I have broken no oaths, Faeolin. As Reaper I was given the power to judge and protect the Harvest as Innoruuk demands.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'yet you judged without proof, and for personal reasons did you make your decision'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'A power you used to judge me and strike me down in the very halls you call sacred *spits in disgust*'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'No, I will not allow you to judge me that way'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'a friend needs to know'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'we're being watched.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'It would be folly to return'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Kehle, child, you lied to me'<br>
 You shout, 'The Dragon of Hate is where combat is forbidden. I chose a punishment Innoruuk would deny if it were not just .He did not do so. My hand struck with His Will.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'You should not have done so'<br>
 Kehle shouts, 'wha? what did i do?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'You admit that you struck Khasirath, but under what grounds?'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'come to me now, away from that bad elf, come to me and I will teach you a righteous life'<br>
Kehle shouts, '*glare* tha same way you tried to teach new magic? uh uh.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'by that same rule, could I have not slain Shaede where she stood?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'for the betterment of the Harvest?'<br>
 You shout, 'You are not the Reaper, Faeolin. And Shaede was to get her trial.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Kehle - I have a present for you.  It is very shiny'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'No, you were adamant about waiting until a trial to judge'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'except when it was inconvenient for you'<br>
 Kehle shouts, 'hmph. you were mean, Mythral. i'm nto going over there now.'<br>
 You shout, 'The blooded one tricked me, I will admit. He made me lose my control, and I have paid in blood at the Father's Throne for my weakness.'<br>
 Kehle shouts, 'and i didn't lie to you, either.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'perhaps not child, come here that we might discuss it'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'hee hee, think i ought to go over there?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Did you not also attempt to sway my thoughts away from what I consider the gift from the Father'<br>
 You tell your party, 'I will not command you, Kehle. But they are very dangerous.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'You sought to water down my hatred, so that you could control it and thereby me'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I see through your ploy's Khasirath'<br>
 You shout, 'I did no such thing. I reminded you that hatred is not to be used against the Chosen. I reminded you to control the gift, not to diminish it.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Yes, you used great restraint against Mythral...yes, I can see that now'<br>
 Kehle shouts, 'mr. Mythral, i wanna know why you and miss Faeolin are acting so mean to us. you used to be nice, but you're different.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, '*spits*'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Fool child, shall I again teach you the proper way to address your elders'<br>
You shout, 'I have admitted and paid for my mistake, Faeolin. Can you say the same for your failings? Would you be willing right now to stand before the Father and ask Him if you are acting in His Will?'<br>
Kehle shouts, '*grrs* you said you didn't stand with us anymore, miss Faeolin. what happened to you?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I have done so, Khasirath'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I survived the night of the blood Harvest'<br>
 You shout, 'It is more than she does not stand with us, Kehle. She has sworn to destroy us.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Only through the purity of my gift'<br>
 You shout, 'Surviving the Blood Harvest does not mean you act within His Will directly. I am coming to believe the Father has little to do with this cleansing. The revenants have something to do with it, don't they, Mythral.'<br>
 Kehle shouts, '*shakes her head* i can't leave any of you for long, can i? everything was fine when i went to Qeynos two months ago.... now you big peoples are acting like humans.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'So again, when the questioning cuts to close to the truth'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I do not know what you are speking of Reaper'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'You turn to Mythral and lay the blame at his feet'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I am weary of that, Khasirath'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'whatever is happening in Neriak is not of my doing'<br>
You shout, 'I lay the blame where Innoruuk's vision has led me, Faeolin.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Half truths and broken oaths Khasirath'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'That's what I see before me'<br>
You shout, 'Not at all, Faeolin. You stand beside the destruction of your people, and you do it willingly.'<br>
You shout, 'The Harvest shall not let it happen.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Have I been given any choice now, did not the Chancellor himself listen to your lies'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I wonder General, was this how it was when they hunted your House to extinction?  All the blames of the world laid upon its doorstep?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'and judge me a rebel and treasonous to the throne'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Where was the justice there?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I remember well, how it was when R'Danya fell'<br>
You shout, 'The Chancellor acted on his own, as is his authority to do so. It is not my concern, and hardly something I can control.'<br>
 You shout, 'If ye wish to know more of that, ask the Council.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I am quite sure that he devoured your brand of truth, and your methods of justice Oathbreaker'<br>
You shout, 'That would be an odd thing, since I have not had time to have words with him.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Never have I moved against the Empire, my grudge was against the Harvest only'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'and those who do not live to do the will of the Father'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'What brand of justice is this?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I will tell you'<br>
 You shout, 'When Mythral declared that he would turn all the people of Neriak into revenants in his quest, and you accepted that statement as his 'commander', you stepped over that line.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'it is Harvest justice, as bent and twisted as your words'<br>
 You shout, 'In that moment you both, and all who served you, became the enemies of the Empire.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Perhaps, Reaper, teh Alliance is the force of Hate's anger brought to remedy the ills your ilk have brought'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I would find the Prophet, were all the Teir'Dal of Neriak to stand before me'<br>
 You shout, 'The Chancellor judged your own words and actions, I had nothing at all to do with his decision.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Or do you find fault with my words as well'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'poerhaps he opened the gates of Neriak to allow the agents of my House in to dole out his ire upon those who have failed him'<br>
You shout, 'The House of T`Rhennic would have no truck with the Agents of Mistmoore.'<br>
 You shout, 'They have been enemies since the day that Mistmoore moved against the King and Queen.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'Since when in teh History of Neriak has teh King ever acted exclusively through his own Houses.  He is the master of plots in Neriak'<br>
You tell your party, 'Wait. I see Vladire. She is here,  spying'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'i knew she was. that means they know i am searching.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'I will act like I don't see'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'i didn't see her, i felt her. women's intuition. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
You tell your party, 'Mythral is here, as a fire elemental'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'i get the feeling i'm being watched.'<br>
They attacked me, three on one. Kehle ran to aid me.<br>
 You resist the Enstill spell!<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Me and mine, are the true Chosen of Innoruuk, Khasirath'<br>
 Auto attack on.<br>
Faeolin slashes YOU for 29 points of damage.<br>
I had to escape them, and they struck Kehle down.<br>
<br>
You shout, 'So ye attack like a pack of wolves. How honorable.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Did you not dance and sing the praises of your martial skill earlier?'<br>
You shout, 'When have I ever?'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Did you not gloat at my defeat upon the battlefield?'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'we learned the tactic the first night when your armies stormed us in teh desert'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Or perhaps you do not remember our defeat in the deserts?'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I assure you - we learn quickly'<br>
You shout, 'We did not fight until your people laid into us without even a proper warning. You started this fight.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'In spite of it all, I could find no counter to your numbers, Oathbreaker'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'We did not strike firstr'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'No, you were warned Khasirath'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Your Ambassador from Kunark was the first to strike'<br>
 You shout, 'Lies. I stood there, I spoke with you all. Shintenshi raised blades against Shaede. It was the first blood.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'No, Khasiraht'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'When you laid the blow against Mythral, that was the first blow'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Come Khasirath, I have sworn to put your head on a pike'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'It is time for you to be judged yourself'<br>
 You shout, 'It is for the Father to judge me, not you. And He has.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, '*laughs wickedly* He has not sought fit to notify me of that, Khasirath'<br>
 You shout, 'The Prophet shall be found, and we shall put an end to your 'rebellion'. One way or another.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I agree on one point, Khasirath'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'The Prophet will be found'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Then K`Thalion and it's conspirators will be exposed'<br>
 You shout, 'And why would the Father notify you, Faeolin? Did you not fail His test? Perhaps you should go before Him to ask forgiveness, and ask about me. I asked Him about you.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Token words, from a lieweaver'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'and like a diseased piece of flesh, removed...'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'he has found me worthy enough to return and do his will, Oathbreaker'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'The rest is not your concern'<br>
You shout, '*chuckles darkly* You keep telling me not to concern myself with you. When you have decried war on my people. What madness. Where has gone the honorable Warrior I knew?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'You have little room to speak of honor Khasirath'<br>
 You tell your party, 'Sorry you weren't able to escape. They attack dishonoably.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I would urge you to remember that you have soiled yours'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'she hit me from behind...'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Mine remains untarnished'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Where iss she?'<br>
You shout, 'And I have admitted and paid for my error. Honor like faith can be redeemed if you are willing to admit your mistakes.'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Where iss Faeolin?'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'I had to run. They snuck up, Mythral is in Fire elemental form, and blending in. He cast on me first while Faeolin struck me from behind. Vladire is here to heal them as well.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Yet I have not erred in this matter, excepting that I did not resort to Harvest justice on the Blasphemer'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, 'i dunno.. she got me from behind.'<br>
You say to your guild, 'I still bide my time and regain my strength. Where are you Ambassador?'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Near ssol b'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'OMW'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Sso we don't know where they are?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Such as he is now'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'They attacked us near Nek'<br>
You tell your party, 'There is Vladire, watching'<br>
 You tell your party, 'We are spotted'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Hail, Vresk'<br>
<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'They appear to be ccentering around Ssol Temple.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'he's teh fire elemental with the cup.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'So you have brought your slave as well Khasirath'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Sscared Faeolin?'<br>
 You shout, 'You know Vresk is no slave, Faeolin.'<br>
 Kehle shouts, 'Vresk is MY pet, not mr. Khasiraths!'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'How you trembled with fear earlier this eve'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Nay, Vresk'<br>
 You shout, 'And is evening the odds so distateful to you? Or perhaps you prefer three on two in your favor?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Then meet me in honorable combat Faeolin.'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'You and I have yet to have a one on one here.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'I sspared your life oncde'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'I have visited the home of your master, and it has had little effect upon me'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'A pity, you would learn a thing or two.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Do you expect my gratitude for your weakness, lizard?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Are you sstill sscared to fight me?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'No, as I have spoken, I know hatred not fear'<br>
You tell your party, 'Nek'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'If the Harvest can have not Teir'Dal champion'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Prove it.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'Mythral is at Nek'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Then I will face whatever pitiful wretch that can be summoned'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Facce me or admit to being the coward you are.'<br>
<br>
Alone, I find Mythral and Vladire at Nek again. <br>
You resist the Entrance spell!<br>
Auto attack on.<br>
Faeolin slashes YOU for 38 points of damage.<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'Coming.'<br>
You say, 'May you be cleansed by Innoruuk's Hate, Mythral!'<br>
Khasirath snarls as his hands are wrapped in a dull black aura.<br>
 You begin casting Harm Touch.<br>
 Mythral writhes in the grip of agony.<br>
You have been disarmed!<br>
You begin casting Life Leech.<br>
You regain your concentration and continue your casting.<br>
 Mythral looks pale.<br>
 You have slain Mythral!<br>
Kehle says, 'eek!'<br>
Kehle says, 'ya'll killed him...'<br>
<br>
I had to break away once more. (and Vresk got bugged) <br>
<br>
Faeolin shouts, '*laughs wickedly*  Perhaps it is fear, Vresk?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Go, coward crawl back to your nest'<br>
<br>
We pull back to Nektulos to regroup.<br>
<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Yes, run coward'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'Where is your champion now, Khasirath'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'he has fled the battlefield'<br>
<br>
We pull back to Nektulos to regroup and plan. Kehle stays in Lavastorm to watch them.<br>
<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
 You have entered Lavastorm Mountains.<br>
<br>
They have remained near Nektulos. We bring the fight to them.<br>
<br>
Vladire has been slain by Vresk!<br>
(Kehle, who had been charmed by Mythral attacked me once and then pet-suicided. Odd bugs these days)<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'come, coward'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'face me again'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'or does the Facelss still hold your fealty'<br>
You have slain Mythral!<br>
Auto attack on.<br>
 You pierce Faeolin for 57 points of damage.<br>
 You pierce Faeolin for 20 points of damage.<br>
 You are too far away to disarm. Get closer.<br>
 Vresk says, 'NO!'<br>
 You begin casting ScreamOfDeathEffect.<br>
 You pierce Faeolin for 94 points of damage.<br>
 Faeolin staggers.<br>
 You have been healed for 20 points of damage.<br>
Vresk says, 'She'ss mine'<br>
You pierce Faeolin for 21 points of damage.<br>
Faeolin feels dispelled.<br>
Faeolin feels dispelled.<br>
Vresk snarls.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Thiss iss all you have?'<br>
 Faeolin goes into a berserker frenzy!<br>
 Khasirath watches on dispassionately.<br>
 Faeolin feels like a killing machine!<br>
Vresk says, 'THISS iss the CHAMPION?!'<br>
Vresk's feet become one with the earth.<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Victory iss ourss.'<br>
Faeolin runs for Nektulos and escapes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mythral shouts, 'now who is the master of teh ambush?  Attacking us as we take our rest...'<br>
Kehle shouts, 'mr. Mythral!'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'yes Child'<br>
Kehle shouts, 'you're still mean.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'That is the Reaper's words child, not yours'<br>
Kehle shouts, 'you made me attack him!'<br>
You shout, '*chuckles* Putting more words in other's mouths.. I never said that to Kehle, or anyone.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I asked you to come to us child - you need to decide - whose side are you on?'<br>
Kehle shouts, 'i... dunno... both you and mr. Khasirath sound right in some places.'<br>
Kehle shouts, 'which one of you is right, though?'<br>
You shout, 'Ask the Father's Hate to guide your heart, Kehle.'<br>
 Kehle shouts, '*giggle* the Father wanted me to go back to the west and work harder. i was ... *sniffle* held back.'<br>
<br>
Vresk followed them into Nektulos to keep watch.<br>
<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'Reaper, she denied me honorable combat.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'Mythral's not here anymore'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'I called her out, and she hid and refussed.'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'Reaper, I have a requesst.'<br>
You tell your party, 'What is it, Ambassador?'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'She forfeited her honor.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'that's what she was saying about us..'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'She betrayss the ccity of Neriak and hass engineered attackss on at leasst 2 noble Houssess.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'ewww....'<br>
 You tell your party, 'You can prove it was her, and not these 'phantoms'?'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'She leadss an army independant of the Indigo Brotherhood.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'She actss on her own, Reaper.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'mr mythral says that mr. Khasirath attacked him wrongly, and both sides are beating on each other.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'By law, her name and Blood are to be sstruck.'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'Yeah, and he killed you Kehle.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'Twicce.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'Sso who are you going to believe?'<br>
 You tell your party, 'In the Grange I did attack him, Kehle. I will not lie to you or anyone.'<br>
Kehle tells the group, '*nod nod* and miss faeolin was being mean while i was charmed earlier today. my mind was fuzzy, but i heard her say something about torture.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'I did something wrong, because he made me believe he killed someone who serves me. And has served me since I was a child. A man loyal to the Father and House S`Therik.'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'Reaper...'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'I mean it.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'I wish thiss matter dealt with.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'Faeolin refussess to redeem hersself.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'I did something wrong, and I have gone before the Father, and been punished for me misdeed.'<br>
You tell your party, '*removes his helm, and shows Kehle his scarred eyes, the violet eyes she knew replaced by stark white*'<br>
Kehle tells the group, 'you look different...'<br>
Kehle tells the group, 'how did that happen?'<br>
You tell your party, 'The Father did this, to punish me, But in punishing me, he cleansed me of my wrongdoing.'<br>
Kehle tells the group, '*nod* well, if that;s what he wanted. you gotta do it.'<br>
You tell your party, 'And He did not punish me for striking Mythral. He punished me for being blind to the truth of who is behind the deaths in Neriak, and the disappearance of the Prophet.'<br>
Kehle tells the group, 'and the others don't believe you?'<br>
You tell your party, '*shrug* Faeolin won't believe me, Mythral won't believe me.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'I do not know of the rest of the Harvest.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'why don't they jsut ask the Father then?'<br>
 You tell your party, 'And it does not matter. I know this truth. And the Father knows this truth.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'I do not know if they have a way to, or if they are brave enough to.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'They seem to believe they act for the Father. But I think they act out of confusion. And I feel they are influenced by outside forces to believe this.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'all Tier'dal can hear the Father.'<br>
 Kehle tells the group, 'they just gotta listen.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'If they choose to listen.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'And the purity of one's blood does make a difference.'<br>
 Vresk frowns.<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'Reaper, I think it iss the only thing they will lissten to.'<br>
 You tell your party, 'Faeolin is of purer blood, though her once-House was struck from the Book of Nobles long ago.'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'I could sspeak to the Queen of Faeolin and Mythral'ss confirmed actionss.'<br>
You tell your party, '*nods to Vresk* Very well, Ambassador. They have taken their actions against the people of the Empire. Tis no longer only a matter for the Harvest.'<br>
 <br>
The Alliance returned to Lavastorm<br>
<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I have returned - will you once again assault my back fiends?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Fiend?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Now issn't that the halfling calling the gnome short?'<br>
 You shout, 'If you cast upon me again, I will strike you again. As I told your 'general' I will defend myself and my people.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'and if your lapdog strikes at me I shall do the same, I shall use all I am or will become to destroy you all'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'You are nothing Mythral.'<br>
Mythral shouts, '*glowers* we shall see.'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'If we are to come to blows again, let it be done'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I tire of the insults of Cabilis, their existence is an insult - and one that shall end in Teir Dal fire'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Do you feel we are sstill beyond reconssiliation.'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'I take it that iss a no then.'<br>
<br>
As we rush into battle:<br>
Payle tells the guild, '*rushes onto the battlefield'<br>
Payle tells the guild, '*stop this fighting immediatelt I bear a message from the Grange'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'You would reconcile with me?  My terms are simple'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'the Prophet and Shaede are there now ith my daughter... he has been restored to health by her'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Show me the Prophet'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'The Prophet is found??'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Hold!'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'And admit to your wrongdoing'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'The Prophet hass been found.'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'Where?'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'they are cut off inside the Grange in Neirak'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'more lies form fools'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'By whom?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Nay, Payle hass found them.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'so you have chosen to reveal him then'<br>
 Payle tells the guild, 'the revenants'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'It is as I suspected, you have had him all along'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Nay.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Nobody had him...'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Aye General, just as you said'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'A moment while we find more information.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Mythral...'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'Who held him Payle?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Care to exsplain why revenantss are penning him in the Grange?'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'General?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'What is this you speak of, Vresk?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'There are revenantss trapping Nosspiratuss and Payle'ss daughter in the Grange.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I told you before, the striking of the agents of my Grandfather is not my doing, I had no knoweldge of it, nor do I know why they have done so'<br>
 Payle tells the guild, 'I do not know all the details my Reaper, I made all haste to the field as to alert you'<br>
 You shout, 'The Prophet was found, and restored to health by the child of Payle. They are trapped within the Grange, under attack yb your revenants.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'How...convenient for you Mythral.'<br>
You say to your guild, 'We parley with the enemy now'<br>
Faeolin says, 'a moment'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'They are not MY revenants.  Unfortunate for you it is your SHAEDE who found him'<br>
Vresk bows before Faeolin.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Peacce Faeolin.'<br>
 Faeolin sheathes her weapons.<br>
 You shout, 'How do you know that, Mythral?'<br>
 Khasirath puts down his weapons.<br>
Mythral shouts, 'Vresk has just said that it was Shaede who found him, did he not?  Shaede is your ally, you have protected her all along'<br>
You shout, 'No, he said Payle had'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'she has chosen this moment to bring him from his cell, but why?'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Nay, I did not.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'I never mentioned Shaede, Mythral.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'How convenient for you then'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'What ccell Mythral?'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'I knew nothing of a ccell.'<br>
 Vresk advances on the vampire.<br>
Faeolin says, 'Shaede &quot;finds&quot; Mythral somewhere in Neriak'<br>
You shout, 'Shaede's wereabouts have been proven. All her holdings have been searched. Can you say the same of yours?'<br>
 Faeolin steps before Mythral.<br>
 You say, 'No one said Shaede found him!'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Do not think I didn't ssee Cromondass buffing you all.'<br>
Faeolin says, 'Shall we once again come to blows, Vresk?'<br>
Mythral says, 'ooc - that was a mix up lol - it was Shaede. hehe'<br>
 Kehle begins to cast a spell.<br>
Mythral says, 'ooc will vbe in tomorrows Neriak Tribune'<br>
Faeolin says, 'The prophet has been found you say?'<br>
 You say, 'ooc - Vresk said payle found her, not Shaede'<br>
Vresk says, 'Aye.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'So what do you propse now'<br>
You say, 'Payle's daughter is there'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'In Neriak no less?'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'That we take you into cusstody as a traitor, and bring Faeolin to the Prophet'ss aid.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Preciouss momentss are being losst while we parley for war.'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'No, Mythral will be brought before no one'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Alternately, I can kill you.'<br>
 Cromondas says, '~A nobleman observes from the hillside~'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'And we can drag Faeolin's unconsiouss carcasss.'<br>
 You shout, 'How are we to be sure these revenants are not yours, Mythral? Outside Freeport you said you would turn every man woman and child into one to find the Prophet.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'That is not an alternative either, Vresk'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Ah, then nothing changes.  You look after your own, I die to absolve all of you of your complicity.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Whichever you prefer.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Do we once again, come to blows in this Vresk?'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Forgive me for having abssolutely NO pity for you Mythral.'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Listen to his words, Oathbreaker'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'If that iss what it takess to ssave the Prophet, then aye.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'I would do that and much more.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'You are a pitious beast, the lapdog of some foreign deity'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'He swore to find the Prophet, not destroy him'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'You have no authority here'<br>
 You shout, 'Why not this: We go together and release the Prophet from the revenants. Then he may tell us who his captors were!'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'YOU are the one who brought thiss upon uss Mythral.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'unless now the Reaper has abdicated his position to you as well'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'T'would be the Harvest who would wish his demise'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Perhaps Tzlar is next?'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Vresk teh Chancellor of Neriak'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'then King?'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'Bah!'<br>
 Mythral spits.<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'You sstall while the Prophet iss endangered?'<br>
You shout, 'Why not this: We go together and release the Prophet from the revenants. Then he may tell us who his captors were!'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Faeolin, the Prophet iss our ally.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Do we go to hiss aid, or bicker?'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'then why have you taken him?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'We haven't.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Revenantss have.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'as long as you continue to threaten, I will remain'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Mythral'ss or another'ss.'<br>
 You say, 'We have not taken him. I know not how he got to the Grange. But he is now in danger'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I threaten nobody.  I wish urgenccy.'<br>
Faeolin says, 'Then cease with your threats against Mythral'<br>
Vresk says, 'He iss to be watched, Faeolin.'<br>
Vresk says, 'By you or ssomebody elsse, it matterss not.'<br>
Mythral says, 'As are you, as are we all'<br>
You say, 'I threatened no one. I have suggested a solution that stops this wasting of time and gets us both answers.'<br>
Mythral says, 'Since when was anyone NOT watched in Neriak'<br>
Vresk says, 'I am as unarmed as I get.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Mythral, it iss revenantss threatening the Prophet, not Iksar.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'My arms can do naught against you, yet'<br>
 Mythral turns an icy glare upon Vresk.<br>
 Faeolin says, 'It is Iksar threatening Mythral'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Doessn't ANYBODY find that a LITTLE odd?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Cusstody iss NOT a threat.'<br>
 You say, 'Shall we bicker, or shall we go to the Prophet's aid? What is more important to you?'<br>
 Mythral agrees with Faeolin.<br>
 Kehle says, 'i want to find the Prophet...'<br>
 You say, 'No custody. We waste time.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I will follow the General in this '<br>
Kehle says, 'if he's in trouble, we have to find him.'<br>
You say, 'We go to Neriak together, or we fight for the right to do so and risk his death. Chose now!'<br>
Mythral says, 'At your word General R'Danya, I will lay down my life'<br>
<br>
(Fae went LD, short break for her return)<br>
Mythral says out of character, 'ok, the highly paid showboating actess is back, resuming, take 6'<br>
Vresk says out of character, 'Anaaaaaaand....action!'<br>
<br>
 Faeolin motions to maleick.<br>
Faeolin says, 'sheathe your blades, this is a parley'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Upon your word General R'Danya'<br>
Vresk says, 'Do we go, or bicker?'<br>
Mythral says, 'I will lay down my life as needed'<br>
Vresk says, 'Becausse I can kill you all in lesss time than it takess to bicker, and we can get to the Prophet that much quicker.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Or.....'<br>
Vresk says, 'WE can go together.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'I know not if I can trust the Harvest'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Or we can annihilate this beast once and for all'<br>
Faeolin says, 'Do not bring me to draw blades again, Vresk'<br>
 Mythral turns an icy glare upon Vresk.<br>
 Vresk says, 'As long as we have your word that Mythral issn't going to ssneak out the back.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I care Faeolin.'<br>
 Kehle says, 'miss Faeolin, you were with us for so long. how can you not trust us?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'No really, I do.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Both of us paid dearly for our battles earlier'<br>
 You say, 'What is more important to you, Faeolin, Mythral? The Prophet, or us?'<br>
 Kehle says, 'I want the Prophet back.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Your lack of honor meanss nothing compared to the Prophet.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'The Prophet was always my primary concern'<br>
Mythral says, 'Or loyalty and honor?  I hear precious little  of that from you these days'<br>
Vresk tells the group, 'And then Maleick.  And then Faeolin.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Continues lies and insult endanger what little truce we have made here, Vresk'<br>
 Vresk tells the group, 'To bicker here iss a worsse disshonor than attacking them to get to hiss aid.'<br>
 You say, 'I go to the Prophet now. Walk with me or stab me in the back, but I go for answers.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'The prophet has been my only concern throughout.  Have I been so unclear?'<br>
 Khasirath begins to walk past.<br>
 Faeolin says, 'NO, you will not travel without me Khasirath'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Aye....with revenantss chassing him now, you do.'<br>
 Faeolin puts her hand out to stop him.<br>
 Faeolin curses aloud and begins her journey.<br>
 LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
 You have entered Nektulos Forest.<br>
 You have formed the group.<br>
<br>
Vresk follows Mythral.<br>
Faeolin says, 'I will not have you slay him while I stay behind'<br>
You say, 'None will be harmed but the revenants if they try to stop us.'<br>
Faeolin says, 'I know not what plans of yours became unraveled'<br>
Vresk says, 'And Mythral if he commandss them.'<br>
 You say, 'Arm yourselves for the battle to come. But if you lay blades or spells against us, we will defend ourselves.'<br>
Faeolin says, 'but the Prophet will be safe this day, or I will find my death'<br>
Mythral says, 'I guarantee you this Vresk, If I do command them, you will not live past the threshold of the city'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'then swear this, Khasirath'<br>
Faeolin says, 'if you still hold sway amongst the Harvest'<br>
Faeolin says, 'since I hold your honour suspect, swear to the Father that you will not turn on me aand mine while we secure the Prophet'<br>
You say, 'If you will swear the same for your people.'<br>
Faeolin draws blades.<br>
Faeolin nods at Khasirath.<br>
Faeolin says, 'Swear it, Khasirath'<br>
Faeolin says, 'None shall leave from here, before I am satisfied'<br>
 Vresk 's sigil of Hate blazes red hot.<br>
 You say, 'I swear upon the Father of Hate, Innoruuk, that I and the Harvest shall not harm the Alliance of the Damned once the Prophet is secure. Unless they first raise blades or spells against us.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Thiss iss a wasste of time.'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'I swear upon the Father of Hate, Innoruuk, that I and the Harvest shall not harm the Alliance of the Damned once the Prophet is secure. Unless they first raise blades or spells against us.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'You have my honor I will leave him be.'<br>
 Mythral nods at Khasirath.<br>
 You say to your guild, 'All are to abide by the Reaper's Will in this.'<br>
 You say, 'I have repeated this oath to all in the Harvest'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And if Mythral controllss the revenantss?'<br>
 Kehle says, 'we won't attack you.'<br>
 Mythral nods at Kehle.<br>
 Faeolin says, 'I Faeolin of fallen House R'Danya, swear before the Father and as one of his chosen, that the Alliance of the Damned will not raise blades against the Violent Harvest, save in defense of the Prophet Nospiratus'<br>
You say to your guild, 'We shall for the moment accept Mythral's word. Only for the Prophet's safety.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'are you satisfied?'<br>
 You say, 'I am.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'then let us make haste'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'Faeolin has sworn the same oath for her people'<br>
You shout, 'Rally at the Gates of Neriak!'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'The alliance will rally within the Foreign Quarter'<br>
 Faeolin shouts, 'Ere we strike'<br>
<br>
Neriak – Foreign Quarter<br>
Mythral bares his fangs at the silence and the smell of blood.<br>
 You say, 'Vresk is just inside the Commons.'<br>
Mythral seems uneasy, agitated.<br>
Mythral says, 'He will kill himself if my grandfather's fprcecs are within'<br>
 Faeolin listens to the sounds emanating from the tunnel to the commons.<br>
 You say, 'Lightborne kill our guards inside... He sees nothing more'<br>
Faeolin says, 'come then Alliance, let us enter.'<br>
 You say, 'We go.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Stand ready for battle, I know not what we shall find'<br>
<br>
You have entered Neriak - 3rd Gate.<br>
Khasirath watches the Spires uneasily, ready for battle.<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'those were no lightborn - they were the remnains of a feast - animated and slaughtering our guards'<br>
Faeolin emerges from the corridor, impatiently waiting for battle to be joined.<br>
Mythral shouts, 'The smell of blood is so thick - I sense my mother's presence.  She did not heed my advice'<br>
Faeolin manuveurs so as to keep an eye on all of the Harvest here.<br>
Mythral shouts, 'Mother!  Return to teh castle, trouble us no longer!'<br>
Khasirath clenches his jaw, focusing only on the task ahead.<br>
Mythral shouts, 'I can smell them'<br>
You say, 'Let us move in.'<br>
You say, 'Mythral has gone ahead?'<br>
Faeolin says, 'I sent him to find the Prophet'<br>
You say, 'We go together.'<br>
Mythral sees the remains of bodies of people he knew.<br>
Mythral sees masses of flesh, no longer recognizeable.<br>
 Vresk watches Mythral carefully.<br>
Kehle says, 'ew.... smells nasty in here.'<br>
 Vresk stops.<br>
 Faeolin pauses a moment.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Blood....sso much....'<br>
Mythral shivers uncontrollably.<br>
 Vresk 's eyes go red.<br>
 Faeolin listens intently.<br>
Mythral says, 'The blood is so thick, so very ....'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Misstmoore....'<br>
 Faeolin opens the gate and steps through, prepared for battle.<br>
We pass the Dragon of Hate on the way to the Grange<br>
 Mythral kneels down.<br>
You  kneel before the Dragon of Hate.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'The streets are empty - is there no on e left?'<br>
Faeolin says, 'where, Mythral?'<br>
Faeolin says, 'where do you feel them at?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Well ssincce you've drained everybody...'<br>
 Mythral says, 'there'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Careful!'<br>
<br>
We battle through the revenants together to reach the Grange.<br>
Mythral shouts, '*Mythral shrieks into the  air and stikes one of the fiends*'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'THere!'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'They attack him!'<br>
 Mythral shouts, '*They are in teh shadows, beware!  They agather about the grange like moths'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I heard a scream!'<br>
Mythral shouts, 'Faeolin - are you alive?'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'I am, they have not struck at me yet'<br>
 You shout, 'I am with your general. Where are you Mythral?'<br>
 You shout, 'Where is the Prophet!'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I am with your Ambassador'<br>
Faeolin shouts, '*twirls her blades in a deadly dance, as a shadow lunges from a corner*'<br>
You shout, 'To the Grange!'<br>
 Vresk strikes out at yet another monster.<br>
Mythral shouts, 'we shall bar the gates and block entry!  If there are any within those sequestered can taken them out.  Destpory the revenantes with blows to the head!'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'I am asssissting Mythral.'<br>
 You shout, 'We are at the Grange! Rally!'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'They delay uss too long.'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Presss forward to the Prophet.'<br>
<br>
Fighting to the second floor we find the Prophet and he tells us the tale of his capture (look for his post on that later)<br>
<br>
Vresk starts hurling revenants over the edge.<br>
Mythral says, 'So, this is where it ends, Nos is here with Shaede and Sabratha'<br>
Vresk shouts, 'Faeolin, ssummon the Indigo Brotherhood!'<br>
 Mythral says, 'And tomorrow, we chase the fiends of Mistmoore to their castle and commit genocide on my own house'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'You forget, Vresk'<br>
Faeolin shouts, 'That I have been branded traitor, again through Harvest justice'<br>
 Vresk dumps over one of the urns of flame to block the creature's passage.<br>
You shout, 'That was the work of the Chancellor, not the Harvest. Ye must make ammends with him, not us.'<br>
 Vresk shouts, 'Your actionss branded you as ssuch.'<br>
<br>
 Mythral says, 'No, I started a war because I knew ... '<br>
 Faeolin says, 'it's all your fault Khas'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I thought I knew...'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'if you wouldn't have taken the bait'<br>
Faeolin says, 'I wouldn't have....'<br>
 Mythral says, 'It was much clearer at the beginning'<br>
You say, 'Ye acted without all the facts...'<br>
 Mythral says, 'As did you, I seem to recall'<br>
 You say, 'As did I... In one instance.'<br>
Mythral nods at Khasirath.<br>
You say, 'An instance well orchastrated by yourself.'<br>
Mythral says, 'A test which you failed, as well as I failed mine'<br>
Khasirath nods grimly.<br>
Mythral says, 'I was used, I did not know until last night'<br>
Mythral says, 'But I have seen only threats continue'<br>
Mythral says, 'I have the right to survive and to defend myself.'<br>
You say, 'You started a war. We had to defend ourselves.'<br>
You say, 'My only threat is that I would end this.'<br>
Mythral says, 'You were all bent upon my destruction.  I had to enlist defenders.  How could I stand against you alone?  Besides, I was foreced to find the Prophet'<br>
You say, 'Done is done. Let us heal our city first. We shall complete our peace once Neriak is secure.'<br>
Vresk sits and relaxes.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Faeolin...'<br>
 Vresk frowns.<br>
 Vresk says, 'We ssaid ssome unkind thingss.'<br>
Mythral says, 'Khasirath. House Mistmoore has invade this realm'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I doubt all were true.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Oncce all factss were known.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I was not a part of that invasion, nor have I been'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Yet I do not think you will ever hold resspect for me again.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I jusst want you to know I can acccept that.'<br>
 You say, 'You knew your mother was here, Mythral. How long have you known?'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'You have driven a rift between us, Vresk'<br>
 Mythral says, 'There is only one thing that can be done to porve this'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Though...it iss painful.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'You were on the wrong sside, Faeolin.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I did what Honor demanded of me.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'No, Vresk'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Four nights past I knew, she came to me in teh woods, she was seeking something'<br>
 Mythral says, 'but it wasnt me'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'You did what your pride demanded of you'<br>
 Mythral says, 'She sought something else - they all did'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Nay Faeolin.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Deep inside, you knew that I would hold true to my honor at all costs'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I did what honor demanded of me.'<br>
You say, 'The downfall and control of Neriak's Empire. As they did in the past.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'We have to rout them out of the city - but they will flee to teh castle'<br>
 Vresk says, 'You and yourss formed an army not ssanctioned by thiss ccity.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'That has always been my way'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Perhaps - I think somehting else - it wwas focused'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And Mythral wass killing Teir'Dal left and right.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'I did what I thought was just'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Your way wass illegal Faeolin.'<br>
 Mythral ignores the Ambassadors false accusatrion.<br>
 Vresk says, 'In the end, you did what Pride told you to do Faeolin.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Since when do the ends not justify the means amongst Teir'Dal'<br>
Vresk says, 'Ssincce HONOR demandss otherwisse.'<br>
 Vresk hisses in anger.<br>
Vresk says, 'And one day YOU believed that.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I suggest we follow my mother's trail'<br>
 Vresk says, 'You know who told me about Hate with Honor firsst Faeolin?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Do you?'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'No, I saw the lack of honor in Khasiraths actions'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Let me remind you.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'It will lead to the estate, and there, we can have a ...conversation'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'That is inexcusable'<br>
 Vresk says, 'It wass you.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Your actionss, in attacking the Harvesst were unaccceptable.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Mayong first played me the fool against teh Harvest, now my mother has followed in his path.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'If you had a problem with the Reaper, you could have had a duel of honor to deccide the matter.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I have had enough!'<br>
 You say, 'I did act improperly Faeolin. But I was baited into it. I have made reparation to the Father. And if necessary I shall make them to Mythral as well.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'No, that many rallied to his defense'<br>
 Vresk says, 'They are neccesssary, Reaper.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Or thiss iss all for naught.'<br>
 Mythral shouts, 'I swaer by Hate's Black Heart, Miostmorre Castel will burn by my hand!  Nevermore shall I be the pawn to their king - this SCion is a Mistmoore no longer!'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'made it clear to me that his actions were condoned'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I've counsselled that from the beginning Reaper.'<br>
 Vresk stops and looks at Mythral.<br>
 You say, 'Then they shall be made. In the way of Mythral's choosing. I wronged him, and I will pay for the crime. The Father is paid, and so shall Mythral be.'<br>
Vresk slowly smiles at Mythral..<br>
 Faeolin listens to Khasirath.<br>
 You nod at Mythral.<br>
 Mythral says, 'There is no time for reparations within'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Already they sense the tide shifting against them'<br>
You say, 'And the Harvest shall assist you in this razing.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'the armies of teh Empire, aided by the Harvest and teh Alliance, have turned them away at teh last'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Mythral finally admitted hiss Hate to himsself.  That Hate iss more important that even hiss blood.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Yes Ambassador'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Hate is all that matters now'<br>
 Vresk bows before Mythral.<br>
 You say, 'After the Castle is fallen, we shall talk more of my blood-debt to you, Mythral.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I kneel to Hates fury'<br>
 Kehle cheers at Mythral.<br>
 Vresk says, 'I told you that it wass there.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Did I not counsel his innocence this whole time, Vresk'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I absorb it'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I accept it'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Do not kneel.  Channel it, as you do your mana.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Nay Faeolin, thiss iss ssomething different.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I am learning to do so - ever since teh Reaper awakened my eyes'<br>
 You say, 'He has admitted his was not innocent, but controlled. Played even as he played me in the Grange.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Ssomething Mythral and I have disscusssed for far longer than thiss war.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'IN the shattering sound of my ribs, I heard Hatred call my name'<br>
 You say, 'he was not*'<br>
Faeolin says, 'did he act of his own free will?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Then it wass, ironically, the Reaper that did thiss.'<br>
 Khasirath nods.<br>
 Mythral says, 'I was a tool - but in the end, I fought you for the right to exist, and I fought with Hatred'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Yes'<br>
 Vresk says, 'You owe him much, Mythral.'<br>
You say, 'As I said, it was the Father's Will that guided my hand. Not in just retribution, but to awaken Mythral's Hate.'<br>
Mythral says, 'Perhaps, after I destroy my inheritance, tomorrow eve, perhaps there will be time to see what I owe'<br>
Vresk says, 'Mythral.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I believe that the two actss.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'This matter is far from closed, though'<br>
You say, 'I did not see it then. But I see it now. The Father has given me new eyes, but it is my quest now to learn to use them.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Hiss harming you, and you're eyess being awakened...'<br>
 Mythral agrees with Faeolin.<br>
 Vresk says, 'I ssee that the gift canccellss the debt.'<br>
 You say, 'As I said, once Mistmoore is razed, Mythral and I shall speak more on the debts owed.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Know thiss.'<br>
 You say, 'That is for Mythral and I to decide to our mutual satisfaction, Ambassador.'<br>
 Mythral crosses his arms, and nods his acceoptance.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Perhapss there were thingss ssaid and done on my sside you do not like.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'But I do not take them back.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I did as I sswore to do when I joined the Harvesst.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Let me be equally clear Vresk of Kunark'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And I will not assk forgivenesss for that.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I hate you'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Good.'<br>
 Vresk grins evilly at Mythral.<br>
 Mythral says, 'I loathe you'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Even better.'<br>
 Kehle giggles at Mythral.<br>
 Mythral says, 'I despise and revile you'<br>
 Kehle says, 'you're learning fast, mr. Mythral.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'But'<br>
 Khasirath grins wolfishly at Mythral.<br>
Mythral says, 'I will not act against you until this matter is resolved.'<br>
 Faeolin whirls around.<br>
 Vresk says, 'And I shall do the ssame.'<br>
Faeolin says, 'are those not the same words of Hatred that I had used?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Ssincce it wass indeed not your revenantss doing the attacking in thiss casse.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I will defend you as I will the General when we invade the place of my birth'<br>
Faeolin says, 'yet I was condemned and told that I was in err'<br>
 Mythral says, 'And I will do all I can to enable you to bring about the destruction of House Mistmoore'<br>
 Vresk says, 'You were, Faeolin.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Mythral DID usse hiss powerss to turn people againsst the Harvesst.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And you ssided with him.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'My revenants are about you now.  And tomorrow, if all turns out as it may, they will be released with little memorty of these events.  Then I will seek a cure for them'<br>
 Faeolin shakes her head.<br>
 Vresk says, 'While you may have done what you thought wass right at the time, it doessn't make it any better.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'No, I am referring to his hatred of you and the rest of those assembled'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Then that, Mythral of Innoruuk, will be your ssaving gracce.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I am waht I am.  As Khasirath has awakend my Hatred, so has my mother taught me control'<br>
 Vresk says, 'What of it, Faeolin?'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I'<br>
 You say, 'Hating one another and using hate against one another are different.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Faeolin, I never condemned you for your wordss of Hate againsst me.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Was that not near to my argument, Khasirath'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I oppossed you the moment I had proof that you actively worked againsst the Harvesst.'<br>
 Mythral looks at Vladire and Maleick.<br>
 You say, 'That was all I was trying to tell you that day. I do not know where we misunderstood one another.'<br>
 Mythral nods to each of them sending a telepathic message.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Though you are correct, Faeolin, the Reaper did take offencce at your argumentss at the time.'<br>
 You say, 'I never once suggested you lessen your hate, only to control it and use it against our enemies, not eachother.'<br>
 Mythral they are free to act in defense of teh Harvest as well as teh Alliance.<br>
Faeolin says, 'Was there ever a doubt initially that I would do such a thing?'<br>
Faeolin says, 'Had I ever given you reason to doubt?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Initially, no.'<br>
Vresk says, 'But it didn't take long.'<br>
You say, 'You seemed on the edge of doing so. I was reminding you to keep control. That was all I meant.'<br>
Faeolin turns back to gaze over the city.<br>
Vresk goes to Fae's side.<br>
 You say, 'There is much to be rebuilt.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Faeolin.'<br>
 Faeolin mutters to herself.<br>
 Mythral says, 'Indeed'<br>
Vresk frowns.<br>
 Vresk says, 'I Hate ssaying your name like that.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Faeolin, on the morrow...'<br>
Vresk says, 'When we asssault Misstmoore...'<br>
Faeolin looks at Vresk a moment, then gazes back over the city.<br>
 Mythral says, 'Then let us return to the field and rout the agents from their shadows'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Do you think it posssible we could fight together as one?'<br>
 Vresk says, 'As we ussed to.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Follow your nose - the smell of blood will be thickest about them'<br>
Khasirath nods to Mythral, his hunger for revenge against the revenants unsated.<br>
 Faeolin says, 'I know not where my path will lead me, Vresk'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I have no nosse...I musst tasste teh repugnant odor on the wind.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I do not know - that will be up to teh General and Reaper to decide'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Much loss have I taken, much damage have I done'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I will approach the counccil on the morn.'<br>
Vresk says, 'And sspeak with Housse T'Rhennic.'<br>
 You say, 'I think it best we blend our forces. So that if some still doubt we may watch eachother.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'I will say this'<br>
 Mythral agrees with Khasirath.<br>
 Mythral says, 'An act of trust Khasirath?'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'That my hatred burns....'<br>
 Vresk says, 'It wass Shaede who made the initial accusation, not yoursself.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'it burns deeper and hotter than I have ever known possible'<br>
 You say, 'Aye, Mythral. Trust must be rebuilt, so that we may truly honor one another again.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And, while your Housse wass doomed agess ago, I will do what I can to influencce them to leave you be in thiss matter.'<br>
 Khasirath nods to Faeolin, his white eyes reflecting the glow of the flames.<br>
 Faeolin says, 'It is rare that I find myself able to find a single object of my wrath'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Mistmoore will fall'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'All of it'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Yes, Mistmoore will fall'<br>
Faeolin says, 'For what I have suffered, for what has been done to us'<br>
Faeolin says, 'There will be no quarter given'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Reaper.'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'I find...'<br>
 You told Kehle, 'I don't remember... Its posted I think'<br>
 Mythral says, 'They will regret the day my mother bore me into their dark world.  For no one can hunt their kind...'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'I find I am regretting my Hate for the firsst time ever.'<br>
 You say to your guild, '*looks to Vresk*'<br>
 Mythral says, '...like their kind.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'As long as your path parallels mine'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'We...'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'We shall strike as one'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'We were not kind to them.'<br>
 Safyran tells the guild, '*gasp*'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'And...'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Truly, they desserved it not.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'beyond that....who can see'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'We were all played... like pawns... Blind. There is much to be made right.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'That is for tomorrow to ecide Genereal.  Let us first get through the night'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, '*growls* I *TRIED* to tell everybody.'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'But nobody would lissten.'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, 'isn't this all the work of that old Mistmoore vampire in a keep to the east?'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'And I had no proof but a faded bit of a dream.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'There is battle to be done ere we rest'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'It is Kehle.'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Aye, it iss.'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Though...'<br>
 Safyran tells the guild, '*shaking her head in confusion* where could we have made our mistake?'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, '*ponders*'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Whether the city accepts us as theirs, the city is ours nonetheless'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Although...'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Let us take it back'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'Let it be known to the Harvest! The Alliance of the Damned are not our enemy!'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, 'i wonder why he set us against each other like that. i never saw us turn on each other before.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Perhapss it wass our Hate that allowed uss to ssee the Truth.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'yes, the time for violence has not yet passed'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'The House of Mistmoore is behind the Blood Harvest! Behind the death and horror in Neriak!'<br>
Safyran tells the guild, 'I shall spread the word throughout the Harvest'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'Mythral has renounced them! He was not a part of this!'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'For if we had not gone to war, had we merely backsstabbed each other in darknesss....then we would have been ended.'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, '*frown* i didn't understand why all of you were possessed to kill each other in the first place, Vresk.'<br>
 Mythral says, 'Beware the ceilings, and never be alone'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'I wass defending you Kehle.'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'On the morrow we shall join forces with the Alliance of the Damned and lay waste to the Castle of Mistmoore!'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'When did you ssee me fight?'<br>
 Safyran tells the guild, 'we must find the betrayer and make them pay'<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'Before or after you were attacked?'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, 'i still need t oslap Mythral for killing me.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Do it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
 Vresk tells the guild, 'He'll Hate you for it I'm ccertain.'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, 'good! he needs to hate more.'<br>
Faeolin says, 'I am no longer welcomed in the Grange.  We have called a truce but I have yet to make peace'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'The Prophet has been found'<br>
 Kehle tells the guild, '*grin* done.'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'The tide turned in our favor in this place'<br>
 Safyran tells the guild, 'well brethren... this revelation has exhausted me.  I must make camp to ponder what has occured, and find a new focus for my Hate'<br>
 You say, 'I have passed the word to the Harvest of Mistmoore's hand in this. they know you are not our enemy and that tomorrow we go to raze what Mistmoore holds.'<br>
 Safyran tells the guild, 'I make my camp for the night, Hate with Honor family'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'I retire from the field of battle, I will make my way to my encampment.'<br>
 You say to your guild, 'The Prophet is safe. Know that and rest well in Hate's embrace. For on the morrow we go to war with our true enemy! MISTMOORE!'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'Mythral, come to me on the morrow'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I will stand guard with you my Captain'<br>
 Faeolin says, 'There is much to discuss'<br>
 Mythral says, 'I will not let you rest alone - it is not safe'<br>
Mythral says, 'As you wish General'<br>
 Faeolin nods wearily.<br>
 You say, 'Tomorrow, we meet at Mistmoore. We shall comingle our forces and strike as one to drive Hate deep into the black heart of the place.'<br>
GUILD MOTD: Vresk - Friday we join the Alliance of the Damned to take down our true enemy Mistmoore!<br>
Mythral says, 'If Thule can find a place to root among Teir Dal, it iwll be there, in teh hearts of Mistmoore.  When they see the eyes of vengeance come to cleanse the world of their taint'<br>
Faeolin looks exhausted almost to the point of body failure.<br>
 Mythral bows before Khasirath.<br>
 Faeolin says, 'yes...on the morrow'<br>
 Mythral leads Faeolin off the balcony.<br>
Mythral guides her to teh camp.<br>
 Khasirath salutes the Alliance of the Damned, one and all.<br>
<br>
The Alliance leave the balcony. Vresk, Kehle and Khasirath stand alone.<br>
 Vresk says, 'They wouldn't lissten.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Reaper...'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I don't Hate any of you.'<br>
 Khasirath watches from the balcony of the Grange as the Alliance makes their way into shadow.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Call me what you will.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'But I don't.'<br>
You say, 'Vresk... I do not hate my allies either. Unless they act against me.'<br>
Vresk says, 'You are my alliess...and it upssetss me that I have losst them as friendss.'<br>
Vresk says, 'It alsso upssetss me that Faeolin will never truly feel at home with uss.  She made that plain at the sstart.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I musst meditate upon thiss.'<br>
 You say, 'Everyone understands Hate their own way. Some feel they must hate every thing that crosses their sight. Others save it for their greatest needs.'<br>
<br>
Kehle takes her leave (Thanks to a LD)<br>
 You say, 'As long as that hate serves the Father, I can accept it.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Perhapss.'<br>
You say, 'There will be much work to do, even after Mistmoore falls. Much reparations to be made.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'But I don't think Faeolin believess that deep down.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I think, in her inner core, she iss fond of uss.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Or wass.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I will make no ssuch reparationss.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'As I've already ssaid, I did what Honor demanded.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I came only when it wass neccessary.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'To prevent the deathss of the Harvesst.'<br>
Vresk says, 'And, you'll note, I never oncce killed Faeolin.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'In fact, I sspared her life when it would have been eassy for me to end it.'<br>
 You say, 'I did the same in the war, but in a sense it was my hand that caused the sundering. Baited or not, it was my act to make.'<br>
Vresk says, 'By even forccing Tzlar to hold back hiss mana.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Perhapss.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'But, in the end....I wass right.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Ssoon after I wass hatched, I wass taught that being right wass all that mattered.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I look around me...at what happened.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And, at leasst in thiss insstancce...it didn't matter at all.'<br>
 You say, 'I will make what reparations are necessary to keep the Harvest whole and strong.'<br>
 You say, 'To the world I say: Tis better to swallow blood than pride.'<br>
 You say, 'To my family.... pride does not mean so much.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I feel I am owed an apology by them.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I don't ssupposse I'll be getting that.'<br>
Vresk chuckles.<br>
 You say, 'Now that they know the truth of things, I hope they can see that it is owed. And Faeolin shall have much to do to make peace with the Chancellor. If such a thing is possible.'<br>
 Vresk closes his eyes and scratches idly at the brand on his left arm, his fingers sizzle and seem to burn when he does.<br>
Vresk says, 'I will do as I ssaid I would.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And sspeak with him.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'It would be in Cabiliss' besst interesstss if Faeolin were to be pardoned.'<br>
 Khasirath stares across the water, his gaze caught by the mage-light of the Eye of Innoruuk. His white eyes reflect the blues and reds of the rune.<br>
Vresk says, 'It won't mean much.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'But I owe it to her.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Beyond that...'<br>
 Vresk says, 'She can come to ME to regain the honor she losst.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Perssonal honor between uss, not her own.'<br>
 Khasirath nods thoughtfully.<br>
 Vresk says, 'She wass wrong, though she will never admit it.  I know her that well.'<br>
 You say, 'There is much to be rebuilt. In Neriak, and in our hearts.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Ah well.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'We fought well.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'And desspite what Faeolin ssayss.'<br>
 You say, 'That we did, Ambassador.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'We desstroyed them.'<br>
 Khasirath nods grimly.<br>
 Vresk grins with the memory of it.<br>
 Vresk says, 'We will do quite well when it iss time to attack Cabiliss.'<br>
 Khasirath grins wolfishly.<br>
 You say, 'May the hate in our hearts bring them to the ways of the Father.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Aye.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Much more of thiss and the Emperor will die of a masssive heart attack.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'A shame I don't really care.'<br>
 Khasirath chuckles softly.<br>
 Vresk says, 'Perhapss it iss time for a new Emperor, neh?'<br>
 You say, 'Perhaps...'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I go to meditate, Reaper.'<br>
 You say, 'I must seek my own meditations as well.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'I musst deal tomorrow with the Court...and that requiress sspecial preparation on my part.'<br>
 Vresk says, 'Shadowss guide you.'<br>
You say, 'Hate an honor guide thee true'<br>
<br>
Khasirath stands alone on the balcony of the Grange, overlooking the bloodied and broken streets of Third Gate.<br>
 You say to your guild, 'Hate and honor guide the Harvest true. I go to my meditations in preperation for the morrow's battle.'<br>
