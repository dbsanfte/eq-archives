He clutched a note in his hand that had reached him all the way out on the frozen wastes of Velious. Pausing for a moment, he quickly read over it again. It was scribbled on some torn piece of parchment and made no sense at all. Something didn't seem right about the confusing contents of the letter which were simply &quot;I will make you powerful.&quot; A shoulder brushed his, he quickly glanced up and barely caught the face of the man he had bumped into. It was his own face, smiling that dark smile that so many had seen as they fell before his blade. &quot;What the hell?&quot; Magil said it aloud. His words seemed to echo off the walls and back into his own mind. Who was that man?<br>
<br>
     He had reached his destination. It was the home of some noble. The house itself was appeared to be carved out of the rock that made the cave wall, just with some granite detail that made it look like it had actually been constructed like a normal dwelling. Magil had never seen this house before, but it had been years since he had visited Neriak. The door was unlocked, so he simply let himself in. This also struck Magil as strange. What kind of idiot would just leave his door unlocked in a place like this? There was a man sitting at the table just inside the door. The room was illuminated by a small gas lamp on the man's table and cast awful distorted shadows all over the walls. From what Magil could see, the house was furnished only by this man's table and chair. He tried to catch a look at the man's face, but it was obstructed by the shadow of a large book that rested against the lamp, obviously to purposefully hide the man's visage.<br>
<br>
     &quot;I got your letter,&quot; said Magil. The man didn't stir. &quot;You! You sent me a letter? Yes?&quot; No answer. &quot;Hey!&quot; Magil folded his arms across his chest. &quot;Sit down..&quot; The man finally spoke. Magil took a glance around. &quot;Sit, please&quot; The man spoke again. There was no chair so Magil stood where he was. &quot;I want to speak to you about your estate within Neriak,&quot; the man's voice was raspy but oddly familiar, &quot;you have not been around in a while.&quot; &quot;I had Tolax close my estate here, nothing of such binds me to this city.&quot; Magil seemed irritated now. <br>
<br>
     The man continued on babbling about various things, none linked any way or the other. None of it made any sense at all. What the hell did this crazy idiot want? Magil turned to the door to go find Nezzka to see why he had actually received this letter. The man leapt from his seat. &quot;Magil!&quot; Magil turned around. This was the first glimpse he had gotten of the stranger's face. It was.. Magil? &quot;Please, sit back down.&quot; There was fear in the man's voice now. Absolutely puzzled, Magil turned his attention back to the man, who took his seat again. &quot;Now..&quot; The stranger continued with his mindless speech about nothing. &quot;Shut up..&quot; It flew from the stranger's mouth. Magil looked around again, he had not said a word. &quot;Shut up!&quot; the man said again. Magil was infuriated now. This stranger had wasted all this time making him travel all the way back to Neriak for this? <br>
<br>
     Reaching at his waist, Magil found the hilt of his dark sword. He pulled it from his girdle and advanced on the man in the chair. The man simply sat and continued on with his mindlessness, this time in a poor attempt at the Iksar tongue. Magil approached him, his blade drawing in the light from the lamp as it got close. The tip of the blade touched the man's chest, right where Magil expected his heart would be. Thin steel plate provided no protection as the blade slid through the armor, through the man, and through the back of the chair. Gasping for the air to scream, the man flailed his arms wildly, knocking the lamp to the floor. Magil took the edge of his hand shoved it into the man's open mouth to stifle his half-yelling. The man bit down hard, his teeth piercing the icy chitin plates that protected Magil's hand. He felt the blood pour from his hand, into the stranger's mouth. &quot;Fangs?&quot; Alarmed, Magil tried to jerk his hand from the stranger's jaws. When he saw that he wasn't getting his hand back, Magil did the only thing he could think of. <br>
<br>
     The lamp had lit the table aflame and the room was bathed in the flickering light from the spreading blaze. Magil ignored the burning tendrils that licked his face, simply throwing the table aside. He had the man by the neck now with his other hand. He pushed the man to the wall the wall and ground the back of his skull against it with pressure that would shatter a lesser being's head like a melon. &quot;Why won't you die!?&quot; Magil pushed the sword's hilt with his body into the rock wall. The sword was through the man's chest up to the hilt now, crimson liquid sprayed over Magil's face. The man knew what was coming, his face twisted into that same sick smile that thousands had knew before as death. Magil's hands exploded with malevolent power, sheer hatred arcing across his fingers. The cascade of violence that flowed from his hands was like nothing he had ever experienced before. The air around seemed to scream with torment and agony as Magil let it all seep into the man's neck and face. The man didn't move a bit, he seemed uninterested in pain, like it had no effect on him at all. It was then that Magil felt his own acid touch run through him. It went through his chest and into his spine. It wasn't physical pain he felt, rather that his soul was being shredded by some unseen minion of death. He felt weakened, his vision began to blur and darken. Incredible pain wracked his body again as he felt the blood in his veins ignite. He no longer could feel his heart beating. He looked up again, that unsettlingly pleased grin on the face of the man as he released Magil's hand from his mouth was what burned in Magil's mind before his vision faded totally. It was terror that was beyond his own comprehension.. the rest of his mind slipped away.<br>
<br>
     The stinging bite of fire roused him with a startled spasm. Magil looked around, the entire room was ablaze now, spires of red and orange crawled across the walls. He felt for his chest. A sword? His sword? He pulled it from the wall and out through the front of his chest plating. A bit disoriented, he slid the weapon back into its spot on his belt. Kneeling, he took a look at the charred face of the man that laid before him, slumped lifeless on the hard stone floor. &quot;Tolax?&quot; It couldn't be. What had happened here? Why was Magil impaled on the wall in some strange house by his own swo.. he felt his chest.. where was the wound? &quot;What in the hell is going on today?&quot; He licked his lips, it was the sweetest thing he had ever tasted, leaving the finest wines of even Neriak far behind. Magil touched his hand to his lips and brought it away to inspect it. &quot;Blood?&quot; He looked down at Tolax, to his hand. He wanted to taste that sweetness again and it clawed at the back of his mind. He WOULD taste it again, he didn't care who would have to die so he could. Standing, he calmly exited from the inferno back into the street. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/umagilvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magil VH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 3:13:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bloodcurse</span><hr size=1> OOC<br>

This is a look at Magil's twisted preception of how events take place and how he's not really all there most of the time.<br>
Hope you enjoyed it.<br>
