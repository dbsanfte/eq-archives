Research, Stress, and Hate all mixed into one<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Kelranon sat at his desk, constantly writing, showing no attention to anything else around him. He was in his most favorite place in Norrath...his laboratory. He scribbled and took notes, and read through his books at least 5 times each. His skeletal maid pet bent over to see what he was doing. Quickly Kelranon turned around and blasted her into a few bone chips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Worthless pile of bones,&quot; he muttered, and continued his work. He stood up and walked over to his cutting board and placed a large bat on it. The bat squeeled and hissed at the necromancer, as he used his dagger to remove both its wings.<br>
&quot;Now now, that wasn't so hard was it?&quot; Kelranon laughed at the helpless fool and threw him out the window to his dogs.<br>
Deciding to take a break, he walked around his house, checking to make sure his slaves were doing their work properly. <br>
<br>
He stepped into the kitchen, pleased to see his vampiric slaves cutting him up something to eat, he stepped over to the restroom and was pleased that his skeletons were cleaning it properly, then made sure the bed was nice and neat, which it was. This relieved Kelranon's stress by a lot. He looked out the windows and saw his zombie troopers were defending his house properly, so he laid back, and rested. <br>
&quot;I will be the librarian,&quot; he'd keep telling himself. Hate grew strong in his heart. But suddenly, the door burst open. Very upset at the intrusion of his house, Kelranon stepped downstairs. He saw a messenger drop off a book. Kelranon gave him a few more platinum then it was worth for the tip, then picked up the book.<br>
<br>
&quot;By Innoruuk, it's here!&quot; He grinned evilly as he opened the book. But to his surprise, it was in a language totally foreign to him. He screamed at the top of his lungs in anger. How could this be? he thought to himself. I ordered this book with the assurance I'd be able to translate it!<br>
<br>
&quot;DAMMIT, now I have to go find my book of languages,&quot; he shouted at himself. He walked back over to his desk and ripped out a book entitled, &quot;The Combine Empire and the Languages That Follow.&quot; <br>
<br>
Love and Hate, both a weapon, both a tool, I use both for Innoruuk and my loved.<br>

<br>
Creapiing looks around her ravaged offices and hears the echoes of her footsteps on the empty floors. New furniture had been ordered, new shelves would be built by morning. The beautiful Mahogany desk could never be replaced, nor could all the ancient tomes, art works, and tapestries. Her knees suddenly felt weak as the poison again attacked her, and she leaned heavily on the wall for a moment. Then as the weakness passed she stood up to see her assistant bringing a scroll. Quickly ripping it open she sees incribed on the scroll one name...Kelranon.<br>
<br>
She turned to leave, to seek out this Kelranon..for she had many many books to replace, or at least to find some mockery of them, as many had been simply irreplacable. <br>

<br>
Creapiing slowly came up to Kelranon's gate, and pressed a button that seemed to be a doorbell. She tried to look through the gate, but was startled when she saw a rotting corpse looking right back at her. In a whispering, scratchy voice, he spoke, &quot;What do you want?&quot; Creapiing shook her head and replied, &quot;I need to speak with Kelranon about...well that is none of your business, let me through.&quot;<br>
<br>
The zombie trooper, not too sure as to what to do, opened the gate for her. The other troopers all inspected her and examined her and made sure she wasn't here to assasinate their master.<br>
<br>
Creapiing stepped up to the large, eerie mansion. She got closer, and she was again startled, but this time by the dogs there. She heard them barking and turned around to see two great danes tied up to a post by magic chains, jumping and barking at Creapiing. She let out a sigh and entered the house. She got no more than 3 steps in when she heard,<br>
&quot;What do you want?&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
What do you want? boomed throughout the house. With a wry smile Creapiing ignored all the theatrics and spoke, Let us speak over a chill glass of this red wine that I have brought with me. Surely you have a nice shadowed room in which we may speak?<br>
<br>
Kelranon wondered to himself..the Reaper of the Harvest..in my home! What have I done to deserve such a visit? Carefully setting aside the tome he had been diligently translating, he approached the Reaper and noted the precise way in which she bowed to him. Dark Sister, how may I help you?Kelranon asked.<br>
<br>
Creapiings violet eyes were a bit unsettling as she handed him a very fine red wine and beckoned him to show her to a more comfortable speaking room. <br>
<br>
Kelranon, I have heard from the finest sources that you keep a library worthy of Faellen K'this herself. With the gutting of my home and offices to try and find the source of my poisoning, I am in great need of both reference material and manuscripts. I would not like to see myself fall into the trap of ignorance that the pale ones so often stumble into, and therefore I must surround myself with knowledge.<br>
<br>
The third glass of wine was poured, and Creapiing and Kelranon sat comfortably trying to work out the specifics of her needs.  <br>
