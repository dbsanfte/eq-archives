*Dark Speach*<br>
<br>
Faeolin R'Danya, M'Lady. I belive that is how Vresssk sssaid you &quot;enjoyed&quot; to be addressssed asss. I ment no Disrespect to you or any of the Teir'Dal. The only offen I ment was to your property Vresssk. You sssee it isss not everyday that one of our kind peelsss hisss ssscalesss off to become the lap dog of any other race.<br>
<br>
I have ssseen Ninaelil in combat. And I belive he will become quite the Warrior. I even aided Ninaelil in the passst. I had ssslain a Human dog and riped the axe from hisss hand by biteing it off before hisss life faded away. I gave that axe to Ninaelil asss I sssee the relience on weaponsss to be a flaw.<br>
<br>
You sssee Dread Overlord of the Violent Harvessst, I mean your kind no disssressspect. And you title only aidsss the Facelesssss one ssso you are a friend to me. Asss Dread leadsss to Fear. And Vresssk needsss to know Fear again.<br>

I will say this to you once Mish.... excuse me. Speaking this tongue irritates my throat.<br>
<br>
*Faeolin reaches into her pack and pulls out a flask. Swallowing the contents in a few short gulps, she places the stopper back onto the mouth and returns the flask to her pack.*<br>
<br>
Do I look like some flamboyant hussy to you, Mishkar? That you would refer to me as lady. I find it demeaning and derogatory, and will not tolerate its use in reference to the Reaper or myself. I suspect that you knew ahead of time that its usage was inappropriate, and I have yet to determine what I am going to do about it. As far as Vresk is concerned, he will indeed know fear. I will make a special point to test his ability to endure pain in the near future. That is as far as it will go. The fact that he has turned his tail on those too ignorant to know true power speaks volumes about his knowledge of fear. There are also many within the Harvest who know fear, and that it has no place amongst the chosen. <br>

<br>
Dread Overlord Faeolin, the Court of Pain is the place where the Iksar monks train in Cabilis.<br>
<br>
Mishkar. You have no right to &quot;give&quot; me to anybody, much less the Teir'Dal that you insult. Your words and actions speak volumes, much as the human monks of Antonica do. Perhaps I was in error correcting your comparison of &quot;your people&quot; to the belly-crawling reptiles of the swamps, deserts, and dungeons, as your poisoned tongue seems to indicate you are much more akin to these creatures.<br>
<br>
My position amongst the Violent Harvest was requested by the Grand Master himself. I will be glad to inform him of your insolence. I will also kindly forward on to him and the emperor your utter disregard of their rule. After all, you and your clutchmates are &quot;utterly fearless.&quot;<br>
<br>
For any Teir'Dal who may be listening, the Emperor of the Iksar rules through Fear. Much as Lord Cazic Thule does his subjects. The open admission of an Iksar to have no fear is an insult to his rule.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;needing&quot; the Teir'Dal, your statement proves you see little beyond your own snout. I no more need the Teir'Dal than a fish needs trees. However, I am enlightened enough to realize that walking blindly alone down a path that is walked by others if foolish. Yet, you indicate you would not only do this, but wildly attack that which you know nothing of.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should go back to playing politics in the Court of Pain along with your other clutchmates. From where I stand, the stench of your hatching still clings to your scales. You have much to learn.<br>
<br>
Overlord Faeolin, if you wish to test my mettle further than you have already in the City of Mist, I will be glad to show you what a true Iksar can do. However, if you wish to find a mere lizard who will likely cry like a human girl-child when you look at it wrong, I believe Mishkar will be an excellent example of such. <br>

Vresk, I suppose it would be too much to hope for that I would be able to train a bit in this &quot;Court of Pain&quot;. That, and my name were one of the very few things I could understand when you were talking to Mishkar. I will tell you that I am proud of the progress you are making in understanding that which is inside of you. It is a very hard thing to hate that which is familiar to you. Especially when it means that you can never return to it.<br>

The art of fighting with one'ss mind, body, and ssoul iss ssomething that iss inbred upon a clutch from before hatching. It iss not ssomething you could go to train in.<br>
<br>
However, if you wish to train like we do, I would be happy to enter the arena with you at any time for training. <br>

It is not unknown to me that some are more suited for combat than others. There are some things that are trainable though. There are other skills, which neglected are quick to atrophy until they become useless. That is why you work the forms as you do. As to your offer, I will most wholeheartedly accept. It will, of course, be to the death. This is something that I am sure you will agree to, and therefore I will arrange for one of the priests of Innoruuk to attend to you once you have fallen.<br>

Vresk your dull molting colors are showing through in your limp speach. You have proven to me that this conversation need go no further, as you are only trying to impress your Masters. Grand Master Glox Has not speken a word in years, and I doubt you are important enough for him to come out of him meditations. <br>

I hope he sservess you well. And I am ssure he will learn to hate uss ass he will never again be able to strike Fear into the heartss of otherss. As you well know not many people are afraid of a cute little lapdog. <br>
<br>
I ssat in meditation in the Court of Pain thesse lasst few dayss, in an inner sstate of outword reflection. And I have been enlightened. I will make my way to your city and Walk your streats without fear. I will come to your Housse sso that you may ssee with your own eyess a true Ikssar. I will take what ever tesst of pain you wissh to lay upon my body and I will not sso much ass flintch.<br>
<br>
By the time I reach your doorsstep I will have a better grassp on your language sso you will better undersstand me. I have planss to help Vressk to learn to Hate.<br>

It becomes very apparent to me how much Vresk has learned from us. The differences between the two of you are near the point of glaring. Vresk does indeed know how to hate. He is quickly learningn to gain strength from it as well, this is a good thing. It is even better, if he does NOT bring about a fearful presence. To be honest, I rather like the lapdog analogy. The better to stoke the fires of his hatred. I welcome you to beautiful Neriak, and I welcome you within our halls. Perhaps a token test of arms against our champion might be appropriate? You may even face Vresk if you wish, although it goes no further than a test of arms. I will not allow a blood feud between your...cluth mates, and Vresk. What was said before, still stands. He has the might of the assembled Harvest behind him, and you would be wise to respect that. Oh, and Mishkar, Iksar are not the only ones who have mastered their fear. The Harvest itself is leading an assault on your gods avatar, I will surely keep you informed of the results.<br>

Obvioussly, like the resst of the Court of Pain, you have yet to learn that one may communicate without uttering a ssingle word. However, an argument with one who foolishly thinkss themsself as perfection incarnate iss not worth the effort.<br>
<br>
*gets a dangerous glint in his eye a moment, then allows the emotion to pass, perhaps harnessing the energy for later battles*<br>
<br>
Regardlesss of what the Dread Overlord wishess to believe, I am no lapdog of the Harvesst, much lesss herss. When we go into battle, it iss as equalss, not as masster and sservant. The Violent Harvesst hass my loyalty becausse, unlike the pranccing about you wish to do in the Court of Pain, they have earned my resspect.<br>
<br>
Pleasse, continue your prattle. You will earn yoursself no more attention from mysself, but it appearss to ssatissfy your haltchling-like mind. Know that it will bring me no particular pleasure when you and thosse like you are desstroyed when the Final Harvesst comess. Know however, that the combined might of all the Chossen, their Father, and mysself will be behind each of my blowss. And know, that if I musst do sso alone, I will bring the Ikssar out of their current sstate of ssnarling and biting like a cornered ssarnak, and into the glory that iss our birthright.  <br>
