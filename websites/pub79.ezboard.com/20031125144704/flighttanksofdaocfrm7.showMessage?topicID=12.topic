<br>
Mercenaries are currently in the process of getting their #1 issue, Dual Wield styles, looked at by the strike team. This makes the overall status of the Mercenary unsure at this time. What I can say with confidence is that as of this writing, Mercenaries are easily the least popular melee class in Albion by a hefty margin (and second least popular in the game after blademasters). Hopefully we can change that.<br>
<br>
QUICK REFERENCE LIST<br>
<br>
As briefly as possible, here is what we NEED:<br>
<br>
- Fix the DW style list (already in progress)<br>
<br>
- Let us put shields into the 2H slot so we can hotkey them<br>
<br>
- Make Dirty Tricks unresistable as was said would be done, and lower its timer some<br>
<br>
Many Mercenary players would also like to request the following:<br>
<br>
- Give us and other light tanks the limited charge ability outlined below<br>
<br>
- Give us the option to train in short bows similar to Armsmen and their crossbows<br>
<br>
And now the details...<br>
<br>
BUGS<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Some older Merc's that were affected by the bug where they would not get Engage from training in Shields are still missing it. Any Merc's created after that bug was fixed are getting it just fine, but those that already trained past 7 in shields when that bug was still there are still missing Engage. There aren't many Merc's left that have this problem however.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; The message when using Dirty Tricks is &quot;You cast an increased fumbles spell!&quot; - it should be changed to something like &quot;You throw dirt in 's eyes!&quot; ...since when were we spell casters? <br>
<br>
TOP ISSUE<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - The DW style list has many issues which I have already submitted in previous reports and directly to the strike team. This is easily our #1 issue and is the main cause for our inability to do the damage we are supposed to be doing. Problems include but are not limited to not enough damage over all (biggest problem), no no-opening chains, redundant styles and too many Evade-based styles.<br>
<br>
OTHER ISSUES<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Merc's cannot hotkey Shields since the shield slot is being used by their second weapon. Please allow shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield/weapon combo for RVR purposes. Blocking arrows and bolts in RVR is the only reason we ever use a shield, but this limitation makes it hard to even do that.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Dirty Tricks is still resisted, even though I was told it would be made unresistable but have a low affect on high leveled players and mobs. Please implement this. If you are a Team Lead or dev you can read the post stating this would be done here.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Dirty Tricks has too long of a timer for how unreliable it is. Not only can it still be resisted as mentioned above, but it can now be Purged with the new realm abilities. The other two light tank classes' special abilities (beserk and triple wield) are much more reliable - they do what they say they will do every time no matter what. Plus they can affect more than one enemy, whereas ours can only affect one no matter what. You said you would consider lowering it after it first came in, is there any chance of doing this now?<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - We want to fit a role in RVR. We are tired of just being light tanks without any of the assumed benefits of the definition. We want to be light infantry, shock troops, to run in quickly, harass the enemy and soften them up, cause some chaos, and be followed up by the main force of our army (heavy tanks and casters). We also want to be feared by archers and casters because of our increased ability to close in on them and take them down. But right now, this isn't possible.<br>
<br>
The problem, however, is not easily solved. The obvious solution would be increased mobility, but that would give other benefits that could throw PVE balance out of whack - such as increased ability to escape from a bad fight, lower travel times, etc. This is not something Mythic is willing to give us.<br>
<br>
We have devised a solution that should give us the role in RVR we desire without unbalancing us in any other aspects. Please give this idea your serious consideration for inclusion into the Mercenary class as well as blademasters and Bezerkers.<br>
<br>
Ability: Charge<br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
- You must have a target.<br>
- The target must be an enemy.<br>
- The target must be in your current cone of view and visible to you.<br>
- The target must be within a certain distance of you.<br>
<br>
- You press the Charge button.<br>
<br>
- You immediatly lose a chunk of endurance<br>
- Your character runs at high speed (at least as fast as the Hunter's speed boost ability) directly toward the target.<br>
- Your character cannot be steered by you, and cannot be stopped by you.<br>
- If your target dies before you get to them or get out of range or you charge for too long then you stop automatically.<br>
- Once your character reaches your target, the charge is over and you auto-attack your target (kind of like when you use a Style and it turns auto-attack on for you).<br>
- You must now wait for a timer before you can Charge again.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this ability would not decrease travel times, nor would it allow you to escape a bad fight (since you have to attack an enemy to use it, which would just make the situation worse). What it would do is allow us to charge into the battle quickly in an effort to take out weaker characters and act as shock troops. Optional things you could do is to give a higher Charge at a later level - perhaps one that also grants resistance to mez/stun or allows dodging of arrows while charging to make it easier to get close to casters and archers, or have an increasingly damaging style execute at the end of the charge with special effects like snare. But that's just fluff, the main thing we want is what is described above.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; - Some Mercenary players would like to know why we can't train in Shortbows like Armsmen can train in Crossbows. It seems odd since we get bows before they do. Also many bows throughout the realm, including our level 20 Epic bow reward, give Shortbows bonuses which don't do anything since we can't train in them anyway.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY<br>
<br>
Until the strike team's changes to our DW list are completed, I can not make an accurate statement on the overall status of Mercenaries. Let me say that the DW style list problems are by far our #1 issue by a large margin, and as such changes to that issue may completely change the outlook for the class.<br>
