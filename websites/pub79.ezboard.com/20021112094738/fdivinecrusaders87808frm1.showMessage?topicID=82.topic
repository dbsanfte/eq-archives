We are currently losing members right now for 2 reasons, one no one really talks to one another, and 2, wich is main reason is DC never does anything together anymore. <br>
<br>
I left DC for a couple of days to see how other guilds work, and in those 3 days I was gone, I went on 3 ToFS raids, and was inv in groups 2 more times. Now I realize that the guild I was in is bigger than us, but for the last 3 weeks I have been personally tring to get the fellow DC on to get together without any luck :-( We have lost Cwerlon, Elistree and I had 3 other members tell me after I left they were thinking of leaving as well.<br>
<br>
Now im not saying that we will always have to play together, but lets all try to get together and start acting like a Guild. In the 3 days I wasn't in DC i missed you guys. Lets all try to posting here in Boards for Ideas on events, try to get some more of our EQ friends in DC, and if you all are bored, or looking for a group, ask DC. Lets try to get together more often. I will be keeping all my alts in DC for now, and till I stop playing EQ. I would like to see all my DC friends there as well.<br>
<br>
And for all who sent me tells saying you missed me, thx, it meant alot. And all who sent me tells saying they were thinkin on leaving, stay in there for a bit, lets not all break up over this. Lets fix the problem, and not ignore it.<br>
<br>
For all who would like to nominate a new leader of DC, please post it here as well, I have been nominated as well as Talkin. If you would like to see either of us, or another officer please let us know. Personally I feel it dosent matter who leads, but who is in guild that matters.<br>
<br>
I have also started an alt that I would like to tag in DC, I started him for the soul purpose of being a Guild bank. I will be transfering some of my bank clutter in there for alts of fellow DC, and prizes for next event (which I would like to try and organize soon). Drops for people not on (ex I have a ton of succlent sap for our rogue MR Sprucsap). He will be camped in freeport, seems like the easiest place for all of us to use him. If you need him, just let me know.<br>
<br>
And finally, if anyone has any ideas at all, please start posting them here so we can try to organize ourselves a bit, and wrecking Havoc out there together!!<br>

I too meant to be there. I have been reading stuff here for a couple hours. I did the character thing on the guildmagic website (TAKLINN!)... Again, I am sorry I missed ToFS. I will try harder. I have been on the other end of this problem. I too have been at the &quot;zone in&quot; to a dungeon waiting on people. I dont like either side it sucks either way. <br>
<br>
I will miss Cwerlon. I will miss Moosie. I think we need more officers. I think Taklinn or Dark should be the new leader (just my 2CP). I also think Moosie should make the decision based on the guilds best interest and not a vote off. I wish Dougy were on more. I wish Oz would come back. I wish Cwerlon would come back. I wish Ellistrae would come back. I hope snake doesnt leave like the rumors say he is????<br>
<br>
The fact is we need more people, we need more officers so we can get more people and we need more of each in each lvl tier. If Iwan and I both have stuff come up, the ToFS raid should be able to go without us. That can only happen if we have more people. If we have more officers in more zones more often then when we get the chance to invite someone we dont miss it. The first thing we need to do is get our melees back! If they left or are leaving because we werent doing anything then we are in real trouble because we can not do anything without them! Next... We need to recruit! I dont know how we do it but it needs done. <br>
<br>
If someone wants to I will help plan another raid. We need to do a better job of getting everyone's schedule taken in to account. For the record I will never make a raid that starts at 5:00PM my time and I doubt any of the other teeth will either we have really messed up schedules. K Im actually going to post this one even though I ramble and make no sense!!!!<br>

I think we should have a short guild meeting every week too even if just to get to know each other. <br>
In response to Chips post we still have Melee's. Last I checked Saijin and Tiiggerr and Pawz were still around and Biggbizz got retagged last night. Raccona is a warrior and I think there are several more. If everyone registers on guildmagic whoever maintains the DC home page can put up a page of links for their characters there.  <p><b><i>Rrawrr</i></b><br><center><image src="http://www.monkeybiz.info/pantherani.gif"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bdivinecrusaders87808.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=trackerwolf>Trackerwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/25/02 1:01:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'm around, somewhere</span><hr size=1> I am new to the guild and hopeing to provide something to the guild.

<br>
As for Snake, he wont leave, we wont let him, we will just keep pestering him if he does, LOL.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Dark, she dosen't want to lead DC, unless she has changed her mind as of late. And Talk would make a awsome leader. He has my vote as well, as I stated before I really don't care who leads, I would personally like to, but would be fine with who ever does. But he is denifatly more senior when it comes to DC then I am.<br>
<br>
I have been recruting as of late, I invited a Icky Monk friend of mine from the last ToFS raid, and might be taggin a friend of mine from Storm, she said she would like to have an alt in both guild, she is also an officer there, and the Storm would make good friends to have. If anyone has a good friend that would like to see in DC, lets us know!<br>
<br>
Final thing, I have noticed a improvment last night on everyone talking to each other, and I grouped with DC last night! (It was along time since last time) I think it was a problem everyone was aware of, and no one was saying anything about it. I am posting a new raid idea under events the next time I can. I will not be playing this weekend (End of March) as for I plan on trying to do extreme amounts of damage to my liver on my B-Day on the 30th. <br>

<br>
As to the leadership of the guild, 'leader' is just a title, and alot of responsibility. organizing guild events doesn't have to fall to the guild leader and the officers. If there's something that you want to do, feel free to organize it; or if you're not quite sure how to go about getting things together, come to one of the officers, or a senior member of the guild for help, and we'll see about getting things done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Yes, getting people on to the boards is necessary, but posting that here isn't going to help, since those coming here already know about it... hence making it a moot point. Though i have posted the address in the MOTD, so hopefully more people will show up here.<br>

That being said I do see this as an opportunity to strengthen the guild and help it to grow.  I have talked with several people who are concidering joining DC's ranks.  Also I believe that we should all begin to group more together and have raids more frequently.  It would help to organize these events if we knew what time zone everyone is in.  On many occassions the raids begin to late for me to join in.  Curse our east coast time.  As a side note I would like to extend an invitation to all of DC to celebrate my impending wedding.  Once i have a date set and a location picked I will let you know.  <br>

ok now that's out of the way....i haven't been available to to do much lately and i'm sorry.....having kind of an EQ crisis, if you will....as in i don't have alotta goals, the goals i do have i haven't been good at getting around to and i'm having trouble finding Mili a guild she'd be comfy in (no offense to DC, but she kinda needs to be in a place with more ppl her own level, i think, maybe not, maybe that's the problem)......now i have started a pally and i think i'm having fun playing her and she's super cool, so MAYBE i'll play her alot and go do stuff with y'all as a pally...i dunno.....just having a hard time right now deciding what and where to do stuff in EQ, and the later it gets at nite the more i wanna play Mili cause she is just easier for me to play.......<br>
<br>
on the other hand if y'all wanna get together and do something fun, may i suggest let's get y'alls keys for seb or HS or something similar....or SS or a buncha other places, i always have fun doing stuff like that, not for loot, but for exp and a goal (keys)<br>

I for one will be saddened to see many that I have grown up with in DC leave and go one with what they feel they should do.. *snifs* I personally have talked to a few about my standing in DC as well, and just opening that closed door I did feel better, but yet things just seemed to be closing in, so to speak. I love my guild and when ppl ask why I chose this one, I tell them all that you all made me feel comfortable and we all talked to one another all the time.. thats one reason someone close to me left his guild to join ours.. Because noone did anything together and no one talked.. Now since he is here in DC, I am saddened to say that we are beginning to be just as his old guild was.. Distant... =(    *sighs* <br>
I for one have a guildie or 2, to nominate for the higher ranks, but I feel we should all be apart of whats going on and each have our own say in matters pertaining to DC.. I know I have closed up and dont talk as much to you all as I was or have been, reasoning behind this was maaking distance to leave i guess... Not real sure... I dont want to close this door for I would MISS you all extremely.. So slowly but surely I am hanging... *cries* <br>
* please say whats on your mind Synn * sheash :P..<br>
Well thanks alot I feel better now too =)...<br>

Love you all.. ((((hugs to you all)))) I will miss those that are leaving and those thaat have already left.. *snifs* <br>

The guild is only being restructured so maybe some are a little out of it lately. I haven't seen you or Kira on much lately but Pawz is STILL parked at the Ferrott/Rathe zone where he camped last time hunting with you two. Once our leaders redefine the structure and either re-ratify, revise, or create a new charter then we can have something solid to build a strong guild. Till then list your characters on <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com">www.guildmagic.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> so that we can get some idea of the demographics of what our guild is made of. Knowing that we can plan raids that most could come to. Sorry if I've been quiet lately but I've been working hard all week on tailoring (mostly hq cat pelt farming) and in a week have only gone from 88 to 92 :-( . That and the Coldain Prayer shawl quest that has been clogging my bank with quest items that with the help of Trackerwolf,Deshaed,Gaea,Biz,Iwan and others I finally got the fourth shawl. I love hunting with everyone in DC and have 6 characters of all ranges in it. There is no reason for us to be distant as a guild but there isn't a lot we can build on till they get the officer structure resolved so we all know the intended direction to make decisions. I've been trying to get an officer to tag Kwurlon (yes its Cwerlons alt) a lev 6 Shammy Iksar in Cabilas area for about 4 days now.<br>
