From Love to Blood<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
NOTE: Some of you know that I am no longer the bride-to-be<br>
of the Thresher. Here is the tale...<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;So what do you think,&quot; Creapiing asked me. &quot;Shall we merge with the Breagan D'aerthe?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure, Reaper. This is sudden,&quot; I replied. We had only recently been reborn as a guild, and I was being almost overprotective. After Ixtab's demise, our members seemed to have scattered with the wind. Only Innoruuk's constant calling out to me drove me to gather the remains and begin the process of renewal.<br>
<br>
&quot;He wants to meet with us and discuss terms,&quot; the Reaper continued. &quot;This could be a good move.&quot;<br>
<br>
I peered over at the Warrior Subati. Indeed he looked most formidable.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right, we can listen,&quot; I replied, not quite sure that I would put my heart into it.<br>
<br>
As we started to discuss the terms of the merger, my apprehensions were confirmed. Subati was arrogant and curt. The feeling of looming disaster nipped at my heels.<br>
<br>
I want this...he said. I don't want that...he muttered.  All in all, it really wasn't so bad, and I found myself thinking of the possibilities. Indeed, he had helped in turning back that awful onslaught of the Knights Templar.  That alone earned him my respect, if nothing more.<br>
<br>
The merger was done. Our ranks swelled...and we were noticed. Although most didn't believe we were yet a force to be reckoned with...we will be in due time.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure when it happened...but it did happen. Subati just wanted to vent...as all Teir'Dal will from time to time. I was willing to sit for a while, since my day of hunting had come to a close, and listen.<br>
<br>
He was ending a relationship with someone I knew. I felt bad for them both, but I knew that sometimes going separate ways may be best. So, I nodded empathetically, gave him a reassuring smile, and we both went our separate ways.  Over the next few days, we found ourselves seeing more of each other. The strange feelings I had for him seemed to grow more intense each day. He must have sensed it, for he let me know soon after that empathy session, that he had feelings for me too.<br>
<br>
That was the beginning of a whirlwind romance for us.  Looking back, I know we must have made many of the Harvest family &quot;sick&quot;. (I apologize for that...heh heh) I'd not known such happiness since before I was whisked away by my family on our long journey around the world pursing Father's dreams.<br>
<br>
It wasn't long after our romance began, that Subati dropped to one knee and asked for my hand in marriage. What exhilaration! I had to say yes. We both agreed our union could only strengthen our hatred for the lightcrawlers, one Nostramis in particular. Subati shouted his glad news to all Norrath...that we were to be wed.<br>
<br>
As any bride-to-be will do, I began the planning. I sent word to my closest friends and, out of obligation, to my distant relatives. My aunt, Listra Ka`Trael, sent word back that she was happy for me and wanted to know more. I eagerly wrote down everything in my heart.<br>
<br>
I was sharing all this with my husband-to-be one evening as we looked over the sunset at Kunark. It was magical.  We both were weary after a hard day of hunting. He was complaining about an itch, of all things. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I have a birthmark on my right shoulder,&quot; he said.  &quot;I sometimes wonder if the scorpion isn't biting me while I fight,&quot; he mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scorpion?&quot; I asked, puzzled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I have a birthmark in the shape of a scorpion.  Want to see it?&quot; he chuckled. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, that is quite all right,&quot; I retorted and laid my head back on his chest. The creatures of the night began belting out their tunes as the day came to a close.<br>
<br>
The birthmark was quite a revelation. I did not tell Subati that I had one as well. I quickly added this detail to the missive I was sending to my aunt. As soon as I returned home, I gave the scroll to the courier and told him to make haste. I had planned to make the trip myself, but just couldn't do it...<br>
<br>
It was only a few days later, that my fears were confirmed.  The birthmark was well known in the K'Draeth clan. My father bore it. His brother had it too. My aunt had only mentioned my uncle's family once a long time ago, but this time, she sent great detail about him and my father.<br>
<br>
I fell to the floor as I read...<br>
<br>
&quot;My dearest niece Selilya,<br>
<br>
I am most sad to have to reveal such hard things to you, but you must know them. These words cause me great grief, and I wish I had told you long ago.<br>
<br>
Your suspicions about the scorpion birthmark are correct.  Subati is, indeed, a K`Draeth descendant.<br>
<br>
Subati's father, born Thallron K`Draeth, was killed in a raid at Guk, which left his mother, Nythalia, quite mad. She was <br>
camped at an outpost in Southern Ro with me and the young child, Subati. With word of his death, she and the boy, left in the night...supposedly through the swamps... I searched hard, but only could hear the rumors of some mad woman howling in the distance... A travelling merchant told me that the young boy was snatched up by a wandering band of Ogres and vanished. The boy only knows his name now, because I had crafted an amulet which he wore back then, inscribed with his name, Subati. <br>
<br>
Even more heartwrenching, Selilya, is that I am not your father's sister, which I think is what you believe. I am your mother's sister. Your father would not consent to take your mother's surname as is the custom of our people. He, indeed, was a rogue...and it shamed us so. I always wondered why you bore his surname. It would be like my sister not to tell you. She loved your father so very much.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my dearest, I have a heavy heart for you. You must not marry Subati, as he is your cousin. You both may hate me, and that is understandable. However, you must do the proper thing....and call this wedding off.<br>
<br>
I can't believe that Subati lives. I have news for him as well, but he must come see me.  You have my love, Selilya. I am sorry to have had to break your heart so. I hear you fight in a noble cause, so I tell you this...pour all your rage into it.<br>
<br>
Lovingly,<br>
Listra&quot;<br>
<br>
I sat on the floor motionless for what seemed like forever.  The knocking on my door brought me out of my haze, and I <br>
opened the door to see a vibrant, smiling Subati.<br>
<br>
I handed him the note.<br>
<br>
<br>

Now I understand what is going on. My heart goes out to you, dear sister. Glorifying day's are ahead I feel it, so be in good spirits and remember Innoruuk has great plans for us all.<br>

Re: From Love to Blood<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It seems that revelations of family holding dark emotion, shame for me and great grief for you, plague the Harvest this past week. In a time where we should be rejoicing, you are healing from a love that can never be more than that of brother and sister, while I lose myself in violence to try to discover how weak my half-bred blood has left me.<br>
<br>
Selilya, we are truly siblings of spirit it seems, and you know I stand beside you as you walk this road.<br>
<br>
Subati, your courage and honor have been a binding force for the Harvest reborn, and I know that you too are healing from this brutal blow.<br>
<br>
And yet, the news is not all dire. I know that once the wounds of interrupted romance will heal in time, and each of you has found a member of a family that you never new existed. Your Houses now hold honor unimagined with your positions in the vanguard of Neriak's elite. Persevere, and you will both see that there is great richness, driven to your hand not by the goddess of love, but rather through the truth of Hate.<br>
<br>
I stand ready for you both, I stand ready for the Harvest. This news strengthens your Houses, and so strengthens the Harvest. In these things, you will find yourselves the stronger for it as well.<br>
