(And no I don't want to debate that. It's just my current opinion. If you think they're not gimped I'm happy for you.) So I'm retiring my Armswoman again. But I absolutely refuse to give up on melee so I'm rolling up a Merc, being an obvious glutton for punishment. <br>
<br>
Now the problem is I know nothing about mercs. /laughs <br>
<br>
I was looking back for posts with advise on speccing and strategies for Mercs I'm having difficulty finding this. I have a new Merc that is Briton I'm going to spec slash. I haven't yet put points into anything else but do expect to go DW. My main aim of course is RvR. <br>
<br>
Any advise on specs and strategies (I expect it's a bit different from a pole Armswoman) would be very much appreciated. In other words I need a Merc education. Links to good threads or sites would also help. <br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch. <br>

Not able to dish out the damage required, nor able to take the punishment long enough to deal with the damage I do now. These situations seem to be common amongs most of the tanks, but albion tends to feel it most, since we're the supposed defensive realm yet our defense is comparable to the other realms.<br>
<br>
However, on a happier note, I like my merc a lot, and hence the similaritys between the arms and merc (two hander arms, btw) causes me to like my arms alot. The few good events I encounter outweight the more bad events. It's all about attitude, anyways. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have a feeling what you're trying to escape from, isn't something that can be outruned. Least, not in albion. Our main tanks are being out-damaged and out-tanked by the other realms counterparts, like our light tanks are with their counter-parts.<br>
<br>
But, you never know. We still get by in our own ways. In a sense, that almost makes me feel fixed. Aslong as you don't care about being uber, this class should suit you fine. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

<br>
We rely on other people's buffs, other people healing etc. but if we have all that we're the best out there.<br>
<br>
As for spec...<br>
<br>
If you're set on slash/dw the most common specs are 50 slash 50 dw 28 parry<br>
or if you want you can go 50 dual 44 slash 37 parry (my fave spec <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <br>
or if yer completely insane and would like to be able to pull out a shield, look like a cleric and play defensive...<br>
<br>
50 dual 42 slash 32 parry 23 shield <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
for levelling up - put lots into slash and dual wield, maybe save some for parry (although you don't get it till level 17 - maybe just put all of level 17s points into parry)<br>
<br>

Ummm...  If you're swinging a pole, casters probably shouldn't be your first target - you would have a difficult time getting through pulsing bladeturn unless you're paired with someone using faster weapons who can keep the bubble down.  If I'm not assisting, casters and healers are my targets (along with any assassins in the group) and the heavy tanks and hybrids take care of the opposing realm's tanks. <p>Gwerral Darkmorn<br>

Now a Merc is a different situation. I've played along side them but don't know that much about how they'r specced, and have a lot to learn. Thanks for the help.<br>

Yes you heard me I am a shield Mercenary and it works a heck of alot better for me than two weapons especially for RVR in that sometimes you don't even swing a left and the DW spec line sucks because of lack of an anytime style. I gave up chance to swing a second weapon and some styles whoopdee.<br>
<br>
Slam is a very versatile move it can be used in defense and offense and especially useful against enemy casters which will mow you down when given the chance and everyone hates MOC + PBAE =0). While Slam not being the only thing shield is good for it gives you a chance to block which is great for parry's weakness being 2-hand.  <br>
<br>
So you say why not be an Armsman well here is your answer:<br>
A.) Evade is very useful ESPECIALLY against other shield tanks they can't land shield styles too often and you can even evade from behind. <br>
B.) Different armor resist table being crush resistant is better than having it as weakness IMO since theirs not too many enemy thrust users. <br>
C.) Flurry,Charge, and Dirty Tricks are very useful and add alot of utility.<br>

Gwerral Darkmorn, what you mentioned was why I intend to spec shield to 7. It's very useful. I doubt I'll keep my spec crush though. Most likely I'll respec at 40. Still being mistaken for a cleric might be fun. /grins<br>

<br>
That doesn't mean shield spec isn't viable for mercenaries, mainly because dual wield isn't that great. And speccing in shield more than makes up for flurry or the low offhand damage when it doesn't miss.<br>
<br>
And it's better than leveling a new character for high level mercs looking for a change.<br>
<br>
As for why mercs can spec in shield. Just another option. Just like armsman can spec in xbow even though it's not really rewarding because their other spec lines are much better for the role they typically play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fester@lighttanksofdaoc>Fester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#000000>(6/13/03 4:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need advise on a new merc </span><hr size=1> I dueled a fellow Merc last night on my server who is Shield.

In the old days, it was cool to be a shield merc because people thought you were a cleric... now with Reavers out it doesn't really make a difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rosimond@lighttanksofdaoc>Rosimond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#000000>(6/13/03 6:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need advise on a new merc </span><hr size=1> With a Briton it looks to me like thrust is out so I'm pretty narrowed down to either keeping crush or re-speccing to slash. The styles (and growth rate) on slash look better so I think I'll end up re-speccing. <br>
<br>
That leaves the issue of spec. A lot of people have said the best way to go is 50 DW/ 50 slash/ 28 parry. (The low parry looks a bit scary but you can make it up with + items and MoParry.) Other Mercs have told me they're very happy with either 50DW/44slash/37parry or 50 slash/44 DW/37 parry.  <br>
<br>
Any comments or suggestions to put me in the right direction? My new Merc is still in her 20s. I'm getting some powerleveling and playing her for levels. Don't want to end up a PL baby at 50 with no clue how to play. <br>
<br>
Thanks for all the info and suggestions.<br>

<br>
OK, it's got a 93% growth rate, and follows on from Ammy. The chain has a great to-hit chance, no stupid bleeds, it's just pure damage from the sharp side.<br>
<br>
It's problem is that it drinks endurance by the bucketfull. However, if you've got a Paladin's endurance chant, you can do it non-stop. The average damag eof the chain ends out at about 88/89%, which is the same as BackSlash (lvl 39 Slash style) spammed repeatedly (only you don't have to be behind the target to do this chain).<br>
<br>
Dslash may or may not be superior to a spamming of DShadows, lvl 50 DW style with a 79% growth rate. DShadows has a medium defensive penalty and seems to miss more often. But each hit of DShadows starts a bleed at 20-ish damage. Not sure if this 20 damage makes up for the average loss of 20% growth rate in comparison to the chain. I guess it depends what weapons you're using...<br>
<br>
Well, the damage is noticeably bigger than anything you've hit for yet, with the possible exception of Shadows Rain. When you're smacking lower-con mobs (particularly GREENS! muhaha... ) you will notice a HUGE alternation in your swings from OK damage to awesome damage.<br>
<br>
My verdict on 28 parry? Well, unbuffed, don't count on parrying much, even with capped Dex, if it's another player. Especially not a 2H one.<br>
<br>
If it's yellow or orange mobs, you can probably get a couple of opportunities to pull off the reactionaries, which seem to be getting an overhaul while Slash styles are staying the same in the hands of a mercenary.<br>
<br>
If your parry is 28 you will DEFINITELY want to add +11 from items at level 50. I myself am regretfully losing Diamond Slash when I get my respec, so that I can benefit mroe from the parry change (and the upgraded DW styles which all rely on parrying it seeems).<br>

Would 50 DW/39 slash/39 parry be a reasonable template in that case? I realize you wouldn't have the highest slash styles but you'd still have ammy as a backup for the DW styles. With + items and MoParry I should think you'd get a fair number of parries. <br>
<br>
Just as a thought, this seems to me to contradict the usual line of thought that Mercs are intended to attack support and not tanks. You'll rarely parry against them. Any thoughts on this? I play on Percy. What classes should I be speccing to target?<br>

<br>
The new DW changes are all aggro-based. Perhaps Mythic thought our anytime damage waally was OK, but they were aware that we got toasted every time we got aggro, or something. Whatever, we have abominable defense to make up for our lack of a shield.<br>
<br>
It seems that the new changes are only gonna be any good in a merc with high parry. However, at least Mythic seems to be validating their original advice on how to spec a merc, which, I'll grudgingly admit, I am not respeccing to.<br>
<br>
50DW, 44(weapon), 37(parry).<br>
<br>
You mentioned 50, 39, 39... actually you can take it higher <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think you can go 50, 40, 41 or higher, if you level out.<br>
<br>
Still, for being offensive tanks who aren't supposed to take aggro, and for speccing full DW(advanced specline) and modest [weapon] and decent parry (for the sake of argument that we take mythic's advice)...<br>
<br>
where's our anytime damage gonna come from?<br>
<br>
Maybe Mythic realised that we mercs were ALWAYS gonna drag the PvE (and RvR? debatable! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) aggro, so they're merely fitting us with some abilities to deal with having to take it in the face, after all.<br>
<br>
I guess that being forced to respec into better parry (in order to reap the benefits of the upcoming changes) also serves to make us shut the hell up about our defensive lack.<br>
<br>
But if our role is not to be an aggro-taker and reactionary tank-destroyer, then we're not getting any better at our job (with the possible exception of landing Flank and Shadows Rain on a Spiritmster) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rosimond@lighttanksofdaoc>Rosimond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#000000>(6/16/03 9:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: agree</span><hr size=1> I'm honestly not sure what the Merc role is at this point. I suppose having high parry would indicate it's supposed to be reactionary tank killer. I'm not sure how well that will work but I'm more than willing to give it a try.<br>
<br>
But at any rate you're right about the figures. My memory was a bit astray when I typed that post. Looking at the figures I'll probably go ahead and take slash up to 44, especially as I will have auto-train points. <br>
<br>
I have to say I'm up to my 27th season now and haven't had so much fun in a long time. It's been a great change from an Armswoman. I've totally duoed with a friend who has rolled up a paladin with a highly defensive spec. The two work together amazingly well and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a 2 person team.<br>
