Wanted to add a quick notice here. This story does get a little dark, and violent. If you don't like that sort of thing, you may want to pass. It was written with a lot of painful emotion when I was leaving the Flame of Hate.<br>
/ooc off<br>
<br>
        Khasirath began his journey home from the Arena with a fierce grin on his face despite the new aches in his body. He had seen his Lord’s Will done, but suffered a painful defeat in the process. It was all worth it to him.<br>
<br>
        It was a long journey to Neriak, so with some misgivings, he paid a Druid to transport him to the Commonlands. Normally he would not trust such a creature, but he was eager to return home and tell his Brethren of his success.<br>
<br>
        As he loped through the Commonlands, he gripped his new dark sword more tightly. His thoughts turned to the Flame of Hate, who had been like a family to him since he had been a young Knight, just entering his fifth Gate. Their strength and dedication to the Will had forged him into the man he now was. But things had changed. No, they had been changing, he finally admitted to himself. The Flame was not the same Guild he had joined, and now he felt a darkly seething hunger in the pit of his being, driving him to action. With a snarl he plunged through Nektulos Forest, blind to those around him.<br>
<br>
        He entered the Guildhall in the Commons of Neriak scowling, and nodded briefly to the Brethren who were relaxing and talking there. He passed through the door of the Council’s chambers, the skeletal guardians standing at rigid attention as he passed.<br>
<br>
        A short while later he came back out to the common room, his violet eyes dark and hollow with badly concealed pain. He looked around, drinking in the sights that had become so familiar over his eighteen seasons within the Guild. He looked over all the faces, acutely aware of those missing... He could not help but feel that most before him now were strangers. He'd not met most of them in the flesh, and they hardly ever spoke to him. But still, he told himself, this is the Flame, and they deserve to hear my words.<br>
<br>
        &quot;My Brethren, my Lords and Ladies... The time has come that Innoruuk's Path for my life leads me away from the Flame of Hate. I have not the words for the sorrow I feel. To know I will not be beside you when next you go to war with the heretics of the Light,&quot; he paused, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
        &quot;I pray the Father's Hand may always guide you, that His Hate will always be strong in your hearts. Know also that I will always be your Brother. Our bonds were forged in battle and in Hate. Nothing save the Father's own Call shall keep me from you if you have need of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;May the Hate always burn in your hearts, and may the Flame rise up to sear the stars from the sky to bring forth the Father's long night. I shall miss you all.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Lowering his head he turned quickly away, pulling his cloak tightly about himself as he pushed through the door, letting it fall slowly shut at his heel. He could not bear to hear them respond, did not want them to see his weakness.<br>
<br>
        As he walked away he heard the door open again behind him. The voice of Vengful Soulist, the Leader of the Flame rang out, &quot;Lord Khasirath S'Therik, Emissary of the Flame of Hate, there will be indeed a time we shall call on you. When this Flame gets stronger we will need your talents. If at that time you’re still not impressed and feel we aren't worthy of your talents then we shall part as brothers. This is not a farewell but a period of time when you must look into our Father’s Eyes and see what he has to show you. Take care my brother there are still many that would have your head that are still our enemies.&quot;<br>
<br>
        He all but ran over the guards at the entrance to Third Gate, mindless of the trouble it could cause him. Grumbling, they let him pass, and he was quickly out of their sight.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath bowed deeply as he entered the Spires of Innoruuk, his hands still clenched like talons at the edges of his cloak, keeping it shrouded close around his body. He hurried to the Priest Ithvol K'Jasn without a word to the acolytes he passed. As an Initiate of Innoruuk, he was under the Priest’s tutelage. Khasirath dropped to his knees before the Priest, his head bowed so low that his brow was nearly touching the stone floor.<br>
<br>
        The Priest reached down, resting his fingertips on the back of Khasirath’s skull shaped helm. “Speak, Childe of Hate,” he said softly.<br>
<br>
        “Master, forgive me. I am in need of a cleansing,” Khasirath choked, barely able to contain his emotions.<br>
<br>
        “Very well, Childe. Come with me and I shall see to it that you have what you need.” Priest K’Jasn turned away and led Khasirath down to the bowels of the Church. Khasirath followed silently, his head bowed. A young acolyte joined them at a motion from the Priest.<br>
<br>
        Priest K’Jasn opened a door in a long hallway of similar doors and motioned for the Knight to precede him. Khasirath instantly complied. The chamber was small and dark. Khasirath walked to the center of the floor and knelt down again.<br>
<br>
        The Priest closed the metal door with a resounding clang and walked past Khasirath to the far wall. He began to chant, his voice strong and sure, and the words in Elder Teir’Dal seemed to fill the chamber with a palpable presence. A rune light of the Eye of Innoruuk flared to brightness in response on the dark stone wall.<br>
<br>
        “The Father’s Eye is upon you now, Khasirath S’Therik. Bare your body and your soul to Him, that you may be cleansed,” the Priest said with command ringing in his voice.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath nodded once and removed his armour and clothing with smooth efficiency, never rising from his kneeling position. He even removed his rings and earrings, but left the Hematite Initiate’s Symbol around his neck. The acolyte placed all of Khasirath’s gear in a chest by the door.<br>
<br>
        The Priest directed Khasirath to stand, and then bound his wrists tightly in manacles that were suspended from the ceiling. Though the air was warm, Khasirath felt a faint shiver run through his body as he was forced to stretch up almost onto his tiptoes to keep his weight from pulling on his wrists.<br>
<br>
         Khasirath kept his eyes locked on the Eye of Innoruuk before him as he heard the Priest and acolyte moving behind him. His skin prickled in anticipation; he was painfully aware of his vulnerability, and he struggled to release control of himself to the Priest.<br>
<br>
        “Now Khasirath, you must let go of your weaknesses and your impurities. Trust in the Father’s Will, give it all to Him.”<br>
<br>
        Khasirath bowed his head once more, twisting his wrists within the snug leather manacles to grab hold of the cold metal chains. He raised his gaze to the Father’s Eye, clenching his jaw tightly shut.<br>
<br>
        Without another word the Priest began lashing the Knight’s back with a barbed flogger. His rhythm was slow and steady, each strike falling with skilled precision.<br>
<br>
        On the first fall, Khasirath hissed softly, but there was more relief than pain in the sound. He relaxed his body; letting his thoughts sink deep into the pain and into the hate that was at the core of his being.<br>
<br>
        As the pain built, the sweat and blood beaded up across Khasirath’s tightly muscled back. His mind began to spiral free, the punishment of his body fading away.<br>
<br>
        Suddenly it seemed he was standing on a shadowed and smoke shrouded hill, still naked and without a weapon. The sky was stained deep red, the clouds swirling indigo and ebon. Something in the patterns of sky and cloud made him think of the designs on his own skin. He could not tell if it were day or night. The smoke was a billowing fog, redolent of blood and pain, and it kept him from seeing beyond the hill itself. Within that seething darkness he saw figures standing, waiting. They were too still to be living things. Their silent watching filled Khasirath with dread.<br>
<br>
        Slowly, one by one the wraiths floated towards Khasirath. He could not make out their faces until they were directly before him. The first was a Human woman with black hair and dark, scowling eyes. She wore the deep robes of a Necromancer. Despite her youth an aura of confidence surrounded her.<br>
<br>
        “Mistress Drugasyn,” Khasirath gasped. This was the Mistress of Initiates who had sponsored him and had brought him into the Flame; the one who had shaped his hate and dedication with her cruel and exacting quests. She had disappeared from Norrath shortly before he was named Emissary.<br>
<br>
        The wraith that was Drugasyn stared straight through Khasirath with disgust and hate in her eyes. He felt her hatred as a blade in his gut, and he faltered, almost staggering back. She glided silently past him and melted back into the smoke.<br>
<br>
        The others came forward – Men and women, many Teir’Dal but some Humans and Gnomes, Trolls and Ogres. They were all the members of the Flame who had gone before. His Sister Blacksatin, a Teir’Dal Cleric who had helped Khasirath many times in his youthful quests; Mistress Azmona, the Teir’Dal Shadowknight who had been the Mistress of Knights, who had cleansed him as part of his Initiation. There passed all the Officers and Brethren who disappeared or faded away. Some mocked and jeered at Khasirath, but most just scowled with icy hate in their eyes. As each one passed, Khasirath grew weaker and his pain eclipsed all thought.<br>
<br>
        Tears blurred his sight and he realized the procession had ended. But one dark figure remained before him, still shrouded in smoky fog. Even at this distance, and in his fugue, Khasirath knew this Teir’Dal: his armour, his Axe, and his swaggering certainty.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath fell to his knees on the dark and trampled grass, the smell of blood and dust rising around him. The pain writhed like a nest of eels in his gut and he felt he could not go on. He held up one hand towards the dark Knight who approached as if he could somehow fend him off.<br>
<br>
        Lord Vlekk’s specter stalked to the crown of the hill and slapped Khasirath’s hand aside with a low snarl. Khasirath looked up at the founder and original leader of the Flame of Hate, his Lord, with tears streaming down his cheeks. He could not bear to be this weak before his Lord, but he was powerless to stop this from continuing.<br>
<br>
        Vlekk loomed over his once-protégé with utter contempt etched across his features. He seemed to grow larger and stronger until he dwarfed the hill and the naked Knight crumpled upon it. Vlekk hefted his mighty Axe, which was a piece of Innoruuk’s own Being bound in physical form.<br>
<br>
        “You have failed me, Khasirath. Failed me and failed the Flame of Hate! I expected so much more from you…” The voice boomed over him, yet was hollow, an inhuman parody of Vlekk’s true voice. As the specter spoke, Khasirath’s mind was assaulted by a torrent of images and visions of the disasters that the Flame had endured. He felt the weight of all those failures on his own back, grinding him down into the earth of the hill.<br>
<br>
        “You are not fit to live, not fit to carry the Father’s Will!” Lord Vlekk shouted, raising his Axe. <br>
<br>
        Khasirath felt blood trickle from his ears and nose at the roaring of the specter, but he could not look away. When first he had seen Lord Vlekk, he had felt fear, but something else was twisting within him, trying to wrest its way free.<br>
<br>
        Drunkenly, Khasirath struggled to his feet, still looking Lord Vlekk in his dead cold eyes. He could feel the cold sweat and blood sizzle and rise from his own body as his hate flared to life, a painful dull black aura swirling and eddying around him.<br>
<br>
        “You failed us, Vlekk,” Khasirath spat, tasting the blood and powder of his own teeth on his dry lips. “You abandoned us when we needed you!” He began to shout.<br>
<br>
        The specter stood mutely, watching Khasirath step forward on numb legs, his body moving like a puppet rather than something ordered by its own mind.<br>
<br>
        “You destroyed the Flame when you left us. You took its very soul, its strength! We tried to hold the corpse together, but only you had the will that could make that happen!” Khasirath was shaking now, the aura of hate coalescing around his naked form, becoming dark and mystic armour.<br>
<br>
        “You made me who I am, Lord Vlekk. I wanted to succeed in this for you, to keep the Flame strong for you. I wanted you to be proud of me, but you set me an impossible task.” Khasirath realized he was no longer looking up at Vlekk; the specter had shrunk back down until it was merely the size of any Teir’Dal. Khasirath stepped forward again, coming toe to toe with his mentor.<br>
<br>
        “You hold no power over me, Vlekk. I belong only to the Father now. If He deems me unfit, then I shall die by my own hand. You cannot judge me anymore.” Khasirath’s voice had returned to its usual throaty growl. Though the pain still writhed deep within him, his hate made it possible to carry on.<br>
<br>
        The specter of Vlekk snarled once again, and rose up its Axe to strike Khasirath down. Khasirath surged forward with inhuman speed, grabbing Vlekk’s arms tightly and stopping his swing. For a long moment, en eternity frozen, they strained against one another’s strength. Both their faces were locked in a death’s head rictus grin.<br>
<br>
        Then Khasirath brought his right hand down and forward, catching Vlekk’s throat in a merciless crushing grip. With a howl of victory he pulled Innoruuk’s Hate into himself, channeling the raw power through his hand.<br>
<br>
        Vlekk’s body jerked and spasmed, a ragged scream forced from his lips as he staggered, the great Axe clattering to the ground.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath pushed the specter backwards and swooped up the Axe in both hands. Without any hesitation he swung the Axe powerfully, burying it deep into Vlekk’s torso, all but severing him in twain.<br>
<br>
        The specter of Vlekk shuddered and broke apart into a thousand squirming shadows that burrowed away into the earth of the hill before Khasirath could even blink.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath shivered and choked for breath as the thick smoky air closed in on him, forcing its way into his lungs, his mouth, the very pores of his skin.<br>
<br>
        He tried to howl out his hate and frustration, but his whole body seized as the smoke began crushing down around him. He clung to the Axe with desperate strength as he suddenly felt himself falling, faster and faster, his vision flaring to red and then black. The smoke still twisted and constricted around him, filling his mouth with the taste of blood. There was a dreadful grinding and roaring in his ears, drowning out all other sound.<br>
<br>
        And then it ended. All was silent, and Khasirath lay spread-eagle, face down, on a cold black marble floor. Slowly he raised his head, aware only of the pain and the hate pounding through his being.<br>
<br>
        There before Khasirath, sitting upon His dark Throne, was Innoruuk. The God leaned forward, an evil and hungry grin on His thin lips. He reached out one long hand, palm uppermost.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath got to his feet, somewhat surprised to see that he was still wearing the dark armour formed from his hate. Carefully he approached his God, aware that some of the thoughts flitting through his mind were emanating from the Father. He could feel the dark weight of His Hate, and sensations most alien in their complexity. Something felt like amusement, and strange and possessive pride. There was also a deeply pervading and perverse pleasure.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath bowed as he placed the Axe in Innoruuk’s huge hand. As he stepped back he saw the Axe twist and fade into a mass of shadows, then melt away into the God’s flesh.<br>
<br>
        Innoruuk nodded slowly, obviously satisfied. With a wave of His Hand, Khasirath went spinning, flying backwards with incredible speed.<br>
<br>
        He tensed, expecting to slam into a wall. Then with a sharp crack he heard the flogger cut into his shoulder, and felt the stinging pain settle deeply into his whole back from neck to thighs. He gasped out a ragged breath as if he’d been holding it a long while. His whole body started to tremble as his vision swam.<br>
<br>
        He lifted his head weakly, looking up at the ceiling. Thick blood crept down his arms from under the manacles and he could not feel his hands. He knew he must have been hanging there senseless a long time.<br>
<br>
        “It is done, Childe. Innoruuk has judged ye fit and returned you purified,” said Priest K’Jasn as he handed the flogger to the acolyte. The boy put the whip away, and then used a crank to lower Khasirath to the floor. The Knight groaned deeply, feeling too weak to resist.<br>
<br>
        The Priest watched over them as the acolyte removed the manacles and bandaged Khasirath’s wounds. He lay still and quiet, trembling with the pain.<br>
<br>
        The Priest made a sign of blessing over Khasirath, then left to tend to his other duties. The Eye of Innoruuk paled, but still provided dim illumination. The acolyte remained behind, sitting on the chest by the door to watch over the Knight.<br>
<br>
        Still shaking with the pain and exhaustion, Khasirath rolled onto his side slowly. He gasped and hissed with the effort, feeling the burning and pulling all along his back. He curled up, tucking his knees to his chest and wrapping his weakened arms around his knees. His hands were pale and cold, numb but slowly filling with pain. He could feel his fingers twitch occasionally, but he could not move them on his own.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath sighed deeply as he almost lost consciousness. He knew he would not be allowed healing until the next day. Until then he would remain here under the acolyte’s care. He thought of all he had seen, fighting against the blood-loss and agony to stay awake, to be sure he would not forget what had transpired.<br>
<br>
        Mostly he remembered Innoruuk’s reaction, the strange pleasure and pride he had felt as the God looked upon His Knight. A wolfish grin split Khasirath’s dry lips as the darkness stole over him, and all he felt was the hate blazing deep and strong within him.<br>
