A Partial Explaination<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It was a quiet night in the Dreadlands. The soft, white flakes fell silently, the frosted ground matted flat by the boots of the many travelers that had passed before. Magil removed one of his gauntlets to touch the cool stone of one of the Spires that rose before him, which was much larger than the ones he had seen in such places as Nektulos and the Northern Desert of Ro. He seemed a bit lost, having only been to the Lost Valley once before with the battle party that was bound to eradicate the Goblin population of the Temple of Droga many months before. He looked up a bit around and observed the trees, in there perpetual autumn howling softly in the icy breeze that clawed at his face. A glance to the horizons made him wonder where all the people were, as he was used to the many he saw in the more populated regions of Kunark.. And then it struck him. How had he gotten here? He searched through his memory for an answer, but found nothing. His most recent memory was of the blank stone face of Stishovite as he was chased through the Outpost.. which also struck him as out of the ordinary. He began to think of other such strange happenings that had plagued him as of recent. He thought of the strange blackouts and the fiery tingling in his weapon hand when he saw the faces of others. Suddenly, a loud crack and the sound of rock on rock broke his thought. Searching around to find the source of the noise, he saw a large structure off in the distance. He set off in that direction, figuring 'Why not? I have some time..' The snow was falling much more rapidly now, a blanket of white had spread while he was consumed by thought. Arriving at what he had seen from his point of origin, he saw this structure was similar.. but on a much larger scale. Magil stared in awe of the massive towers of stone that scraped the heavens. Moving his gaze down, he saw the familiar pyramids with the spires at their corners, as to which he was accustomed. He pondered for a minute the reason no snow covered the platform, as it had now accumulated heavily on the surrounding terrain. Cautiously, he stepped up onto the platform, observing the words, &quot;Territory of the Combine Empire&quot; chiseled into the floor in their ancient script. He then began to wonder how he was able to read their language, and why the area seemed so familiar now. Worse still, he began to fear the sudden sharp increase in temperature as he stepped further onto the platform. He jumped as he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned around, the fingers on his ungloved hand ignited as he jabbed them into the chest of who he assumed to be an attacker. The face of the man on the receiving end contorted in excruciating torment and he clutched what was left of his tattered torso. The man spent his last breath to speak, &quot;It is.. good to see.. you again, Magil.. Take the pages.. in my pocket, so..&quot; Magil looked on indifferently as the man expired. Searching through the pockets of the man, he found that there were pages and, on closer inspection, he also found that they were pieces torn from someone's private journal. He sat down by the unknown man and began to read with interest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Today was another cold and boring day overseeing experimentation at this outpost. I certainly hope something worth an entry in this journal will happen soon. (the name and date have been burned away)<br>
<br>
It seems my wishes have been granted. Today I went on expedition away from the confines of these Spires out to the boundless field. It had all seemed normal until I found one of our workers, I think his name was Magil, wandering directionless on the frozen plain. I called to him as greeting and we walked toward each other to meet. He appeared to have been out wandering for days as the signs of fatigue weighed heavily on his eyelids. We started back to the outpost, but were met by one of the vile giants who fouled Combine territory. I shouted to run, but Magil merely stood before the giant. At the time I thought he was paralyzed with fear, but he soon showed otherwise. The giant lashed out to strike him and with fluidness and grace, my new companion slid just outside the blow. Reaching out with one of his arms he contacted the giant. I did not believe my eyes, as in his grip the giant's veins blackened, its eyes glazed, and its limbs spasmed violently, soon falling limp. The giant seized and crashed to the ground, black liquid pouring from its mouth. It was I who was now paralyzed with fear, for I had never seen such things. Like a machine, he started off toward the outpost. I followed him until his eventual collapse and had to drag him the rest of the way. (the name and date have been burned away)<br>
<br>
It seems the rigors of yesterday's journey have left me tired so I could not venture out again today. I want to say the same for my new friend, but it seems it hasn't affected him at all. When I awoke this morning, he appeared quite healthy. I got recent news that one of our workers has disappeared and am sending out a party to look for him in the field. (the name and date have been burned away)<br>
<br>
It seems we could not find our worker, and during the night, another has vanished. I have called in an Arbiter to inspect the disappearances. I addressed my friend by his name for the first time today, and he seemed severely agitated by it. Later, he introduced himself as Azahgal Xala'al Zek. I questioned about the third name, but he refused to speak more about it. (the name and date have been burned away)<br>
<br>
I awoke this morning to find the Arbiter impaled on his own weapon by the platform, with the same black liquid flowing from his mouth like I had seen three days before. I went to question Azahgal about it but could not find him anywhere. One of the Forest Walkers visiting from Faydwer was unable to locate him anywhere nearby. It is obvious there is a link between the disappearances and my new friend. (the name and date have been burned away)<br>
<br>
(this last entry is written in a different script, with the blood that could only belong to the owner of this journal)<br>
Magil,<br>
I will soon accomplish my goal. Once I have taken down the Combine Empire, the gods will almost be weak enough for me to destroy. My master has informed me that there will be a group of Teir'Dal who can help me accomplish my goals, so I am putting you into dreamless rest until that time. When you awake in Neriak, you will be weak and without a proper kit for combat, as well as I will not be with you, but know that I will come to claim you when you grow powerful.<br>
Azahgal Xala'al Zek&quot;<br>
<br>
Magil stood and looked around, the raging snowstorm had torn down many of the trees around the platform. He started off in the direction of the only spires that still worked, but before he made it off the platform he felt his mind fade. After that there was darkness.. When he opened his eyes again, he was at home in Neriak, much in the same manner he had come to the Dreadlands. He jumped up quickly and set off to find the Harvesters and show what he had found.<br>
