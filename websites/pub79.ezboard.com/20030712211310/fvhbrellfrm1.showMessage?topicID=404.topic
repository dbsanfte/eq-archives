Role-Playing 101 <br>
<br>
           Role-playing… What the heck is it?  Imagine yourself as a character in a play, only there's no script. You are required to know every nuance of your character: how they think, how they act, and how they react. What motivates them to behave in a certain way? What things in their past shaped their personality? These things, among others, are only up to you and no one else. After all, it's your character that you are going to be role-playing.  Role-Playing in a MMOG setting is completely different than doing so in a pen and paper setting or any other instance where you might role-play for that matter.  Role-playing in a MMOG setting can be a very rewarding experience, but can also be one that is very trying.  If you are into a challenge and willing to put some effort into your role-playing beyond a passing attempt then you will be richly rewarded in your game-play experience.  <br>
<br>
There are some key things to keep in mind while role-playing in a MMOG.  The most important of these is that this is not your usual setting where everyone is in the mood to role-play all the time.  Many people in fact will not role-play at all; they are just not in the game for those reasons.  You have to know this and understand it to enjoy your experience yourself.  If you walk up to someone while in-character and start speaking to the, and all they turn around and look at you and say “WTF” you need to know when to say “Good day” and just walk away from that area or continue on with your business.  Don’t be discouraged, and just go find someone else to have a good experience with.  Most people, even if they are not role-players themselves do appreciate the occasional person who stays in character as it creates an enjoyable experience for all parties involved.  <br>
<br>
One other thing to keep in mind is that it’s ok to break character once in a while.  A MMOG would be almost impossible to role-play 100% of the time.  Sometimes it would be a burden to stay in character, and when that happens the enjoyment is taken out of it.  During these one should feel free to switch over to polite out of character speech.  People are used to staying in character for a few hours at a time, maybe once or twice a week if they play a pen and paper game.  With a MMOG people often play everyday for longer periods of time than they would sit down with a pen and paper game.  Because of this fact alone people are going to need to take breaks.  Some people don’t realize that role-playing takes some effort, and while it is rewarded with a great rewarding experience sometimes you just need to take a break and take it easy.  You should never be afraid to do this.   <br>
<br>
Character Creation <br>
<br>
            When you've researched your character's race and prospective class, it's time to think about the &quot;Why?&quot; Why did your character decide to become that certain class? If the answer is, &quot;Because it's the most powerful class available,&quot; or &quot;The book said that it has the most potential,&quot; then you need to rethink again about the person that you're creating. Remember that your character doesn't know that the game exists. To them, the world that you're playing in is real.  You should select your character because it’s something that you would enjoy playing.  If you’re only doing it for the powerlevel capabilities then you are not going to have a very fun role-playing experience at all.  A well thought out character background can be a great asset to you.  It can be your ultimate resource while playing the game.  If there is ever a question about what your character might do in a certain situation all you need to do is take a look back at what your character background says.  If you thought it out well, it should provide you with enough information to imply how your character might react in a certain situation.  <br>
<br>
Key Tips for In-Game<br>
<br>
* The difference between IC and OOC. IC stands for In Character. These are actions that happen as the story is evolving. It includes everything your character says and does. Things that happen to your character IC should be dealt with IC. OOC stands for Out Of Character. Things that happen to you in the everyday real world are OOC. Your character is NEVER OOC. Only you, the player, can deal with things that happen OOC. <br>
<br>
* Always keep in mind the time and effort you took to put your character together. You'll have wasted your time researching and perfecting a character if you don't take into consideration who the character is during a game.  If you come up with a history that your character hates Progen, and you smile to every Progen you see then the character history you put behind the character would be fruitless.  Obviously if you are taking a break from staying in character, you can feel free to act how you please.  But for those times when you are trying to stay in character, really try to stay in character; it will only make the experience that much more worthwhile.  <br>
<br>
* I am not here to test out my theatrical ability and Oscar-winning dramatics, nor show how much self-angst I can exhibit.  I like the feel of role-playing in a game, by using the game mechanics of the system.  Role-playing a character in game is not just Theatrical Improv.   If I wanted to be involved with just Theatrical Improv, I would have been an actor.    I want to play the game, and I immersed in the game to a whole new level.  Role-playing can do this, but remember rule #1 at all times.  <br>
<br>
** HAVE FUN!  - This has been always rule #1 no matter what game you are playing or what setting it’s in.  I try to cater to all players, and establish a portion of the game that they can relate and attach too.  Sometimes that's bad, other times it works.  A quick rule of thumb:  If I am not having fun, no one is having fun. <br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
            The most important thing to remember about role-playing is that you’re doing it to have fun, for yourself.  It's JUST a Game.  - Remember that in the end, it really doesn't matter, don't take it so seriously.  If you aren’t having fun then maybe role-playing in this kind of setting isn’t for you.  A MMOG can be a fun and rewarding experience any way you play it, but for those of us who enjoy role-playing then doing so should only increase your experience with the game.  Good luck to you all and I look forward to seeing you in a not so far galaxy soon.  <br>

<br>
           Now what? You have a character... you have a back-story... you have interaction. How do you further the role-play experience? Out-of-game message boards are an excellent method of furthering role-play stories. After all, in-game role-play can only go so far. Not everyone has the same play schedule, and there are other things you want to do. Such as gaining experience, questing, raiding and the myriad other things that is available for your character to do in an online game. <br>
<br>
Here are the basics... the &quot;dos&quot; and &quot;don'ts&quot; of writing character stories. <br>
<br>
<br>
DO refer to what has happened so readers and other players in your scenario have an idea where you are picking up the storyline from. <br>
<br>
&quot;Corwyn was tired from the hunt and the events of the day. The duel between Mirriam and Iveneski confused him. He fell into his bed exhausted but even in sleep, his devils did not leave him. He began to dream...&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
DO ask permission from your fellow role-players before you &quot;speak&quot; or &quot;act&quot; for their characters. <br>
<br>
&quot;Corwyn looked at Mirriam in shock. &quot;You did what?&quot; &quot;I killed him.&quot; Was her hysterical reply. She began to scream.&quot; <br>
<br>
The person playing Mirriam might take offense at your portrayal of her screaming hysterically. <br>
<br>
<br>
DO correspond via e-mail or ooc messages regarding rules/limits/etc. of role-play and role-play stories, especially if emotions such as love and sexual/abusive acts are involved. There is nothing more disturbing and uncomfortable then when limits are over-stepped. A few precautions taken early can prevent much discomfort. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've enjoyed our role-play very much, and since our characters have professed their love for each other, I think that the natural next step is for them to become lovers. However, I prefer not to have my character married, and would appreciate stories with them involved to close with &quot;fade to black&quot; type endings rather than a description of the sexual act.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The only person to which I will say the words &quot;I love you&quot; is my real world wife. Even though Corwyn is a role-play character, he is very much an extension of my persona. Therefore, even if Corwyn is protective and loving to Syreen by calling her his sweetheart and what have you, he won't be saying those words to her.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I agree that my character will be tortured, but prefer not to have the act described graphically. No hot tongs on genitals, etc. please. A creation of atmosphere can very easily imply what is to come.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
DON'T write out a conclusion of a scenario without collaborating with the other players in your scenario. <br>
<br>
&quot;The babe was placed on the alter. Jeqon lifted the dagger and consecrated it to Innoruuk. Testing the blade he made a clean cut, spilling red blood. The infant squalled until its heart beat no more.&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, well... there, you've given no chance for the other parties to rescue the child, and very possibly put an end to that role-play scenario. <br>
<br>
&quot;Arawyn fired the arrow and watched with satisfaction as it flew true to its mark and pierced Koumi's throat. She grinned evilly as Koumi clawed at it as she fell over dead.&quot; <br>
<br>
Do you think that the player of Koumi might object? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<br>
DON'T use the knowledge that you gain from reading other's off-line stories if your character would not have any reason to gather that knowledge. For example, if two druids had a secret meeting in Surefall Glades and your character is a Cleric of Innoruuk... without a great stretch of imagination (spies perhaps?), your character would not be privy to what they said to each other. <br>
<br>
Finally... whether in-game or out, DON'T get too emotionally involved with your character and the role-play. If you ever do find yourself in that situation, take a step back. A few days off the game or the role-play might be needed. Remember that it is a game. You really aren't a wood-elf.<br>

I have a few things to add about roleplaying and some of the difficulties involved.<br>
<br>
For me, the function of roleplay is to tell a story. The details of the story are unkown, other then the backgrounds of the characters involved. It is through character interaction that plots develop and the story takes form. There is no such thing as &quot;winning&quot; or &quot;losing&quot; in roleplay. It is just a tale that is being told by many people. Also, I see roleplay as being for the benefit of those around me. When given a choice, I prefer to use &quot;say&quot; mode or &quot;guildsay&quot; opposed to &quot;tells.&quot; Allowing the public to hear what is happening will enrich the roleplaying environment of Everquest. &quot;Tells&quot; can be useful for introducing and developing characters, but I feel that the more people that hear you the better. I always encourage others to become involved in any roleplay I do. At the very least, others can be amused and/or entertained.<br>
<br>
One of the issues in Everquest is that everyone wishes to be the &quot;hero.&quot; Very few people are willing to play the fool. When two stubborn heros meet, their roleplay typically degrades into a pointless whinning match that is sure to end with the higher level person challanging the other to a duel. It looks silly for someone to refuse to fight because they know they would lose, and by the same token it shows poor roleplay to challange someone if you know you can win. It would be better to be creative, use you wits. Sometimes it will play best to take on the &quot;losing&quot; role. Remember, so long as you &quot;lose&quot; well, then you have roleplayed well. If you sense that a roleplay interaction is not going to go well, you may consider presenting a scenerio that allows everyone to save face and leave.<br>
<br>
When roleplaying conflict, anger, or sadness it becomes very easy to be misunderstood. No one will ever read one of your messages with the same tone as you typed it in. Augmenting your messages with emotes can help communication, and certainly add a depth to the roleplay. Even so, it is good to offer an &quot;ooc:&quot; message from time to time, assuring the other person or people that you are only roleplaying. I have witnessed experienced roleplayers become offended due to misunderstood roleplay. Also, if there is an aspect about your character that is not coming across, you might try using an &quot;ooc:&quot; message to quickly explain where you are coming from. Also, if you are every truly upset or angry, then never mix real emotions with roleplay. If you halfway roleplay your true feelings, then it will end tragically wrong. When expressing a genuine problem, then make absolutely sure that everyone who hears you knows that you are &quot;out of character.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most of us have detailed character histories. However, you cannot expect others to know your character as well as you do. Especially if it someone you have just met. Feel free to introduce your character and provide any information that you think someone else might know. In fact, this may become essentail if your physical characteristics differ from your EQ model. Such as, if you are exceptionally old or young, or missing a limb, obese, or perhaps a cross-breed. If you can present this information &quot;in character&quot; then all the better, but &quot;ooc:&quot; will do just as well if the circumstances dictate it. Everyone is free to create their characters as they see fit. When they tell you of their history we must accept their story as fact. However, when we create our histories, we should take care to make them believable and so they mesh well in the EQ environment. For example, you wouldn't want to claim that you are the Avatar of Cazic-Thule and therefore all Iksar must bow to you and pay you tribute. For one, the Avatar already exists as an NPC. Secondly, no one would do as you ask and you have no method of actually enforcing anything. Third, it's plain stupid. Also, you wouldn't want to take advantage of everyone by being a &quot;spy&quot;, then telling everyone you meet a different background story for yourself, then patting yourself on the back for being so clever to fool everyone. Everyone wants to be unique, but take care to make a history that interacts well in your environment.<br>
<br>
When using emotes it may be presumptuous to include someone elses reaction. It would not be proper to use &quot;Rohwin grabs hold of Khasirath and throws him to the ground.&quot; I would rather use something like &quot;Rohwin attempts to throw Khasirath to the ground.&quot; Then it would be up to Khasirath to decide if I was successful. Ordinarily I would likely not succeed in such an act, but maybe if he knew that I had just been buffed to 255 strength he might give in and allow himself to be thrown down. Emotes are a wonderful tool to use in roleplay, just make sure to use them responsibly.<br>
<br>
I hope these comments are helpful. I would like to hear other ideas from people on how they view roleplay.<br>
<br>
Journey well everyone,<br>
