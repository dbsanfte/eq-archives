Most people on daoc seem to look at two lights, You have Berserkers which they equate 'uber' and Blademasters which they equate as 'gimps'.  Savages falling into the Berserker line and Mercs falling into the Blademaster line.  <br>
<br>
  Now, that being the case, what exactly should a 'Light Tank' Be like?  I'm asking everyone on several forums this because I'm trying to get an idea if what everyone wants is just yet another gimp class, kind of like I expect.  While answering, try to be specific and cover all the bases.  Define just how much defensive capability they should have, how much offensive power and really what you expect what kind of role they should take in the game.<br>

How fast depends on the survivability.  So a Berserker who has nothing but offense and Studded should be the best at it (within reason), followed by the Blademaster who also has studded but can take out a shield/bow for more &quot;utility&quot; and Mercenaries should come last (at killing quickly among the light tanks) since he/she gets Chain Armor.<br>
<br>
When 2 groups both containing casters and light tanks come face to face, there needs to be a tactical decision:<br>
<br>
1) Take out the big hitters (casters) who can do awesome damage very fast from range or other support classes which increase survivability of a group.<br>
<br>
2) Take out the other light tanks who are trying to take out your survivability or your big hitters.<br>
<br>
All Light Tanks should kill fast (compared to a non-light tank...this doesn't mean 2 shotting an opponent), but the flip side is if the Light Tank gets too much attention, he/she goes down just as fast as he/she can take down any opponent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#000000>(4/27/03 8:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question: What do you think a 'Light Tank' should be lik</span><hr size=1> A Light Tank should draw even in a duel with a polearmsman, assuming they are both using suitable weapon types, eg both Slash in the case of Albion Chain and ALbion plate both being neutral to this weapon type.<br>
<br>
Hance, it should be proven that the damage we can output is enough to BALANCE the amount that we TAKE, giving us equal performance with other tanks.<br>
<br>
The argument against this is that RvR values offense over defense, so that if these two classes were so evenly matched, there would be no point in playing a polearmsman when you can kill casters much more effectively as a mercenary, and then still fight the Heroes nice and fairly, like.<br>
<br>
As of yet, however, there is even less to justify that a polearm should do MORE damage than dual wield... <p>Blame<br>

Light tanks should be more reliant on evade, but armor+evade for all tanks should be identical in benefit in melee.<br>
<br>
Light and heavy tanks should have the same hit points.<br>
<br>
No tank should have to rely on reactional or positional styles. All tank classes should have effective versions of all kinds of styles available to them.<br>
<br>
Light tanks should have a constant non-sprint movement rate speed that is a little faster than normal. This benefit does not permit faster &quot;run song&quot; speed than normal.<br>
<br>
Heavy tanks should have an innate magic resistance superiority over the light tank. This makes up for the light tank's increased speed. While the light tank can close the distance to casters more quickly, the heavy tank can take more of their hits on the way there.<br>
<br>
Light tanks that max out weapon and dual wield lines should do more damage than polearm users that max out two weapon lines (armsman). This does not mean light tanks necessarily do more damage per attack, but over a short period of time (15 seconds or so), the light tank should have inflicted greater damage overall. Of course, heavy tanks that only specialize in one weapon line are even further behind in damage.<br>
<br>
Anything attacked by a heavy tank suffers from a melee attack speed penalty, causing reduced damage over time. In a duel between a heavy and a light tank, each with two weapon line specializations at equal level, the speed penalty inflicted by the heavy tank is exactly enough to offset the weapon damage superiority of the light tank so that over time, each inflicts about the same amount of damage on the other. If the heavy tank's target is attacking an ally instead of the tank, the speed penalty still applies, allowing a heavy tank to defend his friends. In addition, targets of a heavy tank's target do not count as being in melee, allowing them to cast spells without disruption. The attack speed decrease stacks with all other kinds of attack speed decreases, including the speed decreases caused by friendly heavy tanks.<br>
<br>
The light tank becomes a true offensive warrior with his speed and damage superiority. He is best when rushing at enemy casters and healers. The heavy tank, in contrast, is a defensive warrior that survives better against magic and protects allies while they cast spells. He is best when sticking near his own casters and attacking anyone who attacks them. The light tank will generally be able to kill non-tanks faster. The heavy tank ensures that casters are able to kill faster and gains kills through his allies. Both are equally capable when personally fighting other tanks.<br>
<br>
RvR is oriented toward attack more than defense, but the key is to maximize the offensive ability of the fighting group, not necessarily the individual. Healers, for example, do not add as much to offensive power as nukers do, but by keeping the nukers alive, they indirectly improve the group's offense. The heavy tank's defensive ability also indirectly improves group offense by protecting casters. Like nukers, light tanks will be directly adding to group offense.<br>
<br>
In PvE, a light and heavy tank can work in concert with the light tank dealing the heavy damage and probably drawing the aggro. The heavy tank also helps with damage, but more importantly, decreases the attack speed of the target so that the light tank takes less damage.<br>
<br>
Solo, a light tank will kill faster than a heavy tank in PvE due to better damage. The heavy tank should still win battles with the same amount of hit points remaining though, because the attack speed decrease he inflicts reduces the damage he takes. Downtime should be the same for each of the tanks. The light tank is still a better soloer and will level faster due to faster kills, and their ability to run faster to find prey, but the difference will not be that large. There are solo caster classes that are still far more powerful. In groups, both tanks are equally effective, and whether light or heavy, tanks ought to group rather than solo anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siryakk>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#000000>(5/9/03 10:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question: What do you think a 'Light Tank' should be lik</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The heavy tank's defensive ability also indirectly improves group offense by protecting casters. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Flaw:<br>
I have yet to see in your suggestion how the heavy tanks higher personal defence translates to any significantly better ability at protecting casters.<br>
<br>
The heavy tank could slow the attacks of one attacker, while the light tank would drop that attacker quicker.  The heavy tank would be roughly equally likely to kill the attacker before they killed the caster, but the light tank would get the attacker off the caster quicker than the heavy tank would.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, you want:<br>
Light tanks to have the same (mitigation+avoidance) and hps that heavy tanks have.<br>
Light tanks do more damage than heavy tanks.<br>
Light tanks run faster than heavy tanks.<br>
Heavy tanks have inherit magic resist.<br>
Heavy tanks have an inherit slow.<br>
<br>
Mate, that's not a very big set of differences between completely different classes.<br>

<br>
Our damage over time should be more effective but the fact tat we have mroe DoT shouldn't detract from the fact that our job is to kill a target QUICKER than an armsman/hero/warrior, whether he's offensive (2H, pole, LW) or defensive (Sword and Board) <br>
<br>
What this means is that though the polearm/2H can deal tremendous up-front offense we should be able to catch up and overtake this scaling very qquickly.<br>
<br>
IMHO that means that starting at the word go with a front-loading polearm as a contender, a CDWLA tank should have caught up the polearmsmans DoT by the 2nd/3rd hit and overtaken by the 4th.<br>
<br>
This still means that we've gotta wait 9-12 seconds before we can start going &quot;ha! superior damage&quot; but anything over this is overpowerment.<br>
<br>
It's generally a defensive heavy tanks job to protect casters with their slam. An offensive heavy tank (2H) should be a decent caster-killer like the light tank, but as above should be &quot;penalised&quot; in performance through his slowness.<br>
<br>
And most importantly, any fast attack speed shouldn't be a penalty to our damage. IN CDW fast atttack speeds are required as we don't DW all the time. IN LA people have exploited the &quot;you get mroe damage per hit if your delay is slower&quot; by even going to the extent of duelling casters so as to have their quickness debuffed meaning mroe front-loading damage. Slow speed should be a ponderous, ticking, nightmarish curse that makes people want to cry, not a bullet-time slow-motion effect before the target falls dead in 1-2 hits.<br>
<br>
Likewise, the light tank (ALL LIGHT TANKS) should relish the high speed of his attacks, and be more like &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; Kenshiro than Scrappy-Doo.<br>
<br>
Remember, we're good at making our weak opponents suddenly cut-down. So we should his fast, to bust PBT, crit, DW, PF and proc Dots, DDs and DTs a lot.<br>

After all, they are both still &quot;tanks.&quot; I don't believe they were ever meant to serve different roles, and if I were to design my own game, I would only have one pure tank class instead of two. However, since there are two tank classes per realm in this game, they need to be different somehow, but not too different. I believe my suggestion meets this need.<br>
<br>
Yes, the attack hinderance ability of the heavy tank won't completely stop a light tank from killing off a caster. It is not meant to. Remember though, that the ability will also allow the attacked caster to continue casting spells to heal himself or nuke/stun the light tank. The heavy tank isn't totally protecting the caster, but helping him to defend himself. If I were a nuker, I would much rather have the proposed heavy tank defending me because I could then get off a spell and kill my attacker. However, a light tank defending me would not help me cast any spells, and I would probably be dead before the enemy was killed off by the tank.<br>
<br>
Front end damage superiority of polearm users is most significant because RvR damage is so high and people die so fast. I find the fast kill rate annoying anyway, and I think others do too. If combat were simply slowed down and everybody did less damage, the front end damage would be less of a problem because light tanks would do more damage over time.<br>
<br>
Another thing that would help all fast weapon users would be to change the weapon speed delay system so that the delay occurs BEFORE the first weapon strike. That way, when a fast weapon user and a slow weapon user press the attack button at the same time, the fast weapon user hits first. Let's say that a fast weapon does half the damage of a slow one, but attacks at double the rate. When both attacks first attack, the fast weapon will hit once for half the damage of the slow one. Then, the fast weapon will hit again at the same time as the slow weapon's first strike. The fast weapon again, does half the damage of the slow weapon. By this time, the fast weapon has two half damage strikes, and the slow weapon has one full damage strike, and the damage is identical. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#000000>(5/10/03 3:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> how to make US mroe &quot;offensive&quot; than 2H frontload</span><hr size=1> That's actually a very good theory, IMHO.<br>

I think that in itself would solve a lot of the inequalities between 2H and Light Tanks. However, I think this would make many peopl see polearm (especialy 60. speeed crush poles) as nerfed, particularly when it comes to charging casters and stuff.<br>
<br>
POlearmsman duels would be hilarious to watch.<br>
<br>
Another weird thing they could try out would be to have a sort of &quot;highland swing&quot; effect, whereas the first attack does take place but you have a special &quot;draw and strike&quot; animation which does less damage than the succeeding hits.<br>
<br>
Then again, that's unrealistic.

<br>
A light tank should be able to be a primary tank in both a PvE and RvR group with equal ability of a heavy tank.  The difference comes in damage vs. defense.<br>
<br>
A light tank will do more damage allowing for a mob to die quicker at the cost of taking more damage during the fight vs. a heavy tank taking a bit longer to kill the mob but taking less damage during the fight.<br>
<br>
IF block and parry are working in RvR as they do in PvE now, you'll see a heavy tank able to fulfill his role against other tanks now.  None of the light tanks, unless you count savages, will be able to.  <br>

This would allow you to do your positionals in RvR even though nobody would willingly turn away from you. This would make the value of the off hand attack much greater, despite the lack of damage bonus, and would make dual wielding a more worthwhile skill.<br>
<br>
The side positionals need to be fixed so that they do a good amount of damage though.<br>
<br>
If the berserker were to have this ability, the off hand attack has a chance to cause the spin rather than automatically doing it, because the berserker hits with the off hand all the time.<br>
<br>
What is the explanation for this ability? The super fast barrage of multiple attacks dished out by the light tank unbalances the enemy and knocks his facing away.<br>
<br>
This spin effect of course breaks face/stick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tatsumaruiii>TatsumaruIII</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#000000>(5/18/03 11:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question: What do you think a 'Light Tank' should be lik</span><hr size=1> I rather like flurry.

<br>
My complaint is that it doesn't do all that much damage, and also is on the slash resist table no matter what your weapon is. Most I can get out of it is 150 damage (typically hit 110 or so), which isn't real strong for a 2 minute re-use timer. I'v never been able to use it twice in one encounter. If the re-use timer were to stay the same, I would think a damage increase would be in order. For 2 minutes, I want damage that really makes them say &quot;uh oh&quot;. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

I know this is part of their special ability that sets them apart from Warriors, but Flurry IS one of our special abilities, and it IS something given to us in place of superior class tweaks.<br>

Maybe if you shot off those plus flurry at once, you could get some good damage in for a moment.<br>
<br>
An interesting change to flurry might be to take it off its current timer, and put it on a short after-combat-readying timer, similar to assassin venoms. It would work as follows:<br>
<br>
While you aren't attacking, and nobody is beating on you, you activate flurry with a hot button. On your next melee attack, your opponent is hit by the flurry in addition to your normal damage. You finish the fight as normal. Afterwards, you wait a moment for the combat timer to run, and then you again prepare (apply) the flurry to be used on your next attack.<br>
<br>
The above change would keep flurry as a front end damage bonus, as it was orignally meant to be. The removal of the timer between uses would allow flurry to be used more often. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 360<br> <font color=#000000>(5/21/03 4:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question: What do you think a 'Light Tank' should be lik</span><hr size=1> That would be very cool, like a self-applying poison insta-DD thing.<br>
<br>
Only thing is they'd have to find a way to fix it so mercs wouldn't exit combat mode, reapply after and then re-enter, hence using it more than once per encounter. They'd probably have to put it on a short timer, like the Paladin aggro-taunt Chant, AND make it only usable (&quot;applicable&quot;) when not in combat mode.<br>
<br>
OR do a First Aid/Stealth job with it  so you can't apply it while you're being attacked, or directly afterwards.<br>
<br>
But I wouldn't like that, because I'd like to be able to apply it before they use IP so as to trick 'em. So I think it'd probably have to be the timer after all that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would like it on a 30 second timer, usable in PvE and dealing damage based upon a combination of DW/Weapon, and dealing the same damage type as the mainhand is carrying, however.<br>
<br>
Either that or leave it as it is but make it a sort of &quot;insta-fumble&quot; a la Classic (broken) DT. Single target fumbles its next move. Works well against Polearm, 2H, LW but NOT very effective against other light tanks as they often hit twice at once.<br>
<br>
My main gripe is that we can't &quot;fumble&quot; spells. We're offensive fighters but this new DT seems to give us a defensive role. <p>Blame MyBlades, (Golden Hands of Gain)<br>
