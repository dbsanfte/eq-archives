Fallen raid<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
There were half a dozen people there so far.<br>
<br>
Silverstarr sat against the wall just outside of the frog city, Guk. The place smelled horrible, even when the breeze carried most of the stench away. The others waited restlessly at the entrance to the city, sitting or standing, and Minz's half brother Munz was playing a soft tune on a lute. A couple of her guildmates were off in a corner, chatting quietly over something.<br>
<br>
She leaned back and ignored the awful stench, letting the pain in her right arm throb all through her. The scorpion bite she'd gotten in Kunark was getting worse. Poison was doubtful, since it had been two weeks and she was still not sick. But the injury was worsening.<br>
<br>
Several more raiders arrived. These were part of the Knights Templar. She had never met any in person, but knew that they were a just an honorable bunch, and greeted them warmly. <br>
<br>
<br>
Everyone stepped into the large entrance and sat down inside to await the arrival of the others. Silver was not too happy about the other guild that had been invited - the Violent Harvest. They were an unruly bunch, fanatics of evil, in her mind. She'd met a couple, of course. Pravdameer, and Xareth. Those two were enough, she wanted no dealings whatsoever with them. <br>
<br>
The rest of the raiders appeared. Two Violent Harvest, the rest of the Dragons, and a small scattering of others. Silver tried to keep from appearing nervous in the face of the event, but there were Dark Elves all about her. And then Pravdameer approached, grinning evilly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening, child.&quot; <br>
<br>
She gazed him levelly. This one was more fanatical than the rest she'd met. And he was on the Dragons' wanted list for the disappearance of Orrianna. She was not going to do anything though, the Harvest was invited on the terms that they would ally with the Dragons for the sake of the raid, and not start any problems while it went on. She also knew that they had some from of honor all their own, and would not break truce. But still, having them around gave her goosebumps. &quot;Yes, dark one?&quot;<br>
<br>
He gave her a knowing look. She hated it. &quot;Atoxus tells me that there is something of interest about you.&quot; He glanced down at her bracer. <br>
<br>
Silver knew he meant the sting. How much about it did he know? Or more importantly, how did he find out?? Wait, that Atoxus person. She'd never seen or met that one. But heard of, yes. She reached for the stung spot absently and wished that she were elsewhere. &quot;There is nothing that I have that would interest you, dark one. I am here to raid the city, not stand here and bicker with you.&quot; As she turned away he spoke again, softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you do….&quot;<br>
<br>
She ignored it. That one was just trying to scare her, and she knew it. There was no way he could know about the injury that she could see. She'd told no one, save that she'd been stung by that giant scorpion after leaving Kurn's. No one knew about the color change on her skin. No one.<br>
<br>
Everyone finally got ready and split into groups. Group leaders had gathered their groups around them and were going over attack plans. There were two main groups, formed of the stronger and more seasoned raiders. She was one of the few that had not been put there; going to such a difficult area as Lower Guk would be a deathwish for her. Minz, Palsel, and two of the Dark Elves were also not strong enough yet.<br>
<br>
And that meant she was going to hunt with them.<br>
<br>
The very idea made her stomach queasy, and she fought it down. No, they were allies for the purpose, and could be trusted for now. So she joined the circle with the remaining three (Palsel had drifted off to somewhere) raiders, and concentrated on what Minz was telling them.<br>
<br>
Once a plan was formed, everyone set about going to their destination. There was an area in the city that was a sort of way station for the Frogloks. They would travel here and there, near a closed off area that was not visited often. It was a perfect place for hunting.<br>
<br>
Pravdameer and his dark friend, Merryck, consulted for a minute, and Merryck went off to pull a few of the wretched Frogloks to their deaths. Silver readied her sword for them and took her place beside the dark cleric. She felt odd doing so, but for the raid, she'd aid them both the best she could. She really wish Minz had stayed; he'd gone off to the lower levels to see how the other raiders were doing. And Palsel was nowhere to be found still. With both gone, she was left alone with two enemies….<br>
<br>
They fought a number of battles, and killed frogloks until all three were getting tired. Pravdameer had been badly injured at one point, and she'd sung her healing ballad to aid him while Merryck kept watch for attackers. When the cleric was strong enough to cast, he finished the healing himself, and helped tend the wounds she and Merryck had earned. <br>
<br>
Merryck returned from his post and spoke in a low tone. &quot;I hear that the ones who went below broke off the raid.&quot; He turned to Pravdameer. &quot;What do you think about this, brother?&quot;<br>
<br>
Pravdameer grinned and closed his spellbook. &quot;The raid was broken off… does that mean it is over? I think it does.&quot; He rose off the floor and placed the spellbook in his pack. &quot;What do you think, Merryck?&quot; <br>
<br>
Silver sensed something amiss. What were these two so happy about? If the raid below had broken off so soon, then it meant that something had gone wrong. And she'd seen another of their guild go with them too. An Iksar. They seemed not to mind that he was below alone with the Dragons…. <br>
<br>
The two exchanged a look, and she knew something was amiss for sure. She rose from her spot on the floor, watching the two warily….<br>
<br>
<br>
(ooc note: i'm leaving this unfinished so Pravdameer or Merryck can put in their two copper pieces. I'm sure one of them can figure something out, hehehe)<br>

*ooc* Nicely done - I hope to have something up in the next day or so, but work may say otherwise. You did fine on presenting Prav, by the way. <br>
