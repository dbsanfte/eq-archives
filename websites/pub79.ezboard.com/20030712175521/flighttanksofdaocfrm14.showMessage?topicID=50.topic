**************************************** <br>
Hord's Unofficial Berserker TL Report 1.62 6-11-03 <br>
**************************************** <br>
<br>
Overview: <br>
<br>
Berserker's were once a main threat on the RVR battlefield. We were feared by just about ever playable class. In RVR groups, we were the heavy hitters with less defense and armor (that was vulnerable to the most used damage type out there). Currently the Berserker class has lost it's &quot;feel.&quot; This is leaving people to wonder just what exactly the class is supposed to do, if not totally abandoning them. Mainly there is no &quot;incentive&quot; to pick this class over others. <br>
<br>
<br>
Concerns: <br>
<br>
Light Tank Role - <br>
What is our role? The class description was once about how a light tank has more offensive output then a main tank of that realm, but also have less defense output then the main tank of that realm. Currently that description has somehow changed? No longer are all 3 Light tank classes (all-realms) fitting this description. That whole description was the incentive to play the light tank class. Without any class defining traits, there is no reason to play the class. <br>
<br>
Overall Damage Output - <br>
Currently our Left Axe style line was reduced on average by 30%. This was too far to fast in light of all the other current fixes/changes in 1.62. A reduction of 15% along with the a boost (10-15%) in other light tank spec lines, would have been more then enough to hold the &quot;idea&quot; of a light tank true. This would have been a more welcomed change then what is currently in place. <br>
<br>
<br>
Specline Issues: <br>
<br>
Left Axe - <br>
Aurora Borealis (level 50): Please switch this back to work when the opponent parries. We never asked for a 3 chain back hit. A 3 chain hit is extremely hard to pull off in RVR. Also in light of the new group bug parry/block fix this style finally became a very viable style. Icy Brilliance (Level 44) Currently has a 9 damage per 4 second for 40 second bleed. This is currently low when compared to other bleed styles. A change in this value would be a welcome change. <br>
<br>
Frenzy - <br>
The frenzy ability allows Berserkers to gain the ability to have critical hits on every successful hit. The critical range is 1-100%. The ability lasts for 20 seconds and is on a 7 minute timer. Once in this form we lose all Defensive ability and a percentage of our AF. Now that Merc/BM abilities have been changed to a 7 minute time and have positive effects associated to them, there are no negatives to their abilities. The frenzy ability should be reviewed to either bring it in-line with sister class abilities or for them to be brought in line with our ability. <br>
<br>
Realm Abilities - <br>
Many realm abilities have well documented bugs. Tundra, Prevent Flight, Tireless, Mastery of Arms, etc. Fixing these realm abilities would be a great help to Berserkers if not all Melee classes. <br>
<br>
New Issues: <br>
<br>
Left Axe Endurance Usage - <br>
With the current reduction to the damage in the Left Axe style line there should also be a reduction in Endurance costs to some of the styles within Left Axe. Style damage output vs endurance usage should be addressed. <br>
<br>
Endurance Regen - <br>
The modification to shaman endurance regen has affected Berserker performance in RvR. The reduced availability of endurance regen has made style costs and sprinting more painful and possibly put Midgard tanks at a disadvantage in combat with other realms. <br>
<br>
RVR In General - <br>
RVR now has a heavy concentration of Caster based classes. Pre 1.62 the mix of rvr was about 50-50 or 60-40 caster to melee mix. After the patch and the addition of /level the mix has heavily swung to the Caster side. Where does this leave melee classes? If you take a general poll of all the Classes played in RVR you will see the balance has heavily swung to the Caster side of things. Give Melee classes more of a reason to stick it out to level 50 and do RVR please. <br>
<br>
Other Issues: <br>
<br>
- Different damage tables of Left Axe Spec line for Shadowblades and Berserkers. <br>
- More levels of Frenzy and/or more spice/flavor to this ability. <br>
- The way Reactive protects work in pve vs 1 on 1 vs group rvr. <br>
- Possiblity of adding Flurry to Berserker's ability as a light tank. <br>
- Lack of a role for a Berserker in keep defense. <br>
<br>
<br>

I've been advocating this and think it could prove particularly useful.  I would prefer to see Aurora Borealis converted into a side positional and dealing stun comparable to Annihilation.<br>
<br>
Also, the bleed on Icy Brilliance - it should be comparable to the nice little bleeds BM's and Mercs get.<br>
<br>
Also, Doublefrost.  Endurance consumption rate - reduceplzkthx.  I think Mythic should review its bonuses too in light of the significant damage reduction.  Perhaps a medium bonus to hit or a medium bonus to defense?<br>
<br>
Snow Blind.  If you want to know what I think about this style, take a look at Friar's boon, the Friar's taunt style.  Can we say - Friar'sBoon4thewin?<br>
<br>
Cosmetic Change #1:  eliminate dopey Vendo form and substitute it with the Fenrir model.<br>
<br>
Cosmetic Change #2:  style animations or a serious lack therof.  Is it too much to ask that we get 3 or 4 different animations.  I know this is small potatoes, but its not much to ask.<br>
<br>
Berserk:  defensive penalties????  I think not.  Not in light of what BM's got.  Also, how about changing the crit range from 1 - 99% to 30% to 70%.  Same average crit, but it eliminates the higher crits though gives us higher minimum crits.  Essentially, it gives us a more predictable damage flow.<br>
<br>
Shapeshifting:  Christ, would it be too much to ask that this do something for Berserkers?  Perhaps give us a self only run buff of some kind or some other kind of buff?  Shapeshifting is not Berserk.  They're supposed to be two different things.<br>
<br>
Charge:  for Heaven's sake, Sprint + 25% speed please.  Apply this obiviously to BM's, Savages and Mercs.  Incidentally, in exchange for a bump in speed, I'd also favor an increase in the timer from 5 minutes to 10 or 15.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this.  If our role is different now -  we're support melee instead of a primary tank - then give us the tools we need to support.  Currently, our styles are designed to enable us to tank as they assume we're the target, but we can't deal the damage we used to.  If we're supposed to support, then give us a side positional chain and give us pbaoe style chains similar to what Savages got  (hmmm, makes you wonder what class was really supposed to be the support melee class, doesn't it  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

<br>
- Mysthic defines light tank now as positional fighters but we only have one : a rear positinel our other good chain are on parry/esquive but they say we sould be in duo with a warrior so how can we easly do them?<br>
<br>
- as for the rage i wish i could keep my size ( I am a dawrf small size and i hate to become bigger than a troll) and as some as said crit for 30-70% and no defense penatly ( or a very light one of we want to keep the way zerker are in mythologie) it would makes every one hapy ( us with no more very low crits the enemi with no more 1k+ damage<br>
<br>
- the idea of the side positonal style a 50 which stun is good because it won't inpact shadowblade and it will alo be nice to protect the heal/caster <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ulak@lighttanksofdaoc>ulak</A> at: 6/12/03 1:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hordgalahad>Hord Galahad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#000000>(6/12/03 3:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hord's unofficial zerker tl report</span><hr size=1> to give you an example:<br>
<br>
Concerns <br>
<br>
Concerns stipulate a specific issue that is affecting the class. Each issue should be described in 150 words or less, and the first sentence in the description should contain the main theme. Logs, spell lists, damage tables, etc are supplemental information and should not be included in the report. The top 4 concerns should be listed in this section. <br>
<br>
Stuff like that. So you try to be precise on what you need in the report. a lot of the sections they are just asking for things within 10 words. seriously. They say if they want more info they will ask for it.<br>
<br>
SO you do what you can post up what you can and try to hit everything. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Frenzy all together needs an overhaul or better yet have more levels or definition to it. But it all depends on what they will let us do etc etc.<br>
<br>
There are tons of great ideas i have seen for frenzy over the last 1.5 years... They are all very similar. And yet nothing has been implemented. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Right now I want them to look at the differences between our abilities and other light tanks. First if they acknowledge that there should be a change go from there... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It has great potensial but its very clear that the community is unhappy with it in its current state.<br>
<br>
- Give us hard hitting positional styles that don't require us to have aggro in order to use them.  This will make us true light tanks.  Possibly bump up the damage for our rear style (since its now harder to execute) and give us a side style.<br>
<br>
- Without being able to spec in shield, LA is our only viable style line.  By no means should we be given a shield line.  However, variety would be nice.  Not a serious concern in light of other things, but worthy of mention <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hordgalahad>Hord Galahad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#000000>(6/12/03 9:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hord's unofficial zerker tl report</span><hr size=1> I've added in the fact about no side styles.
