Normally Tzlar was a stoic individual, not given to indulgence or hedonistic pursuits. But, the one thing he would allow himself was a satisfying meal. He enjoyed the fine wines and exotic delicacies that was the right of all nobles of the Empire. His brother, Zirrix, used to enjoy such things as well. But, with the departure of an old friend, Zirrix had swore to only drink the commoners brew of  Kalish. Tzlar however, equally saddened by the loss of such a friend and ally of House T’Rhennic, was not so dramatic a Teir’dal. He sat alone in the hall, as was his habit, for he did not like the presence of other people. Not in general, and certainly not while he enjoyed a quiet and relaxing meal. This evening, he started his dinner with an aperitif of Heady Kiola. Following that, he had a first course of spiced Raptor steak tidbits with warmed oyster sauce, accompanied by a chilled glass of light Gypsy wine. Next, he enjoyed a perfectly seasoned half portion of Canyer Nut Stuffed Trout, with a second glass of the same wine. The main course was a choice fillet of beer braised gator (because seafood was one of his personal favorites) accompanied by a goblet of full bodied Red Port. Desert was a whisper light Snow Griffon soufflé, the eggs for which he had gathered himself. To cleanse his palette, he choose a refreshing taste of Ginesh . Finishing his meal, he retired into his study, having a glass of Cabilis Green Death rum brought to him while he calculated and plotted the future, based on the now.<br>
<br>
Much had happened these last few days in Neriak, and plans had to be made. Tzlar, and his brother Zirrix, had been off in other parts of Norrath on Imperial matters and had not witnessed what had transpired. He was instantly summoned back to Neriak by his agents after the Queen’s assembly. It was not so much the summons that was urgent, but the way Tzlar had received it. He had been alerted by not just the servants of House T’Rhennic, but by other members of the Imperial Council, the representatives of the Tower of the Spurned, and his other agents…those not seen in the open. This convergence of interested factions told of the gravity of the situation. Neriak was always of the verge of civil war, held at bay only by the strength and authority of their Imperial Majesties, supported by the Nobility. It was an established fact that the Royal House’s power and legitimacy was rooted in the will and desires of the Dark Father Innoruuk himself. But now, there was the Dark Creator’s Daughter’s emergence and claim to power. A civil war between the beings of Norrath was one thing, a civil war between immortals was another matter entirely. Already, the purges and persecutions had begun throughout Neriak. Those who had spoken out against the Dark Creator in the past were now suspect, and open to public ridicule. The Clerics of the Spires and all “loyal” Teir’dal had begun to set the wheels in motion for a great cleansing of society. Against the “Old Guard” of Neriak, was arrayed all those who were irreligious or non committal to the matters of the soul. In between, there were those who would wait and see. House T’Rhennic was one of the oldest and most powerful in the Empire. It’s tradition of loyalty to the Royal House, and service to the Teir’dal was known even to the lightcrawlers. It was that reputation that was Tzlar’s dilemma. <br>
<br>
He knew where his brother Zirrix stood. The Second Born of their Line would follow their Imperial Majesties wherever they led. Even unto absolute destruction and doom, all in the name of the Empire. True, Zirrix did pay homage to the Great God of Battle Rallos Zek, but his soul belonged to Innoruuk. General Zirrix would led the forces of the Teir’dal Empire against any and all enemies, in this Plane of existence or any other, that the King and Queen so dictated. He was, if nothing else, a Warrior in service to his people. Tzlar though, was something else entirely. Tzlar’s life was steeped in the politics that Zirrix found so very disdainful. The First Born of House T’Rhennic had manipulated, exterminated, plotted and conspired his way to the leadership of the Imperial Council of Nobles. That was no easy feat, and it had been a costly and perilous journey, but the rewards of power and authority outweighed all other dangers. So now, Tzlar was confronted with three primary considerations, one of Empire, one of Race and one of House.<br>
<br>
Insofar as the Imperial considerations went, there was the question of his House’s obligation of loyalty to the Royal Line. Since they would follow Innoruuk, and not his “traitorous” Daughter, House T’Rhennic would be expected to support the Dark Creator. That would be no difficulty, Tzlar well knew both the rewards and punishments that the Dark Father could bestow. Yet, there was also the obligation of service to the Teir’dal. In this regard, the well being of his people must be a leader’s concern. As a Noble he had an obligation to protect and preserve the commoners well being. Thus, if the Daughter of Innoruuk could provide a better, more secure and powerful future for the Teir’dal, was not Tzlar bound to support her over her Father? Finally, there was (what was secretly the most important consideration to Tzlar, or any Teir’dal for that matter) the welfare of House T’Rhennic itself. Being a Wizard, Tzlar had the advantage of being amongst the most intelligent and resourceful of all beings on Norrath. His God was the God of Magic, Solusek Ro, and so he was not so given to the fanatic devotions of the Clerics of the Spires. Make no mistake, Tzlar was Teir’dal and knew the inherent greatness and superiority of his race above all others. He also knew it was a facet of the Teir’dal existence to weed out the weak, for only the strong to survive. The society of Neriak was the most powerful in Norrath, and the only one which deserved to exist. But, as Patron of his Line, did not Tzlar have an obligation to insure the survival and success of his own House above all? That was something his dear brother could not understand. All the spouting about honor and glory made a nice tale for telling at the tavern hearths, but did little to actually stop a rivals Assassins or troops from launching a covert attack. <br>
<br>
So, that was the current sociological situation and the surrounding problem. Tzlar knew that he would act to insure that his Line gained in power and strength and profited from whatever happened. Gods and Teir’dal, King and Country, Father and Daughter, they could all be swallowed up by the Rath, as long as House T’Rhennic continued in a position of authority. Now, it was a question of, as the Erudites say, “ Keeping as many books upon the shelves, without it collapsing from the weight”. Deep into the night did the War Wizard sit, think, and sip his rum. In the darkness his scarlet eyes glowed with a hideous sheen, narrowed in concentration, seeking to plot the best future path through the storm that was coming. A storm that would engulf his Empire, his God and his very own House. Such are the intertwined and dangerous threads, that make up the tapestry which is the Respected Race. “Yes”, thought Tzlar, it was good to be home again…      <br>
