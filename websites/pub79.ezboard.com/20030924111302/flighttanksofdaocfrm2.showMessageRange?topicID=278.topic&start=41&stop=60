<br>
Anyways, Temmie, I feel you're acceptance of your performance is due to your perspective of play. You see yourself perform to a reasonable level on your own terms. But once compared to how well others perform in situations that YOU are suppose to surpass everyone else in (chasing/killing casters and support, hurting but not reliably killing tanks), you'll notice that you'll fall a pretty large margin behind. When you RvR, try to imagine a another melee class in your place. If you know about a polearmsman or a reaver and how well they perform, I think you'll start to see us being left behind as a damage class, and you'll start to feel like we're not dragging our own weight.<br>
<br>
The difference between an anytime and no style is about 50 points worth of damage (with the slash line spec). However, thrust giving no real anytime, the difference can be subsequented with more oppertunitys to use your reactionary and positionals. Pretty sure you won't be missing out on your anytimes damage.<br>
<br>
The styles review should yeild some interesting information about us. We may not even need anything else besides improving our styles (I remember our growth rates are only slightly better than the growth rates of the styles in the slash line, and behind advanced spec lines like pole, two hand, flexible, ect. If we got better growth rate on all our styles, that could very well make us set offensivly). <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

<br>
Maybe i'm not exressing myself correctly. It's not real easy for me to put into words on how I feel our damage is..<br>
<br>
Trying my hardest here:<br>
<br>
Say a polearmsman performes up to a rank of 5 out of 10. This includes everything; RvR, PvE, Duels, ect.<br>
<br>
A mercenary ranks about a 3-4.5. There are just times where I do really really good, but when I do bad, I do really really bad. I can never seem to find some &quot;middle-grounds&quot; with the mercenary.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - i'm fully deticated to my mercenary and enjoy every moment i'v played with him. I'v even recently started doing duels and am have a real blast (i'm even using epic armor and glowy drops - other words, i'm not the best I can be). The thing is, most of my problems stem from just flat out not doing enough damage in situations that I am suppose to perform well in. the general feelings of all the events summed up is more like &quot;ok&quot; instead of &quot;good&quot;. I believe mythic wants it to be good, as do I.<br>
<br>
Again, I feel some more damage (not a whole lot - just a boost by whatever means) will shift it to being good. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

Anything else and I easily outstrip them for damage especially since they can't use a thrust weapon for that extra damage on mids (which is most of what we fight on excal it seems, hibs are much rarer). In addition to that reavers don't get tank RAs and that makes a BIG difference. No det is crippling for a tank and it takes them that much more to get IP which could be used for other things. While they have superior defense from the front they have none from sides/rear and while our all-round evade may not happen often it is something. Finally reavers have noticeabley less hp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Paladin instead of me? Think everyone knows well enough how much pally damage suffers, they struggle to get 1h dmg with a 2h weapon. Pallys are better off s/s guarding the clerics and the sorc.<br>
<br>
That leaves arms and the only way they get more dmg out is with a much slower 2h weapon (pole or 2h). Even then while their dmg per hit may be higher it rapidly evens out (in my experiance ofc). Slower weapons make it harder to proc PF and they're much more suseptable to missing, bt, guard and all that. I rarely, if ever, see my attacks blocked by a guard due to the penalty assosiated with blocking dual-wielders. Also missing one of my attacks means very little to me most of the time, I'll swing again soon especially since I take haste charges with me since I rarely run with a theurg. Arms do, however, have better hp and defense and make a great assist partner for a merc. <p>~Temos Shadowsoul~<br>

I'd have to see a lot more than that to believe that Armsmen get a 50% increase with LW. Believe me if Armsmen got a 50% bonus on double speccing they wouldn't be retiring right and left ... which they are. A pure pole spec if virtually an endangered species.<br>
<br>
If you believe it then I assume you're thrilled with the performance of your Armsman and I'm happy for you. Personally I don't.<br>
<br>
I repeat what the grab bag said:<br>
<br>
Q: A lot of people say Midgard twohanded does ~+15% damage bonus vs. onehanded, and in Hibernia and Albion (as they have special speccs) twohanded does ~+40% damage bonus vs onehanded. I'm talking about style damage. Is that quite correct?<br>
<br>
A: Just as a side note, be very afraid of things that &quot;a lot of people&quot; say. For some reason unknown to mortal man, &quot;a lot of people&quot; tend to be either wrong, or not very many people after all. <br>
<br>
But that's not the answer to your question! The answer according to the swell guy who looked it up is &quot;All two handed weapons get a base 10% damage bonus, plus an extra amount based on their specialization level.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;mutters about her lack of willpower in discussing this tired old subject&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;sighs heavily&gt; Look a pole (as you I'm sure are aware) has an extremely large variance even with that rare animal a 50/50 spec. This brings down the average damage pretty dramatically and it's why you have to look at several hundred hits to get anything like a meaningful statistic.<br>
<br>
But as I said if you believe that you get that kind of bonus I suggest going out and playing your Armsman. You must be one happy camper.<br>

Some guys feel our damage is ok while others feel its way too low.<br>
Off the top of my head I think this might be due to which particular server you play on?<br>
Anyway... this isnt my point.<br>
My point is that as a Merc I personally feel I lack a group enhancement.<br>
I could list all the classes in Alb and their skills but you guys already know that stuff.<br>
I personally think that as a class we dont bring ANYTHING benificial to a group.<br>
Our damage output is &quot;equalled&quot; by armsmen who have the benifit of wearing plate armour. They run outa endurance but we can get a Paladin to compensate for that... Reaver quite handy cos they can keep the stealthers off the casters. And their damage aint too shaby either. Friars good too cos they can heal at a push and some of their buffs really are good. Minstral.. well thats a given.... run buffs and a bit of CC if the casters get swamped, plus mana regen...<br>
My point is what do Mercs bring to the party? Even our assigned role of being caster killers falls by the wayside when our &quot;special ability&quot; of Dirty Tricks doesnt work on casters. And everyone seems to have a PBAOE caster with them these days.<br>
I could take on enemy tanks but then again Mythic has informed me I shouldnt win against them.<br>
Can anyone tell me what roll im supposed to play in an RvR group? Why should groups WANT me? In large scale RvR lag and slowdown is so bad I can barely get my positional styles off.<br>

<br>
Mercs weren't intended to bring group enhancement. A tanks job is to hit stuff ... pure and simple and stay alive long enough to do some damage. If you're not doing that maybe you need to take a look at your resists, RAs, weapons, etcs.<br>

Do you really think all meleers, and those who choose that life should just be shields for the real damage dealers, who say they don't do good damage? We should act as obsticles in the path of our enemies true opponents (if we even do that)? Or were you just stating that that is how it currently is?<br>
<br>
It is true, though. Any meleer will tell you their true role in any RvR encounter is to take the hits while the caster does the damage. The problem is, every meleer is like that, no matter what (some are better than others of course). There's no way to tell an opponent to hit the tank and not the caster. Simply put, no single melee class can truely put the hurt on anyone. <br>
<br>
Well, there are stealthers..<br>
<br>
&quot;Can anyone tell me what roll im supposed to play in an RvR group?&quot;<br>
<br>
You're an extra pair of hands. Meaning, you arn't the primary damage dealer or Primary tank. You are a damage add for the polearmsman, or equally slow swinging tank that can't get past bladeturn. In most cases, you only compliment anothers skills. Some cases, you are actually needed, like the polearmsman who cannot take the time to switch between a pole and a quicker one hander. Not what you invisioned, I bet, but that's what mythic is telling us and the only way we are of any use.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why should groups WANT me?&quot;<br>
<br>
For the same reason they will want an armsman, paladin or reaver. You have the possibility to attract an enemys attention while the casters do the damage. You also have the oppertunity to interupt other casters that arn't high RR (aka, don't have MoC). You're also the clean up boy once most of the fighting is done and the rest are retreating, since casters go through mana real quickly, they don't want to waste time with the last few survivers.<br>
<br>
&quot;A wise man once said something about adapting or deleting....<br>
I ask you... adapt to what?&quot;<br>
<br>
To being a breathing damage add, is the only awnser I can really come up with. In the whole lump some scene in RvR, we are not special. We are expendable.<br>
<br>
We do have our place in PvE though. Amazing what you can do when you have control over a situation. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

There are the odd groups of high RR casters that get the jump with mezz, run in and 3 of them coordinated manabomb entire groups in seconds. But that's rare.<br>
<br>
It's mostly tank groups butchering casters/healers then each other.<br>
<br>
My job as a merc is to either: tie up the enemy healers/casters and kill them (with an assisting polearmer or scout usually) <br>
<br>
or play defensive: Snare the incoming tanks (with prevent flight usually - or my 23 shield but that's not normal for mercs) <br>
<br>
Mercs are far from useless on the battlefield. What we do need is a good group though (much like armsmen, Warriors, heros, zerkers nowadays, blademasters) - of all the classes, pure tanks gain by far the most from buffs, chants etc.<br>
<br>
A paladin only has as much as he brings to the battlefield - add a nother paladin you get two people doing substandard damage, add a merc or an armsman you get one person doing substandard damage another doing superb damage. <p>Fingoniel MacAlpine<br>

<br>
Where the heck did I say that? &lt;looks really confused&gt;<br>
<br>
In fact what I said was just the opposite. (or that's what I meant. But I was also saying that everyone has whines.) Go to the VN caster or Dev boards and read the huge whines from casters about how they are owned by melee then tell me that melee only stand around being a meatshield for casters who do all the damage. A group with several good melee in it and good support can do terrific damage. <br>
<br>
Listen I played an Armswoman for a LONG time and I know that they aren't better tanks than Mercs. (I got mad enough to delete a RR5 Armswoman a few months ago as a message to Mythic) I don't have any patience left with Mercs whining about how Armsmen are better. It just plain isn't true. Mercs have a lot more to work with than Armsmen ever have.<br>
<br>
I think that Merc damage could use a minor tweak but anything more than that would actually overpower the class. You go watch Mercs like Tormond or Qadim on Percy and tell me that Mercs can't do well. I honestly think that Mercs who aren't able to get kills need to look to see if they're in a good group, if they have the right RAs, the right equipment, etc. because there's nothing major wrong with the class.<br>
<br>
I disagree that you only interrupt while the caster does the damage. If you can't kill the bugger yourself or with another melee assisting there's something wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, what Fingoniel said. <br>
<br>

<br>
Never, ever, have I ever said the words &quot;Tanks are useless&quot;. I may have come off sounding like they are, but anyone who has played the merc knows that we are doing something, which in the end does amount to something.<br>
<br>
My problem is we are suppose to be a mobile damage add. Yes, you are a moving damage add. You even said so.<br>
<br>
&quot;My job as a merc is to either: tie up the enemy healers/casters and kill them (with an assisting polearmer or scout usually) <br>
<br>
or play defensive: Snare the incoming tanks (with prevent flight usually - or my 23 shield but that's not normal for mercs)&quot;<br>
<br>
Here. Any other class could replace us. A reaver could get PF and do that, heck he'll probably kill the guy with his behind style!<br>
<br>
We don't do great damage unless someone else is &quot;holding aggro&quot;. Even then, it's not all that much better. We arn't suppose to be hit, yet mythic gives us no way to force an opponent onto who we want (in mythics eyes, that would be the armsman). Originally, we were suppose to be the damaging melee class of albion, but we had to move directions into the armsman's damage add. Why? I really don't know. Maybe they don't want another zerker outbreak.<br>
<br>
Let me state this, so that everyone would stop thinking along the lines of &quot;He doesn't like something about the merc, so thinks they are gimped&quot;. A MERCENARY HAS A PLACE. That place is not special, and can be done with anyone else (and, quite possibly, perform better), BUT HE ISN'T COMPLETLY USELESS. He just does not perform in his designated area as well as others do theirs. Or to a aceptable level, in my eyes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You guys don't seem to be reading my posts correctly.

Tanks ALWAYS do better assisting whether it's Mercs, Armsmen or the hybrids. Running off to solo is a losing proposition. This isn't a situation that's unique to Mercs or means that they perform less well than other tanks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any other class could replace us. A reaver could get PF and do that&quot;<br>
<br>
To some degree all tanks are interchangeable. We all go up, gang up on something and try to hack it to death. In DAOC that's just the way melee works and when done right it works damn well.<br>

You claim that a Merc's role can be filled by any tank, I say bullshit, the only one that can come close (as they also get the same cheap RAs) is a S/S armsman, and they don't dish out damage like we do, so it's not exactly the same role.   <p>Nirala Kindred<br>

<br>
The sample size is several hundred. What I posted was just a small sample to prove that it does. If I go to previous logs over the past year, I can probably get you a few thousand lines more.<br>
<br>
This is not something new, most people know it. Don't see why you don't want to admit it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Believe me if Armsmen got a 50% bonus on double speccing they wouldn't be retiring right and left ... which they are. A pure pole spec if virtually an endangered species.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's not because of double speccing. It's simply for wielding a weapon with 2Hands in all realms. You do 45-55% more damage at 50+ spec.<br>
<br>
I don't agree that armsmen are endangered, that's your personal view probably based on VN not actual. And btw my pole-armsmen is full pole 50/50/30p/9s and you'd be surprised but the so called hybrid spec isn't that popular in game (it's more of a VN thing, many high RR armsmen go full pole or 50/40/39parry).<br>
<br>
The problem with armsmen is with double speccing they get very little in return (ie: def.rage/revenge). And I explained double-speccing and how it works on VN long before the current batch of VN whiners finally understood and some still don't but they will whine for any reason even one they half-understand. <br>
<br>
Mercs are not that much different than armsmen except they do slightly less damage in fights but they offer other benefits (dirty tricks being the main one and charge and suffer less from BT).  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A> at: 7/31/03 9:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nirala>Nirala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dork of the Month~!</span><br>  Posts: 593<br> <font color=#000000>(7/31/03 9:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Merc damage</span><hr size=1> Eh, Vas is correct here, the Grab Bag report of Base 10% damage is for classes that can spec 2H weapons (i.e. Shammy or Healer can USE 2H weapons, but don't get the base damage boost).
