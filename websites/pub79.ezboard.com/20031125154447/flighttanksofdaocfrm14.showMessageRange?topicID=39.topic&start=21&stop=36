<br>
It's the type of post where you need to INCLUDE other classes to make it so your fair and biased and not to whine and to be polite. <br>
<br>
<br>
Before I go into some of my suggestions I want to go into some of the statements out there that are either confusing, not defined or just plain not true. <br>
<br>
1) The definition of a light tank (regardless of realm) is to produce more Offensive damage then that realm's main tank, with the disadvantage of having less defense then that realm's main tank. <br>
<br>
Now currently (pre 1.62) this does not hold true for Mercs/BM's. and then after the reduction to LA damage output it does not Hold true for all 3 classes (mercs/bms/zerkers) <br>
<br>
2. Zerkers still win more often then not when fighting a main tank. This is simply not true. There have been tons of logs/tests on vn pendragon and vn viking boards that proves this does not hold true. <br>
<br>
3. Zerkers can 2 shot tanks all the time. I have not yet to date seen any proof of this is a controlled environment that shows the data that it was a legit fight and not something that was faked where the person had no armor on sitting down and the person was hit from behind. Screenshots can be easily produced to show such results. Now in the same breath it may happen in a very rare possibility type of form because anything is possible if you hit all the right combinations. But to say this is the norm is not true. <br>
<br>
4. Zerkers Own the Battlefield. Now when i read this i did smile at it... not in a pride sort of way but more as a joke. It's fairly safe to say no tank (light or heavy) own the battlefield. Casters do. they have the ability to lay down the nuke power that just levels out groups of tanks that have to cross the range they hold. Now it is true that if we do get into range of them we will surely kill them. But that's the balance of the game, melee range vs caster range. but zerkers do not own the battlefield. <br>
<br>
5. RVR should be balance realm vs realm not class vs class or 1 on 1. RVR is not fought 1 on 1 in nice control environments. the whole realm can effect how much damage you output onto someone else. there are way to many variables to say that a growth rate is the only thing that says LA is overpowered. <br>
<br>
6. The problem was stated that LA + End regen was the problem. thus saying there was no problem with the 2 separate. So why are both being adjusted so harshly? Does this not penalize the players that do not have a buffing partner around all the time or when they are just plain solo or when their buffer dies? I'm confused on how both are to be adjusted when separate they are fine? <br>
<br>
7. The fixing of the Block/Parry bug. Now that this is fixed does that not mean that players will have more opportunity to block/parry attacks thus making it harder to get hit. How can a reduction to a style line be put in the same time more defensive abilities are put in? Thus saying are you sure you need to reduce the amount we are hitting for by so much if people can defend better now...? <br>
<br>
8. Shadowblades and Zerkers both use the LA style line. making changes can hurt both classes in different ways. I'm sure by now that the technology is there to make changes to one class and not effect the other? Thus saying the SB's are getting hit hard since they can not fully spec through out 5 spec lines were as Zerkers have 3. <br>
<br>
<br>
Suggested fixes: <br>
<br>
<br>
1) 10-15% reduction to LA from pre-1.62. Currently in 1.62 there is a 30-40% reduction in damage output. This is simply to harsh to fast. Plus the problem that was stated was when End regen was combined with LA. If both are to be reduced please reconsider how much they are being reduced when combined vs when not combined. the effects are vastly different. <br>
<br>
2) Merc/BM lines should be buffed up to equivalent damage of the 10-15% reduction LA, but LA should have a slight damage advantage. I believe Mythic has stated in the past that LA was a slightly more deadly line style then it's sister classes. <br>
<br>
3. All light tanks should have more Offensive damage output then their realms main tanks, but have less Defensive output then their realms main tanks. (as per the class description which is now not true for all realm's light tanks) adjust number 1 and 2 accordingly to actually make this description work. <br>
<br>
4. Frenzy should have the negatives removed from it since now all light tanks abilities are on a 7 minute time with just positive effects (on merc/bm's) with no negatives. other suggestions would be make Frenzy immune to spell crits while in frenzy but keep the negatives. A change to this ability would be a welcome change. <br>
<br>
5. Level 50 LA style should be reversed back to work off an opponent's Parry... we never asked for a 3rd chain or a dd.. this was an unwanted change. Seeing how Parry/block have been fixed. If this can be reverse it will be greatly appreciated. <br>
<br>
6. Make different Line styles for both SB's and Zerkers. It is obvious the technology is there. No need to reduction both classes because they use the same style lines. <br>

<br>
Light Tank Offense vs. Defense:<br>
<br>
I think you make some fair points, but I think Zerker defense is where it should be.  Shields make a huge difference (and will be even more powerful once 1.62 is implemented).  Many main tanks opt to spec offensively forgoing the defensive route offered by a high Shield spec.  When they do that, then arguably, their defensive skills are not as great as a Berserker's (Evade 3, studded and solid Parry vs. Evade 1, solid Parry and chain), but that's not really our problem.  That's a choice they've made.  I think this is less true of Mercs and Shieldmasters and perhaps a downward adjustment should be made defensively with respect to those classes (though only if their is an offensive upgrade to those classes).<br>
<br>
Aurora Borealis:<br>
<br>
I agree that it should not sit at the end of a 3 style chain, but I would prefer to see it serve as a side positional style.  I would also like to see the bleed on Snowsquall significantly enhanced (I actually believe all style bleeds should be increased) to something like 25 - 20 - 15 - 10 - 5.<br>

<br>
Not sure where Zerkers asking for shields is a viable answer. personally I don't really want the shield. I love dual wield. I like the concept of it. <br>
<br>
What would be a great thing to have from mythic is to determine how they separate Offensive vs Defensive output.<br>
<br>
As in DO they mean just your Armor and your ability to spec in certain lines and what natural abilities you have as a defensive output or do they mean just a portion of that... Hard to say.<br>
<br>
I think we can all agree on Offensive is basically your damage output. At least that's the way it seems to me. As in the only thing most care about is how hard you hit for.<br>
<br>
But then again Not sure if Mythic's reasoning for Merc/BM damage output to be so small when compared to a Zerker was because of there ability to have more defensive ouput. Who knows? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Either way it stands the light tanks simply do not meet their class description, i.e less offensive output then their realm's main tanks. I think that is our main point. Prior to this Patch yes Zerkers were meeting that description but the others were not. Now all 3 classes are in the toilet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for defense. Not sure how Mythic ranks things... But i think Parry and Blocking is higher on the scale then evade 3? Not sure. That would be a NICE list to have... that way you could go through it and say ok he has this this and this.. check the chart each having a ranking take the avg and compare it to something else. kinda get what i mean?<br>
<br>
then again have studded armor which is viable to the most used type of damage in the game is a negative to defense... at least i would think so.<br>
<br>
Either way I thought zerkers were balance both ways. Can they toned down a bit... I can except 10-15 and raise other light tanks. I mean how long have we been asking for that?<br>
<br>
As it stands now if 1.62 goes live people will stop playing Zerkers and SBs... they will roll up savages or just not play. Warrior might become a bit more viable but people will see the damage output of a savage and roll that. I know I would.<br>
<br>
Oh the other thing I would love to comment on. People thing respecing a zerker to a 2H is a viable solution... it's not. If you want a 2H play a warrior or savage. they are WAY better suited for that then a zerker. I think it's a waste of time to respec something like 50 axe 50 parry or 50 axe 50 hammer. Your just going to gimp yourself more and if they every make any more changes to LA your be kicking yourself. The point of the class was to go dual weild... not 2H.<br>
<br>
blah blah ok enough already hord lol.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah i appreciate the comments... helps a ton to figure out where to go next <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Especially for those rare occasions you were wandering around solo and actually found another solo melee to but heads with.  In its current incarnation, I see no reason to get 50 left axe, the style is even less useful then before and the changes in cap damage I'm sure are going to be much less where a 50 axe for better weaponskill will be much more advantagous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hordgalahad>Hord Galahad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#000000>(5/29/03 11:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What I think the priorities should be for our TL</span><hr size=1> i know the difference in damage of a pure 50 vs 44 with + is different... not sure how much but if you plan on using LA after the 1.62 patch your goign to be gimping your damage even more.<br>

<br>
You love the concept of dual-wielding, that's great. So do we all, and we know that speccing in shield not only means being inferior to a Warrior/Hero/Armsman/Paladin/Reaver but it also means wasting offensive spec points and there's the hotkey shield issue meaning dual-wielding calsses can't effectively swap shields and offhand weapons easily (at all).<br>
<br>
So most mercs/BMs don't spec shield. Maybe they spec 7 in Shield for the first Guard or something to do during a keep siege, but thats hardly a boon to the calss. I know one dude specced 23 Shield, but I'm sure he knew what he was doing. I personally wouldn't ever do that. The reason people spec shield is for the anytime stun- at spec 42.<br>
<br>
Whereupon they pull out their pole/CS/2H, or just keep chanting and hitting. Dual Wielding classes don't spec 42 shield because that means being a complete gimp with inferior armour, shield and no damage improvement really after the slam has taken effect.<br>
<br>
Saying Mercenaries and Blademasters need a defensive tone-down and that berzerkers need a tone-up is not, in my mind, logical.<br>
<br>
If you're not asking for shield spec, why not have it anyway. Instead of asking for something else.<br>
<br>
On the armour issue, yeah most Albion tanks go Slash, and will get a bonus against you. And BladeMasters wear Studded and are slash-resistant, and mercenaries wear Midgard-chain except not slash-resistant, without being able to use Shield Slam AND hit for 140% base damage when the opponent is stunned.<br>
<br>
Bringing shield and armour type into the light tank equation gives you a mess. Either ask for it, or don't ask for it, but don't say we've got medium shield option and so we're superior.<br>
<br>
You're more than welcome to ask for Flurry, too.<br>
<br>
My apoligies if this post sounds a bit rude, but your thoughts on potantial defense versus offensive damage output just seemed bad.<br>

left axe = style damage<br>
<br>
At least thats what I remember. I think.. a bit rusting on some things.<br>
<br>
So yes lowering either of them does lower your damage output but even more in Left axe... why because the growth rate is what you take advantage of to give you that boost to your over all damage that is produced from style bonus. Since the growth rate is far less and then you lessen how much of that growth rate you get... the difference from your pre 1.62 damage and your new 1.62 damage is far greater.<br>
<br>
If i had to choose from the 2 i would lessen axe first.<br>
<br>
But then again I think the 50 50 28 spec is perfectly fine. Then again i have +15 to my skills and mastery of parry 1 that gives me pretty damn close to a 50 in parry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
As for the shield spec in the BM line. I have no clue why mythic gave that to you guys. I don't know their reasoning behind it. Obviously they must know of some spec that no-one has ever come across. <br>
<br>
As for armor I'm pretty sure studded isn't slash resistant... It's vulnerable to slash. Chain is vulnerable to thrust. I'd have to say 75% of every opponent out there uses Slash. it's the most used damage type in the game. So wearing armor that is medium range and then vulnerable to the most used damage type in the game is a huge negative to defense. It means your going to get hit more and harder.<br>
<br>
As for the special abilities of each class. Hey I like them being different. Do they need tweaked yeah... Bm/Mercs got some tweaks now they are on a 7 minute timer with positive effects and no negatives. Is it the best solution over all for your class, I have no idea i've never played a Merc/Bm do i think it's a good step in the right direction Yes... is it enough no.<br>

<br>
Doing the same test.. keeping left axe at 50, and dropping axe down to 34... put the damage all over the place with an average loss of close to 100pts of damage.   Your weapon skill effects the average damage...  left axe skill effects the cap.  The amount cap increases per spec in left axe dramatically reduces after 50.   So with +15 to left axe; I could just as well drop it to 35 and still end up with 50 left axe.   Having a 50 axe means I'd be hitting for cap damage more often.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Also 28 parry + 15 = 43 parry.. even with mastery of parry 1 you're still only sitting on a 44 or 45 parry.   Vs. Mastery of Parry 1 with 37 parry + 15 = 53 or 54 parry.   Neither helps a whole lot vs. the pure tanks (heavy and light) who spec to upper 40s in there weapon but vs. hybrids who spec to 44 or lower... having a parry skill above there weapon spec means a whole lot of parry going on.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hordgalahad>Hord Galahad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#000000>(5/30/03 11:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: defensive issues</span><hr size=1> Yeah but having a natural 50 in left axe is still a bit better per hit and over time it adds up.

<br>
I thought parry stopped at 50, as in you gain no benifit after 50...then again not sure considering you gain some from going over 50 in axe and left axe. it may be small. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
