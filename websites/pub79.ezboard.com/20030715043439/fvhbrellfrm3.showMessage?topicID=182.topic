<br>
&quot;Your first lesson street rat, will be to learn to shelve your anger and redirect it into battle.&quot; His words simply stirred her to anger. So smug was this Knight Khel. So sure of himself. By Innoruuk, if he called her street rat once more, she'd run this rusty sword he'd place in her hand through his back the moment he turned it!<br>
But he simply smiled and stepped towards her. The whip he weilded hissed softly as he set it to dancing about his feet. &quot;Lift it.. &quot; the command short and Feral did her best to lift the rusted bastard sword. Strain though she might she could not bring even the tip off the ground. Muscles screamed in protest and her arms trembled as she worked. <br>
A snap of sound and the searing pain had her not only dropping the hilt of the sword but leaping forward and turning to face the attack.<br>
He'd hit her from behind! She glared at him. Feeling the rage only building. What manner of training was this? She wanted to scream at him but held her tongue. Her eyes narrowing even as the pain subsided to a dull throb. She fought to bring her temper in check, as she felt the warm trickle of blood through the now torn tunic. &quot;Lift it.. &quot; Again he ordered.<br>
Growling softly she stomped forward and bent to lift the swords hilt. Tensing as she knew now what would come she again strained against the wieght.<br>
Again the snap, followed by pain. Only this time she was ready and did'nt drop the sword. But instead concentrated on her efforts. Tuning out the hissing sound of the snake about to strike. Each lash driving her anger further, fanning the flames. <br>
With eyes nearly clenched shut. Sweat running from her brow in effort the child slowly began to raise the sword. The rage in her built to a fury she'd never experianced before. The rage diminishing the burning ache of what she knew would be marks she'd bare for life. <br>
For a time she stood there, her arms trembling in protest. Sheer stubborness kept her from dropping the cumbersome sword. It took a few moments to realize the hiss had subsided. Slowly she opened her eyes to realize that she had indeed lifted the sword finaly. <br>
Unable to hold it any longer it fell once more at her feet. Stiffly she turned to face him. Once more the pain began to over take the rage as she began to calm. Her eyes met his defiantly. &quot;You've a funny way of teaching someone.&quot; was her only comment. <br>
His brow arched at her words as he coiled the whip up. &quot;What have you learned?&quot; he asked softly. <br>
&quot;Other than the fact that I'd be a fool to turn my back to you?&quot; She smirked then. She'd be damned if she even let on to the pain she was now feeling. Her pride would'nt allow it. &quot;Ive learned that used properly anger can add strength to one, and numb them to pain of battle.&quot; <br>
At her words He nodded. &quot;Your done for today. You may go.&quot; He shrugged then and turned away. Dismissing her as though she where not but a hindrance to him. <br>
For a moment the young girl contemplated lifting that sword once more, just long enough to ram it through his back! Wisdom prevailed though. She knew that she did'nt have a chance in succeeding. His reflexes and instinct far outmatched hers. She also knew instinctively that there was much she could learn from him. If she survived his lessons. And by the gods, she would survive if only to one day turn his teachings upon him. <br>
Stiffly Feral turned away from him. Moving towards the hall and the small room, no bigger than a closet, that she called her own. Entering it she paused at the threshold for but a moment before closing the door. Only then did she allow herself to let go of her control. Falling to her knees she bit deeply into her lip to keep any sounds from escaping as she fought the tidal waves of searing fire that washed over her back. One day, he'd pay for every mark, bruise or scar. <br>
But not today... <br>
<br>
Feral snapped from the thoughts of the past. Not even a wince gave away the amount of pain involved in binding the various wounds the Bird man had inflicted upon her before it had finally fallen to her sword. For a brief moment she was grateful to the teachings of her long dead mentor.... <br>

She glanced breifly to it before once more meeting Knight Khel's gaze. &quot;You'll carry that.&quot; He instructed as he turned his back to her and began making his way up the trail. <br>
Struggling young Feral hefted the bulky pack to her still searing back and settled it into place. Biting back a groan as she felt the straps of it bite into her shoulders. With sheer stubborness she willed her legs to move as she took up a plodding pace behind him. Several feet behind him. And so it went for nearly 16 hours. They traveled relentlessly through Nektulos forest, then into the hills of east commons. <br>
Sweat burned her eyes as she trudged relentlessly behind him. She'd be damned if she'd beg for a break. Temper simmered into pure unadultered hatred and with it came the much needed strenght she would need to continue the journey. <br>
By night fall she moved in auto. Her muscles long since numbed to the pain. Her mind dazed in fatigue. So immersed in her own thoughts that it was'nt until she slammed into his back with a resounding thud that sent her falling to her backside that she realized he had finally stopped. &quot;We'll make camp here. Set that down and gather fire wood.&quot; <br>
Feral shot a glare at him as she let the pack fall to the ground and spun about. Vowing to one day make him pay. She set off to gather fire wood. She knew as sure as the sun would rise in but a few hours, that her muscles would soon be screaming in agony.... <br>
<br>
Again Feral snapped from her thoughts.. bringing herself back to the present and the relentlessly long swim that would take her to Rathe Mountains. She would have to cross those to the deep dank forest of Ferrott. From there she would travel through to Innothule swamp and then finally South Ro. A few days worth of steady travel would see her once more home. Odd that it was at these times of trials that she found herself actually grateful for the grueling training Knight Khel had placed on her. Stiffining her will she again spurred herself on. Forcing more effort into each stroke that dragged her through the chilled waters of Lake Rathe...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/upayle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>payle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiller</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/20/01 12:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=182.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Redirection</span><hr size=1> Sorry we still haven't met in game yet.
