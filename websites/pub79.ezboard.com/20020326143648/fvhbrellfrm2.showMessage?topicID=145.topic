He'd been snoozing and was lucky not to have been caught.  Quickly he composed himself and pulled the heavy door open only to find a frightened urchin standing there with a folded bit of parchment.  As soon as the boy handed the envelope to the slave he turned and fled.<br><br>Here is what the note said:<br><br>&quot;Um... Hullo.  You know, Mister Khasirath, youre not an easy person to get ahold of!  The nice elves who guard the gate to the city seem to think that Im mean or something cause they wont let me in so I had to give some money to a little kid I saw outside in the forest to take you this note! Its very rude of the guards you know, I thought you told them to be nice to me!<br><br>But anyways I wanted to tell you something sad that happened to me. When I went home to Kelethin Hartwood Master said that i was very bad for going to Neridark...er... Neriak or however you spell your city's name and he said that if I didnt say that you are bad and mean that he would have to ask me to leave cause he didnt want me to be telling fibs to the other students.  They look up to me cause I travel and Im all growed up!  But I wouldnt tell him that youre mean cause I think youre nice and you never yell at me or call me a kid or say I cant do stuff so he said that I had to leave his school.<br><br>Now I dont have anywhere to go cause I lived at the school and no one will let me live with them cause they say that I might have spells from Innoruuk on me but I know I dont cause you wouldnt cast no bad spells on me. Anyways I wanted to know if I can be in your family now since I dont have one. You wanted to teach me all about Innoruuk and I still havent gotten to tell you stories about Tunare and stuff and I liked your city cause of all the pretty lights and everyone in Violen Harpists was real nice to me especially you and Miss Faeolin and even Mister Xareth after you told him he wasnt allowed to eat me for dinner or nothin so can I come and be a Violen Harpist too? I can work real hard and I wanna learn all about Neridark and everyone and stuff. Please please please?<br><br>Um, like I said before I cant come in right now cause they are all watchin' the gate real close and they dont like me even though I never did anything to them and Im always real nice but I guess they think Im bad or a thief or something but Im not and Id never steal from you cause youre my bestest friend Mister Khasirath!  So if you wanna come talk to me I guess I'll be out in the forest cause I like it here its nice and peaceful.<br><br>But all this writing is making me sleepy and Im running outta ink and paper anyways so I hope I'll see you soon.  Okie bye-byes!<br><br>Your Friend,<br><br>Olassen Moonbreeze<br><br><br>At the bottom of the letter was a small drawing of a very happy looking dark elf with a big white goatee and a scribble of a wood elf girl holding out a flower for him.<br><br><br><br> <p>Olassen Moonbreeze<BR>The "All Growed Up!"

He scowled as he saw the timid man dressed in rags slink into the offices. Normally the slaves wore crisp livery, but this one was already being punished for his slovenliness by having to wear rags. The Reaper noticed the furitive way he rubbed at his eyes as he approached the desk with a letter.<br><br>&quot;Place it there, and get on your knees, boy.&quot;<br><br>Almost shivering with dread the slave complied, carefully laying the letter on a stack at the center of the Reaper's neat desk. Then he stepped back to the middle of the office and dropped to his knees, bowing his head and squeezing his eyes tight shut.<br><br>Khasirath walked around the desk and grabbed a long thin birch rod that leaned against the wall next to the door. With his eyes narrowed with smouldering hatred he whipped the slave's back, the rags little protection from the oiled cane.<br><br>Fifteen lashes left fifteen lurid welts across the slave's back and shoulders, and he whimpered softly, biting into his own arm to keep from crying out and drawing greater fury.<br><br>As Khasirath set the cane back beside the door the slave whimpered, &quot;Thank ye, m'lord. I beg your forgiveness, m'lord.&quot;<br><br>The Reaper grabbed the scruff if the slave's neck and dragged him to his feet, &quot;Remember this well the next time ye dare to even think of sleeping when ye are on duty. Now report to the overseer and inform him that ye are to be set to labor befitting your failure for the remainder of the day, under my order.&quot;<br><br>Khasirath pushed the slave out the door and closed it behind him, then sat down at his desk again to read this new letter.<br><br>As he read over the three pages of small flowery script a slight smile came to his face. As he saw the drawing on the last page he chuckled softly.<br><br>&quot;It has been some time, hasn't it, Olassen?&quot; he said quietly in the empty office.<br><br>He tucked the pages back in their envelope, and slid it into a pouch at his waist. Then he stood and picked up his walking cloak, pinning it around his shoulders with the adamantite sigil of the Harvest.<br><br>Thinking for a moment he stepped back to his desk, and pulled a handful of blank papers and an extra vial of violet ink from a drawer. Folding the papers carefully he slipped them into his pouch too.<br><br>Walking out to his assistant's room he nodded to the young Teir'Dal. &quot;I must go out to the forest for a time. I should return in an hour or two. Should anyone call on me, have them return later.&quot;<br> <p><center><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.violentharvest.com/sigs/Khas2_Sig.jpg" alt="Visit the Grange" border="1"></a><br>AIM: FractalCodec / <a href="mailto:fractalcodec@aol.com">fractalcodec@aol.com</a> / ICQ: 100550299 / <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33709" target="_blank">Profile</a><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uolassenmoonbreeze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Olassen Moonbreeze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/02 4:21:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Mister Khasirath...!</span><hr size=1> In the quiet dusk of the forest the child crept along the fallen log as quietly as she could. One foot then the other; toe, heel, toe, heel. After several nearly silent steps she lowered her hands to the grass and stalked forward like a giant hairless cat. And like a cat, she pounced suddenly, her hands swiping at something. The inexperianced huntress put too much energy into her leap and rolled head over heels a few feet down the embankment.<br><br>When she came to a stop she sat up and giggled, grinning at the small green snake she'd caught. In return the snake simply stared at her with small black eyes, flicking its tongue out into the evening air. She giggled again then stood, brushing the twigs and grass from her hair and leather tunic and pants.<br><br>&quot;That was quite a leap,&quot; chuckled a voice behind her.<br><br>Olassen turned on the speaker with large brown eyes, her face widening into a grin as she recognised him.<br><br>&quot;Mister Khasirath!&quot;<br><br>Olassen dropped the snake, carefully, and skipped over to the shadowknight. She bounced up to him and threw her hands around his neck giving him an emense hug. She turned to him and kissed his cheek then tickled his beard and giggled.<br><br>After a moment, Khasirath managed to extract himself from the child's grasp and set her on the ground a pace away. He chuckled softly to himself as he looked down at the young wilder elf.<br><br>&quot;You look well, Olassen,&quot; he smiled.<br><br>The druid nodded and, noticing a twig in her hair as she did, went back to removing the evidence of her tumble down the hill.<br><br>&quot;Didja get my letter, Mister Khasirath?&quot; she chimed while trying to untangle a particularly well caught thissle from her ponytail.<br><br>Still chuckling, the Tier'Dal nodded. <br><br>&quot;Aye, it is because of you letter that I came to speak with you this eve.&quot; he motioned to the log as he himself took a seat. &quot;Come, we must talk...&quot; <p>Olassen Moonbreeze<BR>The "All Growed Up!"
