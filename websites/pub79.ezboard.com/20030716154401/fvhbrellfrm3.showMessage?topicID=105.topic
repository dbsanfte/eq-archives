The Young Prophet and The Dragons, Part 1 (*RP*)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
*ooc* Ok, here's Part 1 of Prav's interpretation of an RP encounter that happened over the weekend. Note, I said _PRAV'S_ interpretation. That's because I'm dropping some things said, and changing others - Prav hears what he wants to hear (and also what I notice in the insanity of the moment. *chuckle*). Anyone who would like a copy of the actual log, just let me know and I'll be glad to send it to you.<br>
<br>
======================================<br>
<br>
The Prophet realized he needed some trade supplies, and headed out to Freeport. When he got there, Atoxus offered to show him a shortcut. The young prophet then followed the messenger's lead and walked the streets. As he walked the paths, he was about to mention that this looked more like the way to the Arena rather than the Trader's Holiday when he heard a noise.<br>
<br>
&quot;...No idea...&quot;<br>
<br>
That voice - it almost sounded like the half-breed named Minz. The prophet looked about and saw them all sitting there in front of the arena.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; The young Prophet said. &quot;Look at the pretty little salamanders.&quot; The half-breed growled at the prophet as his motley crew of lightdwellers grumbled and said things like, &quot;Alas, more filth.&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophet couldn't help himself he looked at Minz and chuckled at the hatred washing forth. One of them had the audacity to laugh at the priest as the half-breed said, &quot;The city crawls with Drow.&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophet only smiled sweetly and said, &quot;Any message for the little bard?&quot; The looks in their eyes caused him to smirk in merriment at it all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell her we shall see her soon,&quot; the half-breed countered calmly as the one named Quezex challenged the priest to a duel. The prophet ignored the challenge as he had more important things to tend to, and besides, if he still wanted to after he knew the consequences, then the prophet would oblige him gladly.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I make the same offer to you as I did to Xareth.&quot; The half-breed continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here let me carve it in your back,&quot; the one Atoxus said was named Nrain threatened with a look in his eyes as though he truly meant it.<br>
<br>
The half-breed continued on and said, &quot;We offer our aid to seeking the cure. Hold Nrain, be still.&quot;<br>
<br>
The paladin seethed at the ignoring of his challenge, so the Prophet continued to ignore him and said, &quot;Oh? Your aid you say? I've seen enough aid from your dear friend Kassy.&quot;<br>
<br>
The one who had made for the perfect patsy - the prophet thought his name was Legodus...Logulus...something like that - said, &quot;You would aid such as these? Why? They are not worthy of our notice, let alone our aid.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We shall see her,&quot; the half-breed said, &quot;Because it is the right thing to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Prophet laughed at the half-breed while some pompous bard with a red shield tried to play more soothing music. He then said amidst his chuckles, &quot;Fool - I no longer care of a cure...I am...enjoying...having her as my guest,&quot; he said as he licked his lips.<br>
<br>
The patsy said, &quot;The only right thing to do is to kill them. Slowly.&quot; Another of the little salamanders said, &quot;Who let a scum like you wander around here?&quot;<br>
<br>
The half-breed gritted his teeth as the Prophet continued on and said, &quot;Know this, as I said to Kassy...&quot; He looked out at them all as they whispered and grumbled and then continued on. &quot;You may very well take my life. However, my actions shall ensure my return.&quot;<br>
<br>
The patsy said, &quot;Oh, I WILL take more than that, I can promise you&quot;<br>
<br>
Another spoke up and said, &quot;I would enjoy that, but even death is too good for you&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophet had paused to let them voice their boasts and then said, &quot;And then I will see to the pretty little bard 10 times over.&quot; <br>

Re: The Young Prophet and The Dragons, Part 1 (*RP<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
/ooc Very nice!<br>
<br>
The bit blow actually happend prior to Prav's arrival.<br>
<br>
/ic<br>
<br>
Minz sat in silence. Staring out across the ocean.<br>
<br>
Things had bee going so well. The meeting was going smoothly. Business was getting done.<br>
<br>
He was proud that they were growing. Not quickly. But steadily. Vallden and Nadilaa brought their numbers up to 18. Small, but a solid group. He wasn't concerned about their size. Rather concerned about their character. Several petitioners had actually been turned away.<br>
<br>
And then he showed up.<br>
<br>
Windam sounded the first alarm, and Minz ran out onto the stage. There he was...Xareth<br>
<br>
Grinning wickedly.<br>
<br>
Tossing verbal barbs at Windam.<br>
<br>
Minz hissed as he saw the drow. Clenching his teeth, steeling himself for what he knew he had to do. Offer this one his aid. Aid in finding a cure to the curse that lay like a dead weight on Silverstarr and Xareth.<br>
<br>
The exchange was short and pointed (sorry, I forgot to log it)<br>
<br>
Minz was shocked at the foolhardiness of Xar when he heard he actually killed Michae, the one who put the curse on them. His hope had been to wheedle the cure from him. But that hope now lay in ashes.<br>
<br>
Their yelling began to attract a crowd. (actually a few came to watch. The theater turned out to be a great venue) A few warriors eager to see a brawl sat on the earth. A halfling thief scurried about, clearly looking for easy targets, and a somber Tier 'Dal cleric named Tenzein, hovered off to the side (a GM...way cool!! Afterwards she told us how impressed she was with our RP. Too much fun!!)<br>
<br>
His attempt to cajole Xareth into accepting his help had disintegrated into pointless and viscous banter. The Dragons seethed behind him. Young Vallden stood at Xareth's back, wrapped in the shadows, his rapier poised at the drow's neck. Urging me to give him the word.<br>
<br>
Finally, he could stand no more. &quot;ENOUGH!!&quot; he shouted. Eyes snapped away from the drow onto him. Few had ever seen him raise his voice. Xareth grinned evilly. Taking a deep labored breath, he made one final attempt, &quot;Xareth,&quot; he said through gritted teeth. &quot;Accept our help or accept our venom.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your venom?&quot; he laughed. &quot;I'll tell you what. Face me. Here and now. Alone. Should you win, I will give you proof that the wench Silverstarr is alive and well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And if I do not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Should you lose, you will provide your services to me for a target of my choosing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO Minz!! Don't?&quot; Saludin and others called out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Done&quot; was the only reply give, as I slipped behind him, plunging my spear into his back.<br>
<br>
(OK, bad choice here. We were dueling away, having a ball, when the dumbass guard strode by. Jumping on Xareth. D'OOOHH!!! So what do I do?? Backstab the guard of course, yelling at Xar to run. /bonk self. Well I was toasted. But Tenzein gave me a full GM res. I presume that is better than a normal one. No idea really. But I was really psyched. This was when she complimented us. Also, this untimely death filled the &quot;Naked Minz&quot; requirement, making it an Official OED event. After looting, we moved to the arena. Now back to our regularly scheduled program already in progress.)<br>
<br>
One final slash, I saw it coming, but was too fatigued to parry it. Falling to the ground. The weight of the loss sinking in. I would have to kill a mark for Xareth.<br>
<br>
The ocean roared loudly. I sighing heavily, I asked the same question again, &quot;what have I done?&quot;<br>

/OOC I thought for a moment I was going to have to come to Xareth and Pravdameer's aid. Apparently though, they are doing quite well on their own. Keep up the good work all, can't wait to hear more. <br>
<br>
Hmmmm, could be some interesting RP between Nadilaa and myself. You do know she was once a seed in the VH don't you? Did you ever think she might be a mole???<br>

Nice one, Minz. The actually RP was actually a lot more, but like Minz, I didn't log it. And I have no idea why Minz went and attacked the guard, a high level druid in the OED snared him so we could get away. LOL. It was a great deal of fun, and pravdameer was going to appear and help me out, but they broke off and left, before he got there. Oh well, he still caught the 'salamanders' doing their thing in Freeport. I can't wait until I can get Minz back for the end of that RP.  )<br>

The Prophet and The Dragons, Part 2 (*RP*)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
*ooc* I'm going to try and keep this whole thing in one thread, so as to make it easier to go back and re-read anything missed. Also, I thought this would only be 2 parts, but it seems there will have to be at least a third part. *shrug* Well, it was a fairly long session. Oh, and once again, I reiterate - I have taken some &quot;poetic license&quot; with the events. What I mean by that is that some comments and actions were changed in terms of the order they were said so as to make for a better story. In any event, on with part 2.<br>
<br>
======================================<br>
<br>
The prophet had paused to let them voice their boasts and then said, &quot;And then I will see to the pretty little bard 10 times over.&quot;<br>
<br>
The silence was deafening as the implications sank in. Several members prayed to their puny gods while others whispered amongst themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;...to protect our sister...then again...&quot;<br>
<br>
The half-breed glared at the prophet and said, &quot;Be gone from this place Drow!&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophet chuckled with evil glee as he remembered a task he had been putting off for a time. Now was definitely the perfect time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will,&quot; the prophet said still smiling. &quot;For I have business with that wigmaker outside of town. I have some pretty fresh hair to sell him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young prophet smirked devilishly as he held up some strands of the bard's hair. Then they all began to speak at once.<br>
<br>
&quot;Priest... your fellow just came and swore to our sister's well being.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah...scum like you shouldn't be allowed around here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Know this, Pravdameer. If any harm befalls her, I will personally destroy you and others who have caused it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You all pray I will lock and load.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pravdameer, it seems no one is with you... why is that?&quot;<br>
&quot;You all are so alike.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young priest basked in the waves of hatred that washed over him, while their half-breed leader shook with rage and suddenly shouted out, &quot;BE GONE!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
As he turned to leave he heard the bard bearing the red shield mumble, &quot;I think... I think this one serves no good purpose.&quot; He considered turning back to toy with them some more when he heard a shout of, &quot;Run like the fool that you are!&quot;<br>
<br>
That definitely settled it. He went back and said, &quot;Oh, I serve a good purpose indeed little bard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No GOOD purpose,&quot; The bard said. &quot;You swear to harm our sister, while your brother swears you serve him. I think you talk too much priest, and have no power.&quot;<br>
<br>
The patsy then turned an icy glare upon the young prophet and said, &quot;My patience wears thin, Pravdameer. Consider yourself fortunate, today Tier'dal. Out of respect for Minz I will not take your wretched life&quot;<br>
<br>
The one who had accused the priest of being a fool (Atoxus said her name was Windam) then called out, &quot;Ah I am glad Windi taught me of your ways - or do you remember her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I do - and she knows nothing of my ways,&quot; the prophet replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh but she does. She knows more then you care to know&quot;<br>
<br>
Another, whom Atoxus named as Saludin, said, &quot;Pravdameer, I have a question for you. Why did you kidnapped Silver to find a cure? Why didn't you tell us that you wanted to help us...like 'normal' people would?&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the young priest had a chance to ridicule their questions, the half-breed said, &quot;Leave him be. No good will come of this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then the one Atoxus said was named Ascrida spit in his face for the slurs he had made upon the Dragons as well as his actions while the bard with the red shield tried to cover his fury by laughing at Pravdameer.<br>
<br>
The young prophet saw through it all. He chuckled at them all as they came after to hurl more insults and threats as their hatred began to consume them. &quot;You fools tell me to leave, and then you come chasing after me like a pack of lost puppies. Isn't that so sweet.&quot; He then showed how unmoved he was by their words by yawning widely in their faces.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, but you don't know what 'sweet' is,&quot; the one named Windam said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, I think this one would serve us like he serves Xareth,&quot; said the bard with that foolish looking red shield.<br>
<br>
Then the paladin, Quezex, began to tighten the grip on his sword and said, &quot;So how about it? Want to go to your bastard god tonight?&quot; <br>
