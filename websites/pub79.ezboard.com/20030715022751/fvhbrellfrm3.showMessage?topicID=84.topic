A Daughter's Debt<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The whole of Neriak shook slightly as the storm above pummled the surface with both rain and lightning. Though all was dark, peacefull, even scerene within, a young girl sat huddled in a small corner in 3rd Gate that had been her home since she was a child.<br>
<br>
Feareth stared blankly into nothingness, her eyes seeing events that had occured long ago rather than what actually lay before her. As she watched the scene unfold for the thousandth for the time, her crimson eyes burned with unquenchable inner fire. <br>
<br>
*******<br>
<br>
She was a small child again, running through the dark forest. There were hungry, vicious creatures all around her, she knew, but she was not afraid. Her father was a mighty warrior, charged with guarding Nektulos' twilight paths and hidden ways, and he would let nothing harm his daughter.<br>
<br>
As every night, she ran through the forest carrying the small bag that held her father's dinner. Fear had been bringing the food nearly since her mother had been murdered at the hands of the Lightwalkers when Fear was only a babe. <br>
<br>
Something was not right this night, though. There was a presence in the forest that frightened the girl. It only grew stronger as she neared the place she was to meet her father and she wanted nothing more than to turn and run back to the gates of Neriak. The girl feared her father's anger at not recieving his dinner more than the strange feeling in the wood, however, and so continued. <br>
<br>
Perhaps it was luck, perhaps divine intervention, but just before she would have entered the clearing where she was to meet her father, Fear ducked behind a large, dark tree. <br>
<br>
An arrow thunked into the bark of the tree not an arm's length from her face and Fear shrank back into the darkness. There was a dead Tier'Dal guard lying in the clearing. Her father's patrol partner. She watched horrified as a tall figure wearing armor the color of leaves strode through the clearing. He was cut in a dozen places, but none of the wounds were serious. She paled as she noted that his blades were covered with blood. Fresh blood.<br>
<br>
Then she heard a familiar voice, her face snapping in the direction it had come from. Fear very nearly cried out as her father entered the clearing. He was drenched in blood, one arm hanging limp and usless at his side. Without hesitation he charged the green-clad warrior, blades at the ready. The tall stranger was muttering soft words as the dark elf ran toward him. Fear couldnt make them out, but she caught the name Tunare among them.<br>
<br>
As the muttering stopped something terrible happened. The very plants seeming came to life, ensnaring her father, slowing his pace to a crawl. Horrified but unable to look away, Feareth watched as the ranger, for that is what he was, cut her father down.<br>
<br>
The child couldnt move, couldnt breath. She only stared at the human from the shadows of the tree behind which she hid. His features burned themselves into her mind, his eyes, the red of his hair, and the slight smile that crept across his face as he had murdered the Tier'Dal guard.<br>
<br>
Feareth didnt remember how she had gotten back to Neriak, didnt remember passing through the dark city, didnt remember finding the dark corner in 3rd Gate. All she remembered was the murderer's face and the blood on his blades.<br>
<br>
Orphened and alone, Fear stayed within the shadows of the dark city. She made her home within the dark corner she found her first night alone, her only company the ghouls that stood guard over the mighty necromancer's guild. <br>
<br>
Through the walls of the guild hall she could hear the masters giving lessons in the magic of Death to their students. Though she paid little attention she discovered that after several years of half-listening she had learned how to do many of the simple spells that young necromancers were first taught. She smiled darkly to herself the day she raised her first skeletal pet. She would have her revenge.<br>
<br>
*******<br>
<br>
Feareth's eyes focused on the world before her as she came back to the present. She looked up at her pet and smiled darkly. &quot;Yes, Drallien, 'tis time the murderer meets the justice he deserves. There is precious little I do not know about you; you will not escape my Hatred.&quot; Red eyes sparkling she whispered a prayer to the Father of the Tier'Dal, her final words being,&quot;Let the foolish Lightwalker know the touch of Fear...&quot;<br>
