As far as it goes the Hibs on my server Igraine were gettin quite uppity. There was a time when we had DF for weeks! Incursions by Hibs were real RP making opportunities! Life was great!<br>
<br>
Then the darkness came; Our best zerg leader fell beneath a pall (wife had a baby) and dissapeared from the sight of fair Camelot. At that same time Tretchery! Some of our Mightiest Knights (Our top alliance) were charmed by an evil Hibernian sorcerer (they left and all went to Hib to create a new guild). In desperation we all withdrew to seek consul with the wise (we called a truce with Hibernia to give them time to develop). <br>
<br>
It wasnt long however (dam-it wasnt long at all!) before foul Hibernians stormed our lands slaying all before them. They stole our most the most sacred Staff of Mighty Merlin! They aided (by keeping us busy elsewhere) the oafish lumbering giants of the North (Mids) to capture Excalibers Scabbard! All seemed lost. Dark were the days in fair Camelot then.<br>
<br>
But lo, a plan was laid to recapture all that was rightfully ours. The giants of the North could be ignored, being too dim of wit to be an urgent problem. The foul Hibernians must be dealt with, taught a lesson to instill fear in their childrens children. <br>
<br>
And so it was, in the darkest of days of the year and the darkest of hours of the night (Hibs go to bed early, they need their beauty sleep...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) that we stole upon deep Hibernia slaying all who stood before us (we surprised em) conquering every stronghold in Hibernia (all keeps - old school tactics) to finally reach our goal and steal in upon their sanctuary most foul (relic keep). There, we took all, to punish the lowly Hibernians for ever daring to cast their dark gaze upon fair Camelot. <br>
<br>
and the Mightiest of the Mighty who led this great enterprise was none other than the greatest of men, previously vilified by braggarts as one who cared only for profit (Mercenary), but beneath such shallow view lies the heart of a true Warrior! The savior of us all! Let his name forever be spoken with the Greatest of Heros.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yep, yep, yep, since takin all the pwr relics the Hibs are definately nerfed. We had to call out the guards a few times shortly after that as Hibs seem to live for pwr, but now the Hib problem is much more manageable. Mids? ya they love the STR relics, but no wants to go after them, because the last time anyone had 6 relics youll never sleep!<br>
<br>
Casters rule RvR, make no mistake about it and if Mythic really wants to &quot;slow&quot; down and &quot;improve&quot; RvR battles it will have to improve certain Melee classes (Mercs/ BM's) and nerf casters.<br>

Not sure if they're gonna snap out of it or not, from what I've heard a lot of them jumped servers or left for ShadowBane.

I honestly think its best when the relics change hands often. Not every night, but every few weeks. I think it helps keep all three realms alive. If a realm goes on several relic raids and gets defeated soundly every time, they'll get discouraged and will stop playing. But if a relic changes hands every few weeks, it'll keep everything lively. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raeloran Twinblade</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, 50 Blademaster, Legendary Grandmaster Armorcrafter, Pellinor</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grayswandir@lighttanksofdaoc>Grayswandir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#000000>(4/17/03 11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> and so...</span><hr size=1> Hey Nirala.<br>
<br>
I totally agree Raeloran - the relics do need to &quot;shared&quot; around for the well being of all realms. Somtimes I notice a certain boredom start to creep into ppl once they reach 50. Oh they tear up emain for awhile (or try), but after a few weeks of endless repetition, the start to lose some interest.<br>
<br>
The DR's and other events help but you can only do so much of that, so they make other chars which keeps em busy for awhile but not forever.<br>
<br>
Talking of Relics there is also IMO an imbalance issue OR seems to be. No realm seems to benefit as much drom the PWR relics as the Hibs. When they have them they are lethal. Even RvR against them is no fun - first to fire wins.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I am very interested to see what Mythic comes up with to &quot;improve&quot; (slow down) the RvR experience as they plan. I really cant see them do it if they dont nerf casters, at least in RvR. We could finally have some real melee battles, who knows?<br>
<br>
The RR just before the successful one I mentioned above was amazing; over 200 Albs and 200 Hib full armies in emain, we chased each or played cat and mouse all day. When we fianally met? I'd never seen so many paeople it was so awesome just see each other, we both stopped to look a minute - then we clashed, and honestly it was over in seconds (hibs had 3 pwr relics) - we lost and badly. <br>
<br>
We had sooooo many bodies stacked in Bolg (summoner) that people were wishing for an AOE rez...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I suppose the Middies ae more dangerous with Str relics too, but our casters take care of that easy enough. Hibs with pwr relics are too dangerous.<br>
<br>
I suppose you might say that all melee classes get ripped a bit, being outclassed by our caster friends.<br>
<br>
Oh well, time to go before some zerker decides to explore my nether regions with his left axe...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Whilst the albion army was occupied with the drakoran invasion (it was but days after King Constantine heeded the Avalonian plea for help) we had other more pressing matters nearer to home.<br>
<br>
The mids struck at first light, the albion army was still drunk and sleepy from the previous night's victory over Morgana's forces. What more they were scattered across an island many hundreds of miles away from Forest Sauvage and Castle Excalibur (alas Merlin's staff has been the property of Hibernia for many months). We have noone to blame but ourselves, the mids came the previous night, capturing many a Caer, and were left unharried. It was foolish not to expect the dawn raid. A handful of defenders that were close enough rallied but were far from enough.<br>
<br>
Albion woke up, we'd been living in a dream for too long. War councils were held, voices raised, agreements reached. The same tactic was applied, at the crack of dawn (10am to you lot) the albion forces struck the gates of Mjolnir Faste. The keep was claimed quickly, but greed was to be our downfall that day. Sending only a token force with Excalibur's Scabbard the rest of the army remained to take Thor's Hammer and Lug's Spear of Lightning when the scabbard was safely home. <br>
<br>
Alas, this was not to be - the small force was cornered at the milegate by twice its number. The minstrels sang their songs of speed but their throats were strangely dry, Odin's eye was watching and they had been cursed. It was not to be Albion's day. (*mumbles something about bugs*)  The brave paladin bearing the weight of the scabbard made it to the foot of the hill beneath our keep in Odin's Gate, but was slain before the guards could fire a shot.<br>
<br>
The Albion army tried to hold Myrddin long enough for the summoning to return Excalibur to us, but the mids grew in number and ours only shrank. We were doomed.<br>
<br>
Many would have been put off by such cruel fate, but more plans were made - an assault began in the early evening, whilst Midgard supped. Nottmoor fell, Bledmeer shortly after. The temple of Arawn brought an Arch Summoner of the Dead, and the entirety of Albion's might was brought to bear in the Jamtland mountains. A long and bloody fight won us Bledmeer, Hlidskialf and Glenlock. Times looked troubled as Hlid was recaptured whilst our attention was focused on Fensalir, but the rebellion did not last long.<br>
<br>
After twelve hours of heavy siege, and fierce battle the albion army made it to Mjolnir. The battle had taken its toll on our numbers but the enemy grew fewer and fewer by the minute. A final battlecry was yelled as we sieged Mjolnir, blasting through its doors. The relics were taken home to where they belong.<br>
<br>
For a week albion defended like lions, even the merest whisper of frontier activity raised an alarm call throughout the realm, and an army was quickly dispatched to repel the invaders. Things looked bad one evening with Boldiam, Berkstead, Renaris and Benowyc all in enemy hands, but a determined and continued assault won us back Renaris. A strike group retook Benowyc and the other two were reclaimed shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>
Thwarted for a week, Midgard hid its fury well, till one fateful morning Albion woke up to find Castle Excalibur in ruins and the relics once more within the icy home of Mjolnir. Stealth and Treachery, whilst albion slept the army had came. Of the three score or so Albion's awake, only ten were of a season able to defend. No match for the ten-score Midgard army.<br>
<br>
In the wake of this are we now, defeated by treachery where force of arms would not. But we'll not lie dormant for long - even now the war drums are sounding, the bugles call for Albion to unite and take back what is ours.<br>
