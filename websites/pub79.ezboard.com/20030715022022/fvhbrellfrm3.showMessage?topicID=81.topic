The Secret Mission<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Guard X’Otta slowly struggled back to consciousness. The world spun, and colors seemed to bleed together for a few moments. He felt sick, but then after taking a few deep breaths he felt centered again and focused enough to recall how he’d come to be face down in the muck in the first place. <br>
<br>
“Damned Goblins!”, he said to himself, then froze as he realized he’s spoken aloud. Slowly he rose from the ground and turned to look about, making sure his outburst had not alerted anyone or anything that might be lurking about the shadows. It had not, he was completely alone.<br>
<br>
Guard X’Otta’s gaze fell upon the overturned wagons and broken carts of the caravan he’d been assigned to as guard. The bodies of many of his fellow guards and a few teamsters, as well as many dead goblins, lay about the broken caravan amid the wreckage. Of their precious cargo there was no sign at all. Apparently, the goblins who had attacked the caravan had made off with everything of value, mistaking him for just another corpse among the fallen. Guard X’Otta tended briefly to his own wounds, then checked a few of the other Teir’Dal to make sure no others had survived. Satisfied he was the lone survivor, he set off East on the long trek home to Neriak…….<br>
<br>
Raveneye had only been back in Neriak for a day. Just returned from Velious, he hadn’t even made his formal report to the council of the Lodge of the Dead when a summons came for him to attend a private meeting with Nezzka Tolax, commander of the Shadowknights and one of the highest ranking members of the Lodge. Uncertain what his old friend and mentor was up to by summoning him, Raveneye set out at once to answer the call. He arrived at the Lodge and was shown to a private meeting chamber by one of the ghouls servants the Necromancers kept for such tasks. Nezzka Tolax arrived moments later.<br>
<br>
“Raveneye, it’s good to see you my friend”, said Tolax.<br>
<br>
“And you sir, it’s been too long”, Raveneye replied. “But why the secrecy? What is the nature of this urgent meeting?”<br>
<br>
“Ahhh yes, always straight to the point with you eh”, said Tolax with a wry smile. “I won’t waste time, we need you to take on an assignment, one that will need to be kept in strictest confidence.”<br>
<br>
“You have my word as a Knight of the Lodge sir”, replied Raveneye with conviction.<br>
<br>
“Fine”, said Tolax. “3 days ago a guard returned to Neriak from the Gorge of King Xorbb. He was part of a caravan that was carrying weapons and armor along with some magic items from our contacts in Paineel. The caravan was ambushed in the gorge, we think by a combination of goblins from Runnyeye and some Evil Eyes that seemed to be allied with them. They overpowered the caravan and made off with all the Black Iron armor, weapons and magic items. Needless to say this is a great loss to the Lodge, but worse still, if word gets back to Paineel that we cannot provide safe passage for goods and merchants to Neriak then our shaky alliance with the Necromancers and Shadowknights of that city will collapse. We need those items returned, and we need it done quickly and quietly.”<br>
<br>
Raveneye’s look was grim. “There is little I can do against an entire clan of Goblins by myself sir” he said.<br>
<br>
Nezzka Tolax showed an amused expression. “Oh we don’t expect you to go alone Raveneye”, he laughed. “I give you permission to recruit a team to assist you in this endeavor. Hand select the people you need, swear them to secrecy, and recover as much of the caravan’s items as you can. Then report back to me at the end of the lunar cycle, that’s 8 days from now. Go now and choose your companions, and may Innoruuk guide your blade my friend.”<br>
<br>
Raveneye stood and saluted the commander. “Consider it done, friend” he replied, and with that turned and walked from the room to begin the adventure……<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC: As many of you know, I have to lead a raid to rise from the rank of seed to that of Dread Harvester. By popular demand I've chosen Runnyeye as the location for the raid. I'd like to do it this coming Wednesday, Feb. 7th at 9pm EST (that's 6pm PST for you west coasters!).<br>
<br>
Runnyeye is a dungeon containing mostly goblins and a few evil eyes. Level range is from 15-25 (in the parts we'll be raiding) so the raid is open to anyone in or above that range. I know the dungeon fairly well, and we will try to get into the Warlord Room, King Room, Captain Room and Knight Room barring anyone already camping out in any of those places. Loot is mainly Black Iron armor, including the Crown which is a nice headpiece, the Medallion which is +3 INT and WIS, and the Black Iron Bastard Sword which is an excelent magic weapon for you melee types.<br>
<br>
I will be pulling mostly to ensure good breaking of the rooms and minimal exposure of participants to death.  I would love it if at least one other 30+ melee character and a cleric capable of rez could attend as well to make life easier for everyone. All VH members are welcome of course. Please signup either here or under the short message I'm leaving in the Dungeon message base. Thanks, and I hope to make this an enjoyable raid for everyone involved!<br>

Re: The Secret Mission<br>

<br>
OOC: Oh one more thing.....<br>
<br>
There are two entrances to Runnyeye, one from Misty Thicket and another from the Gorge of King Xorbb (Beholder's Maze). I'd like to gather everyone at the Gorge entrance at 9pm to start the raid, but if you can't get through the Gorge to that entrance we can make arrangements to come get you. Worst case is I'll simply hack a route through the gorge to the entrance.  If you are going to need taxi service to a location closer to the dungeon (i.e. you don't want to run through Kithicor and High Hold) please try to take care of that or contact me in game befor ethe raid begins that evening. Thanks!<br>

Re: The Secret Mission<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Vresk scans the message before him, rage briefly turning his vision red. The messenger who delivered the message took an involuntary step back, unaccustomed to such a reaction from a Swifttail.<br>
<br>
The monk closed his eyes and centered himself, bottling his anger and Hatred for future battles as the Harvest had taught him to. &quot;Goblins,&quot; he muttered to himself as a wave of calm overcame him. His eyes snapped open and he turned to the human before him. Vresk's nostrils flared briefly and his tongue flicked out, smelling and tasting the informant's fear on the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will tell me where thiss,&quot; he checked the note again, &quot;Runnyeye placce iss.&quot;<br>
<br>
The human glared at him, widening his stance and trying to be menacing. Even with Vresk's limited contact with the human's, he learned quickly that the more intimidated they are, the more obstinate they became in turn. &quot;On the Antonican mainland, Lord Vresk.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blow landed before the messenger's mind had time to register the movement. To the monk's trained eye, he was still slow, much too slow for his satisfaction, but against gutter trash like this spy, his speed was more than sufficient. The man's head snapped back, issuing a loud crack. Vresk had placed the blow well, a fraction of a bit harder, and he would have slain the messenger outright. As it stood now, he would be unable to move his head independantly of the shoulders for about a week, but no permanent damage was incurred. &quot;I told you, I am not to be referred to ass a 'Lord',&quot; he hissed dangerously. &quot;If further insstruction iss needed, I will be happy to provide it for the sslow-witted. I do sso enjoy the tasste of human flesh.&quot; This last was emphasized with his tongue rasping on the outside of his sharp teeth. In all actuality, the monk was a vegetarian, but humans weren't the only ones who could use posture to intimidate.<br>
<br>
The messenger nodded, then winced and groaned in agony. &quot;Yes, Tiller,&quot; he said, bowing low. &quot;Please forgive the ignorance of those of lesser station.&quot; Vresk snorted and swished his tail, a sure sign he had noted the continued arrogance, before motioning for the human to continue. &quot;The domain of the Runnyeye clan of goblins is located deep underground very near the halfling city of Rivervale. Word has it that the wee folk are hard pressed to beat back the continued goblin raids as they get bolder in attacks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vresk nodded, pondering this information. He had never been that deep into Antonica, though he knew its general layout from maps he had studied in anticipation of meeting with the Violent Harvest. He seemed to remember something behind the area this human mentioned. &quot;I would anticcipate that even the goblinss are ssmart enough to have a ssecond way out. I doubt they were ass bold in attacking the halfling ssettlement in the passt ass they sseem to be now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed thiss iss true, M'L...err Tiller Vresk.&quot; The messenger gulped, but the monk seemed to take no notice. &quot;There is an exit that leads to an area known as the Gorge of King Xorbb. There are several creatures there known as Evil Eyes. I know little else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Without a word, Vresk snatched up a quill and began to scrawl on parchment.<br>
<br>
M'Lord Raveneye,<br>
<br>
I have heard of your need for adventurers from the Harvest. As always, my tail is for the use of the Violent Harvest to use. I am currently of the 24th Tail, and feel I would be valuable in your endeavor.<br>
<br>
However, I shall require much assistance in getting to that location, as I am unsure of the particulars in getting there. Please respond as you can so that this may be arranged.<br>
<br>
Tiller Vresk,<br>
SwiftTail of the 24th Tail,<br>
Ambassador to Kunark.<br>
<br>
Gently placing a weight on the parchment to allow the ink to dry, Vresk picked up his ink vial and noted it was getting low. Good thing he had more ink available close at hand. He stood next to the human and clapped his hand once. Immediately another messenger approached. &quot;Yes M'Lord?&quot; the young Iksar queried. &quot;I have a message to be delivered,&quot; he said in his native tongue. <br>
<br>
&quot;He called you Lord,&quot; the first informant said in protest. The new messenger's eyes flicked briefly to the human. In one smooth motion, Vresk placed his weight on his back leg and pushed off with his front, using his tail to balance as he spun around. As his lead foot connected smoothly with the human's head, the force of the blow knocked it clean from his shoulders. The messenger made no motion as the body fell to the floor. &quot;That is because I am Ambassador to this domain, not yours,&quot; he said to the corpse.<br>
<br>
&quot;A lesson to you, Young One,&quot; the monk said calmly. &quot;Never learn the same lesson twice, for rarely will you get such an opportunity.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed. I shall send for somebody to remove this trash M'Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
*ooc* Well, that was much longer than I'd intended. The short of it is that I'm interested in going, though I'll need a port and a guide through the Gorge (only been through there once, several months ago with an alt). <br>

Re: The Secret Mission<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Raveneye, I am most interested in this hunt and your Culling. Therefore I shall endeavor to be in Runnyeye for this Raid. I will warn that my many duties as first son of House S`Therik and as the Thresher of the Harvest keep me very busy, so I doubt I will be able to meet your force for the initial descent.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I shall join as my duties and my travel time allow, possibly a few hours after the beginning of the Raid. If the Raid is already over at that point, perhaps I will be able to join you and the other hunters for celebration afterwards.<br>
<br>
May the shadows guard thee as the Father's Hand guides thee to Victory! <br>

Re: The Secret Mission<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The bird stood patiently while Raveneye read the two messages, one from Thresher Khasirath and the other from far across the waters where the mysterious Iksar monk named Vresk held court. Trained to deliver such messages and be silent until further instructions, the sleek black raven simply stared at the dark elf with the same pale green orbs the Teir'Dal used to scan the notes. Raveneye's symbiotic relationship with the birds went beyond the mere optical similarities, he could communicate with the birds on a primal level, and they obeyed his commands as if he were one of their own.<br>
<br>
Raveneye sat at the field table he used on campaigns for everything from eating and drinking to writing and crafting detailed battle plans. He was on his way to Runnyeye to scout the location and formulate the best attack plans for his hand chosen team. These two would be valuable additions to said team, of that he had no doubts. He began to write.....<br>
<br>
Thresher, I gratefully accept your offer of assistance in the coming campaign against the Runnyeye goblins. I look forward to fighting at your side. If you arrive late due to unforseen circumstances, I am sure that we can find suitable &quot;entertainment&quot; for you. Sincerely, Raveneye Shadowstar.<br>
<br>
Then the second message...<br>
<br>
Honorable monk of the Court of Pain. Please accept my sincere thanks at your offer to join me in my campaign against the goblins of Runnyeye. One of your talents and expertise will be of great use in our efforts to recover the stolen goods from the caravan. I understand fully the &quot;problems&quot; inherent with one such as yourself travelling so far. I myself have received less than warm welcomes in many locations around Norrath. Those of our stature are rarely welcomed by those inferior to us without the threat of pain and suffering to help procure the greeting. I will make every effort to insure you safe passage to participate in this endeavor. My highest regards, Raveneye Shadowstar, Shadowknight of Neriak.<br>
<br>
With that Raveneye rolled both parchments and placed them in seperate containers. <br>
&quot;See that these arrive safely my friend&quot;, he said to the raven now preening itself on the end of his field table. <br>
The bird's only answer was an echoing caw as it took to the air and flew away. Raveneye knew with all certainty the messages would reach their intended receipiants. He turned back to his belongings and made ready to break camp. There was still much travel to be done.....<br>
<br>
OOC:<br>
Thanks to you both, and hope to see you there. Vresk, give me a tell in game tonight and we'll see about getting you closer to Runnyeye safely. <br>
<br>
