Or that they take just a tad bit too long to make these changes?  Personally I think their just trying to milk us for money because come on did it really have to take that long for them to realize something needed to be done about DW? Now it is prolly going to take ANOTHER 3-6 months to get anything else done so they can get more money off you, come on now I know this stuff can get done quicker than that it is like when I see 10 CSR online and 10 appeals in queue and then 20 minutes later I see nothing get done. What the heck do they do while them people are sitting there waiting to be helped and do they like take turns to answer 1 appeal at a time???? Jeez quit being so lazy and BIAS we do PAY for this stuff and usually the customer is always right but that does not seem so with Mythic....... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tatsumaruiii>TatsumaruIII</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#000000>(6/27/03 11:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic is BIAS and just wants money?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Is it just me or does anyone think Mythic is BIAS whenever they make class changes and it is never what anyone wants?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm sure Mythic is trying. How much effert they're putting into it is.. questionable. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and 'lightly' believe they're doing the best they're able to. What results is poor, but at least they try. Don't make me get started on Verant/Sony and their lack of detication <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
As for class changes, there has been a formidable load of changes that people did not request, but there has been an almost equal amount of things that have be requested. We asked for flank to be better, and have a to-hit. They got the first part right, at least.<br>
<br>
Yes, they refuse to change our main problem(s). Such as, not doing advanced spec-line damage, nor having our style bonuses applied to our offhand. It's an unexplainable reason (to me) why they decide to fix minor things, and only a few. It could be they really don't care that much. I don't personally believe in it, but it's still possible.<br>
<br>
I pay mythic to let me play their game. Why? I enjoy it. Things are bugged, don't work as intended and others are flat out broken. There's inbalance between all the classes in all realms, and at the rate of things that are getting fixed, this game will have been long dead and buried. But, I still play, and still have fun. There's more to these games than &quot;My class out-performs yours in almost every way possible&quot;. Being uber-leetz is just a part of it (and not one I care to focus on. I believe everyone who rolls a Mercenary feels the same). Friends, overcomming the odds, draining the game for everything it's worth, those are what I play the game for. The shear enjoyment I get from hunting Danion Farmers in Lyonesse with my good Theurgist friend is worth my 12 bucks a month. Going out in a group full of random people, trying to defeat a (usually) higher populas of mid/hibs is thrilling, even if futile.<br>
<br>
There's one thing this game can bring to me that others can't. I can create a group full of random individuals, and each one will act (more often then not) like we've been school-mates for weeks. This game forces people to be social, and the general population on my server are caring  and fun people to hang with. <br>
<br>
The greatist thing i'v ever experinced in a video game, is when I make a group of random people who just literally rip the jesus out of opposing forces, dispite not having a &quot;backbone&quot; class in the group (in the case of this game, a cleric/friar) in the group. This game brings that feeling to me more-so than others, and that keeps me hanging around. They could perform better with another class in replacement of me, but it doesn't matter to them. If they don't care, then I won't care.<br>
<br>
Things arn't perfect. I don't expect there to ever be true class balance. There will always be classes that perform under-par against most other classes. Just the way it goes. In my point of view, I'll keep playing this game untill the fun factor is overshadowed by too many problems. Right now, it's not, and I can brush the problems aside. Once I can't do that anymore, then i'll stop. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

<br>
So if they gave you what you want for your class you'd STOP playing? Hence then don't so they can get more money?<br>
<br>
Sorry but that makes no sense whatsoever. <br>
<br>
They give what they think will make the game more enjoyable for the majority of players so they can keep their player base as large as possible. This may or may not be what any one individual class or even the majority of players are asking for. They use their own judgement about what they think that is.<br>

<br>
Although they have effectively said &quot;if a class or realm is not having many players, we'll upgrade it&quot; which I feel is very wrong, particularly being an Albion tank, if this is really how they rig their game. If I'm one of hundreds, does this mean myself and my friends have to be the 'Indiana Jones Nazis' and are INTENDED to be mowed down?<br>
<br>
I think Mythic should go read online message-boards actross the entire internet and just look for themselves at what the problems are. We're seeing the same three or four things being repeated over and over again. I'm not going to flip out over Mythic's abscence of fixing the  problems, because they're steadily growing like a cancer, and Mythic is soon going to operate or lose a lot of customers.<br>
<br>
My true thoguhts are that releasing add-ons to retain customers in teh face of SWG and that other online RPG wasn't the smartest move to make. They should have just addressed class balance issues.<br>
<br>
Yes, there are a lot of people playing as the 'overpowered' classes. But there are actually more people playing the classes which suffer  day-in, day-out, because of this.<br>
<br>
Assassins ---- everyone else. Enchanters ----- everyone else.<br>
<br>
Those were just two examples. If they fixed the inherent problems they would be making a lot of people say Thank You Mythic, and maybe for three people, it would be the end of the world.<br>
<br>
I'd actually like to see them fixing the 'zerging' problem on the UK servers by creating one (or even two!) more servers, and alowing people to utilise a /charshift command to &quot;move house&quot;. I know I would.<br>
