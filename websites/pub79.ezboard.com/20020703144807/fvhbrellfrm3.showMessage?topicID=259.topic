(RP/ooc)</span><hr size=1> Vladire had finally made her way home from the dreaded Burning Wood. Walking into the Grange not only invoked a comfort that no other place could match, but, seeing a pile of gifts and letters piled just inside her quarters made Vladires heart well up with affection. Her servant greeted her as she made her way to the table.<br>
<br>
    'They've been arriving all morning, Mistress. Couriers from near and afar. Some risking much peril to slip past our protectors.'<br>
<br>
Vladire looked thoughfully at her servant. There were foods and deserts of every type. She, almost sheepishly, picked up a pristine loaf of forest oat bread and began to nibble the edges. Her servant gave Vladire a smile that almost said 'who are you fooling'. <br>
<br>
 'Who am I trying to impress here?' Vladire thought to herself. <br>
<br>
With that Vladire took an Ogre sized bite out of the loaf. It was delicious. She moaned through her full mouth,<br>
<br>
 &quot;Mmrpph, this could only be the most delectible work of Lyri Corinthar. She is the best cook I have had the pleasure of knowing. And a Feir'dal to add!&quot;<br>
<br>
The servant giggled into her hands and Vladire motioned her over to share in the abundance of food. Together, they leafed through all of the scrolls and letters, all on the topic of the previous nights sucessful work with the missionaries of the Triumvirate. After they were both full of food and wine, Vladire mentioned the need of a bath and the servant, exclaiming &quot;Of course!&quot;, scurried off to draw the tub full.<br>
Just as Vladire was removing her armor a glint of green caught her eye, buried beneath the unraveled scrolls and envelopes. She thought it odd that she could have missed a parcel. And one with such a captivating green shine. She uncovered a small rectangular box from beneath the pile. It was crafted from dark forrest leaves. With beautiful emeralds woven within them. Her name was scrawled in the unmistakable script that all Rangers were taught when young. Vladire felt her senses become acute; if you have never seen an elfs ears perk, i assure you, they did just that. Was this a sabotage? But still, the beauty of the package was so enchanting. She ran her fingers over the leaves, feeling the small bumps and texture. She traced her written name with a fingertip and smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mistress your bath is ready&quot;<br>
<br>
Vladire was jerked out of her dreamy state at the sound of her servants voice. The distraction caused her to drop the beautiful box, the hinge of the small lid breaking at her feet.<br>
The servant released a small squeal of dismay and Vladire gave her an assuring look that she was in no trouble. She bent down to get a better look at the contents, figuring if someone meant her harm there was no turning back now. <br>
Vladire moved the box slightly and from the opening, a beautiful white blossom tumbled out. She scooped it up in her hands and resumed her standing position. Apon inspection she noticed blood staining a large area of the petals. Her knees began to feel weak. This sight immediately brought Vladire to tears. Her servant hurried over to comfort her and to inquire why she was upset.<br>
Vladire simply waved her away, and sat, hugging the blossom against her chest. She flashed back to last nights events. The valorous Ranger Jecks falling still onto the leaves at the hand of Ixiblat Fer; under a twisted and gnarled old tree bearing beautiful white blossoms. He had given her ultimate sacrifice. Through the chaos, Vladire had seen the best Priests and Priestesses of her time gathered around Jecks's unmoving body. The most esteemed medicine makers working together to make him breathe again. And then she had seen him stalk silently into the woods without a word.<br>
Vladire wondered towards her bath, still holding the blossom. The aches and pains of battle began to sink into her bones and after removing the rest of her armor she slid comfortably into the bath. She kept the blossom near and gazed at it as the servant washed her feet. She would always keep it near. And later she would keep the dried petals with her, as a reminder that someone had made the utmost sacrifice for her, and that she would also share in such a sacrifice. <br>

Thank you SOOOO much to everyone who showed. I didn't realize how many friends I had, and also how many friends I had that sent me tells afterwards asking me why they hadnt been invited!! I&quot;M SORRY! An extra thanks to Jecks for being my bait and dying first. Also a thanks to myself for dying second! THANKS VLADIRE!<br>
There is still more to come. I got a ton of tells asking if this was my last piece. Unfortunatly it isnt. So the next round will be Overking Bathezid Di'zok in Chardok. I'll give it a few on this one...and plan a little better. Thanks for putting up with my disorganization. To anyone who knew and missed it because they forgot..thats my bad too cause there wasnt enough reminding and announcement. Next time will be soooooooooo much better. Thanks everyone again...this really means so much to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ujeckss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JecksS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/02 6:45:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: apon returning home....
