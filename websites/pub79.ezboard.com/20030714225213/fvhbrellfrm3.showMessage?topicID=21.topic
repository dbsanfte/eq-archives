A Meeting in the Forest<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Selilya had sent the message back to Nostramis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meet me at the fallen log by the undead monolith,&quot; she had stated. The note was brief. The time was set. The return of the bones was imminent.<br>
<br>
As the appointed hour approached, Selilya felt that now-familiar aching within her head...the pounding as if some pent up demon was lunging at some mystical door to burst through and escape.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be quiet,&quot; she screamed into the air. &quot;You will have your say! I will not allow you to continue in torment, especially when your message is so vital to my Prince.&quot;<br>
<br>
She quickly slammed the lid of the carved wooden box closed. Celestramis' pitiful remains were now out of sight, although, most definitely, not out of her mind. She sagged into her favorite bearskin-covered chair by the hearth and closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
The time had come to travel to the meeting place, and Selilya wanted to walk alone....just her and the blasted box. It was somewhat bulky, but not too terrible to manage...<br>
<br>
She could hear the whispers of the citizens of Neriak as she went on her way out of the city. The rumors of the missing Chalice had been circulating for quite some time now....and many were wondering, she was sure, if she could actually complete the task set before her. Indeed, she wondered <br>
that very thing herself.<br>
<br>
It was Innoruuk himself that gave her the strength for the brisk walk to the meeting place. Her muscles ached, her head pounded, and her heart seemed to race wildly. As the log came into view, she saw the shining armor of her cousin, The Thresher, Subati. A quick smile was then replaced by an inquisitive look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is she here,&quot; she asked Subati?<br>
<br>
The news that Nostramis would get this day would cut him to the core and Selilya could barely wait to face the one who had killed her former leader, Ixtab. How she missed his wise words at this moment, but she knew she must put aside the sentimentalism and don a face of steel and ice. This was the day for reckoning.<br>
<br>
Then he was there. Nostramis. Coyly cloaked in Teir'Dal illusion...but only briefly. He and a compatriot had arrived...quite sure of themselves.<br>
<br>
Selilya hesitated momentarily, and her knees weakened. &quot;Oh, my Prince of Hate, I do not want to fail you in this hour. Strengthen me, I entreat you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have something that belongs to me,&quot; Nostramis bellowed out. Selilya could see why he had commanded the Eastern Division of the Knights Templar....his demeanor was authoritative...and he did have charisma, for a lightborn, that is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nostramis,&quot; Selilya began. &quot;I am glad to return these bones to you. They cry out the very information you seek. Ixtab did not slay him, as you so quickly surmised. BUT, I will let him tell you! Celestramis, arise!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that cry, Selilya waved her arms in one delicate motion....and from the very box at her feet, the bones of the cousin of Nostramis, knit together, and sprung to life.<br>
<br>
The horror in Nostramis' face was quite pleasing to those of the Violent Harvest in attendance. Selilya could hear the racous laughter of The Thresher, yet, Selilya could not join in that chorus. &quot;Listen to your cousin, Nostramis...he has something to say to you...&quot;<br>
<br>
The events that followed seem like a whirlwind to Selilya. The bones began to speak....and the truth of Celestramis' death was declared for all to hear.<br>
<br>
&quot;My own father.....my own father....,&quot; the bones cried out. Indeed, it was not Ixtab that took the life of the favored cousin, it was Nostramis' very own uncle!!<br>
<br>
Selilya almost felt badly for the staggering foe in front of her...and she'd had enough of the display.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; she cried. And with one wave of her arm, she dispatched the bones of Celestramis back into their resting place. She resisted the urge to faint and called upon Innoruuk to steady her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Make sure he tells us about the Chalice,&quot; Subati whispered in Selilya's ear. &quot;Don't let him get away without giving it to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nostramis, I have delivered the truth to you...and yet, there is more!! Maev step forward,&quot; she shouted to the air behind her.<br>
<br>
As if by magic, a young high elf enchantress stepped out of her cloak of invisibility and into the gray mist of the Forest. Nostramis was gazing intently, and Selilya wondered how much more he could take before he broke down entirely.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have heard of your time of captivity at Castle Mistmoore,&quot; Selilya began. &quot;It appears you fell for the charms of a certain Teir'Dal princess there. The princess did not reveal to you the birth of your child. Yes, she is your daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
The disbelief was plain on his face...so Maev began relaying the tale. Selilya was almost shocked at the depth of the her Hatred as she mocked her own father.<br>
<br>
Nostramis stammered and was clearly searching for the words...and as if to deliver a final blow to him, Maev dropped her high elf illusion and revealed her true form, that of a lovely Teir'Dal maiden.<br>
<br>
&quot;Noooo,&quot; Nostramis cried out. Selilya noted that he now seemed to be on the edge of a breakdown. He pleaded with his daughter to leave the Violent Harvest and come seek a life in the &quot;Light.&quot; Maev would have no part of that, and instead, dared him to step into the Shadow with her.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Chalice, Selilya, the Chalice!&quot; Subati urged. &quot;Don't let him get away without giving us the Chalice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nostramis, we have kept our end of the bargain...now keep yours. Give us the Sacred Chalice as agreed,&quot; Selilya sternly reminded Nostramis.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't have it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selilya's heart stopped cold....to fail now was not an option. Failure would mean certain death at the hands of The Thresher....and she would welcome it gladly.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I will tell you where it is...,&quot; he almost whispered.<br>
<br>
After hearing the location, Selilya decided she should step back and watch the reunion of a Father and his Daughter...and she wondered briefly if she would ever see her own father again.<br>
<br>
Her thoughts were jerked back to the present as she noted the tone of her foe's voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;No! I will make sure you never get the Chalice back! I go to find it first,&quot; Nostramis cried. &quot;I cannot let this happen....&quot;<br>
<br>
With that declaration, he waved his arms....and was spirited off into a magical portal....away from the Forest...and away from the Violent Harvest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Subati, we must make ready for the recovery of our Chalice. See to it,&quot; Selilya insisted.<br>
<br>
Subati saluted, turned, and marched off to begin the preparations for the Raid to Recover the Heart of the Harvest.<br>
<br>

Winnower of the Harvest<br>
Devoted Daughter of Innoruuk<br>

<br>
Jasi of Neriak  <br>

Re: A Meeting in the Forest<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Jasi sits crouched on a fallen log outside of Neriak in the wilds of Nektulos. Again her blade works furiously at a mutilated block of wood that she 'whittles', &quot;Yeah... I was there.&quot; The young rogue suddenly grins and looks up at the one talking to her, &quot;Got there late, but no one knows, y'know? I mean, s'not like anyone saw me comin' or goin' if I don' want them to. But I was there.&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly she hops down to stand beside the curious Tier'dal that dares ask her a question, &quot;The light born is flippin' out. He's gonna go down hard, I betcha. That shortling that was with'm kept tryin' to keep him down, but the Winnower too good at what she do. Between her and the Thresher, they didn' stand no chance 'tal.&quot; The grin that blossoms over her face is amused in a vaguely wicked sort of way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just wait till the Thresher calls'n we'll give them Knights their due.&quot; Jasi reaches out and taps the side of her nose. And with that, she's suddenly gone into the shadows.  <br>
