<br>
On December 7, 2001 Mark Jacobs, CEO of Mythic Entertainment, made the following statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;Hibernia will get special attention in order to correct what people perceive it being the “poor stepchild” of the game. In particular all aspects of the development team will be turning their attention to that Realm (classes, spells, NPCs, dungeons) to improve it and the player’s perception of the Realm.&quot;<br>
<br>
This statement was made 14 months ago and the players of the realm of Hibernia are tired of waiting. On April 12, 2003 there will be a formal sit-in protest on the Pendragon server of Dark Age of Camelot. This protest is to once again voice the concerns that make Hibernia feel, in Mark Jacobs words, like the &quot;poor stepchild&quot; of the game.<br>
<br>
This protest will begin at 8pm eastern. Any wishing to involve themselves in this protest should come to the town of Mag Mell on Pendragon at 8pm eastern on April 12. Protestors will be invited to the guild &quot;Hibernian Protest&quot;.<br>
<br>
Some of concerns that will be expressed are these:<br>
<br>
- Graphical Detailing - <br>
<br>
Comparing Hibernia's graphical detailing to the other two realms one immediately notices the lack of detailing in Hibernia. <br>
<br>
Terrain - The zones do not have any &quot;feel&quot; of their own because the landscape does not have the diversity of the other two realms. <br>
<br>
Towns - The towns, with only a couple of exceptions, do not have any &quot;feel&quot; of their own because the building models given to us do not have the diversity of the other two realms. The capital city has much less graphical detailing than the other two realms. It appears that in order to cover up the lack of any real buildings/content in Tir na Nog the developer took the shortcut of making very long, wide hallways throughout the area as filler rather than constructing buildings. The buildings that are in Tir na Nog, with the exception of the castle and the training halls, are all cut/paste of things in the towns outside of Tir na Nog. Having two stables in the city was also a shortcut to fill space, they take up large amounts of space for one building, the fact that Tir na Nog has no horse routes makes these two stables a slap in the face to the Hibernian player. <br>
<br>
MOBS - The MOBs given to us lack the diversity of the other two realms. Even with this lack of diversity in the MOBs, Mythic has completely removed the Formorians from Hibernia. Give us some more MOB models. We really don't care if they are cut/paste from the other realms as long as they are different from the other MOBs in Hibernia. <br>
<br>
<br>
- Content - <br>
<br>
NPC - The NPCs of Hibernia do not speak as much as the other two realms (ie. bartenders who talk about the food and ale in their inn, bar patrons who tell stories about their own adventures, etc.) which leads to a very dull feel to the towns. We have no time of day events such as the magic show. None of that. Our towns have no life. <br>
<br>
Quests - The quests do not have the detail of the other two realms. We do not have a &quot;learn to group quest&quot; and we have nothing like the goblin attacks, skeleton attacks, or dwarf attacks that spawn large amounts of creatures just for the quester (sure we have the curmudgeons vs. siabra but that happens regardless of whether or not anyone is doing the quest). <br>
<br>
MOBS - Removal of the formorians from Hibernia (though they still exist in HyBrasil) is inexcusable. From simply an experience gaining standpoint the multi-pull grabeyes that respawned quickly are far better than the single pull Parthelonians that respawn VERY slowly. From a backstory standpoint, there is (or was) a lot of Hibernia's backstory around the Formorians. There was NO REASON for the removal of these MOBs, their removal has hurt Hibernia in its &quot;fluff&quot; content as well as in its ability to PvE for experience. The fact that the removal of all formorians was NOT documented is a slap in the face to the Hibernian players. What was said is that they were going to be fighting with Parthelonians. How can the Formorians fight with the Parthelonians if the Formorians don't exist? <br>
<br>
Towns - Calling Brynach a town was a slap in the face to Hibernian players, as was putting some NPCs just standing around outside Tir na Nog. Every developer at Mythic should know by now that Hibernians want some graphical content. If you are going to drop NPCs somewhere for our convenience then please simply state it that way, don't get us excited that we are getting some graphics and then just place NPCs around. This includes dropping some NPCs around Kimba's tree, adding horse routes to it, and calling it Culraid. TOWNS HAVE BUILDINGS!!! Can we make it any clearer than that? A few people standing around are not a town. Now, while we are on the subject of buildings, where are the rest of our buildings? Hibernia has the least diversity of any realms as far as architecture is concerned. We not only want buildings in our towns but we want enough diversity in those buildings that we can tell the difference between the towns without having to look around for terrain landmarks like rivers and lakes. Hibernia is also the only realm with no horses to/from our capital city, why is that? <br>
<br>
<br>
- Class Issues - <br>
<br>
Though it may be argued (and certainly is on the VN boards) that many classes in Hibernia have a multitude of problems in RvR viability, or in PvE viability, or in bugged spells/abilities, or in completely worthless spell lines this will not detail each and every one. Instead here are the areas that Mythic has completely ignored Hibernia as a whole. <br>
<br>
Bards - Even though bards have the worst offense/defense in the game, that is a class balance issue and not a realm issue. What is hurting the realm most with bards is that Mythic seems to not even know that this class exists or if they do they choose to ignore it. Mythic certainly does not know how the class works or care anything about the class' playability. Case in point: Mythic for months defended placing empathy on reinforced armor stating that empathy was the bards power pool, it was not until player logs proved that charisma was the bards power pool that Mythic finally admitted that empathy did NOTHING for bards. Case in point: Even after admitting their error and retrofitting every piece of +EMP reinforced armor in the game Mythic still put +EMP reinforced armor into Shrouded Isles. Case in point: Even after giving other classes (such as the friar) self buffs for questionably useful rising stats (at least STR lets you carry more) the bards are still stuck with EMP as a rising stat and no buffs to make up for it. These types of things (and many more on the bard class) show that Mythic completely overlooks this class. This impacts the realm of Hibernia as a whole because so much of what Mythic expects from Hibernia relies on this class (endurance regen, crowd control, healing). Making this class unplayable except as a follow-bot class seriously hinders Hibernia as a whole. This is the only class that will be mentioned on its own because although the others may have individual problems no others are completely unplayable. <br>
<br>
Mages - Unlike the mages of the other realms Hibernian mages do not have choices between multiple viable spec lines. Even the much derided earth spec for theurgists at least continues to offer up SOMETHING that both the theurgist themself and their group at large can find useful. Spec lines such as enchantments and mentalism offer NOTHING to the mage and little or nothing to the group. A spec line for a single target mez and a pet that kills its owner is not a good line (all other CC spec lines offer area effect). A spec line for two pet buffs and a melee damage add is a TERRIBLE line for a mage... in fact it is the worst spec line in the game mage or otherwise. These spec lines need to be made viable even if they are never made into the most attractive lines. <br>
<br>
Fighters - The melee weapon styles in Hibernia are still the worst in the game. Our blades line has no after parry or after evade styles, it is no wonder most do not choose it. Even the lines that do have decent style types are still more expensive in penalties and endurance costs than the other two realms. This was fair when Hibernia was the only realm with the possibility of endurance regen, but it is certainly not fair anymore. <br>
<br>
<br>
- RvR Imbalance Issues - <br>
<br>
KEEPS - Hibernia is the only realm whose keeps have 6 climb points. The other realms only have 4. This makes it much more difficult to defend a Hibernian keep. Considering that our assassin class is the least able to take the punishment dished out on a keep wall it really seems that Mythic is heavily biasing keeps against Hibernia. <br>
<br>
TERRAIN - Though some small effort was put into stocking Emain Macha with a couple more aggressive MOBs, the terrain of the Hibernian frontier is still the most inviting to enemies. Unlike the frontiers of the other realms there are clearly marked roads all the way from the enemy portal keeps to every keep in the Hibernian frontier. Most of these roads are clear of aggressive MOBs and guards making it the easiest frontier in the game to navigate. Unlike the other realms Hibernia has no mountains (we barely even have hills) so our keeps are clearly visible in large open fields rather than obscured by surrounding terrain, the same can be said with forests. <br>
<br>
<br>
- PvE Imbalance Issues - <br>
<br>
DUNGEONS - Hibernia still lacks a level 5-10 dungeon. Muire's Tomb is still the biggest deathtrap in the game. <br>
<br>
REMOVAL OF PVE AREAS - I haven't heard the other realms complain of complete removal of hunting grounds (though I have heard them complain of areas being &quot;nerfed&quot;) yet some of the best hunting in Hibernia has been removed... the formorians. <br>
<br>
LACK OF 10-15 AREAS - Though Muire's Tomb is supposed to be available to this level range, it is a deathtrap (see Dungeons above). Outside of Muire's tomb there is pathetically little available to the level 10-15 range. <br>
<br>
DRAGON - Do the devs really not know about this imbalance? <br>
<br>
<br>
- Summary - <br>
<br>
Though patch 1.51 did try to correct some of the glaring inconsistencies in how Hibernia's spells and abilities work in relationship to the other realms (making them work the same as the other realms) it did nothing to address the feeling that Hibernia is the red-headed stepchild of this game. For far too long the Mythic development team has ignored the fact that HIBERNIA IS NOT THE SAME QUALITY of video game as the other two realms. The players of this realm pay the same amount as the others and deserve to have the same quality of game. The graphical quality of Hibernia should have been addressed long before Shrouded Isles was released. The Mythic development team should know how Hibernian classes work (such as bards not using empathy). The glaring inconsistencies such as keeps with six climb points should never be allowed to pass through quality assurance. All of these things have happened and continue to happen. With each passing day Hibernia falls further and further behind in population balance, not because our classes are unplayable (with the exception of the bard) but because in EVERY aspect of game quality Hibernia comes up lacking. We want the same quality of graphics as the other two realms. We want the same quality of quests as the other two realms. We want the same quality of talking NPCs as the other two realms. We want an equally defensible frontier. We want equally defensible keeps.<br>

The Hibernian &quot;protest&quot; isn't going to get anything accomplished as it currently stands. The points of the protest are all over the place, and a lot of those points are &quot;want graphical updates.&quot; And I already explained on the Vault that this is not going to happen for a number of reasons.<br>
<br>
By the way we measure RVR activity (keeps, raids, relics, all of that) the three realms across all servers are equal. We cannot make changes to a realm because on one server they are losing - the server where they are winning would become unstoppable. There is more combat activity in some Hibernian frontiers (meaning small groups of people running around looking for someone to kill). However, the Hibernian keeps do not change hands any more often than the other two realms, according to the data we pulled when this protest first came up. We've got the hard numbers.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;shiny things&quot;: Perception is a heck of a thing. Sometimes old, outdated ideas linger on past their expiration date. Have the protest organizers counted the number of quests, monster types, areas, and items found in each realm? We have. Since Mark posted the announcement some folks are quoting (from 12/01), we've added things to make all the realms equal. A LOT of things.<br>
<br>
Perception is doubly a heck of a thing - how many people are really behind this protest? I'll tell you, I get a lot of feedback forms every day, and generally, if something is really an issue, I will see lots of feedback forms, emails, and threads. I've got a handful of forms, even fewer emails, and a few extremely active threads... with a couple dozen people posting in them. I'll tell you, I had FAR more feedback from unhappy Albion players who felt they were at a disadvantage... and the data we collected backed up the Albion players. I am definitely NOT getting &quot;swamped&quot; by emails, forms, or any such thing. Been quiet lately, actually.<br>
<br>
I am absolutely NOT saying that the Hibernia screed doesn't have some good points. It has some good points. I hope the &quot;protesters&quot; sort out those good points and focus on them. Spending a lot of time screaming for entire zones to be redesigned, rebuilt, and then downloaded by customers who didn't ask for the changes? When I already said it wasn't going to happen and gave the reasons why? Come on, now. Keep it to class balance issues. I say that only in the spirit of wanting to help the unhappy people have their voice heard.<br>

Ha hah!  Personally, from what I've seen (and I haven't played any Hib classes to high lvl - but I've been killed by quite a few) BM is about the only Hib class that's really wanting.  Some of the others could use a bit o' fluff sure, and one additional spell line in the chanters Enchantment line would be nice for them, but every other class is damned efficient.  Few weeks ago a few guildies of mine started in Hib (Tristan), I leveled both a warden AND a mentalist to 10 in about the time it takes me to lvl ONE toon that high in Alb. (With the exception of Necros - they're ridiculously easy to lvl). <p>Nirala HammahMastah<br>

<br>
I agree with Sanya.  That thing IS all over the place.  Points aren't supported.  I especially like where it says &quot;Muire tomb is a death trap&quot;, then later on says &quot;Muire tomb is a death trap (see above)&quot; referring to the earlier statement of &quot;Muire tomb is a death trap&quot;.  That's not supporting a point.  That's repeating it without evidence.<br>
<br>
I DO agree about style lines.<br>
<br>
I DO agree about spell lines.  Hell, Mana is kind in Hibernia.  Enchantments, Mentalism, Void, and Light specs all suck in comparison.<br>
<br>
It would be good if that thing got its information straight too.  It implies that a Mentalist's charm is under the Mentalism line when in actuality it's under the Light line.<br>
<br>
But they're both very, very poor lines.<br>
<br>
Mentalist Light: Single target spec DD, AE spec DD, pulsing charm<br>
Mentalist Mentalism: Single target spec heal, single target mez, confusion, remove mez<br>
<br>
Calling Mentalists Hibernia's secondary crowd control is one of the more humorous things Mythic has said, considering even Eldritches have more CC than them with an AE mez in their Light spec.<br>
<br>
Level 10-ish offers Blackthorns, by the way.  After that you've got Ghostly Siabra, Bantam Spectres... or if you're into soloing you could be doing red wolfhounds and whatnot.  The mobs are there.  Just look for them.<br>
