So when anyone posts an opinion that you don’t like you insult them, tell them to go away and that it none of their business. By all means lock this thread it’s not going in IV’s favor.<br>
Anyone who had read the posts on this thread and the one on fa’s board can see that the consensus of opinions by those other then IV are the same.  An IV leader said the zone was FCFS and you will get no sympathy that you got FCFS’d there.  You made your bed now sleep in it.<br>
Knobbie when you flame someone try to have some correct information, it helps.  Jaharad was not the troll here I was. Like most people that work I troll the boards when I don’t feel like working. I told him about this post. He posted out of frustration that no one posting for IV seems to understand what others are trying to say in their posts.  He rarely posts on your board or on any threads dealing with IV. He posted on a thread a few weeks ago when BA/Niivag attacked him about an incident he had nothing to do with.  I will let Talionis know that your heart goes out to them. I’m sure they will appreciate your concern.<br>
Let someone other then BA lock this thread. He pinned the last one he tried to lock.<br>

<br>
VP is FCFS if IV is in the zone.  This was dictated, and remains that way by your very own Guild Leader, or main guy behind the Guild Leader, Backalley.  He even says in this thread that it's an FCFS zone.<br>
<br>
If it's not FCFS, then Backalley says &quot;We agree it's a first guild in, one raid zone.&quot;  He doesn't though, in fact mulitple times in the thread he claims that it's not a one raid zone.  <br>
<br>
Lets clear something else up.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Mobs do not magically warp in VP like what can happen when pushing mobs into walls in TOV </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  You know why you guys got Silverwing + Hoshkar + a Guardien wurm add? One of two reasons.  1. Your monk fucked up the pull.  2. One of you were too close , and caught LoS agro, again this is partially your monk's fault for not being patient and waiting for the mobs to be in the right position.<br>
<br>
Backalley says:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  With all the flack we took with SA and VP in June. They never once saw us. We didnt threaten them or even attempt to pull anything they were pulling. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Lets be honest here BA. Hoshkar was bugged back in June.  Had he not been bugged, you could not have gone unnoticed past the SA raid.<br>
<br>
Ianthia this may be hard for you  to grasp, but me posting on Prexus.com, and me dealing with leadership of various different guilds is vastly different.  That's one of the reasons we're able to still kill mobs like Tunare, Dain and Sontalak.  Even when our numbers are a bit short, we have strong enough relations with other guilds to recruit the extra help we need, while also not getting FCFS by the bigger guilds. <br>
<br>
This is so simple to resolve, but your leadership refuses to take ownership.  Let me help you out a bit.<br>
<br>
First Backalley, swallow some of that pride.<br>
<br>
Then you say &quot;Hey, back in June we were wrong.  We were taking advantage of Hoshkar being bugged and tried to sneak past the SA raid.  We understand now, that the entire server respects VP as a one raid zone, and we would like to play ball with those rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
Had your leadership ever made that claim, then Hawx and Sumie would of had to deal with me, for doing what they did in VP.  As of right now though, your leadership (despite what your greater member base seems to believe) is still running with the old partyline &quot;VP is a multiraid zone&quot;.  Argueing semantics like where the pull was at.  Had your leadership stood by that line, and said to Aleolin or Hawx &quot;Look, VP is a multiraid zone kill whatever you want just stay away from our raid.&quot; AGIAN, resolution would have been different.  You can pull Hoshkar to the zone in.<br>
<br>
Of course had Team manburn done that then the nakid clerics at the zone would have bitched that they had Hoshkar pulled on them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18533>Sister Maddie Faye</a>

<br>
We all know what happened in VP a few months ago.  <br>
<br>
How many of you heard the guild chatter and what went on in the private forum immediately following that?  And how did 90% of us feel about the whole situation after we had gotten the whole story?  <br>
<br>
Its done, its over with, move on.  geesh..<br>
<br>
This is worse than a damn soap opera.<br>
<br>
All anyone is doing here  is creating more animosity between our guild and the rest of the server.  So everyone shut it, have a cookie, and make things better instead of making them worse, k?<br>

<br>
Why call someone a tool? Is it not possible for people to express their opinion even though they may share the opinion of other people?<br>
<br>
Ianthia you know how many people have called Maddie a tool? Lets just say there has been a lot of them. Maddie is just expressing his opinion, which he shares with others. So since you share the opinion that 'Maddie is a tool' with others should we call you a tool?<br>
<br>
My bottom line is, don't call people tools. It is unnecessarily degrading and just sounds dumb in my opinion. After all a tool is something you use to HELP you achieve what you can't on your own.<br>
<br>
Can't we all just step back, look at the other person's point of view and see if in fact that there is truth in both sides?<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just putting too much faith in mankind. Please, all sides, prove to me that I have put my faith in the right place.<br>

FA never has had VP a FCFS zone... only if IV is there because that is the bed IV made.  <br>
<br>
The thing that I find most interesting is that of all the posts on this topic no one has disputed it was my pull, no one disputed it was killed by team MB.  Yet when it came time to right a wrong when a guide (who was in a customer service limited area - with the time frame involved no way he had GM permission to be there) warned the accounts of six players for, by VI's own policies, no offense which would warrant such, IV people did not say a  word.

We all know what happened a few months ago and at that time IV's stance was that VP was FCFS, the Prexus community disagreed. I can remember reading posts on Prexus saying that if IV was in VP, its FCFS but other guilds would respect the &quot;first guild in&quot; rule.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> IMO VP is a non reservable zone, therefore its a FCFS zone, irreguardless of whatever antiquated &quot;forms of thought&quot; are out there.

Sorry but some traditions gotta change with the times. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This was a quote from BA I took from the FC?FU! thread on P.com<br>

Has IV's stance changed? If it has maybe the community should know, to avoid occurences like the most recent?<br>

<br>
Sapiens, Ianthia, Taxi, I'm begining to see what the &quot;new&quot; IV is all about.  These three representing your greater population, how can you not be embarassed?   While I only know of Taxi from what I've read here, the other two are well known serverwide idiots.  I don't say this as a personal jab because I can't counter what they have said.  I say this because they continue to repeat the same crap over, and over, and over again.  They reply with half statements, twisting words that are not even close to the point of a message.  Prefering to pick apart posts for the smallest inconsitency.<br>
<br>
I can play the quote game too Sapiens.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Not up to you to decide what we can or cannto kill.. and if you don;t believe me that we wcould have... just read Abery's post. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taken out of context.  I said in a previous post that you should be grateful that they killed Hoshkar for you, because 20 IV were not going to Kill him.  I wasn't deciding what you can and can't kill, I was arguing a point about mob capability.  I stand by those words.  While in the future perhaps you will kill him with 20, as of that day you do not have the capability.  Part of my job as a raid leader is to assess the other capabilitys of other guilds.  This is a complicated matter surrounding FCFS and the such, that I won't go into further.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Well he was told we were there first and that we didn't want to random.. and he said they were going to manaburn a dragon no matter what...

<br>
I find it really hard to believe that he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option.  I think it was a remark made because he very well knew, that you had to kill Hoshkar and Silverwing before you could move on to Phara-Dar.  He knwe that would be a long wait for them, as you guys were obviously waiting on more people so you could kill Hoshkar.  If he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option, I think you guys should lynch him.  Most likely though, he was offering this as an undoable option.  That's not diplomacy, that's impossible negotiation.  Diplomacy is compromise somewhere in the middle.  This was not offering something in the middle.<br>
<br>

<br>
Nope it wasn't.  Every guild considers VP a one raid zone.  IV violated that agreement, through the use of a bugged Hoshkar.  Your leader <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  continues to declare </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that VP is a multi-raid zone.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  No one from IV </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> leadership or otherwise, not even yourself, has posted that you are now on board with the rest of the server.  So until you can learn to play like everyone else, a different set of rules will be there for you.  Why is this so hard to comprehend? You want it to be different? Fine! Then simply state that you (collectivly) now feel that VP is a one raid zone, and we can be done with all this.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Not a grudge? You tell me if this doesn;t sound liek a grudge... </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's not a grudge.   It was a reaction.<br>
<br>
The difference between you and I Sapiens is so simple.  I'm willing to concede to people, when they are right.  You, Ianthia, perhaps even this Taxi person; are not willing to concede.  You will repeat yourselves over and over again, making silly points that no one else even comes close to agreeing with.  When people tell you politely that you are wrong, and should just give it up, you don't.  That's when you just keep pushing, and pushing.  <br>
<br>
Do you realise that you are now looked upon in the same eyes as people see Ianthia and Warador?  I'm not talking about the general population, I'm talking about the intelligent debators that can identify the difference between someone arguing a point, and someone just posting nonsense over and over and over again. <br>
<br>
Since this is your messageboard, I will allow you to have the last word.  I have no doubts it will be more unintelligent drivel that will be a further waste of time to respond too.  It's sad that this could be so easily resolved, yet your weak leadership is unable to do any sort of damage control.  <br>
<br>
If you want to have me respond to something, you know where to look.  Otherwise I leave you now, with the last word of undoubted flames and attacks, taking my words out of context; and tossing in a &quot;Tool&quot; or &quot;You're a little fly who no one listens to&quot;,<br>

<br>
I'd hope not because its all of THEIR own opinion. Saying that  these 3 people represent the guild as a whole is just plain childish.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maddie, yes Sapiens argues alot but he puts in info practically everytime he posts something and the info is relevant  to his material. Yet people call him a &quot;tool&quot; and &quot;dumb bastard&quot; thats bull shit. He may not see your points and what not but saying he is stupid for posting information about a problem just because your on the different side is wrong.<br>
<br>
There's always 2 sides to every story hence 2 arguments and 2 different ways to see it.<br>
<br>
and once again: when the hell was this one of those FA vs IV things?<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought Hawx's post was trying to get his warning off his accounts <br>

<br>
Build a bridge and get over what happened.  One thing that separates a man from a boy is being able to be held accountable for ones actions.  Be a man and stop making lame excuses.  This is not a flame.  This is being real with you.  Be a man bro.  Stop the spinning and excuses.  Step up to the plate and be a man...  Otherwise just pipe down and go away.  Because we really do not want to hear your whinning and nonsense.<br>
<br>
On another note and this is my own opinion.  You don't like Backalley and that is fine.  Do not come here in our house to smear him or IV.  It is childish.  And yes I did call you a tool.  Because look at your actions here and in game.  Maybe you need to take a hard look in the mirror and reality check yourself into why people have the opinions of you that they do.  Hell just look at this thread and use it as a example.  As I said.  Be a man!! <p><P ALIGN=Center>
