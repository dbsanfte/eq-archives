More in touch with their primal nature than most beings would dare admit to.  Encouraged to explore their less civilized sides from the beginning, to later better understand the beast that they would bind with.<br>
<br>
For Orrenda, part of that primitive nature was hatred.  From the beginning, it consumed her.  There was no reason for it, no explanaton.  It was just a part of who she was.   And it set her apart, even from other lords of the beasts.<br>
<br>
As she left the palace that was her childhood home and began exploring the wilds surrounding the city, she was mroe free to allow that hatred to well up and show in her actions.  Even others with an affinity for the beasts began to fear her.<br>
<br>
One day, while out on the hunt, she felt eyes upon her.   The fur on her back and neck raised in alarm.  Before she could spot who was watching her, the being's voice called out, &quot;Might I join you in your hunt?&quot;<br>
<br>
For a second, her eyes narrowed, and the dark elf was left to consider that she might attack him rather than hunt beside him, but hte moment passed, orrenda relaxed her stance, and with a sharp nod, indicated that he was welcome to join her.<br>
<br>
She quickly learned that he was much more powerful than she was, much more experianced.  As they hunted, he spoke to her.  &quot;Have you ever heard the name Innoruuk?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
She let lifeless body of the young hopperbeast she had killed fall from her hands.  &quot;How did you know?&quot; she asked glaring.  At his confusion to her response, she explained, &quot;It's a name that whisperrrs to me in my drreams.  But I don't know what it means.&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark elf spoke to her of Innoruuk, the Father of Hatred, of the harvest.  When he was done explaining, she looked at him and asked, &quot;Who arre you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Imirikol, priest of Innoruuk, and aspiring to join the Violent Harvest.&quot;<br>
<br>
For several more hours they spoke, of Innoruuk, and of his travels and of her dreams.  &quot;I have to see one of my masters for further training,&quot; She stated suddenly after an afternoon of hunting and speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will be leaving Luclin soon.  I have business on Norath.&quot; Imirikol responded.<br>
<br>
Without further response, Orrenda went to the master of the beastlords.  After her lessons, she turned to leave, but the master stopped her.  &quot;I've been watching you child.  With the dark one.  Go with him, young one.  Learn to control that which consumes you.  Learn of his ways.  Tell his people of ours.  You will always have a home here, but I think for you, it's time to explore other realms.&quot;<br>
<br>
She met Imirikol as he was leaving the city. &quot;So what is it like, on Norrath?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come with me and find out for yourself.  Be warned, it's a dangerous journey, but I'll help you as much as I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe, if it was as this priest said, and there were others the felt as she did.  If there were others that revelled in their hate as she did.  Maybe she could find a home amongst them that was more hers than the home she grew up with.<br>
<br>
(OOC) There's a bit more, but, alas, that work thing needs my attention. (OOC)<br>
<br>
Orrenda<br>
Vah Shir, Beast Lord, Level 6 (for a few more hours anyway)<br>
