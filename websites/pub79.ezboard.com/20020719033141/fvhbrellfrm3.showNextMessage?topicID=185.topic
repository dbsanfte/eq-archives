He was in a circle of  7 other Teir’dal Wizards, the strongest of the Tower of the Spurned. Tzlar knew that across all Norrath, on land and sea, Wizards of every race were likewise standing upon the various Spires. In a few moments they would begin, begin a spell the likes of which had not been tried since the Great Erudite War, so many millennia ago. The last time this spell was attempted, a cataclysm erupted that resulted in the sundering of Norrath and the creation of the burnt and destroyed area known as The Hole. Out of the many lesions learned from that incident by the Arcanists of the world was that such a spell was to powerful for any one race to attempt. It was not known exactly who had discovered it, or where the spell had come from, but it had been used with disastrous results. Some rumors even said that it was a spell stolen from the Great God of Magic Solusek Ro himself. That was why the spell failed so miserably, it was punishment for the mortal’s folly of pride and arrogance. After the spells first use, it was lost in the havoc and chaos that followed, presumably forever.<br>
<br>
But that had all changed with the discovery of Velious. The Frozen Continent was the oldest land in Norrath, the place where the Dragon Goddess Veeshan herself first placed her brood at the beginning of the world. Hidden within Velious’s ancient cities and deep dungeons were artifacts forged at the birth of all the races. Over the many years since the “Re-Founding” of Velious, many such objects have been discovered and brought back into the living history of Norrath. Unknown to all but a select few, Tzlar being one of them, the written spell of the Cataclysm had been discovered once again. It was whispered that the recent defeat of the Elven Goddess Tunare, in her home Plane of Growth, was somehow involved in its resurfacing. Whatever the reason, once the spell had been discovered it was secreted to the Temple of Solusek Ro, deep in the Lavastorm Mountains, to be studied. The greatest Wizards and scholars of the Arcane, all sworn to silence, were assembled to examine and experiment with the spell. Only after the Mystic Tazgar, long rumored to be an Oracle of Solusek Ro, announced that the time was at hand for its casting once again, did preparations begin. Seven of the most powerful Wizards from each race where assembled upon certain Spires throughout the face of Norrath. Even the Sea Bottom Spires, unknown to Wizards of the land dwelling races, was being used by the Kedge for this ceremony. <br>
<br>
At a certain time all those involved would begin their casting. Failure could mean the utter obliteration of all that existed. Even absolute success could alter the physical and spiritual properties of everything known. There had been the debates amongst those of the Art. Questions such as “Who are we to make such a decision” and “What gives us the right” were argued, sometimes violently, between all those involved. But, after all the discussion and philosophical differences were played out, all involved stood together as Arcanists. They were, first and foremost, above and beyond all oaths, promises and responsibilities, and in all things…Wizards. In the end, the answer was simply, “Because we are Wizards, the only true Servants of Magic, and we have decided it will be so”. Granted, virtually every other being upon Norrath may disagree, but what was all their objections, all their will, compared to the power of Wizards? What would this spell unleash? What new creations upon the world? For that matter, what new worlds may be open to the paths of the Arcane. Tzlar began to “feel” that the time was near, and joined hands with his Brothers and Sisters upon the Spires. As he began to chant with them, all thoughts except the spell left his mind, and his body was infused with a power he had never imagined possible. As one and with one voice, the greatest Wizards of Norrath, Good and Evil, Male and Female, Old and Young, spoke the words of power and thus did they unleash Magic, the Life-Blood of the Universe, into the fabric of all time and space. The spell took hold and the result was….             <br>
