Vladire, laying on her stomach beside Malelick under the beautiful dead trees of Nektulos, realized how much she had missed her home in the past weeks. <br>
<br>
 Scattering leaves on the ground with idle hands she looked to Maleick and asked if he was hungry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, it's getting late in the day. Should i send for something?&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;No, I'll go myself. It's beautiful weather for a short walk.&quot;<br>
<br>
She headed through the trees leaving Maleick dozing peacefully beside a log. Inside the halls of Neriak she was greeted warmly, meeting with old aquaintences along the way. At the entrance to her quarters she was approached by a formed element, almost standing guard. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, Vladire&quot;, an airy voice says.<br>
<br>
Instinctivly her hand moves to her weapon and she is surrounded by and air of tension. Jaw set, eyes locked. The element chuckles and states, &quot;So defensive you appear. Be calm, I am nothing to fear.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 With a small swirl of mist the element dissapears and Mythral stands before her. With the confusion of the last few days surrounding the Enchanter she does not let down her guard, but feels mostly at ease.<br>
<br>
&quot;And how are you this eve?&quot; He takes her hand and kisses it.<br>
<br>
Out of fear of the rumors (and embarrasment) she jerks her hand away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite well actually. I am gathering dinner for Maleick and I. He awaits me just outside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, may I join you? I have just prepared a stein of absinthe and I've no one to share it with.&quot;<br>
<br>
 His eyes bore into her. As if imploring to accept. They are beautiful and seem to change color if gazed at long enough. He is smiling. Absentmindedly she replies, &quot;Yes, please do.&quot;<br>
<br>
A strange feeling is encompassing her, almost as if she were being controlled. &quot;That is foolish&quot;, she reminds herself. <br>
<br>
They walk along quietly through the beautiful trees. Apon arriving back at the log they find Maleick awake and instructing young Teir'Dal Warriors, teaching them methods of destruction. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have company Maleick. Mythral just happened to be near the quarters.&quot; the fear and nervousness from before had nearly subsided.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh welcome Mythral, let us break bread and share a meal with you. It has been a while since we last met.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vladire has prepared a delicious dinner of steak and fruit and Mythral begins to speak of his battles in the past weeks. He is a great storyteller and his body and emotions dance with a sort of magical jubilance. His words are filled with rhymes and puns and jokes that errupt into laughter at times. The young couple listen intently with smiles on their faces before they realize that Mythral has refilled their pints of ale with absinthe 2 or 3 times over. Totally captivated by his words, they are led into the stories, into strange places, they see beautiful sunsets and the bloodiest of battle. And it all seems normal. As if it were order of the day the three are dancing and laughing like family. Mythral brings an end to his great tales and they sit, leaning comfortably against the log. Maleick releases a sigh of content and Mythral gives him sort of a half smile that emits the message 'rest'. After a short time Maleick is dozing again and Vladire is not far from it. Silently Mythral calls Vladires attention with his gaze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come to me&quot;, he says.<br>
<br>
In a trusting manner she moves closer to Mythral and he places his hand to her throat. Her eyes are level with his. His thumb traces the contour of her neck. Sternly he says, &quot;You will enforce my will.&quot; and with those words he bites deeply into her neck. Vladire blinks confusedly and releases a small cry of pain, but it is gone before she can think further of it.<br>
<br>
The couple awake to daylight poking through the leaves in the forest. They exchange puzzled glances, as they cannot remeber last nights events, or why they would choose to sleep in the forest. Their bodies stiffened and sore from the ground, they stand, and stretch and begin to make their way out of the forrest and back to the rigorous work they had only been able to take a small break from.<br>

<br>
The effort of will it took was enormous.  His fangs pierced her vein, and her energy, her life and her vitality flowed as he shifted them within the twin wounds.  He siphoned her blood, slowly at first, but then the pangs of hunger struck and he entered combat with his need, his aching lust, for more.  His lips adhered to her soft, indigo skin and his jaws worked continuously, shifting to free or stymie the flow as he gulped in her essence.  The flavor, the thrill, the power –all of it blended into an intoxication far greater than that which the absinthe had worked upon his two friends.<br>
<br>
“Easy, my love.  You will drain her to a husk at that rate.”  The voice whispered in his mind, and the shock of the invasion ripped his attention from his blood lust.  He pulled away from Vladire’s neck, and she cried aloud at his leaving, not from pain but from some deeper, far greater anguish.<br>
<br>
Fangs bared, eyes blazing with a yellow-green light, Mythral turned his bloodied face around and he searched with enhanced vision for the person who dared to violate the sanctity of his feast.  He opened his mouth and loosed a feral roar, half shriek of indignation and half agonized venting of frustration, but he saw no one at first.  Then, in the distance, in between the shadowed trees of Nektulos, he saw a lithe, almost spectral figure in shimmering white slip deeper into the woods.  With one agonized look at his food, he turned and raced after the intruder, intent upon protecting what now belonged to him.<br>
<br>
A gentle, teasing laughter, rippled through the forest’s stillness as Mythral transformed throgh a long-suppressed instinct and raced through the forest, fully given to the predatory rage in his blood.  His four paws raced through brush without leaving a print, his snout picking up the scent of blood that called him from behind, and something else – something vaguely familiar in the distance ahead.  The Mythral-wolf sped between trees, following her scent, tracking her at the exclusion of all the others in the wood that offered him nourishment and pleasure.  This one was different.  She was not food.  This one was a threat.<br>
<br>
Mythral emerged in a clearing and saw her up ahead – a solitary woman in white robes, skin as dark as that of the woman he had just tasted, but with eyes the same shape and color of his own.  Her pure white hair flowed in a perfect couture, not a strand out of place, across her shoulders and midway down her back.  Like a queen of the night, she stood in the center of the wood, straight and proud in bearing, and totally confident.  Hate erupted in his chest – how dare this THING invade his territory, interrup his feast!  Mythral lowered his head and charged across the meadow, fangs bared as he brought his legs under him to spring for her throat.<br>
<br>
In the next instant, his body crumbled under him as he lost all muscle control.  He skidded upon his shoulder, landing in a motionless mass at her feet.  His head lay on the grass of the meadow, and his left eye blazed as it stared up at the ghostly figure.  He fought to control himself, but could not.  His eye was wild with the angry urge to destroy her, but he was held bound in the same chains of force he had learned to master himself.  Instinctively, he knew she was more powerful by far than he was, yet he fought to destroy her just the same.  She dropped down to a knee, a proud smile upon her face.  He thought he would die, but instead she reached down and gently stroked the fur on the side of his face.  Her touch was so cold it nearly burned, but also was something he knew he had always craved.  This gesture, this affirmation, was the one thing in his life he had no power to attain on his own – it had to be given.  The anger and the blood lust fled, and with it so did his transformation.  The form of the predator, the spirit wolf, dissipated leaving him lying in black robes at the feet of the woman in white.<br>
<br>
Though she was standing beside him, she continued to speak in his mind, her lips never moving but her green eyes communicating with far greater effect than words could ever bring to bear.<br>
<br>
“You have begun to live up to your potential, at long last.  I am so very proud of you my love.”  Mythral stared up at her, still bound by her will, but the tears in his eyes began to pool instantly and roll down his face, mixing with the dark stains about his lips.<br>
<br>
“There, there, none of that now.  You are my son, the Scion of Mistmoore, that will never do.”  Her smile seemed so genuine, and she reached forward, wiping the tears from his cheeks.  “You left us to prove yourself worthy, so long ago.  And now, now you have finally done it.  You have made everything my father spent so long in the planning come true my son.  You are Mistmoore’s hero this day.”  He did not understand what she meant, but he did not care.  His mother, Llasna Mistmoore, the only daughter of Mayong, was treating him openly as her son, and nothing else in the black world of Norrath mattered.<br>
<br>
“You have much to learn my son, and tonight, I will begin your lessons.  The hunger is upon you and you must learn to control it.  You may feast on who or what you wish and when you will it, but you must learn control.  Another thee minutes, and that lovely young dear you were feeding upon would have passed into the undeath, becoming for you a much lesser servant than she will be if left to live.  Another five, and she would have been driven entirely from this existence, her very soul destroyed.”<br>
<br>
He focused upon her and replied in kind, the telepathy of his mother’s line working like rusty gears in a tinkerer’s machination.  “What must I do…mother.”<br>
<br>
She smiled broadly again, her own eyes glistening at the acknowledgement he made.  Then she rose and looked around the clearing to the far edge where two figures sat amidst baskets and bottles.  She beckoned him and the chains holding him faded.  He was free.  “She must rest and recover.  You drank too much too fast to practice upon her further.  But the male, ah he is enticing.”  Her eyes flared as she looked over the still form of Maleick, and she softly licked her own lips.  Mythral had not realized that she had led him on a chase back to the beginning, back to the site of the forest-outing of the two young lovers. “Yes,” she continued, “He will do quite nicely.  You will learn that your own pleasure will be enhanced by drawing slowly – the feast is a great honor for the chattel, it is the sacred duty that all others live only to fulfill.  It brings them great pleasure to give you their essence, and you must learn that their pleasures enhance your own.  Control your own lusts, feed their own, and they will be bound to you in this life and the next.”  Mythral nodded in understanding, and Llasna smiled softly.  “Good, I will go first on him – he is vital enough for us both if we are careful.  Watch and learn my son.”  Then her eyes blazed with yellow light and she bared her fangs and hissed like a serpent as she moved in upon the motionless warrior.<br>
