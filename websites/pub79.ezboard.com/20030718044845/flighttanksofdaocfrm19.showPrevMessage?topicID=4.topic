<br>
If I get rezzed mid battle and score a kill, I get RP's, rez sick or not.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at RP's for Rezzer code.  They cannot get RP's for rezzing someone that didn't give any RP's.  I know for a fact, that on raids where we got wiped out in a big battle, /transfercorspe, get rezed, buffed, head out, rez sickness drops before we battle again, then die....the Rezzer gets RP's again.  And the turnaround is much less than 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
In fact, in large scale battles where I get rezzed, I'll use Purge to get rid of Rez sickness.  If I die again, and get rezzed again, I'm worth RP's.  I know this for a fact because a close friend who plays a cleric was suprised once when he rezzed me twice withing a few minutes and I was worth RP's both times.  He asked me &quot;How come?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Everything I see says to me that once Rez sickness drops, you are worth RP's to an enemy player. <p>Kerrec Snowmane<br>

You would have to go back and search some very old grabbags to see that but thats what was said.  I believe its a timer like corpse summoner.   That its constantly on and if you die near the end of that timer, you give RPs very quickly, if you die at the beginning you don't.  Really quite simple.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with res sick or not.  I've been dead, released, removed res sick at a healers and went out to die right away again and not given RPs.  By the same token, I've died, ressed, died again and given RPs.<br>
