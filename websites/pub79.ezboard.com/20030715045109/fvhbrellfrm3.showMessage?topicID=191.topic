On days like this there was nothing to do but go fishing.  She rose, turned from her desk, and went to grab her pole and the carefully tied flies that she had made and placed here.  One of the sharp hooks punctured her finger and she smiled as she licked the blood.  <br>
<br>
A random thought that she still owed Khasirath a dinner and an evening of debate crossed her mind, and she turned to her desk to write the note inviting him.   She smiled thinking he would surely bring the pickled lizard that creapiing so loved.<br>
<br>
Creapiiing stoppped.  Spreading across her desk like so much fresh blood, the red ink soaked into the parchements there, dripped onto her chair and the beautifully woven carpets.  Visions of blood, flashes of those she had killed, blood she had drunk, ceremonies she had performed.  Blood --the essence of her life.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you a story a low voice whispered from behind her.  Creapiing stood completely still.  She froze knowing that somehow they had finally found a way to bribe their way in.  Today would be the day then.  She felt confident, strong.<br>
<br>
You see, Creapiing, your grandfather, whose armor you wear, my father, he is not as you perceived.  You have forsaken your family, your destiny, to pursue a life of honor.  Honor , the word rasped scathingly from her Mothers lips.   Creapiing tensed.  No, her mother continued, let me finish my story.  The voice continued, smoothly and from behind her, Creapiing did not move, knowing that to move now was death, she waited her opportunity.  Your Grandfather was not the honorable shadowknight you have fashioned yourself after.  He was a rogue, like me, the voice hissed.  He was the greatest deceiver in our family, a real legend.  He infiltrated the ranks of the best families in his guise.  He theived, manipulated, and yes, even assassinated.  He is yet honored as the one of the greatest shadowknights, but that prestige pales next to the legends of him and his deeds in the ranks of the Unseen Hands.<br>
<br>
The triumph in her mothers voice was clear as she continued, and now , my daughter, you have placed yourself in a position to become greater then your Grandfather.  You have infiltrated the Violent Harvest.  You have been very clever, daughter.  You have reputation, indisputed honor, and you are free to move about the city as you wish.  What fortune, what destiny is now in your hands to grasp.  Remember your training.<br>
<br>
The rage inside Creapiing built to an inferno pounding in her ears.  All reason left as she grabbed at painbringer and brought the weapon around to kill  her mother.   She saw nothing, but breathed in particles of dust that felt like a million needles in her throat and lungs.  Gasping, she clawed at her face and screamed in agony, or it seemed like she screamed --but no sound emerged.  Her mother emerged from the corner, hidden right in front of her eyes, Creapiing moaned.<br>
<br>
The agony was intense, and Creapiings Mother bent slowly over and kissed her on the forehead.  We claim you again as one of us, she whispered.  The threatening blackness cascaded upon her.<br>

She stood.  She looked dismayed.  This was no dream.  The red pool still spread across her desk and furniture.  She walked shakily to her desk and trailed her fingers through the red ink.  Her world was once again taken from her.  She moaned softly aloud remembering her mothers words.<br>
<br>
Her life was a lie.  Her world was deceit.  The simple cleanness of hate, tainted.  Honor, a facade she had hidden behind for a long time.  Creapiing idly swirled her fingers in the red pool on her desk.  Her own blood, was tainted.  She nodded to herself, as if to agree with her own thoughts.  One could not cleanse the dishonor of generations from ones blood.  If her grandfather had been the man her Mother said, then she had no honor in her blood, no chance at filtering out the deceit.  Odd, how the ink slowly congealed like blood.  Her fingers swirled about more.<br>
<br>
Creapiing wiped her hands on a cloak, the red stain would stay for some time on her hands, but she would not leave fingerprints.  But her mark, the mark she would leave, all would know.<br>
<br>
Creapiing called in her assistant.  I was gone but a short time, she lied.   One of my servants spilled ink on my desk.  Assemble them now so we can find out who the careless one is.  Her assistant scurried off, looking like she would kill whoever had done this to her masters office.<br>
<br>
One by One, the servants appeared.  Her assistant had brought in the guards, who now stood blocking the doors.  Fully 20 people, including guards, assistants and servants now stood in her office.  Is this everyone?  Her assistants angry face looked over the group and she said, Yes, this is all of them. Let the culprit stand forward.<br>
<br>
Creapiing grasped her weapon firmly.  <br>
<br>
None who who had served her, none who knew her secrets, none who had access to her ways, not one must live.  She motioned to the guards to not allow any out of the room.  Her assistants voice was a distant hum.  Her blade bit through her assistant cleanly.  Surprise on every face.  Creapiing swiftly went to her work.  As the last servant fell, Creapiing, muscles aching, drooped.  Then, giving no forewarning, she fell upon the two guards as well.  They fought well, but they were no match for the Reaper.<br>
<br>
Creapiing slid out of her armor.  She dropped her weapon.  She removed her boots, her cloths, and stood naked in the carnage.  Carefully, she spread equal amounts of the blood and red ink over her body.  She used a dagger to slash off her hair.  Her face she scratched with her own nails.  Her mane of white hair she left on her desk.<br>
<br>
Stumbling out the door, she left her office, ignoring the gasps and stares of those out in the street.<br>

Audible gasps were followed by silent parading behind the Reaper of the Violent Harvest.  Creapiing walked steadily, shoulders and head held firmly upright, eyes fixed on the future.  The eerie procession trailed silently behind her and carefully avoided her mark on the streets.  The path she chose this morning was one that she had intended to follow earlier.  This was the way to her favorite fishing spot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Creapiing stood on a boulder, next to the shore of the lake, and spread her arms wide.  She forced her body to become as rigid as death.  Then slowly, to the outcry of the crowd, she allowed herself to fall.<br>
<br>
Red gore, blood, ink, boiled up behind her and clouded the water.  <br>
<br>
The procession stood uncertain for a moment, then one brave Teir'dal jumped into the water.  The splash awoke the charmed onlookers.  Many jumped .  With each addition the water stirred the redness more until the children of Innoruuk floated in a sea of blood.<br>

The red trail was being obliterated by the thrashing bodies of those who jumped after her.  Soon they would have no hope of ever knowing where she went or whether she simply drowned.  Down she went.  The blessed darkness of the deep water beckoned to her. <br>
<br>
Flashes of the euphoria she had once had in this very pool went through her mind.  Khasirath pulling her body from the pool, both nearly drowned.  The longing she felt to cool her fevered body in its depths.<br>
<br>
Not this time.  She pushed her body harder and deeper into the embrace of the deep dark water.  Creapiings lungs ached.  The euphoria was a threatening cloud on her mind.  The darkness was overwhelming in this shadow of Neriak.  The depths blacker then an ebony drake.<br>
<br>
Creapiings hand scraped on rock.  Frenzied, she felt around.  The last of her air was gone.  Her hands moved frantically with the adrenaline of knowing she would drown soon.  Like  a manta she skimmed the bottom and sought three stones stacked in a pyramid.  What was she trying to remember?  Thoughts came sporadically.  Yes, an Air tube.  An escape route used by her rogue parents.  She tugged at the top boulder and pulled out a slim tube.  The top was cleverly capped so that it remained full of air.  She took a deep breath then gagged at the stale air.  Wet molds had grown in the long disuse of this tube.<br>
<br>
The air was foul, but it was enough.  Calm.  She forced calm upon herself.  Creapiing took another breath, trying to force the molds to the side of her mouth, and keep them out of her lungs.  Such a clever device.  Undoubtedly stolen from the gnomes.  Or tortured from them...<br>
<br>
Looking aroung Creapiing saw the opening she sought.  A small tunnel that would take her to the little known passageways.  Swimming smoothly now, her path assured, Creapiing turned toward the tunnel.<br>

Creapiing shivered.  Inside she was cold.  No creaking of armor would give her away.  No boots were on her feet to scuffle.  Bats could not be more silent as she slid through the tunnels under Neriak.<br>
<br>
Like the winged shadows she slid down the passage towards Freeport.  A smile lit her face at the pleasure she was going to take from this.  She emerged just inside Freeport into a city dotted with fires to hide the blessed darkness of Innoruuk.  She merged with the side of a house.  She waited.<br>
<br>
Please, I just lost all my gear, do you have anything I can have?  The words whined pitifully out the dwarf.  Creapiing smiled.  His boots from beneath his cloak gave him away.  A begger.  A dwarf begger.  Creapiing felt a surge of anticipation.  The citizen moved on after giving the rich begger some coin.  Creapiing stalked him into an alley.  The dwarf was counting his coin.  <br>
<br>
Silent death.  Thud.   Creapiing took the coin.  She tugged off his cloak.  She grabbed his flask.  Dwarven ale..foul but sufficient.  A dagger, she smiled.  The rest she would leave, for the freeport carrion to pick clean.  These humans were much worse then the rats.  Silent as Death she went  into the tunnels toward Neriak once again.  She still had one loose end to attend.<br>

You do not know my strength.  Creapiing smiled at the thoughts running through her head.  Her head pounded in a rhythmn that matched her racing feet as they headed back down the abandoned tunnels to Neriak.  She was strong.  She was ready.  She had proven to all her ability.<br>
<br>
Stealthily she approached Neriak from a different angle then before.  The Reaper of the Harvest was gone.  This woman with scratched face and short hair did not even resemble her former self.  One last thing to do, one last end to tie to assure her success.<br>
<br>
Hiding deep within the cloak Creapiing had taken from the Dwarven begger, she walked quickly and silently through the streets.  The city was humming with activity and it was long after the sun was up.  Creapiing smiled.  They were undoubtedly dredging the waterways looking for her body even now.  <br>
<br>
For a long time, Creapiing had slept in a different house, inn, or even corner each evening.  By avoiding the same location twice she minimized the likelihood of being poisoned or attacked.  She approached the inn where she had been expected to sleep at this eve.  Only one other person knew the location.  That person would be there waiting, with warm food at the ready and freshly laid blankets for her.<br>
<br>
Steadily, stealthily, she went up the stairs to her room.  Soundlessly she opened up the door to her room.  The food was ready, the blankets laid.  Kurmudgins back was to her.  He awaited her in the ill fitting clothes and armor that she kept him dressed in.  He was entirely non descript except for his enormous form.<br>
<br>
Soundlessly she walked across the room.  Quickly and accurately she drove the dagger she had stolen off the dwarf beggers body into the back of Kurmudgins neck.  With amazing quickness and strength the troll turned on her.  She moved with him as best as she could pushing downward with all her strength on the dagger.  The trolls massive arms came around and beat upon her.  Creapiing gasped for breath as the stumps pounded on her and she pressed harder and harder upon the blade.<br>
<br>
With a snap the blade broke.  The sudden release made Creapiing lose her balance and she rushed forward and tripped and fell on her face.  Blackness descended on her.  When  Creapiing awoke the was aching everywhere and an enormous weight had her pinned to the floor.  With a rush it all came back.  The stickiness on her face was blood.  Summoning what little strength she had left, Creapiing rolled the enormous body off of her.  Kurmudgins slow brain had not allowed him to admit he was dead until his attacker lay at his feet.  Then he had fallen upon her.  Gingerly she checked her ribs.  She seemed to have come out mostly unharmed.<br>
<br>
The tea and food was still tepid and Creapiings stomach rumbled.  She forced herself to sit and eat and drink.  Then quietly, she stripped off the too small armor and weapons from the troll.  No one questioned the quality of the armor she had given her slave.  The ill fit had turned aside curiousity.  These supple leathers would fit her much more now then the plate mail she had worn yesterday.  The stillettos fit her hand nicely.  <br>
<br>
Not one person would ever mistake Creapiing for less then extremely dangerous.  And not one would recognize her as the *former* Reaper of the Violent Harvest.   Dressed she noisely left the room and walked out of the inn to listen to the rumors on the streets, and to send a message.<br>

Teir'dal presence in  this wood has always been recorded, though little is known of most of them.  Kithicore lacked the soothing darkness of Nektulos, but it had a freedom--the freedom from prying eyes of the Teir'dal.  This cabin, dark and unnoticed, would have surprised anyone brave enough to actually enter its black recesses. A dark stairway led down into the earth itself,  into beautifully furnished rooms that belied the size and condition of the exterior of the cabin.<br>
<br>
Creapiing sprawled out on a comfortable bed snoring loudly.  Her bath had been cleansing.  The removal of the grime made all the pain and fatigue of the last day rush to meet her, and she had happily laid down to reset herself for the work yet to come.<br>
<br>
Choking she awoke to the Mad Ones laughter, and spat the rancid wine back at him.  Mad One, she warned, never approach me in my sleep again, or ...die..., She whispered the last word more as a truth then a threat.  Are the rest assembling?  She cautiously took the flask and then took a long drink.  Like the heat of Lavastorm, the liquor rushed through her veins.  She reached to straighten her hair our of  habit, but found none to straighten. <br>
<br>
Dark names, dark shadows. assembled under the cabin in the wood.  Nospiratus....Creapiing....Vinar...Imrahil... Xosha...Ixtab...Ueudiinya... Names of power.  Innoruuk himself must have felt the tremor in Norrath and he graced this meeting with a dark presence.  Parchment seemed thrown about the room and those inside  argued and debated through the night.<br>

A decision had been made.  The small group had a unified purpose.  Vinar, former Thresher of the Violent Harvest, had taken off his luxurious robes that marked him as a Wizard, and replaced them with the black and red leathers that the group favored.  Standing together they resembled not so much a crowd, as a caterpilar with many legs.  Like a caterpilar they  moved in a single sinuous movement.<br>
<br>
Vinars arm moved above them all briefly and a red glow swaddled the group and then they disappeared leaving only a red mist swirling.<br>
<br>
Creapiing felt the rush of remembering.  Her feet instictively moved silently.  All the years of rogue training congealed in her, tempered by her time as a Shadowknight of Innoruuk.   Her time was now.  All these years she had hated.  She had hated rogues.  She had hated her parents.  She had hated herself.  Today, her hate solidified into a single mass of strength, confidence. and purpose.  Today, she was not revered leader of the Violent Harvest, but rather a single pair of legs of the centipede that would forever change the face of Norrath.<br>
<br>
The group stood there, confident that no one saw them, but each looking to see if anyone noticed them.  Stilletos and main gauches flickered in every hand.  They walked silently and swiftly toward their objective.<br>
<br>
Mistmoor was filled with undead, huge gargoyles that loomed and popped to life if anyone strayed too close, and warped shrieking creatures to horrible for description.  Apprentices and students walked through this evil place.  The group moved silently and unnoticed.  They approached the castle mistmoor from the graveyard, filtering in through the invisible walls and hidden doorways.  Past the guards, they slid undetected.<br>
<br>
The opulence of this place was truly astounding.  Plush carpets and artistry were everywhere.   Creapiing doubted anyone had ever gotten so deep within Mistmoors walls before undetected.  Mythral had done well in disarming all the sigils.  The lure of his inheritence and disdain for his family had made Mythral a willing accomplice.<br>
<br>
Mayong Mistmoor was planning his next move.  He poured over maps in the Castle Mistmoor today.  Your time has come, a voice whispered in his ear.  Then his blood splurted from eight separate wounds and soaked the carpets and parchements around him.  Creapiing reached down, unhooked the axe from mayong, and with  a chop, finished their business in the Castle Mistmoor.<br>
<br>
In a swirl of red, they disappeared.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
A bag landed with a solid thud upon the desk of Daiunus, newly appointed Thresher of the Violent Harvest.  His assistant shrugged unknowingly.  Just arrived, he said, it came with this envelope.  <br>
<br>
Daiunus reached first for the envelope.  Thresher.  The one word upon it.  Gingerly he opened the envelop and pulled out a thick parchement and began to read:<br>
<br>
<br>
    Daiunus, newly appointed Thresher for the Violent Harvest, let us introduce ourselves.  Under the leadership of the Subati Razorback, a special ministry was formed called the Breagan D'Aerthe.  The Breagan D'Aerthe is a single unit that exists for clandestine operations both on their own initiative and at the request of the Thresher of the Violent Harvest.  We report to no one else.   Though most consider our existence to be rumor or myth, we would like to assure you that we do indeed exist.<br>
<br>
  At this time we choose to remain anonymous, though some or all of us may choose to reveal ourselves to you in the future should you prove to be strong in hate and Innoruuks blessings.<br>
<br>
  As a token, we have sent you a gift that represents our latest intervention in the operations of Norrath.<br>
<br>
  Should you ever need us you may leave a message with the hafling that swims inside the glass at the blind fish.<br>

This is a bit of a rewind, about an hour or so after Creapiing first left the Grange.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Khasirath walked through the streets of Neriak with his Mace in his hand.  There was a great commotion in the streets, guards and citizens rushing about in confusion, many heading towards the lake.  He could only hear snippets of the rumors… something about a mad woman walking the streets.  The Knight frowned deeply as he turned away from the crowd towards the Grange, a foreign uneasiness tightening in his gut.<br>
<br>
Approaching the Grange he saw at once that the madness reached even here.  Twice the normal guards stood at the door.  The door!  It was closed!  Never in his time with the Harvest had he seen this before; always the Grange stood open to admit the faithful who may wish entry to speak with the Chosen.  His pace quickened as he drew closer, and one guard pulled open the heavy stone door as he was recognized.<br>
<br>
Within the Grange the faces that he saw were singularly grim and lost.  A servant of the Grange rushed to meet him as soon as his boots crossed the threshold.  The man’s face was stricken with barely controlled panic, “Dire Overlord!  You must come at once to the Reaper’s office.”<br>
<br>
“Lead on, then,” Khasirath snapped.<br>
<br>
The man all but scurried down the hall, his shoulders hunched with dread.  Khasirath followed with steady strides, rigidly controlling himself.  He knew that whatever crisis might await, his strength must be something the Harvest could depend on.<br>
<br>
Outside the Reaper’s office stood four of their senior guards, veterans all.  Each one’s face was a steely mask, but even in their eyes Khasirath saw the apprehension that had fallen like a shroud over the Grange.  The four guards saluted him and stepped aside.  Quickly and nervously the servant unlocked the office door and held it open for the Knight.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation Khasirath walked in, through the apprentice’s room to the office proper.  This door was also closed, and Khasirath pulled it open before the scuttling servant had a chance to.  In the doorway he stopped, stunned by the devastation within.<br>
<br>
The dark and finely appointed office was an abattoir.  The charnel reek of death seemed to envelop Khasirath as he struggled to take it all in.  At first he could not accept that he was seeing this here, in the heart of the Grange.  It simply could not be!<br>
<br>
Dimly he realized that the servant was prattling on, trying to explain.  But the words meant nothing.  Khasirath clenched his eyes shut, his head lowering as his entire body tensed.  A feral snarl twisted his face as he turned back to the servant, his hands curled into tight fists.<br>
<br>
“Get out,” Khasirath growled deeply, the words almost swallowed by the rage in his voice.<br>
<br>
“B...but my Lord!” the servant stammered, taking a step back.<br>
<br>
“GET OUT!  Let no one else enter!” Khasirath roared, driving the servant back and all but shoving him into the hall.  He tore the key from the man’s hand and slammed the door shut, locking it from within.<br>
<br>
He tossed the key onto the apprentice’s desk and walked slowly back into the inner office.  He could feel the tension in his entire body, almost to the point of trembling from the stress.  Leaning against the doorframe he closed his eyes once again and drew three deep breaths, forcing himself to relax.<br>
<br>
Opening his eyes again he entered the office.  The lighting was dim, as always.  Teir`Dal did not require much light to see, even underground.  Slowly he walked among the bodies, counting and identifying them.  Two guards, eighteen servants.  He recognized all of them, knew them to be Creapiing’s assistants and helpers.  They lay jumbled together right where they had fallen.<br>
<br>
The wounds, the patterns of cuts… Those he knew just as well.  He had fought beside Creapiing as often as he was able, watched her in the Arena.  He knew her skill, her style.  None other could have killed these men and women but the Reaper herself.<br>
<br>
He forced himself to observe without emotion, though the strain was telling.  The blood was everywhere and the smell permeated everything.  The bodies could not have lain here long, but still death crouched heavy and restless around him.  The Reaper’s armour, and her weapons were all thrown about carelessly.<br>
<br>
The desk was covered in papers; many had spilled to the floor.  The red of the ink and the blood co-mingled ‘til they seemed one and the same.  For a long time he stared at the desk, memories of the times he has spent in that office with Creapiing blinding him to the horrid reality around him.<br>
<br>
As he came back to himself his gaze struck on a patch of bright white on the dark and stained parchments.  Stepping over the corpses he walked closer, and realized what it was he was seeing.  Hair – The Reaper’s beautiful mane of hair stained in blood and roughly chopped off.<br>
<br>
Slowly he pulled off his gloves and tucked them under his belt.  He carefully gathered up the thick white bundle of hair.  It was so much softer than he had imagined.  His jaw clenched tightly as he lifted it to his face, feeling the softness against his cheek and lips as her scent for a moment eclipsed the smell of blood.  Almost reverently he tucked the hair away into a pouch tied on his belt.<br>
<br>
It was all too much.  Deep in his heart he knew that he would never see her again.  He walked around the desk and set heavily in her chair.  Putting his head back, silently he wept.<br>

The proof sat before him, the head of his once and former Lord, a creature as powerful as a god, and one that could only be destroyed by legendary warriors.  The Breagan D'Aerthe would be one of those legends, a childhood fantasy that was now bound in truth.  Daiunus could not stifle a laugh as he thought of the legends of Innoruuk being at his call, it was just unbelievable.  Daiunus looked back at the wardesk and the plans upon it, knowing that even the most difficult plans just became possible.<br>
<br>
The new Thresher looked at his assistant, &quot; Destroy this letter, and the envelope, I will not soon forget the words or directions written within.  The bag,&quot;  Daiunus hesitated, &quot; leave the bag, I will hide this well myself.&quot;  With that, the assistant took the letter and brought it to the heat of the torch that Daiunus had lit in order to read his letters, and warplans.  The assistant then left the room, leaving the Thresher to his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Daiunus raised the head from the bag, looking directly into the cold, lifeless eyes of Mayong Mistmoore, &quot; Aye M'lord,&quot; Daiunus said with sarcasm dripping of venom and Hate, &quot; The Breagan D'Aerthe do exist, and they are behind me and the Harvest.&quot;  Daiunus sank back into his chair, tossing the gift of the Breagan D'Aerthe unto the wardesk, for him to admire while he sat contemplating the next move that he would make.<br>

The servant and guards had heard nothing while he had been inside, and had continued to guard the door as ordered.  Khasirath walked slowly, almost stiffly.  His face was a passionless mask, and the redness of his eyes could easily be mistaken for the rage that was common to the Chosen.<br>
<br>
The servant bowed low as the Dire Overlord stepped out and handed him the keys. “Have some men take the dead out of there.  They are to be burned,” he said simply.<br>
<br>
Blinking in confusion, the servant stuttered, “But… but my Lord, the dead are always taken to the Lodge for their experiments…”<br>
<br>
Khasirath snarled as he suddenly grabbed the man by the tunic, pulling him close and almost off his feet, “I will not be questioned, fool!  I said burn them.  You will see it done yourself, or you will join the dead.”<br>
<br>
Pushing the servant back against the wall of the hallway, Khasirath turned away.  Regaining control of his anger he looked back over his shoulder at the cowering man.  “Once the bodies are removed, you will gather my personal servants to see to the cleaning.  I will give them my own instructions.”<br>
<br>
Slowly the Dire Overlord walked back through the Grange to his office.  He nodded to those he passed, but did not stop to talk.  He had no real answers for them, and had much thinking still to do.<br>
<br>
Inside his office he gave his manservant Dythos explicit directions for the ones who would be cleaning the Reaper’s office.  Once the young Rogue had hurried off to deliver the orders Khasirath sat back in his chair, sighing deeply.<br>
<br>
Burning the bodies would most likely bring a review from the Lodge.  But he could face Nezzka Tolax and his displeasure.  Whatever had come over Creapiing it seemed clear to him that she wanted those people silenced.  He knew they all served her, and as such may have known something that should not be passed on.  The Lodge of the Dead was most canny when it came to unearthing information.  Access to those bodies would be almost the same as giving them the keys to her office.<br>
<br>
Even without understanding what this all meant, and what would happen now, Khasirath knew he must do what he could to support and assist the Reaper.<br>
<br>
Khasirath walked to the side table of the office, and set a cone of incense in the small brazier he kept there.  He lit it and sat back down in his chair, trying to relax as the familiar scent filled the air.  He found his thoughts far too chaotic to properly meditate, the concerns and the loss filling his mind.<br>
<br>
He unclasped his bracers and put them on his desk, then drew a keen-edged dagger from his belt.  Slowly he drew the blade across his wrist, slim parallel lines of blood welling up.  His eyes half closed as he centered on the pain, letting it drive all thoughts from his mind until stillness reigned within.<br>
<br>
Setting the blade down he licked the blood from his wrist, a soft growling sigh leaving him as his hate finally flared to life, bringing him into harmony with his God.  Resting his head back his body grew still as he sank into communion with Innoruuk.<br>
