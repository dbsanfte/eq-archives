A fight in Cazic Thule<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
/ooc With some added embellishment, this did happen. Oh, and for those who need translation of what this is all about, I was proud to hit for 82 with my flying kick. This is a small tribute to my pride at the event.  <br>
<br>
“Hate with Honor, Harvesst,” came the shout from the temple courtyard.<br>
<br>
From somewhere within the depths of the large complex, a lone voice responded, “Hail to the Harvesst! Come join us Ambassador.”<br>
<br>
If Vresk was pleased to hear the voice of the Thresher of the Harvest, he showed no sign of it. After obtaining the location of the group Khasirath led, the monk set out on his way.<br>
<br>
It was not a far distance, and much of it was under water, which seemed to aid his journey. He emerged from the strangely blue waters of the “sewers,” and loped along the enclosed path toward the even stranger green waters that lay beyond. It was at this pool’s edge that he found the Thresher.<br>
<br>
Or what he later determined was the Thresher. The sight the Ambassador to Kunark was met with was disturbing indeed. There, an entire pack of wolves, with blue coats and red eyes all, stared at the approaching Iksar. He slowed as he approached, wary but confident of his position. It was then that the largest of the wolves stepped forward, and in a clear voice invited him into the group. “Greetings Ambassador,” the Khasirath/wolf said.<br>
<br>
Vresk, seeming oblivious to the fact that the Teir’Dal was somehow a wolf, bowed low. “Dark Tidingss, Thresher. I await your insstructionss.”<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until the magics wore off that the situation became clear to him. The druid that left as he approached must have been responsible. Vresk was happy to see that the Thresher’s curse was only temporary.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, he allowed the barbarian to cast his magics upon him. Though he was of inferior stock than Tiller Payle (as evidenced not only by the fact that this “barbarian” stood perhaps 2 feet tall, but that he was too short-sighted to have joined the Harvest), he had a use. Perhaps when all was done, the Ambassador would keep him as a pet.<br>
<br>
With the aid of the barbarian’s magic, he was able to move swiftly, pulling dozens of the resident alligators from their nests and into the waiting weapons of his group. Time passed in a hot blaze of blood, weapons, and the rush of battle.<br>
<br>
Still, something was missing. Nothing here really lit the fires of Hate that Vresk so wanted to seek. He had joined the Harvest for the purpose of unlocking this emotion. He felt disappointed that he could not show the Thresher what he could truly do.<br>
<br>
His inner disappointment did not show. In fact, he did not even allow himself the luxury of feeling such a feeble emotion. It was just something that existed. The monk slipped once again into the cool waters of the green pool<br>
<br>
Not seeing anything initially, he swam deeper in, the powerful strokes of his long tail propelling him forward at great speed. In the far corner of the pool, Vresk could see a dim shape looming. Curious, he turned and headed toward it.<br>
<br>
From the size and shape of the shadows in the murk, he could tell that this was no alligator, but the cloudiness of the water prevented him from clearly seeing until he was almost on top of it. A lizard champion looked at him, its bright green skin almost blending into the surrounding water.<br>
<br>
Vresk had been in the Temple for only a short time, but had made a name for himself in that period. The lizards that populated the place either feared him, or loathed him, depending on their relative power. The more powerful (such as the one before him now), sought to use Lord Cazic Thule’s power to invoke Fear within his breast. Little did they realize that he, too, was a product of the Lord of Fear. Then again, little could be expected from creatures that acted upon their primal urges far more than reason.<br>
<br>
As Vresk approached, the lizardman snarled. “Die, soft skin,” it said. Looking back, Vresk would realize that the dim intelligence of these creatures probably precluding them addressing anything unlike them as anything other than “Soft skin.” But this wasn’t later. This was war, and in Vresk’s mind, that last word meant nothing less than genocide.<br>
<br>
Reflexively, his monk training kicked in, clamping down tightly on any emotion he may have felt.<br>
<br>
Khasirath and the other two in the group looked on expectantly as the form rose out of the pool. Vresk lunged out seeming in slow motion, water cascading off his scaled in a steady stream. For a brief moment, the Thresher caught the Ambassador’s eye, only determination and death was to be seen in his eye.<br>
<br>
On the monk’s heels came the lizardman. Not quite as lythe in the water as the Iksar, the creature climbed out, fists swinging. The group quickly closed in, with the shaman hanging back to do whatever it was that casters do during battle. Vresk couldn’t care less. Deep within him, the Flame of Hate was fanning intself into an inferno.<br>
<br>
Combat went on for almost a full minute with nothing different than any other. Though they took some damage, their healer was competent, and no true danger was in reach. The Thresher was calm, if determined, the blows from his large two-handed blade striking deep into the flesh of the lizardman. As was normal, the monk’s blows rained in faster, but not as hard. Still, Khasirath noted a difference in this battle. He decided to keep a careful eye on his guildmate.<br>
<br>
Fury built within him until Vresk could hold it no more. He snarled and hissed loudly. The lizardman, too stupid to realize it was losing the battle, turned to the Iksar. “What iss the matter, ssoft sskin? Afraid to losse?”<br>
<br>
The monk saw red. After a flurry of blows that did little other than glance off the scales of his opponent, Vresk took a step forward, closing the small gap between them. The Thresher thanked the skill of his own blade, for had he not been so skilled, his last blow would have struck the Ambassador instead of its intended target.<br>
<br>
Still in motion, the monk spun in a circle, exposing his back. The lizard champion, dimly sensing an opportunity, moved to strike. It was surprised when a strong force knocked it easily to the side. It turned to see Vresk’s tail completing it’s arc and the monk facing him again.<br>
<br>
Snarling, the lizardman moved forward again, and the monk met him head on in a blind fury of hand strikes and blocks. Grunting its frustration, it lunged forward, trying one last time to land a blow.<br>
<br>
Vresk wasn’t there. He leapt into the air at the last moment, using the momentum of the move in a massive kick. Because the lizard’s last blow missed, its back was slightly turned. The monk struck at the base of the neck, his hardened foot leading the way.<br>
<br>
There was a sickening crunch of grinding bone and gristle that sent a shiver up the spines of all present. The lizardman’s spine was severed instantly, its body going slack and right eye twitching randomly.<br>
<br>
The Hate within Vresk had yet to be satiated. His fists flashed out, the blows preventing the limp body from touching the ground. And while his arms worked, his leg muscles tensed, preparing for another kick.<br>
<br>
Khasirath and the light-skins present stopped their fight and stood back; the Thresher in approval, and the lightdwellers in awed disbelief.<br>
<br>
The Ambassador took to the air once more. The blow, if possible, was even more devastating, striking the lizardman in the chest. Blood gushed from the mouth of the dying lizard as its heart exploded from the pressure. All present were showered in blood.<br>
<br>
The body hitting the ground was like a switch. All of the monk’s training was back in full force. He turned, and without a word, slipped back into the water too search for more prey.<br>
<br>
It was a full minute before they fully recovered. It was the barbarian who responded first. “Wh…what the HELL was that?!” he demanded.<br>
<br>
Khasirath, a playful smirk dancing on his face, turned. “He doesn’t like being called soft skin,” he said casually.<br>
