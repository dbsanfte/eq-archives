A faint smile pulled upon her lips as she recalled the banter with Kasirath. What was simple beautiful was the man actually thought she was kidding. But she was'nt. She was a woman of high ideals and long reaching plans. She would gain what she sought. <br>
Imagine her surprise to come upon a ranger carrying the noble tag of the harvest. At first she had thought it a jest and had been prepared to call him out for reviling a most respected guild. <br>
She had then confronted Khasirath over the matter. Insisting that to let the light dwellers into their stronghold only weakened them. For was it not said that the strongest chain is judged by its weakest link? Khasirath gave her her first lesson. Each creature no matter their race had a use in the harvest. Even the pale faced elves. <br>
After much discussion he had convinced her to see things from his point of view and she had begun to practice what he preached. Much to her chagrin she realized how right he was. The case in point was proven to her as she ran hellbent for leather from a rather nasty swarm of goblins and some fool druid for some odd reason had cast the wolven spirits  upon her. Boy was'nt he surprised to find a knife sticking from his chest in thanks. Would teach the imbicile not to just cast his magic about all willy nilly.<br>
Feral grinned at this. He was indeed correct. They had their uses. A thought then came to her. Perhaps the best way to learn more was to offer her services to them. And thus with this idea in mind she began to seek out Khasirath once more. To queary him on who she must speak to for admittance. <br>

At Feral's negative reply she assigned one. &quot;In the South of the Karana's you'll find the Splitpaw, bring me two of their skins.&quot; Feral nodded this would be very easy she thought to herself. Then came the rub, &quot;And from the treants you'll find nearby, I want two pieces of wood.&quot; <br>
If at all possible Feral may have paled at this. Then the grin came. Oh this would at least be fun!<br>
<br>
It did'nt take Feral long to find the Splitpaws, and a cleric in need of a tank. For but a moment Feral hesitating joining the High Elf in her hunts. Then The Threshers lesson returned and Feral joined her. During the hunt there where a few times when Feral wanted desperately to turn her blade on the fool cleric but she held off. What was it about Clerics who felt the need to pull and tank that irratated Feral so much? Perhaps it was the fact that this one felt also the need to try to teach Feral her job! <br>
<br>
Upon recieving her second skin she did not tarry there much longer. And with a quick farewell she was off to find the treants. Thanking Innoruuk that that had'nt taken very long. She moved to the northeastern part of the plains. And nearly fell right on top of the twisted wierd tree's. By the Shadows they where grotesque! An abomination! Ferals fingers itched to sink her blade into their bark. Twas a good thing that caution prevailed and she saught out a partner.<br>
<br>
Feral felt a bit more at ease when she was able to enlist the aid of a traveling Necromancer. They sat for some time discussing their course of action. Then upon deciding who would do what Feral moved to take her stance. And waited .. waited for the word.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; One word, was all he uttered and all that was needed for Feral to let the arrow, already notched and ready, fly. Big mistake. Ferals eyes widened and her heart actually skipped a beat in excitement as not one but both of the lumbering tree's came towards her. The first to reach her recieved the touch, she laughed as it recoiled from the touch of hatred. <br>
<br>
Wood bits flew as she hacked upon it, ignoring the other that reigned crushing blows down upon her. Mentally screaming at the Necro to get his damn spells off! Then at last relief came as the second treant ran screaming from her. The first fell at her feet shortly after. Quickly she gathered a wooden chunk as she waited for the second to return. <br>
<br>
The second returned shortly afterwards and the battle began in earnest. This one proved a tad bit tougher than the previous one. &quot;Any day now you walking pile of bones!&quot; Feral snarled at her pet. Grinning maniacally as both her pet and the Necro's pet jumped the silly tree monster from behind. The battled seemed to take hours but in fact only lasted a few short moments before this tree too fell with a mighty crash, narrowly missing Feral. <br>
<br>
The second bit of wood gathered Feral sat binding her various wounds. She shook her head at the pile of dust a few feet from the fallen treant. Her pet certainly did'nt last very long. Oh well. He had served his purpose. Tiredly Feral rose and saluted the Necro before turning away. A slight limp to her gait she set off. Now to find Overlord Faeolin and a sponsor...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uferalssyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FeralSsyn </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/2/01 1:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Eve</span><hr size=1> (continued from &quot;Petition of Joining&quot;)<br>
Later, much later, Feral stirred once more in her chair. She blinked at the fire that now lay dying in the hearth. A soft sigh escaped as she shifted again her hands folding in her lap. <br>
Emerald eyes closed as her mind wandered.... <br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet as a mouse now.. ya dont want em to hear you coming!&quot; the voice cautioned the young girl as she watched the &quot;Fancy Folk&quot; wander past the alley she stood in. Her hands itched with a need she could not really define in her young years. She shot a glare over her shoulder to the older rogue who stood behind her. Nallin was of gnomish descent. His old/young face twisted with scars. His coal black eyes burned with greed. Gods how she hated him, but he kept her fed. Well, enough to keep her alive and in his service at any rate. <br>
A shove to her back sent her thoughts back to the pair now almost out of sight. &quot;Damn girl, dont ya be lettin' em get away now.. go to it!&quot; and she was off. It was supposed to be simple really. Bump up against the man, at the same time lighten the load of his purse. <br>
However, something went wrong the moment Feral bumped into the &quot;Fancy Man&quot;. An energy she'd not felt before seemed to give her a bit of a jolt. Her instincts screamed in reaction just a second to late. As her fingers curled about the purse, a shackling grip curled about her own wrist. <br>
A soft growl of protest escaped from the childs lips as the Man tightened his grip to a crushing one. Any second now, just a tad more pressure and she was certain she'd feel the bones snap in protest. Like a wildcat let loose from the bag she came unglued. NO ONE held her without her consent damn it. Feet, fist and nails flew, as she clawed at his wrist, tried to knee him, kick him. Anything to gain release. That Nillan was probably long gone. He'd not stick around to assist her. <br>
Sudden light exploded in her mind. Her head literally rang with deafening sound as she found herself suddenly and quite rudely meeting the coblestone. In a daze she looked at Him, a moment of confusion beginning to lift. Pure hatred filling her, combating with rage. Agily she lept to her feet, her hand coming in contact with his chest. She gasped as she felt a sudden jolt and watched in shock as he staggered back a wee bit. <br>
Dumbly she looked at the palm of her hand. So shocked and confused as to where That had come from she did'nt even notice the anger now very prominent on the Mans face. &quot;Why you... &quot; He gritted out.. &quot;Fine you wanna trade blow for blow?&quot; Was the last she heard as sudden darkness descended. His touch far more powerful than hers sent her quickly near deaths door.... <br>

The pounding in her head pulled a soft groan from her as she lifted herself slightly. &quot;Bout time you woke up street rat.&quot; The uttered words had her stiffening even though her muscles screamed in protest. Bunching herself up she prepared to battle. Even as the Man continued to speak. &quot;Your lucky I did'nt take your head. I dont know why I did'nt. One less smelly urchin would have done Neriak good.&quot; <br>
He shot a glare at her then deliberatly turned his back to her as if daring her to take her best shot. And take it she would have had she not found herself suddenly paralized. Frozen and unable to move anything except her eyes. <br>
She looked towards the door just as the woman entered. It dawned upon Feral that she was the reason she now found herself immobile. &quot;Tsk tsk, Khel. Is'nt she a bit small fer a sparring partner?&quot; The woman softly chided him as she moved towards Feral. &quot;Now now, calm yerself Child. There's no need for more violance.&quot;<br>
A soft utterance from the woman and Feral found herself released. She remained however prepared to take her chances and run for the door. Warily she watched as the woman set a tray down upon the floor beside her. &quot;Eat Child.&quot;<br>
Feral did'nt move as the woman then turned to the man. &quot;She has the touch Khel. What harm would it do to teach her to use it? Save perhaps turn her into someone of worth.&quot;<br>
&quot;Bah! I've no time to be training some whelp, Narise.&quot; He fell silent at the look in her eyes, then sighed. &quot;Very well, but the first time she comes for my throat.. &quot; He left the threat unfinished as he and the woman left Feral alone in the small room. <br>
<br>
A loud snap in the hearth drew Feral from her thoughts. A faint grim smile pulled upon her lips as she rose from the chair. Gripping the sheathed sword she wandered from the hall. Dwelling on the past was for the old. A good spat of hunting would quickly clear the cobwebs of the past.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ueuridicee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euridicee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 7:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Eve</span><hr size=1> NT /em Blush <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ueuridicee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euridicee</A> at: 12/5/01 7:25:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uferalssyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FeralSsyn </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 7:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Eve</span><hr size=1> Feral found herself pacing back and forth as she waited for someone..

Wondering if Overlord Faeolin would allow her to keep one as a remembrance?<br>
A soft sigh escaped her. Oh she hated this most of all. The waiting. To occupy her thoughts she thought on those she had met. Time and again she found herself pulled back to Overlord Faeolin and The Thresher... Now there was a Woman to immulate, and much could she learn of her chosen craft from Him. <br>
Bah, Chosen? More like god given talent. She giggled softly at this and glanced about to be sure non had heard such an unadult like sound.

She held herself stiffly awaiting his reply.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udaiunus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daiunus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/6/01 10:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Eve</span><hr size=1> &quot;Aye, I will sponsor you, but know this, if you disgrace yourself, you disgrace me... and I will not have that.

I will teach you the ways of the Harvest and the ways of the Knights of Innoruuk if you wish.  And if you will accept my conditions of sponsorship regarding your life, then you have a sponsor.&quot;  With that, Daiunus looks at the Seed, awaiting whether she will accept the terms or walk away from the Shadowknight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uferalssyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FeralSsyn </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/7/01 2:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Eve</span><hr size=1> She nods stiffly. &quot;I will accept your terms M'lord.
