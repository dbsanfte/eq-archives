I do not want to stir anything up among you.  But. You.  Are.  All. Spoiled.  I'm sorry for your nerf because now you'll have to get used to beng in the same boat as BMs and mercs.  For some reason you seem to have forgotten what a light tank is.  A light tank*should not*, no matter the circumstances, realiably take down a main tank.  I do not care what Mythic says.  Just...no friggin' way.  You're all complaining about a nerf that is deserved.  I do not care if you are all used to handing out damage by the bucket.  How can you really belive it's okay that you can 2-3-shot people?  A light tank is supposed to rely on positionals.  Did you forget that?  You should never have been able to spam Doublefrost for ungodly damage.  Look at Misty Gloom, DW's 16 spec anytime style.  Misty Gloom is well known as being the WORST style in the game.  My fellow mercs who spec slash can replace Misty Gloom with Amethyst Slash, but our thruster brethren rely on Misty Gloom.  You can spam Double Frost like no tomorrow, even after the nerf.  From what I can tell, you use LA style primarily and use base weaps for filler.  Ever notice on the Merc and BM reports how it is constantly stated how we use base weapon styles, CDW for filler?  You are*still*better off than us.  Ever notice how the majority of the CDW styles suck?  They really do.  Majority of them are just thrown together.  You don't realize the pain we've been through because of you.  I don't even know if you guys could bend over to tie your shoes because of the balance issues pre-1.62.  Post-1.62 you are still more viable to play than mercs or BMs.  No.  You don't have Flurry.  Yes, you still have better style damage.  No you can't spec in shield.  Yes, only .5 percent of the BM and merc population specs shield higher than 7.  You lose all parry and evade and half your AF for 20 seconds.  20 seconds.  Really, do you really evade and parry enough in twenty seconds that you sometimes refrain from Frenzy?  If so then you are still not in the same boat as Mercs and BMs.  I do not know if it's true or not, but I read somewhere on your board speccing LA gets you higher evade chance.  Glance over to Merc Ask TL, second page of 'Cath, are any of these going to be addressed?'  You'll notice that both BM and Zerker take significantly less damage than a mercenary over time.  If the LA=More Evade is true, you're damaged for even less than the Blademaster, making the Berserker even more defensive than Blademaster.  Ever notice how you get Avoid Pain?  We don't.  Probably never will.  So, you all take less damage than Mercs and BMs over time and you get Avoid Pain.  How can you really justify that?  Blademasters*need*TW.  Ever glance at Hippy Land styles as a whole?  Pierce is the only line that doesn't look like it was just thrown together.  So hm...all three weapon lines for you are worth speccing.  With mercs Slash is reasonably best, crush second and thrust only if you're Saracen.  But BMs....only one line is actually pretty nice?  How do you justify that?  Please tell me.  How is it you believe Mercenaries have a better class skill than you?  Dirty Tricks isn't that great.  It's a proc for one, so if you are really unlucky it won't fire at all.  A 35% proc that causes a 50% chance to fumble.  How is that better than critting every hit for 20 seconds?  Sure, you lose half your AF and no parry or evade.  But if you were actually playing your class how it should be played,  you woudln't have anything attacking you in the first place.  Oh in RvR you are getting slaughtered.  Play a mercenary or blademaster.  We get slaughtered to.  Y'know what's funny about Dirty Tricks and you guys? Even if Dirty Tricks does proc, your left hand will still hit and crit.  You get haste effect 100% of the time*and*your left hand always hits.  Hmm...and you say we'll do more damage over time than you?  Unstyled?  Style?  Please, let us see the logs.  No.  You are not worse off than we are.  You are a light tank.  You shouldn't take down pure tanks.  Period.<br>
<br>
Again, I am not trying to stir up any trouble whatsoever.  I am sorry that you were brought down to your rightful level so abrubtly.  But you all need to realize that you are pissing and moaning about something that should have been done a long time ago.<br>
<br>
I wish all of you luck on learning your newly realized tole as light tanks.  May you all learn to love the light tank class like all of the diehard Mercenaries and Blademasters that post on these boards.<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>
Joe<br>
<br>
P.S.  Mythic doesn't lie and cheat.  They do everything for a reason.  They are not stupid.  They can't do everything because other classes have issues too.  So shut up about how much you hate Mythic.  Wanna hate a company?  Play EQ and hate Verant.  They deserve it at least.<br>

Hey, man.  Chill...<br>
<br>
You will have a hard time finding a Zerk or Shadowblade that will tell you there was nothing wrong with the damage output of Left Axe pre-1.62.  In fact, most will tell you, yeah, it could use a little tweaking.<br>
<br>
Cutting it almost in half was way overboard, and you know it.  That is no way to tune a spec line, and a single-line respec to EVERYBODY when nerfing a class is a joke.<br>
<br>
There are several reasons why the Berserker community was up in arms over 1.62:<br>
<br>
1)  Aurora Borealis was changed from a reactionary style to third in the chain of a behind style.  Ever try to get a behind style off in RvR?  How about one that is third in a chain?  For a LEVEL 50 spec style?  Ok, maybe you have gotten off a few behind positionals, but how about after 1.62 where they nerfed that too?<br>
<br>
2)  Damage across the board was reduced 40%, but endurance costs for the anytime style is still on the level of a shield slam.<br>
<br>
3)  Our primary buffing class got the nerf bat across the forehead.  Instead of being behind the lines, healing and what-not, they have to be right up there with us.  The Shaman, while having chain armor, has very low defense and isn't a tank-like class... it's a caster class.<br>
<br>
4)  The nerf was done without the input of a legitimate class team lead.  Ragnarthruu took pity on us and tried to offer input to the development team.  Apparently, even that was ignored.<br>
<br>
5)  The Blademaster's Tri-Weild totally negates Frenzy.<br>
<br>
6)  Both the Mercenary and Blademaster special abilities were boosted, while Frenzy was reduced (see 5.)<br>
<br>
I have nothing but good things to say about Blademaster and Mercenaries.  Mythic has needed to address dual weild issues since the game was released.  Why haven't they fixed you yet?  Easy.  Infiltrators and Nightshades.  If they put CW and DW on pre-1.62 LA levels, there would be no reason to play any other class.  Why did Shadowblades have this power?  Ask Mythic.  They're the ones that made Left Axe available to them.  They're also the ones that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BOOSTED</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Left Axe growth rates pre 1.62.<br>
<br>
Remember...  Mythic doesn't lie, and they know what they're doing.<br>
