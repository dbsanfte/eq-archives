It touched my heart, and I wanted to share it with my online family of both VHers and non-VHers. I think the subject heading gives you enough of a warning.<br>
<br>
===========================================<br>
<br>
Her hair was up in a ponytail, her favorite dress tied with a bow.<br>
Today was Daddy's Day at school, and she couldn't wait to go.<br>
But her mommy tried to tell her, that she probably should stay home.<br>
Why the kids might not understand, if she went to school alone.<br>
But she was not afraid; she knew just what to say.<br>
What to tell her classmates of why he wasn't there today.<br>
But still her mother worried, for her to face this day alone.<br>
And that was why once again, she tried to keep her daughter home.<br>
But the little girl went to school, eager to tell them all.<br>
About a dad she never sees - a dad who never calls.<br>
There were daddies along the wall in back, for everyone to meet.<br>
Children squirming impatiently, anxious in their seats.<br>
One by one the teacher called, a student from the class.<br>
To introduce their daddy, as seconds slowly passed.<br>
At last the teacher called her name, every child turned to stare.<br>
Each of them was searching, for a man who wasn't there.<br>
&quot;Where's her daddy at?&quot; she heard a boy call out.<br>
&quot;She probably doesn't have one,&quot; another student dared to shout.<br>
And from somewhere near the back, she heard a daddy say, &quot;Looks like another deadbeat dad, too busy to waste his day.&quot;<br>
The words did not offend her, as she smiled up at her Mom.<br>
And looked back at her teacher, who told her to go on.<br>
And with hands behind her back, slowly she began to speak.<br>
And out from the mouth of a child, came words incredibly unique.<br>
&quot;My Daddy couldn't be here, because he lives so far away.<br>
But I know he wishes he could be, since this is such a special day.<br>
And though you cannot meet him, I wanted you to know.<br>
All about my daddy, and how much he loves me so.<br>
He loved to tell me stories he taught me to ride my bike.<br>
He surprised me with pink roses, and taught me to fly a kite.<br>
We used to share fudge sundaes, and ice cream in a cone.<br>
And though you cannot see him, I'm not standing here alone.<br>
&quot;Cause my daddy's always with me, even though we are apart I know because he told me, he'll forever be in my heart&quot;<br>
With that, her little hand reached up, and lay across her chest.<br>
Feeling her own heartbeat, beneath her favorite dress.<br>
And from somewhere in the crowd of dads, her mother stood in tears.<br>
Proudly watching her daughter, who was wise beyond her years.<br>
For she stood up for the love of a man not in her life.<br>
Doing what was best for her, doing what was right.<br>
And when she dropped her hand back down, staring straight into the crowd.<br>
She finished with a voice so soft, but its message clear and loud.<br>
&quot;I love my daddy very much, he's my shining star.<br>
And if he could, he'd be here, but heaven's just too far, You see he was a fireman and died just this past year when airplanes hit the towers and taught Americans to fear.<br>
But sometimes when I close my eyes, it's like he never went away.&quot;<br>
And then she closed her eyes, and saw him there that day.<br>
And to her mother's amazement, she witnessed with surprise.<br>
A room full of daddies and children, all starting to close their eyes.<br>
Who knows what they saw before them, who knows what they felt inside.<br>
Perhaps for merely a second, they saw him at her side.<br>
&quot;I know you're with me Daddy,&quot; to the silence she called out.<br>
And what happened next made believers of those once filled with doubt.<br>
Not one in that room could explain it, for each of their eyes had been closed.<br>
But there on the desk beside her, was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.<br>
And a child was blessed, if only for a moment, by the love of her shining bright star.<br>
And given the gift of believing, that heaven is never too far.<br>
<br>
<br>
They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them.<br>
<br>
Send this phrase to the people you'll never forget and remember to send it also to the person that sent it to you.<br>
<br>
It's a short message to let them know that you'll never forget them.<br>
<br>
If you don't send it to anyone, it means you're in a hurry and that you've forgot your friends.<br>
<br>
Take the time...to live and love. <p>Pravdameer Pravdamorte<br>

Do you mind if I print it out and bring it to work?<br>
<br>
As most of you know, I am an EMT, what most of you guys don't know, is that because I work for the fire department, I am also technically a fire fighter, and every now and then, I do get to employ those skills as well.  <br>
<br>
I personally knew some of the fire fighters lost that day.  I worked with some of them, trained with them, cried with them.  Several of them recieved their initial training through the fire department volunteer program my city runs, and they still came all this way down to volunteer their 24 hours a month, though their contracts required for the &quot;free&quot; training had cleared them of the obligations often years before.  I live in a military area, and these people served in the military, became fire fighters/EMT's, then got out and moved to New York.   True American heros.  There entire life was a sacrifice so that the rest of us might live in freedom and the safety of knowing that there are people out there that will save their lives if tragedy falls upon them.  <br>
<br>
Many of the fire fighters lost that day were NOT carreer fire fighters.   There were many volunteers lost that day as well.  They had carreers elsewhere, offering only hours each month, or serving in times of crisis.  They were NOT paid to do what they did, they volunteered their time.  Though I'm carreer now, my own &quot;roots&quot; lie with the volunteer services.<br>
<br>
Another thing most people don't realize is that for most of the month of september, our fire department was basically run by volunteers, because many of us, myself included responded to the tragedy in New York.  I saw many things up there that I don't ever want to see again.   The destruction and loss of life that day is still an inconceivable thought.  But I also saw hope up there.  I saw people with no medical or rescue knowledge whatsoever standing there, ready to hold the hand of a complete stranger to offer comfort.  So many people willing to lend a hand in any way they could. All of the sudden, in a time of dispair, people from all over pulling together to help overcome tragedy.  In the moment of greatest dispair, a new hope was born in New York.  <br>
<br>
OK that's enough rambling for me.  (and Yes, I am crying as I write this.  That email could easily have been a little girl of someone I know and work with.  It could easily have been one of my children.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/upravdameer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pravdameer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Overlord</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/16/02 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=411.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *ooc* Have the tissues ready...</span><hr size=1> *smile* Thank you for sharing that, Natori, and by all means - print it out and share it.

I cannot believe that you feel nothing for this situation. So much death and destruction and it doesn't touch you some how?<br>
<br>
Maybe its because its not personal to you.  Well guess what.  It's personal to me.  That could have been me in the building had it happened locally.  Those where people I'd met, people I'd done disaster training with.  A few I'd worked with.  <br>

They are the people that risk everything to save your life, and the lives of your family.  Has anyone in your family, any of your friends, ever had to dial 911?  Has a medic ever saved the life of someone you know?  Has a fire fighter ever put out a fire in your neighborhood?<br>
<br>
Many of them are volunteers.  They have careers elsewhere.  There is no commitment like a pay check that says they HAVE to do what they do.  They do it because they do.  Because they want to give back.  Quite a few of the ones that died up there were volunteer fire fighters that actually left their real jobs when this happened to join the efforts.  <br>
<br>
Its a lot like the military.   The military fights so that everyone else doesn't have to feel the fear of another countries domination.  Well we are here so that you can sleep at night, knowing that if something goes wrong, someone is out there to take care of you, no matter who you are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=411.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=411.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=411.topic&index=11><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.threadControl?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate<option value="vhbrellfrm19">Hate's Culling Guild</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm1>The Dungeon</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
