The Mad Prophet<br>

<br>
Visions and Predictions<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Saturated in his own sweat, teeth grinding as his jaws worked against one another like two halves of a vice, he thrashed across his bed gripped by the one thing in life he feared - the touch of his master's mind. Once snared, there was no escape. They called him a drunk, misbegotten, underachieving biproduct of noble birth. Still, they let him be and confronted him not. His master's presence was upon him, if only in the dark aura that only the gifted could see, yet all could feel. Outside these walls, he was an eccentric figure, a joke at parties and a whispered name in the pubs. Within them, he was clay to be moulded and formed - as meaningless as any of the master's tools yet still worthy of being graced by Hate's personal attention.<br>
<br>
Far from mollified by the routine, the scribe in the corner shrank within the shadows. Hate was present before him, and though he had seen it many times, he was still terrified. He waited, vellum and quill at the ready, to capture anything that was said. The scribe was without identity in Neriak - none even knew he existed. He had come to serve Hate, but had he known how it would be...<br>
<br>
With a sudden jerk and a scream, the Mad Prophet sat upright in his bed and his eyes grew wide. His face was rigid, as if chisled from obsidian, but the eyes raged with a red, yellow and green light. The scribe partitioned his world from the work at hand, and instantly captured every word that was spoken. The words, once more in the prosaic tongue of the Combine, came fast and harsh, but he dared not miss the least among them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Empire mighty, empire wide, could not defeat Bertoxxulous' Bride. Chosen from birth, chosen from all, chosen to bring about empire's fall. Plague undefineable, enemy unseen, no healer could cure, the remains all obsene. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hear me Harvest! The Bride is Awake! She has come among you, your lives she shall take! The Bride of Plagubringer walked through your gates, drank from your chalice and bonded your fates! The Bride of Bertoxulous, chosen from birth, no cure, no hope, no joy, no mirth.&quot;<br>
<br>
As suddenly as it began, the torrent of words ended in a hushed silence. The scribe looked up, and stared in amazement. The Prophet was smiling! The horrors he had seen of the dead Combine Empire still echoed across his face in a thousand ways, but he smiled nonetheless. His eyes had grown calm, their pupils taking on an ashen hue. With a twist of his head, the Prophet turned to look at the scribe and stared for a moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;New lands have been discovered since the days of the Combine. Hate has shown me the way. Send a message at once to the Thresher, have him loose the Breaghan D'Aerthe to search the new continent. The plague is born of the icy Bride of Bertoxulous, and it shall die by her sacrifice in another land of ice. Have the Assassins seek the place where acid flows, for there shall we divorce the Plaguebringer from our Tiller - none of the faithful of Hate may be taken against Hate's wish. Go!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a groan, the prophet fell back in his bed, unconscious and spent. The scribe finished writing the exact words of the priest's utterance, then gathered his belongings and left through the hidden door to refine his works for later study with the prophet. It took no Oracle to see that there would be many more nights like this before teh Prophet would feel confident in what he ahd seen, but for now, there was work enough to keep from worrying about future nights with no sleep, and he disappeared into the inner corridors of the Temple, joining the other unseen denizens of the crypts.<br>
