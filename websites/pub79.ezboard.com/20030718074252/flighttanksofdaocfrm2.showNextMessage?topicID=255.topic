I have a 32 Reaver, 48 Minstrel, 31 Mercenary and a 19 S/S Crushman.  90% of the armsmen I have met on my various characters used slash.<br>
<br>
For some reason I doubt a lot of slasher armsmen are going slash just because the advantage in the Plains stage and Amethyst slash.  I think most of them just like the idea of swords.  Or I'm an arrogant fool(Which has been proven on my rant topic).<br>
<br>
Crushing has a short chain that keys off a block, which you should be doing a lot of.  There are 2 positionals, from which your 50 style keys of Side Crush.  Several very nice styles key off of the taunt style, which an armsman should be spamming in PvE.  Yeah, there is a lack of nice anytime styles.  Concussion is rather average, but the MoB is slowed a bit, i.e. more damage to them.  And you should be blocking so much that Skull Breaker could be nearly spammed.<br>
<br>
I doubt 90%f the armsmen and paladins I meet are using Scimitars for the tactical use(Longswords are a much, much better balance between speed and power).  They are just using Scimitars because they look badarse and make them think they're Sinbad.<br>
<br>
And trust me, we all know that armsmen are possibly the simplist class to play.  I've met armsmen at 44 on my minstrel that didn't know what intercept and protect did.  Armsmen do require to be constantly aware of what's around them and such, but Paladins need to keep track of their chants, Reavers need to keep track of their chants and make sure surge and their spells are working and mercs constantly need to stick and circle around the MoB to do positionals.  <br>
<br>
I have questioned a lot of armsmen in my guild about why they use slash, but very few had a legitimate answer.  Slash in Albion is even more common than Crush in Midgard, which is braggable.<br>
<br>
So what do my fellow mercs believe? Slash is a very viable spec, but no more viable than crush IMHO.  why is it we see so few crush specced armsmen and paladins?<br>
<br>
I am an arrogant fool.<br>

<br>
Primarily, crush doesn't inspire many people. In SEVERANCE (I know I rant about this game all the time, but it's the standard of fun and versatility by which I judge every action game nowadays!) all cahracters have the option to carry blunt and bladed weapons, and, trust me, it's a lot less fun hitting somebody down with a staff than it is to chop their arms, leg and head off with a spear or an axe. Maybe people have an in-built instinct towards using something technologically advanced as a katana, rather than a stone club. It's also rahter bland, when you think of how varied the appearance and style can go. Sure, it'll be unique, but, well...<br>
<br>
Secondly, I think there's a role-player in all of us. And in literature/film, not many people use blunt weapons when they can cut stuff up. Skywalker, Aragorn, Robin Hood (yeah, picky, I know), the Knights of Camelot (see &quot;EXCALIBUR&quot;) all used swords. The sword speaks of versatility, tactical sharpness. The hammer speaks of brutality and thuggishness, as does the axe to an extent. However I know many of us are dirty violent axe-brawlers at heart <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    If flex weaponry had always been with us, was merc-compatible, crush-styled and wasn't considered a FoTM trinket, I think we'd have a lot more crush emrcs than we do.<br>
<br>
Tactically, crush has a reputation for being poor at PvE. This assumption is extended grotesquely in Albion, where the crush-vulnerable guys seem (at first) to be only Armsmen and Paladins, and the hammer looks at first sight to be only useful against things wearing a &quot;shell&quot;. Not a good thing.<br>
<br>
At RvR, crush is probably the best owing to its &quot;backseating&quot; for many peoples SC resist templates <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   However, the styles themselves are supposed to suck. Again, Slash seems to be Albions only useful anytime-spec.<br>
<br>
 And the armour-vuln/bonus tables show us the opposite anyway- -<br>
<br>
Crush is also neutral to Midgard (meaning you can't drop either a 'Zerker nor a thrust-vulnerable Healer as fast as you might want to), and gets penalties against the Champ, Warden and Hero, pretty popular classes.<br>
<br>
Compare this to Slash which gets bonus versus Norse Studded (which, it could be argued since the overpowering of LA, is the armour if Midgards primary tank force) AND the armour of the tanks in Hibernia.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thats my reasoning. Another thing is that when you're training as a Fighter, you're only given a training Sword. When you get to spec at level 2, you're wasting your points if you put them in Crush, because it's a style you can't get. Many players seem fine to settle into this mould nicely, and go slash after meeting their class trainer. Similar to Rogues with Thrust.<br>
<br>
^ I don't THINK you can go to a fighter trainer and get him to give you a crush weapon. Maybe you can. But I didn't find out how, and if other players didn't, then that could explain a few things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

All of Midgard is Neutral to ya.  You take down Bards, BMs, rangers and NS's. <br>
<br>
Go Slash, you are resisted by Warriors, Thanes, Skalds, Healers and Shamans.  You take down zerkers, sbs, hunters and savages like no tommorow.  You also slaughter all the scale wearers, but you have problems with Nightshades, Blademasters and the rare Battlebard. <br>
<br>
Seemingly they even themselves out pretty well on paper.  My slash merc has a gay old time in RvR and my memories of the 1v1 duels with the Hibbie tanks on my 50/50/28 slasher merc on my old account are quite vivid.<br>
<br>
I've never tried a crush merc, but my crush armsman does very well in PvE and ok in Abermenai(Which isn't too hard with all the newbs).  All the styles that key off of the taunt look like they would work well since in groups an armsman should spam their taunt style for the first few rounds.<br>

I believe it to be because of a rumor that they are going to allows mercs to duel wield nunchuks (only reavers can use those currently).<br>
<br>
However, most stay away because of the slow weapon speeds and, actually, the stuns. Because every shield wearer (well, ones you can spec in shield) has the 42 anytime shield stun style. Makes a good section of your styles (the stuns) useless or not as effective. It's also not as popular because crush is considered to be a &quot;swing slowly for big damage&quot; type of weapon. Mercs are built for speed more than slow swinging big hits.<br>
<br>
But, this is just observation. Could be that people go crush to gain auto-trainning points (most don't seem to care about 'em) and often respec out since it doesn't auto-train.<br>
<br>
There is, however more crush mercs then thrust mercs on galahad. Thrust is probably the worse spec line we can have since it's mostly evade. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

The only way anyone could have interpretted that was maybe he heard somewhere they would but flex weapons on the left hip if they were in the 2-handed slot.  The Reaver TL has made some reports about how flexible weaps in the 2H slot look weird and unnatural.  My own reaver keeps his whip in 2H and Flail in Right-hand and the whip looks plain stupid up there on my shoulder. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theravensclaw>The Ravens Claw</A> at: 6/1/03 6:52:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fingoniel>Fingoniel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://forums.barrysworld.com/avatar.php?userid=16042&dateline=1026917502" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 318<br> <font color=#000000>(6/2/03 2:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crush-Why the rarity?</span><hr size=1> sure it's not Jambiya's they're using?

I'd have to be pretty blind to get the two mixed up.  Also take into conscience that those mercs that I saw were mostly under 15 or 20, i.e. lowest conning jams are fine alloy, optimum level of use being 25.  <br>
<br>
There's really not much to persuade me out of thinking that there should be more crush  armsfolk though.  I'm probably just arrogant, but again I'll post, a seemingly very nice chain keys off Maul(Taunt), and Maul should be spammed quite a bit if one is the main tank.<br>
<br>
Oh, I think Mythic had the idea of the light tank maybe in the last 6 months of developing.  They'd already thought up the infiltrator, nightsahde and shadowblade so they just copied everything from the CDW line and pasted it onto the merc, including the style anim.  While the styles looked perfectly fine with the straight bladed swords, if not a bit politically incorrect, they didn't expect any mercs to actually spec crush, even though they made a few left-hander crushers.<br>
<br>
What they could do to fix that would be to use a specific set of anims depending on which kind of weapons are in the two hands.  If they used two different kind of weaps in each hand they could just use the anim of the weapon type that the CDW style was firing off of(I.E.  You just used the style off of your left hand, which has a slasher, you do a slash anim. You use the style off your right, which has a thruster, you do the thrust anim).<br>
<br>
Maybe on the slasher spec they could do the following:<br>
Starts off with a quick but very brutal uppercut style anim, but is quickly followed by a horizontal, but quick again, swipe from the left hand, mainly so the hand axe would like fine in the left hand again.<br>
<br>
They could leave thrusters the same since DW anims were pretty much built for thrust infis.<br>
<br>
Crushers could do similiar to zerker LA styles and just brutally smash and enemy between the two blunt objects in their hands.  This would look especially cool with small hammers.<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, I'm kinda out of ideas for the butt-stab moves(like Shadow's Edge) or the spinning pivot like moves.  But anywho...Mythic is a smart bunch and they could figure it out.Heh like Mythic taking an idea from the average Joe.  They rarely even listen to the TL's...<br>
<br>
Well, thats my two copper on the DW anims<br>

<br>
It funny, because untill just a while ago, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 16.5 Dps Crush 1-handers were off-hand weapons. When Spellcraft/Alchemy came out they added right hand only 16.5 Dps 1-hand crush weapons. In fact, up untill that point, 16.5 Dps off-hand Thrust weapons also didn't exist, and neither did level 51 shields.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly, i question what was going through several devlopers minds when i think about some of the omissions they had, when it only seemed logical to include the things that were missing.<br>
<br>
Another perfect example, Netherium and Arcanium. I remember waaaaay back when these 9 (lvl 40 to 45) and 10 (lvl 45 to 50) tier materials also didn't exist. Asterite was the limit, and capped 50th level people at 13.5 Dps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danyan@lighttanksofdaoc>Danyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#000000>(6/2/03 5:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crush-Why the rarity?</span><hr size=1> All the style anims are just ripped off the crit strike line anyway, and they look much nicer for infils (not to mention out damage every DW style by a mile). Also it's interesting to note that while DW has 3 anims, so far every CS style I've seen has a unique animation (my infil is only level 24 though).<br>
<br>
Also note all styles are off the right hand only so left hand anims are not really needed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>----<br>

clang! Slice! Just like the hero from any cheesy Jim Henson fantasy movie.<br>
<br>
Pincer shares a similar animation to Eviscerate and Kidney Rupture, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Hamstring, yeah, it does look like he's gonna trip up. So I think it would work well for Twin Return.<br>
