You will find many willing teachers among us, should we bother to even acknowledge you further.  If you wish to learn more about us, then you will seek out the Dread Overlord Xareth.

I am a Dark Elf female and as such even those males who, though possibly stronger than myself momentarily, I associate myself must know their place.

Heavy armour in the colours of shadows and blood encase his body, though his head is left bare, his moon-white hair bound at the nape of his neck, the long strands flowing almost to his belt.  A shadowed mace hangs at his hip, a finely forged longblade of mithril is sheathed in its baldric across his back, and slung across his back is a thick shield sheathed in the bones of Ashenbone Drakes.  Upon his face there is a sanguine rune-like sigil, a sword of thorns.  His violet eyes narrow as he focuses intensely upon Deganota.<br>
<br>
His voice is low and controlled as he speaks, &quot;I do not care what the traditions of your own House may be, petitioner.  As of yet you have shown nothing but a childish sense of entitlement to the Harvest.  If ye are to be judged in your hate to see if you are worthy of serving in the Father's Army, then ye shall bow to those of greater station, female and male alike.<br>
<br>
&quot;In Neriak the Queen and King each rule as equals.  Innoruuk is male, and we all bow first to Him.  Do not seek to force your matriarchal ways upon others, for you only dishonor yourself.  Among the Chosen, and the majority of Teir'Dal, females and males serve as equals, their status determined by their hate and their honor, not their gender.<br>
<br>
&quot;If that is perfectly clear to you, then you have a choice to make.  Present yourself to Dread Overlord Xareth to begin your Culling, or leave this Grange-house now.  I will not stand for such churlish backtalk to one of my Dread Overlords.&quot;<br>
<br>
He begins to turn away, then spins on his heel to face the young Rogue again. &quot;And one more thing, child.  I would know the name of your House.  Ye profess to be of an age when most Houses allow their children to wear their name, but you have not declared it.  I would know which House comes before the Harvest with such disgraceful words.&quot; <p><center><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com"><img src="http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/khas_sig.jpg"></a><br>

Checking through the various rooms, he stopped by the area where people petition to join the guild, which seemed an area of uncommon activity.<br>
<br>
Upon entering, he immediately noticed the Dire Overlord in confrontation with another Teir'Dal he did not know.  The monk assumed it was another petitioner.  However, Khasirath's manner and bearing were one of anger and confrontation, suggesting a possible enemy.  Vresk shifted his weight slightly, readying his body for combat if necessary.  The magical brand of the Dragon of Hate on his arm pulsed and writhed in response.<br>
<br>
The Iksar calmly strode over to the bulletin board, which allowed him to listen in on the conversation without seeming nosy.  Within moments he was fighting a chuckle.  Mating rituals.  Again.  Do the Teir'Dal argue about anything else?<br>
<br>
Turning from his spot, Vresk walked over to his friend and laid what he hoped was a calming claw on his shoulder.  Beaming a smile (a disturbing sight at the very least, not many greeted a mouthful of sharp teeth as welcoming) at the petitioner, he spoke in Teir'Dal, &quot;Dark tidingss, Petitioner.  We are honored to have you in our Grange.&quot;  Khasirath shot him a dangerous look, which he ignored.  &quot;Your being here iss evidencce that you are intelligent and wisse enough to know that the Harvesst will come, ssweeping asside the lessser people'ss and placcing the Teir'Dal (and their alliess) in their proper placcess.<br>
<br>
&quot;We assure you, however, that your pressencce in the guild iss not neccesssary.  Innoruuk will guide the Harvesst bassed on your devotion to Him,&quot; the monk allowed the stress on the last word sink in.  &quot;If you wish to join the Violent Harvesst as a guild, then I ssuggesst you learn to resspect your future ssissterss and brotherss, for doing otherwisse createss disscord.  We don't like disscord within our rankss.  It hamperss our efficienccy.  I'm ccertain you undersstand.&quot;<br>
<br>
His speech finished, he bowed to the newcomer, and then even lower to the Dire Overlord, respecting the latter's station, then stepped back to allow the pair to continue their conversation. <p><img src=http://starwave.smartdesk.net/www/kooK/vresk1.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ushaedewavecaller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaede Wavecaller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/29/01 10:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Petition of Joining</span><hr size=1> Shaede sat quietly unseen at the back of the central hall of the Grange, her air elemental hovering silently in front of her.  A minor cantrip changed the temperature of the elemental to mask her body with a uniform heat the same as the rear wall.   Her quiet contemplation was shattered by the voices of those in the room at the end of the hall.  With an irritated sigh she waited for the distractions to leave.  A few minutes later she watched as the Dire Overlord and the Ambassador left.  Standing quickly, she walked into the room with the Rogue, her elemental silent and invisible behind her.<br>
<br>
Walking in she faced the Rogue; at her silent command her elemental floated up to engulf Shaede, the invisible winds of its body whipping her hair about.  “Congratulations, you have managed to get on the bad side of not only one of our most dangerous Dread Overlords, but also managed to bring an edge to the voice of one of our most collected.”<br>
<br>
The smile on her lips was welcoming and deadly.  A dangerous look to her eye spoke of sanity barely held.<br>
<br>
“I am the Matron of House K`Thalion.  You will do well to remember the name of my House.  You will also do well to be careful of those you incite within the Harvest; the Dire Overlord has powerful allies as well as courtesans.  But please, do not count me as an enemy.  I like your... attitude.  I would like to speak with you more, but my time does not allow it at the moment.  Please, seek me out so that we may speak more.”<br>
<br>
Shaede turned, her hair calming as her elemental flowed away from her on the air currents.  She turned, her eyes dark and clouded.<br>
<br>
“I will stand as your sponsor.  But I will warn you.  Should you make enemies within the guild, count me as one of them.  This is my family, these are my friends, and I will slay any who stand against us....”<br>
<br>
The room was once again empty, save for the new petitioner.<br>

Calling on the Father she faded into the darkness to contemplate.<br>
<br>
Decision made she drew the sword turned, by her hand, to the Fathers will.  Whispering one of his Lesser Names she sets it to a blaze and with a prayer writes her words in the air...<br>
<br>
Shaede, I did not come here to make enemies.  I came to do the Father's bidding and had hopes that such could be accomplished with greater efficiency within these hallowed walls.  I do not say I will not interact with males nor did I say I would not be TOLERANT of these males for there are times when necessity deems such to be so.<br>
<br>
I have offered my talents and my wisdom BUT I do have my ethics and will defend them with my life. We, made by the father, are the nurturers and the keepers of all he holds holy.  Males, though inconvenient, are many times a necessity.  I do not hold in high regard a species that when I slip out of my tunic stumble during battle.<br>
<br>
I have no qualms about using ALL the talents I posses to obtain the goals which the Father sets before me.  To believe that males and females fight side by side out of MUTUAL agreement is abhorrent and a disgrace to the power the Father has given us in the creation and destruction of life.  WE bear the seeds of his followers.  WE tend the growth and the teaching of his followers, our people.  The very idea that males are equal is a pale-skinned idea.  Probably derived from those filthy humans who seem to have taken up residence over most of the world.<br>
<br>
The fact that we live beneath the world is proof of a Males inadequacies.  Were it not for them we would have ruled this world LONG ago.  Them and their foolish tempers and their &quot;We fight now&quot; rather than temper it with patience and planning have set us back far too long. My belief in this will not be swayed.<br>
<br>
The Iksar, whom I know not, is somewhat of an enigma to me.  I know very little of them and have little against them.<br>
<br>
I am surely interested in the joining yet I will not allow the facts to be clouded by anyone's brute strength.<br>
<br>
I will find you and, if you are still amiable to speak, would be more than happy to speak with you.<br>
<br>
As for my House, that I will tell you when and if we speak.<br>
<br>
I mean no insult to the women of the dark and my petition was just that, a request for joining.   My only request was that I would be greeted not by a male but by one who holds true power.<br>

&quot;The FATHER's bidding, hmmmm.  Interesting for someone who does not believe in the strength of males. If your prideful ignorance will not allow you to speak with or RESPECT males then turn now and go find another Guild to soil with your outdated and almost lightborn prejudice.  I will not tolerate any member being this blind and I assure you neither will any of the others. If you think mere nudity would sway any of our members then you are uneducated as well as ignorant.  I have seen much better looking distractions not turn the blade of the General of Empire, the Dread Overlord and my chosen Xareth, nor the Dire Overlord Khasirath.<br>
<br>
We may bear the soil NOT the seeds.  If you understood things properly, the soil is nothing without the seed.  Maybe you should join Vresk on his research of mating?<br>
<br>
In your words and beliefs you have offended me.  In your ignorance you disgrace the Teir`Dal race.  I will not see you join us if you do not cast away these ideals born in prejudice.  You are no better then the lightblind that would deny one because of the color of their skin.<br>

On and on they went, House against House, faction against faction, and noble against noble. All claiming to be acting for the good of the Empire, all claiming unfailing loyalty to their Imperial Majesties. Such was the way of the Teir’dal.

Tzlar had entered his 55th season as a War Wizard, and been granted the title of “Evoker” by the Great God of Magic Solusek Ro himself. Likewise, his brother General Zirrix had been officially named a “Champion” by their Imperial Majesties upon gaining his 51st season as a Warrior. Tzlar was brought out of his contemplation’s by the arrival of a messenger. It was one of the agents from his guild, the Violent Harvest. Unlike his brother Zirrix, Tzlar rarely visited the guildhall. As an Arcanist he was busy traveling to far off areas of Norrath, and sometimes beyond, for his Art. Still, he did keep informed of the happenings of the Harvest. He listened to his agent’s report, then dismissed him.<br>
<br>
Tzlar considered the situation and the circumstances. First, and above all was his authority in this matter. Thankfully for his schedule, it was non-existent. This was a matter for the Triad and none other. Granted, as a member of the Harvest he had a voice in such matters, but the ultimate and final responsibility for this matter rested exclusively with the Triad, or those they assigned it to. If it were a matter of Imperial policy or social considerations, then he would indeed have a compelling input. Personally, he understood the young Thief’s attitude about Neriak. House T’Rhennic was one of the oldest of the noble Houses, and it well remembered the past. He did not know where it began, or even why, but females had indeed always held a position of power over the males in society. In fact, for millennia after the founding of the Empire, there were only Matrons leading the various Houses. The Imperial Council was composed exclusively of females, and the position of the King was downplayed in all the histories. No one seemed to know why that had changed, or when it had started. Probably because one Great House was suddenly without a Matron, and there was not a suitable female replacement. Perhaps there had been a coup in one of the more powerful of the noble families, and none of the other House’s dared strike them down. Whatever the reason, now it was not uncommon for males to have an equal, and on some matters an even  greater say, on matters of House and Empire. <br>
<br>
There were those from the “Traditional” Lines who did not accept such changes. They were in a minority, but were still a powerful force within the nobility. As Teir’dal history has shown, with but the cut of a well placed dagger, or drop of subtle poison, or well timed spell, the minority opinion of today can become the Imperial Dictate of tomorrow. Traditionalists saw equality as an example of the corruption brought about by the interaction and exposure to the lesser races. Such Lines advocated the return to isolation and consolidation of the Empire. They even called for the destruction of the foreign quarters, and extermination of all who inhabited those areas. On occasion Tzlar’s own brother Zirrix had lent his support to their cause, at least in so far as the extermination part was concerned. But, Zirrix was Second-Born and a Warrior, and it was for the Leader of the House to make “Official” policy for their Line. Tzlar knew that such gender hierarchy arguments were a dangerous thing indeed. Unless one had the resources and backing of a Great House behind them, publicly extolling such philosophies usually resulted in a sudden and silent death. In this matter Tzlar would stand by and observe the situation. He would see who was involved and, in the end, ally with the side most likely to emerge victorious. In that way, the best interests of House T’Rhennic would truly be served. Nodding in silent agreement with himself, Tzlar returned to his duties as Imperial Chancellor and the matters of the Empire.          <br>

<br>
She chuckles laughs allowed at the mere idea of equality with males.<br>
<br>
She then becomes calm and sits and begins to contemplate.  <br>
<br>
Vresk.  An enigma.  A CALM enigma.<br>
<br>
Still contemplating, she uses her given gift and fades from sight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/uferalssyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FeralSsyn </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/2/01 12:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Petition of Joining</span><hr size=1> None seemed to notice her sitting quietly near the hearth. A soft cloth playing gently across the blade of her two-hander. Keen emerald eyes lit upon the woman as she stood stiffly listening to the Thresher. A faint smile tugged upon Feral's lips as the woman spouted off.<br>
<br>
Though she could understand the womans sentiments. Ferals reason for distrusting the males where naut as the rogue's. Her words gave Feral pause as slender fingers stilled upon the blade. Her words made Feral wonder where they had been taught. For as long as Feral could remember she'd naut had a &quot;house&quot;. And look, she thought, she'd turned out just fine. What need did one have of a fancy house? Was it naut but a name to be either upheld or besmirched? Feral really did'nt care who her family had been. She'd stand on her own name or not at all.<br>
<br>
Turning away from the conversations, Feral continued to ply cloth to blade. The smile growing to one of pure malicious amusement. When Feral had joined and spouted her own view, It was simply for the fun of stirring things up. Though she had Khasirath believe she actually wanted his command. Another shrug, well, with those words burned into his mind, he's naut sure to forget her was he? A sound escaped from her and she stiffend. By the shadows, was it actually a giggle? <br>
<br>
The rogue needed to really use her head instead of her pride if she wanted to gain respect and a place among the Harvest. Most fools knew when to keep their mouths shut and their views to themselves, those who didn't ended up dead. <br>
<br>
As the room emptied, Feral remained. Watching the antics of those who came and went. Still unnoticed and really not caring if any did. Almost lovingly she slid the blade back into its sheath. That really was all anyone needed for themselves. <br>
<br>
A good blade to keep the wolves at bay. It was good company too, never talking back. Always obeying. Never had Feral had to fight or argue with her blade to get her way. Another odd sound escaped as she leaned back into her chair. Life was good enough.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ubooteeful.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Booteeful</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/4/01 3:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Petition of Joining</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ubooteeful.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Booteeful</A> at: 12/4/01 4:07:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udeganota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deganota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/4/01 4:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Petition of Joining</span><hr size=1> Deganota uncurls herself from her slumber and withdraw the veil that surrounds her only to find a note waiting for her.<br>
<br>
Her eyes glitter as she reads it. When she is finished she sets her blade against it and turns it to ash... then prepares her response...<br>
<br>
Shaede Wavecaller,<br>
<br>
Obviously the nude analogy was an extreme to making a point which, I wonder, was received. Lightborn prejudice? I believe that the Lightborn work together with their males and even ENCOURAGE working together with their males. This is NOT a Lightborn prejudice, this is OUR way, almost forgotten it would seem. I did not deny their usefulness, I just deny their belief that they may command us. US, the bearers of life! We bring about their existence and for that alone, not counting many other reasons, are they beholden to us. That is the LEAST of many.<br>
<br>
There have been very few, VERY few males in our entire history that deserve the respect of a woman. As of this generation I have not found any. Mayhap the one you defend is such? Of this I do not know for I know him not. Does he treat YOU with the proper respect or has he too fallen from the true ways of our people?<br>
<br>
Only one of our males have I EVER encountered that even came CLOSE to respecting the old ways and I have not seen him in a long time. Daiunus, I wonder what became of him? Perhaps even he has fallen to the lightborn ways of commanding women. Ne'er did he demand that I give him respect he did not earn, nor had he ever approached ME without showing proper respect. Tis one of many. A shame there are so few.<br>
<br>
You claim that it is *I* who is ignorant? Interesting coming from one who claims the lightborn races judge us by our skin. They do not judge us by our skin, FAR from it. They judge us by our history and their fear. We were once a ruling power they feared. They respected our strength and would fall prostrate to the ground when we would pass. Now, no longer. Now they shun us out of fear and jealousy of our old power. They now treat us like a common street urchin and fling us from their cities. It is not our skin they judge us against. Find your history. When you do, tell me who was in power?<br>
<br>
Deganota<br>
<br>
P.S. Interesting there are no &quot;Mad&quot; Prophetesses' don't you think?<br>
<br>
<br>
Deganota's sword flares in response to her anger. So much forgotten, so much to be done.<br>
<br>
She sheaths her sword and storms back into the welcoming veil.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ushaedewavecaller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaede Wavecaller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/4/01 8:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Petition of Joining</span><hr size=1> Shaede looked at the letter delivered to her.

Knowing there are important things ahead for the Harvest, and for himself, he walks back into the shadows and the darkness of Nektulous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=108.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=108.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=16><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.threadControl?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate<option value="vhbrellfrm19">Hate's Culling Guild</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm2>Seeds of Innoruuk</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
