This is a bit of a rewind, about an hour or so after Creapiing first left the Grange.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Khasirath walked through the streets of Neriak with his Mace in his hand.  There was a great commotion in the streets, guards and citizens rushing about in confusion, many heading towards the lake.  He could only hear snippets of the rumors… something about a mad woman walking the streets.  The Knight frowned deeply as he turned away from the crowd towards the Grange, a foreign uneasiness tightening in his gut.<br>
<br>
Approaching the Grange he saw at once that the madness reached even here.  Twice the normal guards stood at the door.  The door!  It was closed!  Never in his time with the Harvest had he seen this before; always the Grange stood open to admit the faithful who may wish entry to speak with the Chosen.  His pace quickened as he drew closer, and one guard pulled open the heavy stone door as he was recognized.<br>
<br>
Within the Grange the faces that he saw were singularly grim and lost.  A servant of the Grange rushed to meet him as soon as his boots crossed the threshold.  The man’s face was stricken with barely controlled panic, “Dire Overlord!  You must come at once to the Reaper’s office.”<br>
<br>
“Lead on, then,” Khasirath snapped.<br>
<br>
The man all but scurried down the hall, his shoulders hunched with dread.  Khasirath followed with steady strides, rigidly controlling himself.  He knew that whatever crisis might await, his strength must be something the Harvest could depend on.<br>
<br>
Outside the Reaper’s office stood four of their senior guards, veterans all.  Each one’s face was a steely mask, but even in their eyes Khasirath saw the apprehension that had fallen like a shroud over the Grange.  The four guards saluted him and stepped aside.  Quickly and nervously the servant unlocked the office door and held it open for the Knight.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation Khasirath walked in, through the apprentice’s room to the office proper.  This door was also closed, and Khasirath pulled it open before the scuttling servant had a chance to.  In the doorway he stopped, stunned by the devastation within.<br>
<br>
The dark and finely appointed office was an abattoir.  The charnel reek of death seemed to envelop Khasirath as he struggled to take it all in.  At first he could not accept that he was seeing this here, in the heart of the Grange.  It simply could not be!<br>
<br>
Dimly he realized that the servant was prattling on, trying to explain.  But the words meant nothing.  Khasirath clenched his eyes shut, his head lowering as his entire body tensed.  A feral snarl twisted his face as he turned back to the servant, his hands curled into tight fists.<br>
<br>
“Get out,” Khasirath growled deeply, the words almost swallowed by the rage in his voice.<br>
<br>
“B...but my Lord!” the servant stammered, taking a step back.<br>
<br>
“GET OUT!  Let no one else enter!” Khasirath roared, driving the servant back and all but shoving him into the hall.  He tore the key from the man’s hand and slammed the door shut, locking it from within.<br>
<br>
He tossed the key onto the apprentice’s desk and walked slowly back into the inner office.  He could feel the tension in his entire body, almost to the point of trembling from the stress.  Leaning against the doorframe he closed his eyes once again and drew three deep breaths, forcing himself to relax.<br>
<br>
Opening his eyes again he entered the office.  The lighting was dim, as always.  Teir`Dal did not require much light to see, even underground.  Slowly he walked among the bodies, counting and identifying them.  Two guards, eighteen servants.  He recognized all of them, knew them to be Creapiing’s assistants and helpers.  They lay jumbled together right where they had fallen.<br>
<br>
The wounds, the patterns of cuts… Those he knew just as well.  He had fought beside Creapiing as often as he was able, watched her in the Arena.  He knew her skill, her style.  None other could have killed these men and women but the Reaper herself.<br>
<br>
He forced himself to observe without emotion, though the strain was telling.  The blood was everywhere and the smell permeated everything.  The bodies could not have lain here long, but still death crouched heavy and restless around him.  The Reaper’s armour, and her weapons were all thrown about carelessly.<br>
<br>
The desk was covered in papers; many had spilled to the floor.  The red of the ink and the blood co-mingled ‘til they seemed one and the same.  For a long time he stared at the desk, memories of the times he has spent in that office with Creapiing blinding him to the horrid reality around him.<br>
<br>
As he came back to himself his gaze struck on a patch of bright white on the dark and stained parchments.  Stepping over the corpses he walked closer, and realized what it was he was seeing.  Hair – The Reaper’s beautiful mane of hair stained in blood and roughly chopped off.<br>
<br>
Slowly he pulled off his gloves and tucked them under his belt.  He carefully gathered up the thick white bundle of hair.  It was so much softer than he had imagined.  His jaw clenched tightly as he lifted it to his face, feeling the softness against his cheek and lips as her scent for a moment eclipsed the smell of blood.  Almost reverently he tucked the hair away into a pouch tied on his belt.<br>
<br>
It was all too much.  Deep in his heart he knew that he would never see her again.  He walked around the desk and set heavily in her chair.  Putting his head back, silently he wept.<br>
