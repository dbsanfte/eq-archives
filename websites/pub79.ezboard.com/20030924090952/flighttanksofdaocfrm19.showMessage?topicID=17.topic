I don't play to leech RP's, so when a fight starts, I'm in the thick of it, making a difference.<br>
<br>
In this case, there must have been close to 50 Mids, and when I got on the Runemaster, he pulled me right into the thick of the Trolls, Norse and Rats.  So I couldn't even SEE the damn dwarf to tell if he had his back to me, or his side, or his front.<br>
<br>
Basically, ANY style damage is better than base damage, which is what I would get if my positionals failed.  So I used Misty Gloom..the ONLY anytime I have.<br>
<br>
Check out the styles available to a 50 DW 50 Thrust Merc and tell me what I should have been using instead? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=avandor>Avandor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Axe-Wielding Maniac</span><br>  Posts: 349<br> <font color=#000000>(3/13/03 4:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webinnovations.dk/av/albion.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disgusting.</span><hr size=1> I understand what you saying Kerrec, but Misty Gloom is really one of the worst choices you can get for yourself.<br>
<br>
I run around with a 50 thrust/50 DW merc also in my guild group, and if he can get off positionals (our best styles), he starts with Tranquillize (and even Wyvernfang) and he usually manages to get Dragonfang off after 1 or 2 styles, allowing me and him to pull off our side and back styles.<br>
<br>
If you not into using the detaunt styles, perhaps Puncture and Lunge ?!? (sorry dont know much about thrust styles). <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->_____________________________<br>
