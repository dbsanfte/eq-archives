The other Harvesters present mocked Artillius. Their doubts and distrust were readily apparent. Artillius heard them, but he did not waiver. He blocked them from his mind and praised the glory of Innoruuk. However, he did glance for a moment at the northwoman, Payle.<br>
<br>
After Faeolin dismissed Artillius, Payle approached him and demanded to know what motivated the looks he gave her. She reminded him that it was the second time he had stared at her, the first time was while she stood before the Dragon of Hate a few weeks earlier. Artillius explained that he did not understand how one who is not Teir'Dal could be Chosen. She told him that the fact was indisputable, she had survived her testing. However, Artillius maintained his reservations. Payle's annoyance with this seed was bearable for the moment. She questioned his right to make any judgements what so ever. A seed should know his place. Artillius apologized humbly and said he meant no disrespect. He sounded sincere enough, but it was difficult to read his expressionless face.<br>
<br>
Payle noticed that he held something with both hands, a small object hidden from view. She asked him what it was and he displayed a small brass figurine in the form of Innoruuk. With the figure before her, she could feel a faint aura around it. She asked him where he obtained it. Artillius explained that he found it behind a loose stone in the wall of Lord Khasirath's sub-basement. While Artillius was chained there, he became aware of the figurine. He went straight to its location as if he had known exactly where it was. It would seem that it was hidden there, then forgoten about. Perhaps to protect it from looters during a siege long ago. Artillius planned on presenting this figurine to Lord Khasirath when he returned from his current campaigns.<br>
<br>
Artillius has had other revelations. Artillius said that he can see relics clearly in his mind. He knows where they are to be found. Payle doubted any knowledge that Artillius had, but she could not deny the figurine displayed in front of her. Artillius said that he would show the Harvest where other relics where. They would all see...<br>
