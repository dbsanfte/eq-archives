Kelranon's Demise-Velil's Rebirth<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
/ooc This is explaining why Kelranon is gone and Velil is here. Hopefully this should help with my getting back into VH. Please post any responses, whether criticism, comments, or hopefully more RP. Thanks  .<br>

<br>
Kelranon, the name struck fear in many within the commons. A hated necromancer, also known as the Dark Physician. He was famed with curing The Reaper of her poison, his constant devotion to his studies, and his dedication to Innoruuk. This dedication gained graet favor in Innoruuk's eye. However, Kelranon was merely a harvester, what would The Triad think if he said that Innoruuk himself spoke to him of his favor for him? No, this was a secret he must keep.<br>
<br>
For a long while Kelranon X'Vdinn served the Harvest, and The Dead. He loyally did any task given to him by Xon Quexil, or Queen Christhanos Thex. Whether it be to slay an enemy mercilessly, or give his riches in donation, he always did it.<br>
<br>
However, the annual sacrafice from The Dead to Innoruuk was at hand, and there was no stopping it. The beggars and thieves from the dungeon were all but rounded up now for experiments or sent and sold to the Freeport Militia for shows or whatever it is those blasted Humans did. Therefor the members of The Dead checked amongst their files, seeking one of low season. Kelranon's name was the first to come up.<br>
<br>
The young lad was sleeping at the time in his large house, rented to him by the Harvest. He was awakened by the loud clanging at his gate. He grumpily looked out his window, to see five Shadow Knights dressed in full plated armor, bearing seals of The Dead. They tore down his gate, then quickly slew his undead guardians. Before long at all, they burst into his house, and willfully moved upstairs. Kelranon drew his dagger and stood back against his wall. He saw the troops break down his locked door. Their eerie skulled helms glowed off the little light in the room. Hesitantly he casted a spell and shot at the first one who entered. His clinging darkness spell didn't quite cling onto this man as he drew his Dark Reaver from his back. Kelranon stepped back and bumped into the wall. He gulped, he knew he was going to meet his end here.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no use resisting, Kelranon,&quot; the Shadow Knight said. With that, he smashed Kelranon in the forehead with the hilt of his sword. Thus he crashed to the ground, unconciouse and somewhat twitching. The shadow Knights all entered the room and laughed at him. The first one lifted him, taking him back to the Lodge of the Dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kelranon awoke to a great many people around him chanting. He could not make out what they were saying, but he could feel he was lying on a most uncomfortable table. His head throbbed with pain from the blow. The confused necromancer tried to massage ihs head, but his hands were tied down to the table by chains. He looked around, and realized this was infact the Lodge of the Dead!<br>
<br>
He suddenly saw Quexil himself stepping forward. He looked over at Kelranon, leaning overhim grinning. He could see the fear developing in his eyes as sweat poured down his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be afraid Kelranon,&quot; he said, placing his hand on his forehead, gently petting the Harvester's hair back. &quot;You should be honored,&quot; he spoke again. Kelranon could not choose his feelings, whether he was enraged out of his mind, or scared beyond all sanity. Xon drew a beautiful dagger that Kelranon recognized. It was called Zven'Vew, Teir'Dal for Innoruuk's Love. It was a blade crafted by Innoruuk's minions in the Hate Plane, designed for sacraficing people to him. Kelranon began breathing heavily in great fear. Suddenly he lost all thought and shouted,<br>
<br>
&quot;You fools ! I-I am favored by Innoruuk over all of you! You will feel his wrath for harming me!&quot; The room grew silent. From somewhere in the crowd someone yelled,<br>
&quot;Then say hi when you meet him!&quot; Everyone erupted in laughter. A tear slid down Kelranon's cheek, knowing that despite his devotion to Innoruuk, he would soon die. His heart began to race as the sacred chant was chanted by Quexil. Suddenly and without warning he turned to Kelranon, and rammed the unholy blade into the man's heart. After a long drawn out scream, he breathed out his last precious breath of life, and died.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kelranon looked down and noticed he was wearing nothing but his red coak, black pants and boots. He then looked around, he was not breathing, and felt nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this death?&quot; he asked to the man who was not there. Suddenly he heard a stroke of beautiful music. He looked around to see where it was coming from. He realized he was in a dark, black city. Kelranon looked up to see a ceiling at the top of this city. A loud WOOSH! was heard as a hideous figure carrying a lute came from around the corner. It had fangs protruding from its mouth, the hate in its eyes. It raised its eyebrow at the young sorcerer of hate. It snorted at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you're Kelranon?&quot; it asked, its voice booming across the city. Kelranon kneeled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I am Kelranon, who are you? And am I dead?&quot; he asked, not knowing what to expect. The larger beast seemed annoyed by Kelranon's presence.<br>
<br>
&quot;I, am the Maestro of Rancor,&quot; it said bowing respectfully.<br>
&quot;And no, you are not dead.&quot; Kelranon raised an eyebrow at this Maestro. Then his studies cought up with him. Maestro of Rancor was Innoruuk's personal entertainer! This was he Plane of Hate!<br>
<br>
&quot;Do forgive me for not noticing who you were mi'lord,&quot; Kelranon said. The Maestro motoioned for him to follow. Though his quick pace, the necromancer managed to keep up, since he did not need to stop for breath. There, hunched over the balcony stood a very tall figure with a small cape.<br>
<br>
&quot;The mortal you request mi'lord,&quot; the hideous Maestro said. The large figure at the balcony turned. He was even more foul and horrid than the Maestro. Kelranon fell to his knees before this &quot;great&quot; creature.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord Innoruuk!&quot; he said facing the ground. The Prince of Hate sighed at the necromancer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stand up you mortal fool,&quot; he said to him. Kelranon rose and looked up at his god questioningly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am honored to be in your presence mi'lord,&quot; he said attempting to flatter the long hated deity.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh shut up Kelranon. Have you any idea how annoyed I get with all this damn groveling I hear? Why can no Teir'Dal, or Human for that matter, ever get to the bloody point?!&quot; Innoruuk said. This surprised Kelranon, and he simply nodded to his god.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, to get down to business,&quot; The Prince of Hate said. He motioned for Kelranon to sit at a table with a dark feast there. He quickly obeye. Innoruuk continued,<br>
&quot;I'll admit necromancer, I like you, a lot. Your constant devotion to studies, your unwaveringly loyalty. These are all things that greatly intrigue me. But most of all, I enjoy your attitude.&quot; He sighes briefly and looks at the Maestro, &quot;There are many fools who claim I speak to them. That Pietro is a damn fool, he is trapped in a dream world. You however,&quot; he turned his attention back to Kelranon, &quot;You knew full well I spoke to you, but recognized your place. You didn't bosat, you just followed my orders, I like that.&quot; Kelranon beamed a cheery smile at Innoruuk, feeling very relieved. Innoruuk continued,<br>
&quot;That idiot Xon Quexil gave you up in a sacrafice and is experimenting on your disgusting corpse even as we speak. But, since I...like you, I will give you a chance to redeem yourself.&quot; Kelranon looked up, seeming very curious. This was all very exciting to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall return you to Norrath, where you shall remain my humble servant. However,&quot; Innoruuk's hideous face turned very grim.<br>
&quot;You shall not be Kelranon. You shall be Lord Velil X'Cannoth. Noble of many lands in Western Karana. I will remove any knowledge of magic from your mind, as you shall be a fearless warrior of the Indigo Brotherhood,&quot; Innoruuk said handing Kelranon the Chalice of Revival. He thought for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mi'lord, I honestly don't know, it's flattering but-&quot; Innoruuk smashed the table, splintered it into several pieces.<br>
<br>
&quot; YOU do not have a choice!&quot; the deity said, outraged at the recently slain Teir'Dal. Kelranon gulped, very frightened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Y-Yes mi'lord, do accept my apology,&quot; he said catching himself. Innoruuk grinned,<br>
&quot;Excellent, now my child, drink from the chalice and you shall be restored as Lord X'Cannoth!&quot; Kelranon quickly guzzled down the disgusting contents from inside the chalice. He felt a great pressure and heard Innoruuk's evil laughter, and he collapsed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kelranon stood, looking around. He was in a city, but not the one of Innoruuk's. His legs were weak and his stomach churned. The necromancer vomitted on the ground in front of him, then looked around. It was Neriak! He reached into his pouch and found a note telling him to repot to Selonia Punox. It was time. He felt heavier than usual, so he stoppd next to a mirror in the Cauldron of Hate. He as wearing beautiful plated armor, with many weapons. Punox welcomed him to the Indigo Brotherhood. Soon all the knowledge he needed came to him. He was Velil, and his master was S'Rhenvoux. A new chapter began, and Quexil was on his last...   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=85.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=85.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate<option value="vhbrellfrm19">Hate's Culling Guild</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
