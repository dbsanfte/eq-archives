======================================= <br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Camelot 1.56d Test Release Notes <br>
<br>
Monday, December 2, 2002 <br>
<br>
======================================= <br>
<br>
<br>
ANNOUNCEMENTS <br>
<br>
- The Shrouded Isles Beta Program ends today. We want to sincerely thank all of our dedicated Shrouded Isles beta testers and especially the Team Leads. We could not have done this project without you guys. Your diligence and thoroughness is appreciated. <br>
<br>
- Gaheris, the first co-operative server, is now up in open beta. As a result, we have wiped all character records. We'll keep Gaheris in an open beta state until we're sure all the kinks have been worked out, but we don't foresee wiping characters again, barring some unfortunate catastrophe. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- Spread Heal spell healing amounts have been tuned down, and their power costs have been tuned up. They were far more powerful than intended. <br>
<br>
- Dying a standard PvE or Suicide fall death should no longer allow you to use the corpse summoner. PvP deaths are not affected by this change. <br>
<br>
- Leather weapons (whips) should now work correctly from their base materials. There was a bug that prevented higher-level whips being created correctly. <br>
<br>
- Corpse summoners can no longer summon corpses while in combat. <br>
<br>
- Your camera should no longer go below the plane of the water on the SI client. Please note that this only happened in specific places in the Albion expansion. <br>
<br>
- Any summoned pet to a ground target should now obey visibility (turrets for animists). <br>
<br>
- You should no longer see your circular shadow below you when swimming in classic shadows. Likewise, you should no longer see your high definition shadow below you for new shadows when swimming. <br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug where brush was sorted incorrectly versus rivers in the old classic client. <br>
<br>
- Shadows for large monsters on hills should no longer be clipped oddly in terrain zones from certain angles. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer get into Expansion zones while running the Classic client. Previously, you could run the expansion client, teleport to an expansion zone, then run the classic client and try to enter with that same character, resulting in either a client crash or you'd end up in an empty zone. Now if you try to enter a SI zone with the classic client, you'll get an error message, and it won't let you load. <br>
<br>
- The zone loading bar has been moved to not interfere with pretty loading screens. <br>
<br>
- Some Midgard Alchemy recipes and associates skills were not working correctly - they showed a question mark icon and didn't work. This has been fixed. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXPANSION CLASS UPDATES <br>
<br>
Valewalker Changes <br>
<br>
- We've decreased Valewalker base damage a bit. <br>
<br>
<br>
Reaver Changes <br>
<br>
Based on Reaver beta tester and Team Lead feedback, we're beefing up the Reaver a bit. <br>
<br>
- Reavers now get Parry spec at level 5 (i.e. when they join the Temple of Arawn). <br>
<br>
- Increased Reaver base melee skills a bit. <br>
<br>
- Added a DOT shout line (30 second timer, 1500 range). This will give Reavers a pulling spell option that isn't a lifedrain. <br>
<br>
1 Spirit Wrench <br>
6 Spirit Ill <br>
12 Spirit Rot <br>
18 Spirit Decay <br>
23 Soul Toxin <br>
29 Soul Blight <br>
35 Soul Venom <br>
42 Soul Poison <br>
49 Soul Bane <br>
<br>
<br>
- Increased drain percentage on Life Siphon and Soul Siphon from 70% to 80%, and 90% respectively to increase the benefit for high speccing. <br>
<br>
- Reaver lifetap procs now have greater chance of firing, but they drain less. Overall they are, however, far more effective than before. <br>
<br>
- Increased the drain percentage on the highest two lifedrain proc buffs to 80 and 90%. <br>
<br>
- Decreased the initial (i.e. casting) power costs on Aura of Foreboding, Arthritic Curse and Bashing Aura lines by 33%. Their pulse costs remain the same. <br>
<br>
<br>
Savage Changes <br>
<br>
- There was a bug that prevented high level (i.e. over 45), Savages from double-attacking in a round. Instead of double-attacking, they would always triple-attack. This has been fixed, so that they will now correctly single, double, triple, or quad attack in any given round at those levels. <br>
<br>
<br>
Animist Changes <br>
<br>
- Under some circumstances, some bomber pets would not cast their spells properly. This is fixed. <br>
<br>
- Turrets now have shorter casting times. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ART NOTES <br>
<br>
- Sylvan now have their individual faces. Previously there was only one placeholder for all six male and female faces. <br>
<br>
- The Necromancer and Reaver epic armor skins are now in. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW EMOTES <br>
<br>
There are five new emotes: <br>
<br>
- &quot;/ponder&quot; - for when you just want to go &quot;hmmmmmm&quot;. <br>
<br>
- &quot;/military&quot; - a military salute. <br>
<br>
- &quot;/present&quot; - to present someone with something. <br>
<br>
- &quot;/taunt&quot; - a very naughty gesture when you really want to insult someone. <br>
<br>
- &quot;/rude&quot; - a rude gesture. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CRAFTING NOTES <br>
<br>
- Removed the Soulrending Focus gem from Albion spellcraft <br>
<br>
- Fixed new weapon components only using 10th rank materials for Albion and Midgard <br>
<br>
- Fixed recipes where a &quot;null&quot; object was created in Albion <br>
<br>
- Fixed all of the icons for the newer weapons to use the appropriate icon for said weapons (i.e. flexible, hand to hand, and scythes) <br>
<br>
- Fixed weapons that are leather, instead of metal, to have their DPS progress normally <br>
<br>
- Fixed issue with Midgard Alchemy, Herbcraft, etc, not showing up properly <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CLASSIC WORLD NOTES <br>

<br>
EXPANSION WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
