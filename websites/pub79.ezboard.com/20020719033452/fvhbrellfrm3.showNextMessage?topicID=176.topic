She had been given a book to read on elementals and their power. Tenzing sat in the Nektulos forest outside the dark city of Neriak and began to read. The book was entitled History Of The Elemental. <br>
<br>
In the past there had been problems with these spells. Powerful Magicians stretching their abilities a little far, not slowly preparing for the newly found ability to form an element into an actual creature. At first the newly summoned pets would go wildly out of control and slay their master and everything around them. Small armies of these little creatures would storm around the Magician guildhalls and destroy everything they saw. Ancient and amazingly talented Magicians were slaughtered where they stood, unable to battle against a foe, they have never encountered before. After a great deal of spell research and tests, the Magicians found a way to destroy the pets with their arcane magic. The Magicians casted a spell that would allow them to destroy the pet and absorb their energy. Strangely only a tiny bit of energy would be attained by these elements, or elementals, as they came to be called. The Magicians gathered their forces and began a way to tame and control these elementals, this went on for centuries. Finally the Magicians came to a system they found to work out. A gem called Malachite was found and used to help summon an elemental that was completely under the control of the caster.......<br>
<br>
&quot;Blah, Blah, Blah.&quot; Tenzing closed the book sharply and sneezed as dust flew up into her face from the ancient book. She set it aside on the ground. I don't need to read all of that, I have the scrolls I need here to do my dark biddings, why learn the past when I live in the present? Tenzing looked over her four new scrolls:<br>
<br>
       Elementalkin Fire<br>
       Elementalkin Water<br>
       Elementalkin Earth<br>
       Elementalkin Air<br>
<br>
Tenzing copied down all the words of the scroll down into her spell book. She was wondering what elemental she should conjure up first. Her mind raced with thoughts of intrigue. What would it look like? Will it have any feelings? A surge of feelings was rushing through her body, such excitement came over Tenzing's body. She decided that she would conjure up a water elemental. The spell was read in a low whisper, Tenzing through the gem of malachite on the ground, and then it began....     The malachite quickly melted away into a pool of water, Tenzing still whispering the words. The pool of water started to glow, hues of blue and light blue began to emerge in the pool. Tenzing was still whispering the words, faster now. The air seemed to change, it was harder for Tenzing to breath, growls came from the pool of water. Finally an arm formed out of the water, first one, then another. The elemental began to form, its body began to rise out of the water. Tenzing said the last phrase of her spell &quot;Rise and serve your master, stand before me, now.&quot; Tenzing opened her eyes and before her was the formed water elemental, the pool of water on the ground was gone now. What Tenzing saw was merely a torso with two arms sticking at it, hanging down. Constant ripples formed back and forth in the water that made up the elemental’s entire body, never stopping. No eyes, ears, mouth, nothing could be found of the creature. The creature stood floating above the ground, the torso like body coming to a point at the bottom end of the creature. It appeared the creature had to clutched fists, but no fingers could be made out. After a few minutes of silence between the two, something happened, a first in Tenzing's life. The elemental spoke to Tenzing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your will is my command, master.&quot; Tenzing took a step back, her eyes showing fear. The elemental had called her master, why is she was she so afraid. It could have been the amount of energy she felt pulsating off the elemental, a deep feeling, which sank deep into her heart. Perhaps she was actually trying to comprehend that she actually conjured up such a beast, an entity, a.... elemental. The only way to get over her fear was to understand, she had to talk to the elemental, even though she was frozen in awe of its power. Finally Tenzing spoke up.<br>
<br>
&quot;You serve me, don't you?&quot; Tenzing swallowed down the lump in her throat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you are my master, I am your pet.&quot; The water elemental replied back to Tenzing. <br>
<br>
&quot;So, you are saying that what ever I want you to do, you will do it?&quot; Tenzing was still in doubt of what was really going on. <br>
<br>
&quot;Just give me a command and I shall follow it.&quot; The elemental was talking a deep, emotionless tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go kill that black wolf over there.&quot; Tenzing watched as her water elemental pet rushed towards the black wolf and began to pound on it with its fists. A vicious attack was launched on the black wolf, as the water elemental landed blow after blow to the wolf's head. The wolf tried to claw back and bite the elemental but had a hard time hurting it. The water pet was growling and howling with an indescribable cry. Its ferocity easily outmatched the wolf, which soon was badly bleeding from the eyes, ears, and mouth. Finally with a great surge of power from the elemental, its fist, went through the wolf's chest, grabbing a hold of its heart, and ripping it out. The bloody wolf fell to the ground and gave out one last whelp before the light in its eyes faded out. The water elemental threw down the wolf's heart and began to laugh a deep, dark, cackle, finally stopping and turning to Tenzing<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you happy my master?&quot; The elemental asked.<br>
<br>
Tenzing smiled with great pleasure. She to began to emit a small dark laugh, and it was soon accompanied by the elemental. The master and the pet both laughing, the bloody corpse of the wolf, starting to get cold, fire beetles and moss snakes spying at it from a distance, wanting a piece of its decaying body. Tenzing looked down at her hands, with them she had created this great power in which she had total control of. She looked out over the great Nektulos Forrest, a new feeling of power filled her. She spoke quietly to herself...<br>
<br>
&quot;It would appear my evil essence has created an evil elemental.&quot; This is exactly what I wanted, now I have the added power I need to begin my journey to perfection. It is now time to begin my training, to become the strongest Magician of all time. Tenzing was beginning to talk louder. Yes, I will use this new power to crush my enemies. Tenzing was even louder now. I will serve my dark master to my fullest potentional. Tenzing was screaming out, putting as much feeling as she could into her words. It's time now to feel my power world...... Never underestimate the power of the Magician. Her pet was growling and glowing, showing off its power to impress its master, and prove her point of its master's power. Tenzing now stopped silent, and began to think to herself what other powers the other elements held, and what would become of her future. She looked down and picked up the book she was reading earlier, thinking to herself &quot;This may be of some use.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come my pet, we have work to do.&quot; Tenzing called out to her pet, and it followed close by her. Tenzing walked deeper into the forest with her pet and thanked the gods for the power they bestowed upon her. It was time to begin her reputation, her destiny, her life......<br>
<br>

I can appreciate the feeling of utter power.  I remember my first rush as well.  It is indeed grand to not only meet another magician but to fight along side one as family.<br>
