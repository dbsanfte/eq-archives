And this is where your logic is flawed.<br>
<br>
Jump-rings are not made one-at-a-time, as you seem to think. What is done, is a length of wire (Also quite easy to make by drawing metal through a 'draw plate') is wrapped around a dowel/rod in a 'spring-like' coil. This long coil of wire is then slid off the rod, and cut down one side, producing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>many</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rings <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fast. Hundreds, if not thousands of jump-rings can be produced this way in a very short amount of time. I have not purchased a single ring for the suit of Chainmail i'm making myself, using this process the entire time. Buying them would just be a waste of money, and only save me a small amount of time.<br>
<br>
A 'commoner' in the past needed no blacksmithing skill to sit down and learn the relitivly easy process of making a piece/suit of Chainmail. Think of it, no TV or radio, no computers, unable to read (Like there was access to the super rare and expensive books), none of the modern leisure activities we waste our time on these days. Time is one thing they had plenty of. Mix in a realm at war and in need of more troops with the best armor they can manage to make, and nothing but time to make it, and you have many suits of Chainmail being produced.<br>
<br>
Blacksmith's time was far to valuable to be spent on this work that didn't need their skills, since it took many years (Of a much shorter life-span) of appenticeship to learn these skills. The time it takes to 'weave' them is still not nearly as intensive compaired to the time it takes to heat an entire piece of raw metal, and pound it with thousands of blows into a desired shape. Progress on the weave is actually quite amazing one you get into the groove, and all the fitting and size tweaking can be done mostly after the Chainmail is almosy done. The Platemail requires constant tweaking and ajusting as an on-going process for it to fit the final user. If Platemail was so much easier (and considered so much better in protection) to produce, why weren't more then the elite/royal troops out-fitted in it? Why were the British royal family out-fitted in Spanish made armor from so far away? Becuase it was only there that the level of skill could be found to produce Platemail to their standards. Trust me, smithing is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> time consuming, on top of the years-and-years of learning needed to get really good at it. Even i'm only a modestly skilled smith, with many years of practice and learning still ahead of me to become what i'd consider a 'master'.<br>
<br>
And, as i final note, if a Blacksmith <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to take their valuable time to make a suit of Chainmail he would have out-sourced the repetitive work of making large secions of of the Mail to apprentices and commoners, only to do the final fitting and assembly work personally. There were plenty of people with the time to sit and do the work.<br>
<br>
When <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the factors are put into consideration; the cost to produce heat (You gotta chop down the wood, drag it back, stoke the forge, over-and-over. There's no natural gas that's 'always on'), the time it takes to actually fit and smith out a piece of armor, the avalibility of ore that is of high enough quality to actually make platemale, and the limited number of people who actually have the long-learned skills needed to make a piece of Platemail, the cost/value of Platemail goes through the roof compaired to Chainmail. Time is a major factor, but only one piece of the big puzzle. And i still have to argue that smithing out a large piece of armor is going to be just as time consuming as producing a large piece of Chainmail, on top of the other costs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xainder>Xainder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#000000>(6/22/03 11:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Comparison</span><hr size=1> Oh, and as Raven said, that is exactly why Minstrels get Evade 2.

However, I've become the middle man in this argument.  <br>
<br>
See, I have a friend who's horny over that stuff.  His dream is to have a forge and make swords and armor.  He's a geek when it comes to the tecnicalities of metals, their properties, how to temper them, forge them, how to make it.  He's done all the reasearch he can, right down to a business plan and what kind of market he could sell too.  So he's the guy that you're basically arguing with.  Here's what he says.<br>
<br>
Chain Mail made from wire is nice for decoration.  True, it's easy to make, and cheap.  It's probably the most common form of chain mail present today in &quot;live action roleplaying&quot; because of this.  However, he wouldn't wear one of those to save his life.    <br>
<br>
Take a square of chain mail made this way, go to a lumber yard, and tack the square to a piece of firewood.  Stand the firewood on end with the mail facing to a side, then take a swipe at the mail with an axe, hard enough to make the firewood go fly a few feet (if the axe doesn't stick in the wood).  Then, have fun picking out your wire links from the wood.<br>
<br>
The kind of mail that someone would pay for and wear  (because it's more flexible/breathable than Plate) to protect their life would be made from something much &quot;harder&quot; than some wire you can manually wrap around a rod and cut.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not going to comment any further, because you two are probably going to get technical on me and I don't really care.  I posted this much just to defend my original claim since I did stick my nose into this.<br>
<br>
But there is one thing I know from reading.  Many European royal families used to seek out Spanish made swords (Damascus?  I'm not sure if this is the city) because the metal was a better quality, as well as the methods of making the sword.  It turns out that the ore they were getting had many imperfections (carbon) in it, which resulted in a better quality alloy at the end of the making of the sword.  I know, swords aren't armor.  But I'll make this correlation.  If the ore used for making swords was better, wouldn't the ore be as good for making armor??  <br>
<br>
When that particular source of ore was depleted, or became purer, whatever...Damascus? had established itself as a center for swordmaking such that the masters of the trade flocked there.  There wasn't THAT much more knowledge in Damascus than anywhere else, it's just that their supply of Ore happened to be better before they ever knew that the ore was that important.<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is, the fact that the royal family got their Plate Mail armor from Spain, in my mind, has nothing to do with the tradeoff in difficulty between making chain and plate armor.  <br>
<br>
And umm, unless someone can prove Richard Cohen wrong (the author of the book I'm getting this all from), there was no &quot;Chain Mail&quot; in that era, so once again, what difference does it make where the Royal family got their armor? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 447<br> <font color=#000000>(6/25/03 2:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Spanish steel - much stronger than our native blade</span><hr size=1> I would always prefer to buy weapons and armour from Spaniards anyway.

No flux and the solder won't flow properly), solder of some sort, and to heat the metal to a 'flowing' state for a brief moment. When a piece of Chainmail is tempered, you have no flux, solder, and the heat is actually just below the flowing liquid point. And as such, no fusing occures. And fusing (Bring 2 crossed pieces of metal to liquid state at the cross) is a valid way to also do a simpler join, (Tack wielding is a form of fusing) but much less exact then soldering. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 452<br> <font color=#000000>(6/27/03 10:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> nobody's ever called me that before...</span><hr size=1> /cry<br>

On a more relevant note (or is the debate about chainmail-making really relevant in this topic anyhow? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), I think somebody should get Mythic a link to this thingy and force them to switch the prices on chainmail.<br>

I'm not sure what the topic is anymore, but i'm sure I wouldn't understand it, even with an explenation.<br>

Housing spots are down to 23 plats, though. I'm so glad house placement (for the most part) doesn't really matter, since you can just get a porter and such to go pretty much anywhere you need to.<br>
