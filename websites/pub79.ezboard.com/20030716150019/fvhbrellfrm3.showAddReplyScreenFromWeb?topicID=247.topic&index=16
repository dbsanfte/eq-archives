<br>
storymode on<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering the previous night Darkrayne, in a fit of madness had thrown his morning star down at Natori's feet in the uppermost room with the Aviaks of South Karana. <br>
<br>
He was no match for pure mind attacks against the druidic treants, much to his chagrin. He had no choice but to dive into a nearby bush and hope the treant hadn't seen him.<br>
<br>
Slowly slowly, the treant passed the spot Darkrayne once was  at and paused...but continued on..brething a sigh of relief, Darkrayne retrieved his morning star from the Aviaks. upon his arrival, he found Natori had gone without a trace.<br>
<br>
After a few days, Darkrayne got word that Natori had run off into the lands of The OverThere in Kunark...away from all activities of The Wicked Crown. Knowing she would need his healing powers being a warrior, Darkrayne, not having anything better to do left for Kunark.<br>
<br>
Much time and blood was spilt in Kunark, a few unmentionable things happened too, as Darkrayne's mind was becoming more and more confused from the poison. During his time there, Darkrayne felt what would have been called feelings and emotions for Natori, between you and i. After a bit of care though, he was soon on his way to recovery, and he soon became himself again, with only a few brief waves of emotion which Darkrayne shrugged off. However, after having experienced such emotion...he may never again be able to be completely rid of those diseases (emotions).<br>
<br>
Eventually Darkrayne received a summons from a peon to show up to the Dragon of Hate for a meeting. Little did he expect the things that would take place, or the people he would...or would not...see.<br>
<br>
During the last bit of the ceremony, Xilau had been named a Dread Overlord, and almost, as if on cue, the second she was named such a worthy title, snipers from the Wicked Crown, until now hid in shadows, had a clear shot on Darkrayne as he stood up to greet a newcomer..each one took a shot and not one missed. Dark fell to his knees murmuring a spell of healing to alleviate his pain and to lessen his injury before passing out. But it was not until another heal spell from a guildmate that Dark was able to begin recovery. He spoke of the Wicked Crown, the faction and conglomeration of Teir'Dal, Feir'Dal a very unlikely alliance, Humans Dwarves, everything. Their sole purpose, is to overthrow the Queen, to return power to the people. Ambassador Rylan was the last uncorrupt person that stood in the underground (Wicked Crown)'s way. He had to be removed...and his daughter Natori Rylan...just to be sure.<br>
<br>
Now that you are aware of Darkrayne *ahem* my situation, and my responsibility to the Queen, for she does not know that even her most trusted Vizier is corrupt...now that you know Natori's situation...she is the only one that can prevent this entire change fromtaking place...you MUST let her live, even if my life is forfeit...you must do what you can, in my next chapter of memoirs, i will write, my will, and i will tell all i know about The Wicked Crown...so that you may identify them in your travels and dispose of them. I have seen the leader but i could not handle him on my own...please i am begging you as a brother of the Harvest, take care of Natori, for i soon, may not be....strong enough...or have the will...i bid adieu.<br>
<br>
*Darkrayne closes his book, turns his head and closes his eyes...a tear actually drops from the corner of one. Ashamed of his weakness, he retires to bed, defeated* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udarkrayne2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkrayne2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/02 11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Young, full of hate, a formless arm of Innoruuk appea</span><hr size=1> The wind blew chill. Ill things were about to take place. Glaring into the unwarming sun, Darkrayne shouted curses to the inhabitants of The OverThere.<br>
<br>
Accepting his challenge, a Sarnak, whip in hand charged. <br>
Dodging the first strike barely, Darkrayne drew the creature back into the ambush...soon after all was done.<br>
<br>
It was about this time a messenger appeared from his former student Natori. &quot;The mistress wishes you to answer her summons in the frozen lands of Velious, along the beaches of Ice Clad Ocean.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;So be it, I must take leave of you now...were we more then just allies, I would request your presence..but this time..I go alone.&quot;  Darkrayne said no emotion marring his words.<br>
<br>
Swallowing a foul brew, Darkrayne was soon surrounded by a brief Lupine aura. Making his trip to the outpost short. <br>
The boats were having problems, so a little gnome awaited him, using her ability to translocate from one place to another.<br>
<br>
It was but a matter of moments that Darkrayne was at yet another gnomish caster, she too translocated Darkrayne to the Iceclad Ocean. Upon arriving, Darkrayne needed tend Natori's wounds for they were mortal. Not many words were spoken, none were needed.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until Darlkrayne and Natori slew Midnight that anything really happened. <br>
&quot;Darn, I need the other leg bone, not this one&quot; Natori said. <br>
&quot;Perhaps you will get lucky. I wanted to congratulate you my student, you have done well...you are now a full fledged Harvester, you have grown strong in arm and will. Soon it shall be time for me to make my final step.&quot; Darkrayne said.<br>
&quot;I would not have been able to reach such a level without your guidance. But...may I ask, what final step do you speak of?&quot; Natori asked. <br>
&quot;BAH, I only pulled that which was inside of you out. You are the one that got yourself this far. You had potential, and I allowed for yo uto access it, that is all. The final step which i speak of is my attack on the Underground.  I MUST put this folly to an end. We don't need another incident like what happened at the last ceremony. It is time, I will find their lair, sneak in and assassinate the Human Druid, for without him, their ranks shall surely fall. It is then t hat you will ride in with a legion of your own troops, and you will crush their miserable hides and drink of their blood freely.&quot; Darkrayne said<br>
&quot;The Thresher tells me all of the Harvest is behind you on this.&quot; Natori commented. &quot;Aye, I do not doubt that is so...but I must do this alone. We must bloody their nose, Crush their spirits, then humiliate them...What they did on sacred ground cannot be forgiven. Innoruuk will not stand for such, nor wil I!&quot;<br>
Darkrayne near started preaching. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I do not know fully what is up with this Human, but he is a key...a key to my past...and to my future.&quot; Darkrayne turns his head. &quot;Now...is the time...you must know of everything about me.&quot; Darkrayne took a deep breath for he knew what he was about to say was very controversial and would greatly affect his relationship with the warrior and ultimately the view others in the guild had on him. &quot;I...am the bastard child of Zenthra Versayth and my father, Merthiste D'Arnak, High Priest of Neriak.&quot; Before Darkrayne could finish, Natori went berserk, she knew where ths was leading. &quot;this is TWICE now that you have betrayed my trust, you, YOU said you were the only one I could trust yet you've betrayed me yet AGAIN!&quot;<br>
&quot;The time was not right Natori, I did that for your own safety. This is a truth you WILL accept or die. For I cannot allow you to have such knowledge and yet breathe. Now, choose warrior.&quot; Darkrayne unbelts his hammer after saying this.<br>
&quot;And do you really think you could bring me to my end?&quot; Natori challenged. Darkrayne stares, unemotional. After a moment Natori speaks, &quot;You are not worth the time in dulling my blade&quot; sheathing her weapon. <br>
<br>
&quot;That is fear I sense child!&quot; Darkrayne shouted.<br>
&quot;should we have fought I would have slain you. Fear is a weakness and until you get a grip on all of your emotions you wil lnever achieve your fullest power. There is one more thing I must teach you. Within there is a power of Hate so strong it would make your magical defenses stronger. This discipline is called resistant. Once you are able to control your emotion, you will be my end.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My Hate and my Anger are what keep me strong&quot; Natori says.<br>
&quot;Then, prove your hatred, fight!, I AM NOT AFRAID&quot; Darkrayne steps up to Natori and stares into her eyes, piercing her through her soul, his challenge still ever present, he waits for her decision. &quot;Fight me or accept these truths...&quot;<br>
<br>

Is it yet another lie? Perhaps you are doing the will of the Wicked Crown?&quot; Natori spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why would i have plans for the assassination of the Leader if i was doing their will?&quot; Darkrayne defended himself.  &quot;More lies? i do not know what to believe.&quot; Natiori said.<br>
&quot;I tried to save your father, if only you were there to witness such, i exhausted myself trying to save him.&quot; Darkrayne's head hangs as he speaks this. &quot;You kidnapped me when i was young.&quot; &quot;i did this to save you,&quot; Darkrayne spoke. &quot; More lies?&quot; Natori asked &quot;All i know is that you kidnapped me when i was young, what if it is the Underground that is trying to help me and you the corrupt one?&quot; &quot;I heard them say such.&quot; Darkrayne said. &quot;There were no problems until after you took me away.&quot; Natori fired. Yet it seems they have been after you for quite some time.&quot; &quot;Only about a day or so if even before i took you. I overheard their plans to poison your father and to slit your throat. I saved you&quot; Darkrayne said. &quot;How do i know this?&quot; Natori said.<br>
<br>
Changing the subject, Darkrayne speaks &quot;You have grown in hate Natori&quot; &quot;It is a shame most of it is directed at you&quot; she replied. &quot;Let us hurry and finish this.&quot; Natori continued. &quot;I agree, we must finish this so that i can continue with my plan. To assassinate the leader.&quot; Darkrayne said.<br>
&quot;For now, the Underground is our common enemy, we will dispose of them, but then i want you out of my life forever.&quot; Natori said &quot;I am a part of your past, past is pain and agony, both tools of The Father, if you slay me, you kill your past, do you really want this?&quot; Darkrayne asked. &quot;Will this make you stop bothering me?&quot; Natori asked. &quot;I am the past, you can't forget me, i will always be there, after we defeat the Underground i will leave you be as you wish.&quot; Darkrayne spoke.<br>
&quot;Please get on with this, i don't want you in my life anymore.&quot; Natori said. &quot;And i don't care to be part of it&quot; Darkrayne responded. &quot;But you still won't alleviate the pain.&quot; He continued. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you ever shut-up?!&quot; Natori asked getting quite impatient.<br>
Darkrayne takes a few steps back and challenges Natori &quot;Very well, choose now warrior, fight? or do we work together against our common enemy?&quot; Darkrayne asked. <br>
<br>
Without a comment Natori charged, her weapons drawn.<br>
<br>
A Brutal battle ensued, Natori's spear and sword tearing into the Cleric's weak armor...blow after blow he sustained, and his counters barely scratching the warrior's armor. &quot;Oh my god! i hit you harder then i hit the monsters&quot; Natori taunted.<br>
Ignoring her remarks, Darkrayne steps back and stuns Natori, blinding her and rooting as well, he was testing her magical defenses, and...much to his dismay, they were strong.<br>
&quot;You have good magical defenses Natori&quot; Darkrayne spoke.<br>
&quot;So you've noticed?&quot; Natori retorted landing several more blows on the bruised and bloody Cleric. After rooting himself, Darkrayne decides it is best to beat a hasty retreat, after testing Natori out...he now knew what he was up against.<br>
&quot;Do you realize i hurt myself more falling down the steep part of the cliff then what you've done to me?&quot; Natori taunted.<br>
This was when Darkrayne rooted and blinded Natori, retreating a great distance. &quot;Now you run and hide? Why don't you stand and face me if you have the courage&quot; Natori's taunts kept coming...Darkrayne had backed out of range of Natori's arrows and out of her sight, there he restored himself full. Calling out to Natori Darkrayne spoke, &quot;It would seem Innoruuk favors you this day...no matter now we begin round two....things will change shortly&quot; Darkrayne now taunted.<br>
Starting out aggressively, Darkrayne called massive amounts of wrath of the gods to strike Natori down..within minutes she was more then half dead...however, she kept coming, and..taking her final lesson to heart, she summoned all the hate within her soul and her magical defenses skyrocketed.<br>
Out of mana and too worn physically (still not fully recovered from his injuries at Natori's ceremony of binding) Darkrayne was defeated...he turned to face the warrior toe-to-toe and..moments later, the frozen tundra of Iceclad was stained pink from the cleric's now lifeless body.<br>
<br>
Natori had, infact...killed her past...shaking her head in disgust at the inanimate shell, she turned away..unemotional.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Innoruuk had found Darkrayne's service no longer useful to him, so he was done and his death, unlike Natori's belief, was permanent...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I Drinseth G'Naltha, state my final will and testiment. <br>
If you are reading this, it has been finished, the last chapter and ounce of my strength has been spent. I hope and pray that the Wicked Crown is no longer, but if my demise was premature, it is my last wish for Natori to be kept alive at all costs until she is able to come a thousand thousands strong to take back Neriak from the Underground. I have hid my possessions, only one that is fated by the gods to find them will I take their location to my grave, wherever it may be. There is one thing i wish Natori to have, it is in the drawer in the library. There is a brew there for her to take to her father. It is my life work...i have taken many recipes and ingredients from all over Norrath to create this super-tonic, i believe this is the cure to the malady that her father was stricken with. I was a bad father for her, the kid deserves a<br>
REAL father...though the Ambassador was not my first choice, he will do just fine...I wish to thank all the family i had, for allowing me to be part of the legacy that is The Violent Harvest. I leave you with one gift, i took it upon myself to straighten up the Library, those tomes were in such disarray, everything is now in chronological order and is grouped by type and context.<br>
<br>
Hate with Honor all, and farewell...All...Praise....Innoruuk<br>
