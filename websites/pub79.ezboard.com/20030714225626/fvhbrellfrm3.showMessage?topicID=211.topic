A painful, choked rasp echoed in the silence as he sucked in a small breath.  The crackling sound of shattered ribs was quickly followed by a pain-ridden cough that sent him to his knees.  One lung had collapsed, pierced by the shrapnel that had been his rib cage, but the other was functional enough to sustain his un-life.  Mythral clutched the edge of the sarcophagus, trying to focus on easing the bloody cough and maintaining consciousness.  To be found in this place would mean his destruction – he had to find the strength to summon the magiks.<br>
<br>
Straightening as best he could, he whispered the incantation.  “Animus hezod petrius brellini!”  His final word more of a course grunt than a phrasing of the ancient teachers of his craft, enough of his power and focus remained to dance in tune with the quiet enunciation.  A momentary yellow-brown aura illuminated the darkness, casting shadow across the other relics of the crypt, then faded once more as the light dissipated.  The hunched figure was gone, replaced by a mammoth creature of stone and earth.  Red clay seeped from its wounded chest, but it paid no heed as it easily shifted the lid from the sarcophagus, then crawled within the massive tomb.  Once within, it pulled the lid back into place, sealing itself within the protecting darkness.  Once more the light flashed, and the form of the elemental was replaced by the diminutive Teir Dal.  The tome had been crafted for two – for they had ruled in life together, and many believed that they would continue to do so in death.  Their bones had been given to young necromancers in Nektulos when Mythral had claimed the tomb as his own, so as far as he knew, the rulers had become the slaves of the inept.<br>
<br>
Mythral knew that he had to find the strength to complete his work, or the pain of his current state would last for centuries.  Once more, his lips trembled with effort, but a cough upstaged the action, broke his concentration, and turned him to his side in a fetal position as he spat bloody bubbles from his ruined lung.  He cried out with the agony, and twitched, nearly giving in to the desire to give in to the sheltering dark.  If he had, he would have slept for years, only to awaken in a form permanently bent and scarred.  If he gave up, he would become in form the monster that his enemies had made him out to be.<br>
<br>
His breath was shallow, and a nauseating dizziness threatened to take him.  With an effort greater than any he had known, he mouthed the words, ignoring the slurring sound that his bloodied saliva made as it escaped his broken body.  “Animus hezod sauritus iksaris.”  An aura of green, black and red flashed and was stilled, and he lay writhing in pain in the form of an iksar, still robed in black, and still sundered with a shattered side.  Almost immediately, he could feel the regenerative nature of the iksar form begin to work throughout his body.  The process would take days, and he would have to work through the popping of bones as they broke off the old pieces and grew new marrow in their place, eventually reabsorbing the shattered fragments until no trace of the injury remained.  He would have to refresh the shape and focus on the healing, but he would not give in to the fate the Reaper had intended to impose, and his own Captain had nearly finished.  <br>
<br>
Mythral whimpered slightly at the memory of the touch of Hate’s power, channeled through the Reaper’s touch.  The pain, white hot and all consuming, had scarred its place into his mind.  His body might heal, but his mind would never forget the sensation of that touch.  Mythral knew full well that only the Rune of Power had saved him from being wrecked and defenseless, and that in that state the Reaper could have called for the sanctified oils and fire that would have ended his claim to immortality.  The Reaper had become death incarnate, and not even Lord Faeolin could have prevented Mythral’s death if the rune had not absorbed most of the shock.  No such rune had protected him from Faeolin's strike, adn she had nearly broken him beyond his will to recover.   She had shattered his coffin, his only place of residence within the grange, and forced him to flee to this place, his last, hidden refuge within the city of Neriak.<br>
<br>
Now that the healing had begun, Mythral was able to calm himself, and ease into the process of breathing shallowly, focus upon the healing, yet still free his conscious mind for thinking.  He had much to consider.  Lord Faeolin had stood up for him, had defended him against the others, just as he knew she would.  She was his Captain, he cared not what else had happened, she would remain so.  In time she would understand that his bite was no attack.  He did not eat his own kind.  He tried not to think about the taste of her, the scent, the life of her.  She had hsi loyalty, but his head still swam at the vitality she offered.  In time she would see why he had to make sure she would remain immune to the coercion of the enemy - faithful to the casue they had taken up - together.  She would lead them all to victory.  Mythral had merely ensured that no one else would beguile her into taking a wrong turn in the many forked road ahead.<br>
<br>
His conscience appeased, Mythral turned his thoughts to the Reaper, as much to resist thinking of Faeolin's lingering taste upon his lips as to replay his gambit.  Mythral smiled.  He had provoked the Reaper, as he knew he must, to prove that he cared nothing for justice – and to prove that he was the one behind the disappearance of the Prophet.  Mythral did not know why he even cared about his cousin, really.  But he was driven by the urgency of finding him, and driven by the knowledge that Khasirath was behind it all.  So, he took a chance, one that nearly cost him his un-life, but it worked.<br>
<br>
Really, it had been quite simple.  He had followed Shaede out of the Grange, sent the others to continue after her, and then sped through the night air to the chambers of the Reaper.  Khasirath’s prized S’Therik servants had of course been there, busy as ever ensuring that every detail of their Master’s work was completed to his satisfaction.  Mythral had waited until one of them took his leather scrip and left to return to the compound of House S’Therik.  Less than two blocks away, Mythral had struck – without warning, without hesitation and without emotion.  He cared not for the servants of the Reaper, and he cared not what happened to them in this life or any other.  A simple entrancement stopped the servant in the dark street, and there he waited as Mythral resumed his shape and bared his fangs.  The pulsing blood in the servant’s jugular was a strong draw as the servant stood helpless in the dark, waiting for the death he knew must be approaching.  Mythral struck fast, and struck clean.  The body in his hands quivered and thrashed a moment as he drained it of life, but then it lay still as the euphoria of vampiric death consumed it.  Mythral looked back to the servant and shuddered once as he saw the lines of pulsing blood tracing across his body. The rush of energy he had gained from his kill was intense, but short lived.  The dog he had consumed was a small life, and while enough to sustain him, was not enough to satisfy.  He wanted to taste the servant – just as bit to ease the need for more, but he had his ethics.  He did not eat his own kind, not even if the servants of traitors.  He licked his lips, savoring the last traces, and repeated his oath.  &quot;I do not eat my own kind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mythral recalled casually tossing the dog to the servants feet, and reaching up to take the insignia from the collar of the servant.  He recalled returning to stand beside Faeolin as she confronted the Reaper and his followers, confronted those who had taken over the Harvest and imprisoned or slain the Prophet.  Mythral had known as soon as the Reaper had looked in his hand at the S’Therik house insignia that Mythral had thrown to him, that his bait had caught the beast.  He began casting his gate right away, but the Reaper’s speed was amazing.  The power of Hate blazed in his eyes and blazed in his touch, and Mythral had been spun away barely maintaining concentration as the gate was formed.  The Reaper had taken the bait, but Mythral had paid the price.  He knew the Reaper’s only regret when he discovered that his precious servant was still alive would be that he had not slain Mythral.  The lie of his supposed morals had been exposed, though, and Faeolin now had the justified right to lead open rebellion against those that were bent upon the destruction of the Harvest.<br>
<br>
Mythral sighed, then cringed with the pain.  It was begun, and soon Khasirath would taste the regret of having crossed the scion of Mistmoore.  They all would.  Mythral would find the Prophet and expose them as traitors, and once again he would save the Harvest.  Just as he had when he found the cure for the disease that Payle had brought upon them, an act for which they had branded him a trator - Mythral would again bring salvation to the faithful of Hate.  <br>
<br>
“The faithful of Hate,” he whispered aloud.<br>
<br>
With a sudden awareness, Mythral realized that the touch of Khasirath had indeed been filled with Hate, and Mythral finally understood that the power was a reality.  That touch had changed him, and Mythral could feel the change growing in his heart as he lay in the tomb regenerating.  He felt the dark shadow spread across his soul as he sensed himself giving over to this new emotion.  For the first time in his life, Mythral acceded to baseness, left the high calling of his intellect, and acknowledged the supremacy of Hate.<br>
<br>
Khasirath had done more than spawn a rebellion with his action, he had birthed a new tool for Innoruuk.  Mythral smiled with the dark knowledge that coursed through his soul with the touch of a new master.  Agnostic no more, unbeliever no more, Mythral Mistmoore was born again.  The Vampire of Hate, had Risen.<br>
