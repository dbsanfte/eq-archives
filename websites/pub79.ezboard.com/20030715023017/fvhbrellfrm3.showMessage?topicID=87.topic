A Subject of Dark and Light (char history)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sria sat down on the balconey of her home in the Forign Quarters of Neriak. Her skin, a deep blue was offset by her large light blue eyes and white hair that cascaded down her back. Covering her body, she wore a soft blue robe with golden trim and a matching cord tied around her waist. She looked up and smiled at Tullaris, a man she married a long time ago and greatly admires for having such a strong will to have resisted her attemts to bring him to light. He sat down beside her and slipped his arm around her back as she rested her head on his shoulder and they both looked town that the street below, thier feet dangeling off the edge of the balconey.<br>
*                *                *                *                                <br>
Sria remembered back to when she had first met her husband in the lake and fought side by side slaughtering the aviaks that had currupted the lands. The will of Mithaniel Marr was strong in her life then and she lived each day by it and helping others in his name. She had a passion deep in her soul for the Teir`Dal race. Thier fetures were elegant and strong, yet gracefull and decieving. She thought them a beautiful race and often wore the illusion of one herself. Fascinated and conceated, believing no man could resist her charm she began to work her charm on this young Tier`Dal shadowknight. Mixing her feelings in with her attempt yo turn him to Marr, she showed him the truth and good of the god she served. After many evening together, talking and sharring with eachother, Sria decided that marrying this young shadowknight might aid her in her quest to turn him (after all, she did really like him, but wasn't sure if she truley loved him, or the thrill that she could change him). <br>
<br>
They soon were married on the wooden bridge of West Karana and soon after Tullaris took her to see where he resided within Neriak. The home was nothing extravagent. There were three rooms with beds, a sitting room with a fire in the middle to keep the home warm and a large balconey that overlooked the streets of the dark city.<br>
<br>
As she continued to try and turn her new husband, he began to show her his ways, beliefs and expanded her knowledge of Innoruuk. Excited with what she was learning about Tullaris's life, Sria began to lose site of her goal and started following her husband to new hunting sites. She killed her first bard with him by her side incase something went wrong. The sweet song of that dead bard drove her to seek them out and silence more, only to hear the tunes played uopn thier death. Because of her new actions, her close friends drifted from her, appauled by what she had done. They told her repeadily that her husband had changed her and she had become one of evil. Laughing at thier words, Sria went to the man that had raised her in the light of Marr and sought his counsel. He scolded her for her actions and sent her away with his love, in hopes that she would recognize her wrongs soon and repent, returning to the ways of good again.<br>
<br>
Astonished and depressed from her fathers words, Sria isolated herself in Feerrott and sat in the middle of the mail route the bards took. She no longer fought them as they approched for pleasure of the sweet dead tune they sung. She just sat there in deep thought until her consentration was inturrupted by a thunk on the head by an angry bard which in return she unconciously killed for her own protection. She knew then that her reputation amoung the bards had deminished and there was a price on her head. She looked up, her eyes closed in deep consentration and spoke to Marr. &quot;Why! oh why my lord have you turned your back from me?!&quot; A vision came into her mind as she sat there with her eyes closed. It was an immage of Mithaniel Marr, standing in front of her in an ivory building which she payed little head to. In a questionable, angry tone she heard his words pierce through the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;You!...my once so faithful servant are the one who has turned your back upon the ways of valor and good.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Sria inturrupted him,speaking up in her defense, &quot;I have done no such thing! I have done your will all my life, I have strived every day to please you, share your ways with others and bring others into your sevice...all in the name of your DAMNED FORSAKEN VALOR. YOU put this shadowknight in my path and presented me with the quest to turn him! I have done only what I have been asked to do by you so do NOT bring false words against me!&quot; Too proud to notice she had stepped out of line in accussing the god, she stood her ground and starred strait into his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;That shadowknight, young servant, was a bet that if&quot;, the great god began to speak as she interupted him once again in furry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, so 'now' I am a pawn to be tossed around and played with when you are bored?!&quot; Her eyes narrowed in an icy glare as she began to see the sceem of things.<br>
<br>
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; she heard him shout, &quot;You were a foul bet. I tested your loyalty to me against your passion for that wicked race.&quot; Marr held up a hand to silence her as she opened her mouth to intterupt him once again. &quot;You have shown that your loyalty lies in who and what will aid you most at the time. So driven by your passion, you lost sight and entered into the service of that vile god to learn and see more of his children. In doing so you have betrayed us. Now, come to me child.&quot; Sria felt the presence of another and scaned the room with her eyes. She saw the image of love herself step beside Mithaniel. Sria felt her anger subside some and began to approach the twins. She looked up to Mithaniel, anger still showing in her eyes as he placed a hand on her temple and began to speak. &quot;Sria, place your faith in the right one and harm shall not touch you. For losing sight of the true ways, let this new sight serve as a reminder. No longer will you see as you wish, only what a god allows and wishes you to see.&quot; Before she even had the chance to speak, her mind went black and they were gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am 'not' a pawn to be played with by you gods Mithanial Marr. This vow I shall make each day that he who give me sight today, I shall serve&quot; She knew that by her words she had made herself subject to serving any god. She heard footsteps approaching behind and grabbed a dagger from her sleave and plunged it into the body sneaking up. She turned and glared at a figure she knew lied beside her on the verge of death. She listened for others and knew by the voice of the dieing man that he was a young Tier`dal child. <br>
&quot;A message from my father for you, Lady Sria. 'I will give you sight beyond your dreams, my child.'&quot;<br>
*                *                *                *                                <br>
<br>
Sria yawned softly and kissed her husband on the cheek before rising to head to bed.<br>
