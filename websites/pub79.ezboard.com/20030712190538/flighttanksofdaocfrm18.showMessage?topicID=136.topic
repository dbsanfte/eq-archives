People complain about getting hit for 600 - 1000 damage. Thats not LA, thats LA + 100% crits. <br>
<br>
Simply leave LA the crap alone! Change berserker frenzy to give a 50% crit 100% of the time, and take away all defensive penalties. Wham bam thank you man, finished, no more 1000+ damage shots and zerkers and SB aren't broken in half. <br>
<br>
<br>
Blademasters: <br>
1) Double-parry check. They should be deadly and defensive. This would make them way more defensive than berserkers. <br>
2) Remove Celtic Duel from them. <br>
3) Make their offhand weapon ALWAYS HIT. Not always swing, ALWAYS CONNECT. Always. <br>
4) Give their mainhand weapon 50% chance to critical hit at all times. <br>
5) Leave Triple-Weild alone.(as in, no frenzy immunity, mmmkay) <br>
6) Remove flurry. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mercenarys: <br>
1) Evade 3. Part of their &quot;unfair play&quot; would be to wear chain armor and still evade like monkeys. <br>
2) Remove Duel Wield from them. <br>
3) Make their offhand weapon ALWAYS HIT. Always. <br>
4) Change Dirty Tricks to a 39% attack speed debuff + 70 point dex/qui debuff in one. Dirty Tricks would no longer be a proc, but a shout on a 20 second recast timer. <br>
5) Give their mainhand weapon a 50% chance to proc an oldschool-dirty-tricks.(35% chance to fumble on target) <br>
6) Remove flurry. <br>
<br>
<br>
This, in my mind, would fix the three light tanks. <br>
Zerkers would still be the monstrous heavy-hitters of the game, but not to the point where they would 1-shot or 2-shot people. <br>
<br>
BMs would be mini-zerkers with higher defense. A great mixture to make the perfect &quot;Blade-MASTER&quot;. No need to spec in CDW allows double-spec or higher defense. <br>
<br>
Mercs would be unfair fighters. Doing everything they can to put the odds in their favor with powerful defensive and offensive debuffs as well as having higher evade with chain armor. No need to spec in DW allows double-spec or higher defense. <br>
<br>
Whats better, is this would officially make all three light tanks the most offensive fighters in their realms.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siryakk>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#000000>(5/8/03 1:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=136.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My idea How to fix all three Light Tanks</span><hr size=1> Your suggestion is slightly overpowering.<br>
<br>
The goal is to make the heavy tanks, the light tanks and the hybrids all viable characters.<br>
<br>
I guess you could do the above, then buff heavy tanks massively (heavy tanks get an intrinsic LEVEL/3% resist), the buff hybrid massively (remove all &quot;hybrid penalties&quot;, give then an extra 0.5 skill points / level), then give casters/archers a bunch of upgrades (double range on all spells/bows), then assasins, then. . .<br>
<br>
That path doesn't involve &quot;nerf&quot;ing anything, so I guess it is better.  I guess.<br>

<br>
What they've done is tone zerker style damage down to only slightly better than the other style lines (instead of double!) and boost a couple of positional chains on the light tanks to do a bit more damage whilst not being directly engaged by someone. We already do more damage than the heavy tanks over time so there wasn't a lot needed really <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Still need a few more tweaks here and there (for mercs: giving flank a to-hit bonus, improving the damge on the rear positionals - better off with the baselines at the moment)<br>

<br>
For one, if 1000dmg is a 100% crit that means the zerker is hitting for a styled base of 500 already. Every 3 seconds, this iis monstrous. This is damage NOBODY should do. And it still means that while frenzied a zerker could hit for 750 damage, this againn is damage nobody should POSSIBLY be able to deal every 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
It means if you couldn't kill a zerker in 8 seconds from the word go, you'd be dead. It may be better than waht we've got at the moment, but zerker damage is seriously overpowered right now. Removing the penalties from frenzy just make this worse, and attempting to balance it by giving the merc/BM a 100% offhand hit at all times with 50% crit would overpower them a lot.<br>
<br>
Evade3 for a mercenary sounds like fun, but we'll never get that because of our chain. It'll just never happen. The TW crit immunity would make the BM the FOTM class designed for killing other light tanks.<br>
<br>
Doubling our parry? You'd have to nerf our spec points. With a 100% DW rate (like zerker has now) plus double parry (and what else are we gonna spec in except slash/thrust/crush) we'll never be killed except by magic.<br>
<br>
Oh, and BTW, zerkers and SBs need to be broken in half. That's the point of this patch, its correcting the 2x styled damage that was stupidly and mistakenly given to the berzerker over a year ago. And, I might add, not even doing a full job of halving it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's my solution.<br>
<br>
Nerf LA by a full 50% styled damage. (dont shout yet, hear me out)<br>
to put it at the point Mythic INTENDED it to be at when they first made the class- a styled/unstyled class (practically) EQUAL to the merc/BM.<br>
<br>
Leave frenzy as it is with the 100% crits from time to time<br>
Uncap crits in RvR so that anybody can hit for 100% crit- this means people with mastery of Pain aren't nerfed- they actually have the advantage they PAID for. If a zerker gets MOpain2000, then he may chose not to use frenzy at all.<br>
<br>
If you like, nerf magic crits down to a possibility of 50%- it's already proven casters rule RvR and if anybody whines and says their caster RELIES on crits then they are already nerfed.<br>
<br>
Fix TW like is being done, but without the crit immunity. Give the BM a 1.5x bonus to parry when TW-ing due to a 3rd blade.<br>
<br>
Change Dt to something better (i havent seen the new one yet), make it affect casters and archers as well.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> DONT MAKE DT A SPEED/QUICKNESS DEBUFF </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Because DESPITE THE PENALTY OF FUMBLING it wil overpowere any zerker it's used on even more. Zerkers WANT slow attack speeds because they like to hit really slow (the slower you hit the harder you hit- its so things balance out)<br>
<br>
Speaking of which this is a serious design fault to an otherwise quite good game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> FIX the problem with quickness and attack speed </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Anyone with 30 quickness should be a GIMP!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No questions asked. They havent worked on that necessary stat and it should reflect in their fighting ability. They should hardly evade ever (see evade1's pathetic 0%-ish chance)  and they should miss, fumble and gain NO damage enhancement for having a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> CRAP </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> quickness.<br>
<br>
I feel very strongly about this. Everyone should be encouraged to max their stats, all of them. The reasoning behind picking a saracen before a highlander shoudlbe that they will hit MORE but because of lacking STR, they should do the same DoT. Not hit for less because they have more quickness.<br>
<br>
OK, now al the light tanks have been nerfed down to the level that Mythic originally intended they should fight at- <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> LET MYTHIC PLAY THEM </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And hopefully they will see what needs to be done to ensure these classes do commeasurable damage as other tanks, in relation to their defensive capabilities.<br>
<br>
It's (the problem) somewhere in the workings of LACDW, and they should look at their own product.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which, remove CDW's base 25% to DW and let infiltrators spec in DW if they want to hit with 2 weapons. Otherwise let them  use a speccable small shield if they so choose.<br>

<br>
The light tank does 25% more DPS, while the heavy tank takes 20% less melee damage as a fraction of his hitpoints.<br>
<br>
If you work it out, 1.25 * .8 = 1.0, so a light/heavy tank duel would tie.<br>
<br>
Now, take 5 light tanks and 5 heavy tanks (from Albion) and put them up against 10 light tanks (from Hibernia).  Who wins?<br>
<br>
The Hibbies win.  They attack the Albion light tanks first, and drop one before the first Hibernian tank drops.<br>
<br>
By the time all 5 Albion light tanks are dead, there are 6 or 7 Hibernian light tanks standing.  Basically because the Heavy tanks can't tank for their Light tank allies.<br>
<br>
Then, take 10 light tanks vs 5 heavy tanks.  The 10 light lose 1 or 2 tanks.  Same thing happens with 10 heavy vs 5 heavy, except the light tanks win the battle in less time.<br>
<br>
If you want to make light tanks viable, do the following:<br>
<br>
1&gt; Reduce light tank defence, and up their offence a tad.<br>
2&gt; Reduce heavy tank offence, and up their defence a tad.<br>
3&gt; Allow heavy tanks to practially shield and defend light tanks.  Heck, allow light tanks to do the same, to a lesser extent.<br>
<br>
The key part is #3.  Until tanks can actually TANK for another player in RvR all that synergy crap means nothing.  While protect, guard and intercept are cute in PvE, using them in RvR is about as practical as flank styles used to be.  <br>
<br>
Make guard an AoE ability.  Make Intercept an AoE ability.<br>
<br>
Code Protect so that it affects player targetting (if you target a player who is currently being protected by another, and you have LoS to the protector, you will target the protector instead).<br>

<br>
If a fight between a light tank and a heavy tank comes down to the wire, then the heavy tank is inherently inferior, die to the fact that in RvR the tanks aren't going to be &quot;tanking&quot; so much as &quot;offensing&quot; the enemy casters, healers, bards etc. And if the light tank is able to carry out their duty more efficiently than a heavy tank, then why should anyone play a heavy tank?<br>
<br>
It's a good question and not one that I could answer without being torn to shreds by the wolves.<br>
<br>
But the fact remains that CDW is itself inherently inferior, partly due to our reliance on offense rather than defense to win a fight which, even in PvE is a tough thing to do.<br>
<br>
Check out those Paladins with 42 Shield and no MOB soloing Cthonian Crawlers in Darkness Falls , you'll get what I mean.<br>
<br>
Paladins are built to never die. Mercenaries are supposed to be the true amsters of DoT. It's an idea i totally hate. We're suposed to be shock troops, like less stealthy infils who can cahrge and chop damn fast. <br>
<br>
If I want to deal damage over a long period of time, I'll be a Paladin who can style forever and block forever, and who's HP regenrates as he fights, can stun enemies at will and etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
I won't wait for my End to run out and then cheer, saying&quot; Yee Har! Imagine if I was a polearmsman right now doing only 140% base damage! Well mine is 165%!&quot;<br>
<br>
Because when we run out of endurance that means our enemy is going to shred our lightly armoured bodies. This is DUE to our lack of defense.<br>
<br>
An example I hate to use is the zerker, who charges, takes HELLUVA daamage from everyone hitting him, but deals some HEFTY damage while he can before his end runs out VERY fast . Sort of a crazy fighter, a master of sudden movement, a chaotician or whatever.<br>
<br>
But I don't like that example because I think melee combat (and endurance) should last longer than 20 seconds, even for a light tank, and berzerkers deal mroe damage than anyone should.<br>
<br>
Mythic themself suggested that a mercenary spec 50DW, 44Wep and 39Parry (approximately). But not a lot of mercs I knwo specced that way because they wanted the best offense they could get for the short period they were being torn to shreds.<br>
<br>
And remember that if the only thing we've got over a plate-wearing polearmsman is 22.5% BASE damage (and our styles are only giving us mainhand bonuses for 1H weaponry unlike all other styles which amplify the total damage done *  even the old overpowered Left Axe which was double waht it should be, but in a crappy way, sort of &quot;right&quot;) then we're underpowered when it comes to survival.<br>
<br>
Remembering that a 2H person gets a 40% increase in base damage (making it well worth his while to use a 2H weapon when he doesn't need the defense) just because they DONT HAVE A SHIELD EQUIPPED.<br>
<br>
We can spec less in DW if we like higher parry, because the styles are awful, but we might need a RA to get that dw% aback up, and unless we have maxed DW%, our base damage, the ONLY gap between us and a heavier, more life-prone fighter, is being reduced.<br>
<br>
We're the only class that has to spec heavily in TWO lines in order to keep our base damage over that of a Pally.<br>
<br>
Our offhand is so weak and insignificant (considering its the only thing seperating us from the  other fighters) nobody cares about it any more.<br>
