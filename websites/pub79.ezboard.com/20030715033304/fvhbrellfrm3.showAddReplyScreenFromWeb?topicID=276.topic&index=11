Part 9.</span><hr size=1> The little house in Shadow Haven was a flurry of activity.  A handful of servants from House S`Therik were there cleaning and packing and moving bundles of Tzanntiel's belongings to a new apartment in a nicer quarter of town.  Tzanntiel sat on the empty bed, watching them hurry in and out the door.  Three large trunks sat beside her, already packed and strapped and well locked.<br>
<br>
About midway through the work Tzanntiel felt a weight settle onto the bed beside her.  She turned and smiled as a rough voice said, &quot;I am here, Mistress.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded to one of the servants who was passing by the bedroom door.  With a quick bow they closed the door then hurried off to continue their work.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good, you may reveal yourself,&quot; she said.  Immediately a human in heavy black armour appeared, sitting on the bed next to her, his head lowered slightly though he stared into her eyes, his black eyes full of unveiled hunger and danger.  A claymore was sheathed across his back, the hilt angled over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel purred as she climbed into the large man's lap, straddling his hips as she leaned into him.  His arms wrapped around her possessively.  Tzanntiel smiled as she said, &quot;I'm so glad you are here.  You and your brother are the only ones I can trust with this.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man hardly seemed to be listening as he pressed his lips to her neck, crushing her against his chest with a deep growl.  He nipped and kissed along her throat to her lips, and Tzanntiel wound her fingers into his wild hair, scratching at the back of his neck teasingly as she kissed him.  &quot;Are you hungry, my pet?&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
With another rough growl, the Shadow Knight nodded, squeezing his eyes closed as he held her.  Tzanntiel leaned back her head and drew one of her nails across her own neck, thick blood welling up in the path of the talon-like nail.  The Knight immediately pressed his lips to the cut, holding Tzanntiel tightly as he drank her blood.  Tzanntiel's eyes drifted closed as she purred deeply.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes, Tzanntiel pushed the big man's head away from her throat.  He looked up at Tzann, his eyes glazed with the sensations her blood gave him.  Tzann traced a fingertip along his stubbly jaw, smiling at him.  &quot;Such a good pet,&quot; she purred, half-teasing, half-fondly, &quot;I need you to take these three trunks for me.  Don't let anyone touch them, and never let them be opened.  I know you and your brother can keep them safe, you are the toughest Knights in the caverns, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
He chuckled deeply as he gave Tzann another fierce bear-hug, nodding.  &quot;Of course, Mistress.  No one will touch your things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann leaned closer, her lips brushing against his.  Her tongue flicked out, tracing the edge of his lower lip.  &quot;Good,&quot; she whispered to him.  &quot;I would be so disappointed if you failed me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The fierce man's hands trembled against Tzann's back as he shook his head hard.  &quot;No, no, no!  I would never fail you.  Never!  Your things will be left alone or my brother and I will die to defend them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking up into his dark eyes, Tzanntiel gave him an impish grin.  &quot;I don't want you two dead.  Live, so that you might enjoy your rewards when I come to recover those boxes.&quot;  She kissed him again deeply, basking in the demanding roughness of his mouth.  Her hands caressed his stubbled cheeks, and slid over the hard metal of his breastplate as his own hands explored her back and legs with bruising strength.<br>
<br>
She teased him a few minutes more, then sat back again. &quot;You should hurry now.  It'll be best to take them one at a time, so you can fight if need be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Though he clearly did not want to leave, the Knight nodded his head, rubbing her shoulder with all the gentleness he could muster as she stood up.  &quot;Of course, Mistress Bloodthorne.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took the first of the trunks, and whispered a few eldrich words. The shadows of the room rushed to him, binding to his form like a second skin before he vanished completely from sight, trunk and all.  Tzanntiel smiled with delight, staring at the place he had been standing. &quot;Fantastic,&quot; she whispered as she crossed the room and opened the bedroom door.  She felt the slightest of drafts as the magic-shrouded Knight walked past her.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel walked through the house, watching the servants do their work.  She smiled as she thought about the Knight and his brother.  They were two of the Lieutenants of the Shadow Knight Guildmaster in the hidden city within Echo Caverns.  An outpost populated by criminals and madmen.  How she loved it!  The Knight brothers had been an exceptional find, and she truly believed her things would be safe with them.  If not, the Rogue's Guildmaster would be watching their back.  He had been harder to win over, a cold and calculating man of incredible skill.  But Tzanntiel was never one to accept no when there was something she wanted.<br>
<br>
The first trunk the Knight had taken contained some of Tzanntiel's spare gear, extra things she liked to keep caches of for emergencies.  The third held all of Khasirath's gear and armour.  It was the second trunk that was most important.  Within it her brother was wrapped in blankets and furs, curled up like a babe in its mother's womb.  The trunk was well designed, with concealed gnomeish valved air holes that would keep water out of the trunk yet allow fresh air in.  It was further enchanted by one of Tzanntiel's talented friends to be surprisingly durable, practically armoured, while it actually reduced the weight of what was contained within.  The locks on each trunk Tzanntiel had tested and trapped herself.  Anyone trying to open those boxes would have quite a challenge.<br>
<br>
Within an hour, all three trunks had disappeared under the cover of the house being emptied.  Tzanntiel went to her new apartment for the evening, and spent the time making fresh copies of her sketches of the collar's designs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A> at: 2/19/03 8:23:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/24/03 10:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> OOC Note:</span><hr size=1> ooc for this one:<br>

It may continue a little more slowly from here, but I do hope you are all enjoying it.<br>

Although the Grange was almost empty now, only the former Thresher and 4 of his 10 disciples now lived in the once grand building, he still felt as if it was his only home.  He had hoped many of the former inhabitants would return to the building once he had paid the unpaid taxes to the city, and reopened its doors, but that had not been the case.  All he had knocking on his doors were fools, sellswords and children, none of which he wanted to grace the halls of Innoruuk's chosen.<br>
He stood, overlooking the city, remembering days of past glory, and of the commanders of the Harvest, his beloved Reaper, the man he came to betray as the days ended within the Harvest.  This man was Khasirath, a great leader, but who had lost his lust for the Culling, and after months of watching his best friend and liege waste away, decided to take action, and try to save Innoruuk's might.  It had failed, the Harvest stopped, and the Grange emptied.  He regretted what had been done, what he had to do in those days, but now, he had heard some disturbing news.  For he had not killed the Reaper, he had arranged, with the help of Shaede, a mage of the Harvest, to have the Reaper incapacitated and &quot;stored&quot; in the bowels of Castle Mistmoore.<br>
Now the Reaper was missing, his contacts within the mighty citadel had told him.  He remembered the recesses of the Castle where he had arranged Khasirath to be held, a place he believed no harm would come of the Reaper, and he could figure out how to return the fire to his friend's sword.  Now, it had come undone, he did not know if he was known to be involved in this horrible act, but if it was, his life was forfeit.  He could not help but smile, his fate was sealed, but more importantly, Khasirath was back, and if anything would refuel his liege's fire, it would be knowledge of the treason committed.  The Thresher returned inside the Grange, looking to one of his disciples who he had found within Neriak, &quot; Open the doors Espion, we will have visitors soon.&quot;  He smiled again, knowing in a strange way, he had done the will of Innoruuk, to return the god's chosen commander to the cause.<br>

FractalCodec is my AIM handle if you'd like to discuss it, or my email is fractalcodec@aol.com. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=greystormironhart>GreyStorm Ironhart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/27/03 11:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OOC Note, part 2:</span><hr size=1> Tzan.. shadeweaver2002@yahoo.com send me an email there or contact me at xstormweaverx on aim <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:helvetica;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Greystorm Ironhart</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Watchers</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">64 Sorcerer of Karana</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125080" target="top">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125080</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
