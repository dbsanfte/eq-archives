So post more little fly =)<br>

&lt;Edit&gt;   The reason I'm here telling you this crap is because these are the only things you ever listen to.  You don't see Facts when IV is involved.  Even when we show you over and over the facts.  So why bother trying to prove things to you hell your not even worth it all your looking to do is flame people because it makes you happy.<br>

Well here is some news for you it makes ME happy watching you look like a FOOL.<br>

And for some of those MBers sorry you got a warning but having maddie here posting over and over and continue to say that all of IV are liars and some of the other members of FA posting the same.  I start thinking I'm not really sorry that it happened.  You guys wont admit that you were in the wrong and it doesn't really matter since this wont ever be resolved because no one is going to say that we or you were wrong and admit it so good luck and have fun with the contiuous posts.<br>

We all know what happened a few months ago and at that time IV's stance was that VP was FCFS, the Prexus community disagreed. I can remember reading posts on Prexus saying that if IV was in VP, its FCFS but other guilds would respect the &quot;first guild in&quot; rule.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> IMO VP is a non reservable zone, therefore its a FCFS zone, irreguardless of whatever antiquated &quot;forms of thought&quot; are out there.

Sorry but some traditions gotta change with the times. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This was a quote from BA I took from the FC?FU! thread on P.com<br>

Has IV's stance changed? If it has maybe the community should know, to avoid occurences like the most recent?<br>

<br>
Sapiens, Ianthia, Taxi, I'm begining to see what the &quot;new&quot; IV is all about.  These three representing your greater population, how can you not be embarassed?   While I only know of Taxi from what I've read here, the other two are well known serverwide idiots.  I don't say this as a personal jab because I can't counter what they have said.  I say this because they continue to repeat the same crap over, and over, and over again.  They reply with half statements, twisting words that are not even close to the point of a message.  Prefering to pick apart posts for the smallest inconsitency.<br>
<br>
I can play the quote game too Sapiens.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Not up to you to decide what we can or cannto kill.. and if you don;t believe me that we wcould have... just read Abery's post. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taken out of context.  I said in a previous post that you should be grateful that they killed Hoshkar for you, because 20 IV were not going to Kill him.  I wasn't deciding what you can and can't kill, I was arguing a point about mob capability.  I stand by those words.  While in the future perhaps you will kill him with 20, as of that day you do not have the capability.  Part of my job as a raid leader is to assess the other capabilitys of other guilds.  This is a complicated matter surrounding FCFS and the such, that I won't go into further.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Well he was told we were there first and that we didn't want to random.. and he said they were going to manaburn a dragon no matter what... When we said ok.. take pahra dar.. thent hey said no... How diplomatic was he with the &quot;we are MB something no matter what&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I find it really hard to believe that he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option.  I think it was a remark made because he very well knew, that you had to kill Hoshkar and Silverwing before you could move on to Phara-Dar.  He knwe that would be a long wait for them, as you guys were obviously waiting on more people so you could kill Hoshkar.  If he was offering Phara-Dar as a sincere option, I think you guys should lynch him.  Most likely though, he was offering this as an undoable option.  That's not diplomacy, that's impossible negotiation.  Diplomacy is compromise somewhere in the middle.  This was not offering something in the middle.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And the logs show they lied... Lets give them benefit of the doubt that they didn;t know before they zoned in...

2 Clerics + 2 Necros = Summon Team.  A good point though about the lack of communciation, but that door swings both ways.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Yup... they pull because they can according to the EULA... funny how this wasn't good enough when IV wa sin VP in june... </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Nope it wasn't.  Every guild considers VP a one raid zone.  IV violated that agreement, through the use of a bugged Hoshkar.  Your leader <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  continues to declare </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that VP is a multi-raid zone.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  No one from IV </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> leadership or otherwise, not even yourself, has posted that you are now on board with the rest of the server.  So until you can learn to play like everyone else, a different set of rules will be there for you.  Why is this so hard to comprehend? You want it to be different? Fine! Then simply state that you (collectivly) now feel that VP is a one raid zone, and we can be done with all this.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Not a grudge? You tell me if this doesn;t sound liek a grudge... </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's not a grudge.   It was a reaction.<br>
<br>
The difference between you and I Sapiens is so simple.  I'm willing to concede to people, when they are right.  You, Ianthia, perhaps even this Taxi person; are not willing to concede.  You will repeat yourselves over and over again, making silly points that no one else even comes close to agreeing with.  When people tell you politely that you are wrong, and should just give it up, you don't.  That's when you just keep pushing, and pushing.  <br>
<br>
Do you realise that you are now looked upon in the same eyes as people see Ianthia and Warador?  I'm not talking about the general population, I'm talking about the intelligent debators that can identify the difference between someone arguing a point, and someone just posting nonsense over and over and over again. <br>
<br>
Since this is your messageboard, I will allow you to have the last word.  I have no doubts it will be more unintelligent drivel that will be a further waste of time to respond too.  It's sad that this could be so easily resolved, yet your weak leadership is unable to do any sort of damage control.  <br>
<br>
If you want to have me respond to something, you know where to look.  Otherwise I leave you now, with the last word of undoubted flames and attacks, taking my words out of context; and tossing in a &quot;Tool&quot; or &quot;You're a little fly who no one listens to&quot;,<br>

Yet people call him a &quot;tool&quot; and &quot;dumb bastard&quot; thats bull shit. He may not see your points and what not but saying he is stupid for posting information about a problem just because your on the different side is wrong.<br>
<br>
There's always 2 sides to every story hence 2 arguments and 2 different ways to see it.<br>
<br>
and once again: when the hell was this one of those FA vs IV things?<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought Hawx's post was trying to get his warning off his accounts <br>

<br>
Build a bridge and get over what happened.  One thing that separates a man from a boy is being able to be held accountable for ones actions.  Be a man and stop making lame excuses.  This is not a flame.  This is being real with you.  Be a man bro.  Stop the spinning and excuses.  Step up to the plate and be a man...  Otherwise just pipe down and go away.  Because we really do not want to hear your whinning and nonsense.<br>
<br>
On another note and this is my own opinion.  You don't like Backalley and that is fine.  Do not come here in our house to smear him or IV.  It is childish.  And yes I did call you a tool.  Because look at your actions here and in game.  Maybe you need to take a hard look in the mirror and reality check yourself into why people have the opinions of you that they do.  Hell just look at this thread and use it as a example.  As I said.  Be a man!! <p><P ALIGN=Center>

The bottom line is this Ajahn.  People in your guild chose to do something against the rules and got caught.  Nothing IV did or said put those warnings on those accounts.  As I said be and adult and be held accountable for your actions.  I know it is a hard concept to grasp.  But that is also along the same lines as having integrity and honesty.  Being able to say we made a mistake and got caught.  It is about accountability.  You guys got caught doing something wrong.  Take your punishment and live with it.<br>
<br>
And along the lines with Maddie.  He came here ranting about our leadership with more of his nonsense.  He should really learn when to pick his battles.  This was a one sided fight.  As I said in the prior post.  He needs to be a man.  I have yet to see that in the guy.  I suggest you walk away and do some self analysis on what happened.   <p><P ALIGN=Center>

You could have pictures and tells of the people and everything but it will still not be good enough.  <br>

O and I guess I'm just an idiot for posting because some person wants to come to our page and say that we are Liars and attack our leadership.<br>
