All better, she thought...<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Qeynos, the &quot;enlightened city&quot;. Paladins, monks, clerics chanting of the goods of their gods and how to serve. Heralds shouting news in the streets. <br>
<br>
Vendors sold wares of varying quality, from the barely adequate to the immensely valuable. Kings and Queens carry sway here and with monarchy came court and politics. <br>
<br>
And with court and politics invariably came corruption. The Unseen Hands, the well known Corrupt guards. The beauty and lawful splendor of the city lended itself well to the polarity of hate and greed. <br>
<br>
A confusing town, thought Xosha, but one that is ideal for work. Xosha sat in a room in an inn alone. She looked at the palms of her hands and rubbed them thoughtfully. Work, meaning killing for contract, HER work. She turned the words and with them the deeds over and over in her mind. She could recall thier deaths, everyone one of the victims she had taken for money. That hot blood running down her hands, redness all places. She recalled the color and sent of it. More than once she had lowered her mouth to drink in it, the dying one looking at her in horror but too weak to act against her. <br>
<br>
Xosha put her hands over her face. This face that had loved. This unholy body that had cared for humans. It was no salvation that there was only one or that the one was a woman and only a friend. Was there a difference between that love of a man and a woman, and the love of two friends? She felt that pang in her chest. Try as she might to confuse her emotions, to blanket them with death, with payed murder, there seemed always that painful white ball in her chest. She knew the word for it, though the act of saying it was out of the question Xosha moved her mouth slowly, pronouncing the letters and syllables. <br>
<br>
She put her fingers to her mouth, felt how they curved and pursed, and then clenched and released. Love.. her fingers felt the sensation from her face. It didn't hurt to think about it. She tried again, moving her lips silently. the same dull ache throbbed in her chest, but didn't get larger or hurt her more as she had feared it might. <br>
<br>
Xosha's lips moved again, this time the tiniest rasp of a whisper in the back of her throat emerged. She held her fingers to her mouth still. &quot;....lu...vuh....&quot; <br>
<br>
At that moment a knock on the door across for hers in this poor Inn within Qeynos shocked Xosha into standing. Her heart beat and guilt washed over her. She panted and looked at the door, as if she could pierce through it. Irrationally she thought to herself, had they heard her? <br>
<br>
There was a reply and the knock was greated with a door opening and a friendly greeting, then the door closing, and silence again. Ashamed of herself Xosha sat back down. Her eyes distant, she began to gear up. As she stared, she dressed herself, her face like a worn sheet. <br>
<br>
After she was dressed, Xosha opened her door and walked out, with a second thought she softly brushed her lips with her gloved fingers. For a momemt she had feared they might have changed, or been injured. Love in a Tier'Dal, it was more than forbidden, it was death for sure. <br>
<br>
And that is why Xosha promptly walked to the sewers, found a human beggar there, disembowled the man, bathed in his inards, methotically ate his heart, painted herself in his blood, and began to dedicate this death to Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
All better, she thought... <br>
<br>
She proceeded to meet Jracol outside the town. The dark elf had information she wanted... <br>

<br>
/ooc the reply, I'm cooking something up here.<br>
<br>
So. Plans were set; the wheels were greased, all that was now required was the push, the impetus that would provoke the entire machinery to shudder, to move, the behemoth to roll, crushing those that were in its path... <br>
<br>
Siaorah took another drink. This was how he WOULD have thought, before. It was this that led to his ignominious downfall, and glorious resurrection to the truth. He had held remnants of hatred for the bard, blaming him for what were truly his own errors, sins of pride and ambition and selfishness. *That* was what led to his mistakes, his loss of prestige within the Bloodsabers... his insanity. <br>
<br>
Not that he was probably all that sane now, as some would have it. Was it truly madness if you knew you were insane? A conundrum that went nowhere... much like the cycles his Master spoke of, the returning, and returning, and returning... locked in an endless circle, never changing, never evolving, the energy, the FORCE of each souls natural state being lost and walled away from the Void, where it belonged. There was more, he was sure, much more that he didn't comprehend, that he *couldn't* comprehend yet. It didn't worry him. He would serve, as served falseness before, he would serve the truth now... with, he hoped, better results. <br>
<br>
Finishing the mug, he laid it and a coin down for Sabnie. He'd already paid; she looked at him with gratitude, amusing, since she knew what he had been, if not what he'd become. He wondered idly if she saved the coins, to support the escape she secretly longed for, or if she spent it as quickly as she got it, furthering her self-destruction. He would observe adn see. It was interesting, this outward pleasantness to others, how well it worked to gain their favor, their trust. Not that he needed such; his desires for anything but service to his Master seemed to have dried up like a dessicated corpse, replaced not by the old fanaticism, but with a cool clarity... a void. <br>
<br>
The false wall in the back moved easily under his touch. He'd been given the secret after returning to the city, after... the memories of his rebirth were still too powerful to be approached idly. He'd found refuge in the sewers, but suprisingly, among the thieves and assassins, those calling themselves the Circle of Unseen Hands. A pretentious name... but no worse than &quot;Bloodsabers&quot;, he supposed. These rogues took no part in politics other than their own, and had no interest in whether he was in or out of favor with whomever. It was enough that he was known to them, however periphereally; that he was known to able to keep silent; and that he was willing to assist with small services while he regained his strength, and learned more about his new... state... <br>
<br>
He was no theif, no assassin. OF that he had no illusions. They taught him what they knew of swordplay, and the physical efforts that were so foreign to his previous life. With enough time, and enough strengthening of body (and, supposed, spirit, assuming that he even had one, still), he returned to the Shrine, allowing them to continue his education in the more martial arts. Blades, clubs, shields and armor... his service, and humility, were enough to maintain his good standing there... more fool they. Inwardly, he smirked at the devotion he himself used to carry. They too would come to know the Void as he was... or they would return to it. Either way would suit. <br>
<br>
Passing through the hidden halls of the thieves hideout, nodding to Hanns and receiving a warm smile in return, he delved further in the catacombs, deftly passing the various traps and deadfalls with both his new knowledge and the strength of his new body. As much as had changed, the catacombs were as familiar to him as anything is this world, and as comfortable... which is likely why he noticed the scent of blood so quickly. <br>
<br>
A beggar, it seemed. Why so many teemed in the sewers like the rats they resembled, he had never known. Still, they did, and this one had apparently run afoul of something... or someone? <br>
<br>
Kneeling, he took it all in. The clean cuts, the chaotic mess of intestines spread about, the contradictory precision with which the heart had been removed... was still missing. The sheer number of arteries opened... the the curious relative lack of blood staining the stone. Ritual... and not of Bertoxxulous; that would have taken place in the Shrine, the celebrant most likely released with some virulent plague to cause chaos in the streets... no, this spoke of another. The fact that the sad beggar had probably lived through most of it spoke of another tradition... and one well practiced in it. He thought he knew who. <br>
<br>
The smudged, blurred, red handprint beside the cooling corpse made that certain. Inadvertant? Unconcious? Only that one knew. <br>
<br>
He pondered alerting the Shrine, just to see their reaction to an &quot;interloper&quot;... but that might interfere with his own instructions. Smiling to himself, he moved deeper into the damp tunnels.. he had a few things to retrieve from Javen before the time came.. for action. <br>
<br>
Things were so much better, now. <br>
