Nasia looking down upon her <br>
latest victim and snarled in anger. Why was she so angry? Thinking back across her lonely history, she<br>
realizes she has always been angry. Leaving her home of Halas at an early age is not that uncommon. But<br>
the others always seem to come back to see their families and friends. I have no reason for that. No <br>
family, no friends save those select few that peeked my interest in these wilds. Could that be the reason?<br>
 Nay, she thought. If I had those pathetic things, I would just have left earlier if not slayed them. <br>
Forget the past, she thought, there is glory to be had. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp **snap** <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With all her powerful might and hatred, Nasia weaved a web of poisonous gas around her, knowing full<br>
well she can withstand the toxic poison. A crumpled form fell on to the hard rocky ground. A Tier'Dal? Slowly <br>
gasping for air, he spoke. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Nasia of Halas, there is a note for you from the Grange.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Grange, Nasia thought, where has she heard that before? Ahhh, there is a tale of one from her <br>
village named Payle who left for the Grange. From the unfavorable stories told in Halas, Nasia thought she was <br>
the only one worthy of her respect.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Help me!&quot;, cried the Tier'Dal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Don't worry small one, the poison will not last long. If you are strong enough, you will sur-&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Arggg....&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grinning evilly, Nasia chuckled. &quot;Perhaps you are not strong enough tiny Tier'Dal....pity. It must <br>
be why you were given this oh so important task of ~messenger~.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reaching down to the blistered and pox marked corpse of the Tier'Dal, she grasped the crumpled <br>
rolled parchment. <br>
<br>
*** The letter sent to the former members of the Harvest***<br>
Dear Nasia of Halas,<br>
<br>
The culling has returned, Innoruuk's word has reached me. You are being summoned to our mighty service from <br>
the Father. If you remember the visit you had as a child, you will have the answers you seek. Embrace Innoruuk's<br>
might.  Return to Innoruuk at haste, I await your arrival.<br>
<br>

<br>
*** The letter ends***<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A visit? Nasia started to swoon. &quot;Nay, the poison can affect me not.&quot;, thought Nasia. But alas, she slumbered.<br>
A vision of Halas and its cool waters. When crossing on the barge as a child, looking down into the waters. Another child<br>
shoved her deep. Failing to pull herself up from the cool depths, she started to slip further down. A light...burning<br>
in the waters. A dark face of nobility. The light...the fire...it is his eyes flaming with Hatred. Feeling the strength<br>
returning to her small body, Nasia swam for the barge. She exploded from the water surface and crawled to her knees <br>
gasping for breathe. The other barbarian child spoke, &quot;Nice swim, orphan?&quot; Hate fueled her mind. All is aflame.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon waking, Nasia remembered that fateful day as a child. The mood of the village was of sorrow. It was quite <br>
unfortunate the drowning of the barbarian child. Being from noble birth, a tragic day. No one blamed her. &quot;There there child,<br>
you just simply didn't have the strength.&quot; Grinning evilly, Nasia remembered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Let us see what answers this Daiunus Darkenvalor has for me.&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

**********************************************<br>
<br>
Pravdameer walked the catacombs of the Spires - deep within the bowels of the Holy Place. Places where only Regents of the Spires dared tread. Long ago he had been granted the title through much work on his part. Yes, it was with the help of his brothers and sisters within the Harvest that he succeeded in the quest given him. <br>
<br>
The Harvest. There was something he hadn't thought of in…well, in a very long time. He stopped a moment and tried to think of just how long it had been. He remembered well the disbanding of the Harvest - it's purpose having been fulfilled after all. After, he had hunted for a time, but had a feeling of loss within that he could not explain. That was why he had come back to the Spires - to immerse himself in the words of the Father. Days had turned into weeks, weeks became months, and months became years…but how many had it been?<br>
<br>
He began walking again muttering to himself as he went, with each word the flames within seemed to grow. Those he passed could hear not much, but from time to time one or two words could be made out.<br>
<br>
&quot;…Atoxus…&quot;<br>
&quot;…Nospiratus…&quot;<br>
&quot;…Harvest…&quot;<br>
&quot;…visions…&quot;<br>
&quot;…Khasirath…&quot;<br>
&quot;…betrayal…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Talking to yourself again, Pravdameer?&quot;<br>
Now there was a voice he hadn't heard in some time. Slowly he looked about until he saw the outline of the speaker's form. &quot;You.&quot; His eyes burned with the fires of hate. &quot;You have the gall to come to me after what you've put me through?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I put you through? You did it to yourself…child.&quot; The figure smirked as he saw the cleric react to the words. &quot;I see the Father's Gift still burns within you. Good. You will need it in the days to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young priest gritted his teeth and said very softly, &quot;And why is that? Do you really think I would still jump to your beck and call like some trained pup?&quot;<br>
<br>
Atoxus laughed a deep and hearty laugh as the priest spoke. &quot;I'll tell you what I think - I think you know me for what I am, and you know who sent me, so you will do what I tell you to do when I tell you He wants it to be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cleric glared at the messenger. That was all Atoxus needed to continue. &quot;The Father has a new task for me, Pravdameer - I must tend to another soul. I will be visiting from time to time, but not as often as before. Before I leave, however, there is one last gift of the Father I have for you.&quot; With those words, he slowly reached his hand out towards the priest's head. As the hand touched Pravdameer's skin it continued moving in, and Pravdameer began to scream - a bloodcurdling scream that brought all within the spires to a halt. &quot;This is my last gift to you, Pravdameer - may the visions serve you well.&quot; That was the last thing he remembered before it all went black.<br>
<br>
A time later, he awoke. He felt hung over, as if he had been drinking for…for…for a long time. He looked about trying to focus on the things about him and realized he was no longer in the catacombs. He was in the upper levels of the Spires. Then he noticed a letter on the bedstand. He instantly recognized the seal and considered leaving it closed. He knew what was inside - he knew what it meant. He closed his eyes to consider his path, and the vision slammed into him. He fell back to the bed, his whole body twitching as the images washed over him. As the visions finally subsided, he reached over, grabbed a bottle of wine, and drank almost all of it down in one swallow. He looked back at the letter with hate in his eyes, and picked it up breaking the seal. As he read the letter, it confirmed what the visions had told him.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
Dear Pravdameer,<br>
<br>
The culling has returned, Innoruuk's word has reached me, and I am sure you know what I mean by this, for you have no doubt had something of the vision as well. The Grange has opened, and I dwell inside. Return to Innoruuk at haste, I await your arrival.<br>

Indeed, he did now know what Daiunus meant by this. He picked up what belongings he had, and left the Spires to return to his home - the Grange.<br>

Cursing the dampness in the air, she bent her limbs.  First one leg, then the other, her arms next.  Finally satisified that pain would not shoot the length of her body when she made to get up, she arose from her bed.  <br>
<br>
Kicking one of the many empty liquor bottles that were strewn about her bedchamber, she hobbled to her window.  Looking out over the commons of Neriak, she started to once again see the braziers burning in the Grange.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So it was not the liquor, that interrupted my rest.&quot; she mused to herself.  &quot;Some damnable fool has taken it upon themselves to rouse up even denser fools.&quot;<br>
<br>
A fit of laughter, degenerating into a bloody cough shook her for some time.  Finally satisfied that a tottering walk could be maintained, she headed off to the wine celler for another dose of forgetfulness.<br>

<br>
Faeolin on the other hand, is steadily growing more bitter.  Perhaps it's the frustrations of  her mounting age, or the lack of success at finding that mythical &quot;potion of youth.&quot;  Whichever it is, memories can be a painful thing.  Especially if that's all that one has to hold on to.  I think in the coming weeks though, she might not be too opposed to taking a little trip to see what has become of the Grange.  She was always to curious for her own good. <br>
