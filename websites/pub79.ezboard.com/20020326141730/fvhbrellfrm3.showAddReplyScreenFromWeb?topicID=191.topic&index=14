A decision had been made.  The small group had a unified purpose.  Vinar, former Thresher of the Violent Harvest, had taken off his luxurious robes that marked him as a Wizard, and replaced them with the black and red leathers that the group favored.  Standing together they resembled not so much a crowd, as a caterpilar with many legs.  Like a caterpilar they  moved in a single sinuous movement.<br>
<br>
Vinars arm moved above them all briefly and a red glow swaddled the group and then they disappeared leaving only a red mist swirling.<br>
<br>
Creapiing felt the rush of remembering.  Her feet instictively moved silently.  All the years of rogue training congealed in her, tempered by her time as a Shadowknight of Innoruuk.   Her time was now.  All these years she had hated.  She had hated rogues.  She had hated her parents.  She had hated herself.  Today, her hate solidified into a single mass of strength, confidence. and purpose.  Today, she was not revered leader of the Violent Harvest, but rather a single pair of legs of the centipede that would forever change the face of Norrath.<br>
<br>
The group stood there, confident that no one saw them, but each looking to see if anyone noticed them.  Stilletos and main gauches flickered in every hand.  They walked silently and swiftly toward their objective.<br>
<br>
Mistmoor was filled with undead, huge gargoyles that loomed and popped to life if anyone strayed too close, and warped shrieking creatures to horrible for description.  Apprentices and students walked through this evil place.  The group moved silently and unnoticed.  They approached the castle mistmoor from the graveyard, filtering in through the invisible walls and hidden doorways.  Past the guards, they slid undetected.<br>
<br>
The opulence of this place was truly astounding.  Plush carpets and artistry were everywhere.   Creapiing doubted anyone had ever gotten so deep within Mistmoors walls before undetected.  Mythral had done well in disarming all the sigils.  The lure of his inheritence and disdain for his family had made Mythral a willing accomplice.<br>
<br>
Mayong Mistmoor was planning his next move.  He poured over maps in the Castle Mistmoor today.  Your time has come, a voice whispered in his ear.  Then his blood splurted from eight separate wounds and soaked the carpets and parchements around him.  Creapiing reached down, unhooked the axe from mayong, and with  a chop, finished their business in the Castle Mistmoor.<br>
<br>
In a swirl of red, they disappeared.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
A bag landed with a solid thud upon the desk of Daiunus, newly appointed Thresher of the Violent Harvest.  His assistant shrugged unknowingly.  Just arrived, he said, it came with this envelope.  <br>
<br>
Daiunus reached first for the envelope.  Thresher.  The one word upon it.  Gingerly he opened the envelop and pulled out a thick parchement and began to read:<br>
<br>
<br>
    Daiunus, newly appointed Thresher for the Violent Harvest, let us introduce ourselves.  Under the leadership of the Subati Razorback, a special ministry was formed called the Breagan D'Aerthe.  The Breagan D'Aerthe is a single unit that exists for clandestine operations both on their own initiative and at the request of the Thresher of the Violent Harvest.  We report to no one else.   Though most consider our existence to be rumor or myth, we would like to assure you that we do indeed exist.<br>
<br>
  At this time we choose to remain anonymous, though some or all of us may choose to reveal ourselves to you in the future should you prove to be strong in hate and Innoruuks blessings.<br>
<br>
  As a token, we have sent you a gift that represents our latest intervention in the operations of Norrath.<br>
<br>
  Should you ever need us you may leave a message with the hafling that swims inside the glass at the blind fish.<br>
<br>

This is a bit of a rewind, about an hour or so after Creapiing first left the Grange.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Khasirath walked through the streets of Neriak with his Mace in his hand.  There was a great commotion in the streets, guards and citizens rushing about in confusion, many heading towards the lake.  He could only hear snippets of the rumors… something about a mad woman walking the streets.  The Knight frowned deeply as he turned away from the crowd towards the Grange, a foreign uneasiness tightening in his gut.<br>
<br>
Approaching the Grange he saw at once that the madness reached even here.  Twice the normal guards stood at the door.  The door!  It was closed!  Never in his time with the Harvest had he seen this before; always the Grange stood open to admit the faithful who may wish entry to speak with the Chosen.  His pace quickened as he drew closer, and one guard pulled open the heavy stone door as he was recognized.<br>
<br>
Within the Grange the faces that he saw were singularly grim and lost.  A servant of the Grange rushed to meet him as soon as his boots crossed the threshold.  The man’s face was stricken with barely controlled panic, “Dire Overlord!  You must come at once to the Reaper’s office.”<br>
<br>
“Lead on, then,” Khasirath snapped.<br>
<br>
The man all but scurried down the hall, his shoulders hunched with dread.  Khasirath followed with steady strides, rigidly controlling himself.  He knew that whatever crisis might await, his strength must be something the Harvest could depend on.<br>
<br>
Outside the Reaper’s office stood four of their senior guards, veterans all.  Each one’s face was a steely mask, but even in their eyes Khasirath saw the apprehension that had fallen like a shroud over the Grange.  The four guards saluted him and stepped aside.  Quickly and nervously the servant unlocked the office door and held it open for the Knight.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation Khasirath walked in, through the apprentice’s room to the office proper.  This door was also closed, and Khasirath pulled it open before the scuttling servant had a chance to.  In the doorway he stopped, stunned by the devastation within.<br>
<br>
The dark and finely appointed office was an abattoir.  The charnel reek of death seemed to envelop Khasirath as he struggled to take it all in.  At first he could not accept that he was seeing this here, in the heart of the Grange.  It simply could not be!<br>
<br>
Dimly he realized that the servant was prattling on, trying to explain.  But the words meant nothing.  Khasirath clenched his eyes shut, his head lowering as his entire body tensed.  A feral snarl twisted his face as he turned back to the servant, his hands curled into tight fists.<br>
<br>
“Get out,” Khasirath growled deeply, the words almost swallowed by the rage in his voice.<br>
<br>
“B...but my Lord!” the servant stammered, taking a step back.<br>
<br>
“GET OUT!  Let no one else enter!” Khasirath roared, driving the servant back and all but shoving him into the hall.  He tore the key from the man’s hand and slammed the door shut, locking it from within.<br>
<br>
He tossed the key onto the apprentice’s desk and walked slowly back into the inner office.  He could feel the tension in his entire body, almost to the point of trembling from the stress.  Leaning against the doorframe he closed his eyes once again and drew three deep breaths, forcing himself to relax.<br>
<br>
Opening his eyes again he entered the office.  The lighting was dim, as always.  Teir`Dal did not require much light to see, even underground.  Slowly he walked among the bodies, counting and identifying them.  Two guards, eighteen servants.  He recognized all of them, knew them to be Creapiing’s assistants and helpers.  They lay jumbled together right where they had fallen.<br>
<br>
The wounds, the patterns of cuts… Those he knew just as well.  He had fought beside Creapiing as often as he was able, watched her in the Arena.  He knew her skill, her style.  None other could have killed these men and women but the Reaper herself.<br>
<br>
He forced himself to observe without emotion, though the strain was telling.  The blood was everywhere and the smell permeated everything.  The bodies could not have lain here long, but still death crouched heavy and restless around him.  The Reaper’s armour, and her weapons were all thrown about carelessly.<br>
<br>
The desk was covered in papers; many had spilled to the floor.  The red of the ink and the blood co-mingled ‘til they seemed one and the same.  For a long time he stared at the desk, memories of the times he has spent in that office with Creapiing blinding him to the horrid reality around him.<br>
<br>
As he came back to himself his gaze struck on a patch of bright white on the dark and stained parchments.  Stepping over the corpses he walked closer, and realized what it was he was seeing.  Hair – The Reaper’s beautiful mane of hair stained in blood and roughly chopped off.<br>
<br>
Slowly he pulled off his gloves and tucked them under his belt.  He carefully gathered up the thick white bundle of hair.  It was so much softer than he had imagined.  His jaw clenched tightly as he lifted it to his face, feeling the softness against his cheek and lips as her scent for a moment eclipsed the smell of blood.  Almost reverently he tucked the hair away into a pouch tied on his belt.<br>
<br>
It was all too much.  Deep in his heart he knew that he would never see her again.  He walked around the desk and set heavily in her chair.  Putting his head back, silently he wept.<br>

The proof sat before him, the head of his once and former Lord, a creature as powerful as a god, and one that could only be destroyed by legendary warriors.  The Breagan D'Aerthe would be one of those legends, a childhood fantasy that was now bound in truth.  Daiunus could not stifle a laugh as he thought of the legends of Innoruuk being at his call, it was just unbelievable.  Daiunus looked back at the wardesk and the plans upon it, knowing that even the most difficult plans just became possible.<br>
<br>
The new Thresher looked at his assistant, &quot; Destroy this letter, and the envelope, I will not soon forget the words or directions written within.  The bag,&quot;  Daiunus hesitated, &quot; leave the bag, I will hide this well myself.&quot;  With that, the assistant took the letter and brought it to the heat of the torch that Daiunus had lit in order to read his letters, and warplans.  The assistant then left the room, leaving the Thresher to his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Daiunus raised the head from the bag, looking directly into the cold, lifeless eyes of Mayong Mistmoore, &quot; Aye M'lord,&quot; Daiunus said with sarcasm dripping of venom and Hate, &quot; The Breagan D'Aerthe do exist, and they are behind me and the Harvest.&quot;  Daiunus sank back into his chair, tossing the gift of the Breagan D'Aerthe unto the wardesk, for him to admire while he sat contemplating the next move that he would make.<br>

The servant and guards had heard nothing while he had been inside, and had continued to guard the door as ordered.  Khasirath walked slowly, almost stiffly.  His face was a passionless mask, and the redness of his eyes could easily be mistaken for the rage that was common to the Chosen.<br>
<br>
The servant bowed low as the Dire Overlord stepped out and handed him the keys. “Have some men take the dead out of there.  They are to be burned,” he said simply.<br>
<br>
Blinking in confusion, the servant stuttered, “But… but my Lord, the dead are always taken to the Lodge for their experiments…”<br>
<br>
Khasirath snarled as he suddenly grabbed the man by the tunic, pulling him close and almost off his feet, “I will not be questioned, fool!  I said burn them.  You will see it done yourself, or you will join the dead.”<br>
<br>
Pushing the servant back against the wall of the hallway, Khasirath turned away.  Regaining control of his anger he looked back over his shoulder at the cowering man.  “Once the bodies are removed, you will gather my personal servants to see to the cleaning.  I will give them my own instructions.”<br>
<br>
Slowly the Dire Overlord walked back through the Grange to his office.  He nodded to those he passed, but did not stop to talk.  He had no real answers for them, and had much thinking still to do.<br>
<br>
Inside his office he gave his manservant Dythos explicit directions for the ones who would be cleaning the Reaper’s office.  Once the young Rogue had hurried off to deliver the orders Khasirath sat back in his chair, sighing deeply.<br>
<br>
Burning the bodies would most likely bring a review from the Lodge.  But he could face Nezzka Tolax and his displeasure.  Whatever had come over Creapiing it seemed clear to him that she wanted those people silenced.  He knew they all served her, and as such may have known something that should not be passed on.  The Lodge of the Dead was most canny when it came to unearthing information.  Access to those bodies would be almost the same as giving them the keys to her office.<br>
<br>
Even without understanding what this all meant, and what would happen now, Khasirath knew he must do what he could to support and assist the Reaper.<br>
<br>
Khasirath walked to the side table of the office, and set a cone of incense in the small brazier he kept there.  He lit it and sat back down in his chair, trying to relax as the familiar scent filled the air.  He found his thoughts far too chaotic to properly meditate, the concerns and the loss filling his mind.<br>
<br>
He unclasped his bracers and put them on his desk, then drew a keen-edged dagger from his belt.  Slowly he drew the blade across his wrist, slim parallel lines of blood welling up.  His eyes half closed as he centered on the pain, letting it drive all thoughts from his mind until stillness reigned within.<br>
<br>
Setting the blade down he licked the blood from his wrist, a soft growling sigh leaving him as his hate finally flared to life, bringing him into harmony with his God.  Resting his head back his body grew still as he sank into communion with Innoruuk.<br>
