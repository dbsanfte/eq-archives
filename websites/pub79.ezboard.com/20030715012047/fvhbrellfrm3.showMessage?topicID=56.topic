withering vine<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Creapiing collapsed again. She lay at the feet of her enemy, incapable of defending herself. The Pale elf before her grinned down upon her and spat on her. You are worthless, there exists no place for you in the light. As she lay helpless on the ground her mind raged with anger that could find no outlet from her crumpled form. Then slowly the effect faded, and as she felt her energy return she drew from the hate that had been building to leap to her feet and impale the insipid elf before her. He died far too quickly, hardly registering his own death before it came from her sword.<br>
<br>
These spells had been coming upon her more and more often. She had destroyed all her furnishings, had her home and her office gutted, and yet she could not find the source of the poison that was slowly eating away at her. The precious books, art, and antique furniture that had adorned her office were long since burned, and yet she was slowly becoming more and more helpless. Her long years of training with the rogues allowed her to recognize all the symptoms and soon enough she would start to lose her judgement.<br>
<br>
Only a few days before, Creapiing had met with Khasirath, the Thresher of the Harvest, and begged him to slay her if she did not find the source of this poison soon. Soon I will lose all my mental abilities as well as having more and more frequent collapses. If I do not find the source of this poison I ask you to kill me. Do not give me much more time, and do not wait for me to ask again. I ask you as the Thresher to show me some mercy for my service to Innoruuk and slay me quickly and before I get any worse.<br>
<br>
Khasirath gazed deeply into the eyes of Creapiing and responded with the only answer a Teir’dal could give. Creapiing, I would gladly slay every druid in Norrath than to hurt you, but it is my duty and my honor to be the one to kill you should the day come that you can no longer benefit the Harvest. I promise to be swift and send you to the father with haste.<br>
<br>
Creapiing saw the look that briefly crossed Khasirath’s face, noted it, and nodded. He would slay her before she became a hazard to the Violent Harvest. Creapiing bowed and smiled the smile of one who is has nothing to lose. Khasirath, the father asks much of us all.<br>

Re: withering vine<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Khasirath frowned as he looked at the Reaper, not wanting to believe what she was saying. She looked so strong, so achingly beautiful. He could not accept that she, of all people, could succumb to a coward’s poison. The very thought hurt him deeply. His gaze traced her delicate features, searching the eyes as violet as his own. Inside a chilling, tearing pain eclipsed his strength.<br>
<br>
When she made her request he thought his heart would stop. But looking into her eyes he knew there was nothing he could deny her – not even this. On his blade and his House he swore he would send her to Innoruuk if the poison affected her mind. He also swore he would do anything to find the cause and the cure, even lay down his life to save her own.<br>
<br>
Though his sister Tzanntiel was in training with the Ebon Mask, Khasirath knew little of poisons. Tzann had not yet earned their respect enough to be entrusted with such secrets. Struggling to understand where the poison was coming from Khasirath questioned the Reaper, looking for revelation and salvation.<br>
<br>
Her food and drink were tested, and she’d had her office and home gutted to remove any possible contamination, so Khasirath tried to think of other possibilities. He asked if she’d traveled to any new places in the time that the weakness had started, but she had not. Then he asked if she’d bought or found any new armour or weapons. After a moment’s thought she said that she’d recovered her Darkforge Greaves shortly before the first collapse.<br>
<br>
He knew that an undead Knight at the Temple of Solusek Ro made Darkforge from the remains of armours stolen by the Lizardmen of Cazic-Thule. He did not see how it could be related, but suggested that the Reaper have all her armour and weapons tested by her poison finders.<br>
<br>
She almost resisted, explaining that her armour and weapons were always with her, so no one could have tainted them. But Khasirath pointed out that because they were always with her, the effects would be greatest if that was where the poison was applied. He also told her to have it tested by an alchemist, as he had heard of metals that could sap the strength and health of even the strongest warrior.<br>
<br>
Though she seemed skeptical, the Reaper agreed. As he turned to leave, Khasirath wished her luck and the Father’s blessing. He also offered her the protection and hospitality of House S`Therik for as long as she might desire or require.<br>
<br>
The walk back to his House’s compound seemed too long, his mind full of darkness and pain. When he arrived he went directly to the House’s altar, kneeling down in his armour to pray for the strength of one of Innoruuk’s finest Knights. He also prayed that he would be allowed to visit the Father’s vengeance upon the poisoners, whomever they may be.<br>
<br>
Khasirath drank of the pain that welled through him, letting it reach every cell, every inch of himself, until his whole being seemed to shudder under it. Then he sent his mind deeper, to the wellspring of Hate, drawing it forth to meld with the pain. He harnessed the pain and the hate together, binding them so that they might make him stronger, and more focused. He willed this lash of pain-charged hate to be ready when he found the coward who would dare try to destroy the Reaper. <br>
