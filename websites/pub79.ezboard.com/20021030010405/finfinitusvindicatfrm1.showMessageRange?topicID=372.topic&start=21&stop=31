This thing about doing chardok for clerics only just bugs me.  I myself have been waiting awhile to do chardok used to ask about doing it then stopped.  That night for Rezeri made sense we had the spot for her to do Zordak and it would have made no sense not to get her the piece to do it.  Yes I have a cleric and sure just like everyone else I would like to get my epic done but if it dosent happen right away its no big deal after all im 56 now but sure it woud be nice.  Also if anyone noticed I was there as many time as possible on my warrior to help with FGS for rez and carit.  WE are a guild we are suppose to help when we can this dosent mean we will be rewarded for it its just out of kindness to make others happy and stop worrying about being so dam selfish ourselves. <br>
<br>
I was also there that first night with bretton (HUGS) with warmheart to help in chardok.  Most of us help when we can and if you ever look at my stuff I earned most of it without being in guild. I have never been one to put loot as my main priority.   The game is suppose to be fun and when it gets to the point where its not its time to take a break and like Huri said play a twink.  We all need help sometimes but we all also know Real life interferes people work have kids families.  So sometimes the power is not there to do what we need to do. <br>
<br>
I myself have not been playing as much as I would like have had alot of RL stuff going on but that dosent mean I am just going to up and quit.  Anyway I dont normally write so much crap but dang Bretton I'm sure gonna miss ya your a great guy.  <br>

After that I kinda rambled but the point was about how many tells I get and complaints that we arent doing &quot;this&quot; part of someones epic, when we are on a raid for someone else. It happens everytime we do the hole for example and people just need to realize that we are there for a purpose and IF we can do it we will. IF not, they can schedule a specific raid for their epic piece and we will support it as best we can. <br>
<br>
We cant always do things when people want em too, I guess that was my main point. We have &quot;down&quot; times where the desire to do an epic raid might be lower in the guild than other times. But as witnessed by the really good turn out for Kilanys epic, we can also muster a good force too.<br>
<br>
People just gotta be patient. It will come.<br>

<br>
I did not mean to make it seem as though Chardok is only done for clerics.  Chardok when we first started doing it for the Queen prestige was also a zone of the added bonus of hitting  three classes epic mobs.<br>
As things have tapered off a bit we are having more fun with ToV and lets face it the rewards are greater than Chardok (overall).<br>
I suppose I mentioned the cleric connection because it makes more sense to me.  The cleric epic is the most valuable epic IMHO some may disagree and others may agree totally;  my point is that if we have a cleric ready for this point in particular its more of a motivator to go there ( that goes for me as well ).  Gennerally if we are not in some crazed rush because of the circumstances ie: that whole zordak double camp,  the guild does a full rotation  Enchanter, cleric and warrior.  Three birds with one stone in one night is pretty damn good IMO.  I know that's not a gaurontee as the queen herself does not always drop the blade but the other two are pretty much a lock.<br>
I don't wanna belittle the other classes that need chardok but that's just where I see the bigest need for the zone.<br>
<br>
I scheduled a raid on Chardok because I was:  <br>
1.  Still high after the dragon.<br>
2.  On my last piece.<br>
3.  Saw the night had a raid that goes fairly quick and thought to only ruin one exp night as opposed to many.<br>
<br>
How I felt when I canceled the raid.<br>
1.  A little down<br>
2.  Optomistic for trying later.<br>
3.  Relieved,  I was able to do all the other junk so when we did hit Chardok I could loot the blade and hit combine. Better effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Did I leave the guild because of it.<br>
1. NO  The epic will still be there tomorrow.<br>
<br>
The guild had a very productive time of it that week.  Lots of epic stuff was done, in fact that's one of the reasons I did not try to reshedule.  We had Faydedar, rogue epic saturday, Kilany did the hole etc etc.<br>
<br>
You gotta look at the epic this way... People wince when they hear that name.  Why,  well think about it this way each epic can have a number or large battles required. Cleric: zordak, chardok.  Warrior: pick a red, sev, chardok, PoA<br>
(note im not including planer raids as they seem to really be part of the raid so not an extra raid) you get the idea.   Even though we may not have done any others on one persons epic we have done pretty much every raid a number of times.  3 or 4 epic raids in a week spanse = epic burnout.  I had not planned to try chardok again as leading the raid;  I did plan however at being at the next one which I assumed would be in a couple weeks giving eveyone some much needed down time.<br>
<br>
Its exciting being part of a guild that CAN do the epic fights but doing them non stop is stressfull,  especially with other things like ToV upgrading and exping to make it stronger.<br>
<br>
BA did say it right be patient, most of us have been working on our epics for a long time and some longer than we can even imagine.  I personnaly have decided not to worry about the end of my epic now untill I am 55.  ( of course 55 is getting farther and farther away every day damn 39 rez)<br>
<br>
So what was my point ??? hmmm lost it let me scroll back and reread this garbage, gimme a sec.......     .....   ..   .<br>
<br>
Oh ya  take two weeks Don't plan ONE epic fight at all.<br>
Then post a raid on the calander preferably one of those multi epic drop zones, put it in the war room as well.<br>
<br>
If you see the above post DONT post any other epic fights that week. Wait at least one week and plan your final mob raid etc.  No burnout but still getting things done.<br>
<br>
PS.. damn I miss joo guys...<br>

For some people /guildremoving is like therapy. I dont know specifically why thats the case, I guess they feel &quot;free&quot; to not worry/think about anything for awhile and just play...to play.<br>
<br>
However that therapy hurts those who considered them their friends, some very close friends and to see them go like that makes people worried they will never return.<br>
<br>
Fact is myself and I know others have grown very close to the community we have here in this cyber world we play in. Its just hard to see people go, you wish them well, but its still hard.<br>

Hope you have a nice long break, or a short one, whatever you choose to do your friends support you. At least you wont be told &quot;BA loaded the wrong game&quot;, but Im sure they will find something...<br>

I totally agree that it is silly to have to worry about politics in a game,  although I understand how it got there, and I'm grateful that there are officers willing to deal with it.  So I changed my playing style to sort of an unbuffered burst mode - two or three nights in a row when i get a chance, then nothing for a week or two.  it leaves time for life, and usually whatever squabble is going on in my playing time is gone by the next time i log in.  so i learned - problems will go away, i still have friends online, group for exp, help on what raids i can (although it's tough for a lvl 49 to help on much) and IGNORE ALL THE OTHER BULLSHIT.  I don't even check the message boards but once every few days.  Of course I have very little merit from only raiding every couple of weeks when i can, but i don't give a sh*t.<br>
<br>
Do what you want, but I dearly hope you come back, even if you leave guildchat off most of the time and just play the damn game.  I've learned that the BS only gets to you if you let it - I think mullzy would agree with me on this point.  Oh, and be selfish a lot too - I play the game when in guild groups or raids for the good of the guild and everyone there, but at all other times i'm really only concerned about MY loot, MY exp, and MY fun.  it certainly puts things into perspective, but then again maybe rogues are allowed to be selfish...<br>
<br>
Well, since I hate reading through everyone elses annoying ramblings, I'll try and wind down mine.  Come back, don't come back, go away for awhile, keep playing and deal with it; whatever - just dont get too worked up over something you pay a monthly fee for to sit in front of a computer and acquire pretend money and items that mean absolutely nothing to the world you live, eat, defecate, work, sleep, drive, email, and kick your dog in.  I'll miss you in guild, but I'll still help you whenever I can, and i've already got it covered:  /friend Bretton.  You can only have 30 friends.  shit.  /friend morkenlar.  morkenlar is no longer your friend.  /friend bretton.  bretton is now your friend.  Ah, there we go.<br>

I might just have to try this [burst] playing style... I dont know if anyone has noticed of late, but you have, and will prolly continue to see less and less of bimbur/faeline playing.. we have actually gone to counciling over this game, and ((with the help of a professional)) learned that its just that! /em steals BA's copyright a G.A.M.E! That simple.. we all pay at least $10.00 a month to stress ourselves out! how cool is that! WOW! the boon of mankind! In really any recreational activity that I have ever done theres always been 2 ways of doing things... #1) for the hell of it ((i.e. soul surfing/skating)) and #2) the really mean and serious way((i.e. husteling be it pool, basketball ect..)) The FUN of the activity is in #1, but the PRODUCTIVITY is in #2. This may seem way off, but bear with me... To play EQ JUST to play, JUST to interact with your friends, JUST to &quot;chat&quot; or just to have FUN will inevidably not get you very &quot;00ber&quot; or very far exp or equipment wise.. BUT if path #2 is more your motto then no doubt you will be lvl 60 within months or in some cases weeks even ((my co-worker did lvls 1-60 in NINE DAYS)) but the point being is that it was stressful. He wanted into Unity SO bad that he changed Classes and lvld HIMSELF ((no PL)) in a two week vacation.. EQ 18-22 hrs a day. Within maybe 6 months he was outfitted in all ToV armor, raided 5-7 days a week and could tell me how to take down major mobs in his sleep. 3 weeks after that, he deleted his account.  I know this is long, and I know this is boring, and I am well aware that I'm rambeling... but there is a point in here, and it is this... Sometimes we play to get somewhere.. lvl 60... Epified... ToV armor.. but once we get there.. then what? This has always been a question of mine when ppl say &quot;You have to be lvl 55+&quot;.. its like im not an expierenced enuff player as is... sure i might die.. but so will you at lvl 60.. Both myself and faeline have gotten this on quite a few occasions, and personally it is disheartening to my considering I HAVE no characters 55 or above... and I honestly dont plan to any time soon either.. the majority of the time I play for #1.. I could care less about any equipment, i could care less if im lvl 15 or lvl 60... its not a big deal to me... i live, i die.. i get a click stick rez, i go with no rez at all.. who the he11 cares.. it all goes back to what baekin said.. its a game.. its not real.. like my counceler((sp)) says.. its some pixels being moved locations... its not like YOU died.. or even a PART of you.. ya pick up, ya move on.. sometimes moving on means leaving a Guild TAG behind.. but i have never known a case where it ment leaving FRIENDS behind. Many of us have been in guilds prior to IV.. Many of us still have friends from former guilds, and some even the support of former guilds who would drop anything the ENTIRE guild is doing to rush in aid. Bretton hasnt really left the ones that are near in dear to his heart.. hes just droped the tag.. hes not in green letters((or your preference there of)) be it temporary, be it permenent... thats not ours to say, or even beg or plead really.. Do what your gonna do Bretton, just have FUN doing it.. as you can see, the vast majority of us are still behind you and still call you brother.. NOW GO PLAY!<br>

People bitch and whine, but not every complaint is unfounded. I honestly think most of the bitches/whines are due to miscommunication (mostly unintentional) which is why I later deleted that post. Had I Known beforehand that loot was going to be randomed between everyone, I wouldnt have gotten so upset. As it was, with all the talk about mostly IV being there and the primary goal as the scale, I figured surely the spells would be distributed according to guild policy. So, it was unexpected to see a lvl 55 druid win a 60 spell, when there was a 60 present. /shrug Still have my own opinion on that but I look beyond it now to what the original intention was of the raid leader. Regardless of that, I still came that day simply to help you out and was happy you got your piece, with as long as I've known you. People get upset, but they get over it too. However, we shouldn't become so jaded that we think every complaint on the boards is unfounded or for immature reasons. I'm not talking about my post that day, for while it was due to a misunderstanding, I'll admit it was in the heat of the moment. I've since attempted to be more diplomatic...but that's another topic.<br>
<br>
Sorry to see you go. But before you quit for sure, consider taking some time off. I've been there many times myself, especially lately which I partly attribute to outside stress. Overall though, I think IV is a great place to be and that we can resolve our issues in time.<br>

You are one of the prexiuns I will remember most kindly.  You are a great guy.<br>
<br>
Yes this is a game.  It is a game that has stressed out all most every one that plays it more than once.  I have seen so many fights over pixels on a screen that it blows my mind.<br>
<br>
When some one tries to quit playing, others try to pressure them in to playing (I swear to god it is just like a drug).  When some one decides to switch guilds for what ever reason, half of the guild will become very upset over it.  um yah There are politics.<br>
<br>
There is a lot of burn out in eq atm.  Lot of people playing DAoC because of better graphics, no politics, no loot arguments.  When SoL comes out it will renew many peoples interest in EQ.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed leveling to 60 and getting my epic.  I enjoyed getting full ToV gear.  I enjoyed raiding just to kill things I had never killed before.  I did not how ever enjoy all the drama along the way.  I hope that Verant listens to it's audience and tries to change some negative aspects of this game.<br>
<br>
Come back when your ready Bretton.  When you do, all ways remind your self it's a game.  Try not to get stressed.  And do what is going to make YOU happy.  Have fun with all your friends.  Blow off as much BS as you can.  When you can't have a happy go lucky attitude with this game, log out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Send me tells when you log in some time.  I will probably be playing DAoC, but I have not cancelled my acct.  I shall return! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=372.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=372.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=372.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=372.topic&index=31><img src=http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/images/f_addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=372.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.threadControl?topicID=372.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=372.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=372.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="infinitusvindicatfrm1">The Commons<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm9">OT Discussions and Debates<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm5">Screenshots<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm2">The Inner Sanctum<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm17">Guild Policies<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm4">Membership Application<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm24">Membership Voting<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm12">Strategy Room<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm25">Merit Information<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm13">The Auction House<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm20">Chamber of the High Guard<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm23">Forum Access Requests<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm18">Make Suggestions<option value="infinitusvindicatfrm26">Message Archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/binfinitusvindicat>Infinite Vision</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm1>The Commons</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.infinitusvindicat.com">Infinite Vision Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <body bgcolor="#333366" text="#FFFFFF" topmargin="0" leftmargin="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
