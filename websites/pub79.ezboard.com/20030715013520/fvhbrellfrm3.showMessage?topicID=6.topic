Where The Hatred Sprung Forth<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Some may find me cold as steel, ruthless even. In battle, that is true. The rage one will see burn within me springs forth from the fountain of my youth.  Let me fill you in.<br>
<br>
My parents were a typical Teir'Dal family of the moderate means and much love. My childhood was one filled with laughter and, oh, yes, fishing....a favorite activity of mine. Our cottage in 3rd Gate was a fantasy-filled abode for this youngster.<br>
<br>
Father was a Rogue. I recall his departures vividly each time he set out on his &quot;missions&quot;. Mother was the finest crafter of silks and hides...a tailor everyone in Neriak envied.<br>
<br>
After several &quot;missions&quot;, Father's demeanor began to change. I wasn't quite sure what was going on, I only knew that our outings became fewer. The whispers of neighbors disturbed me, but I really couldn't fathom what was being said. <br>
<br>
One night, I heard mother crying and pleading with my father. &quot;No, don't do this to us,&quot; she cried. &quot;We must! So get ready,&quot; he retorted. &quot;We must leave in the morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
I recall being lifted from bed by my mother and told to hush and get dressed. My mother told me, with a weak smile on her lips, that we were going on a journey with Father. &quot;We'll have a wonderful time, you'll see,&quot; she whispered. That was<br>
all I needed to hear. I joyfully pulled together my favorite treasures.<br>
<br>
The next seven years that passed were the bleakest, most harrowing, fear-filled days I could ever imagine. It turns out my father was trying to fulfill a fantasy of obtaining riches and hiring out his services as a thief and spy. He dragged us <br>
along from town to town, travelling in shadows...in secret. Some days, we did not eat because we had to hide from the patrols of guards that would surely slay any Teir'Dal caught in the midst. How many nights, I cried....and I watched my<br>
mother cry.<br>
<br>
Oh, Father was living the good life...his life. The plat was flowing in, but it was never enough. On to the next &quot;mission&quot; he would go...dragging us along.<br>
<br>
And then one day, he'd had enough of my mother and me. We had become a burden to him...a drain on his lifestyle. We were hiding not too far from the port by Qeynos.<br>
<br>
He walked away. No farewell kiss, no smile, no hug. He had givin my mother a bag of a hundred plat and walked away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly, we must get out of here,&quot; she whispered and dragged me down to where a hole in the wall appeared. &quot;We can escape the city through here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Escape is what we did. Using some inborn skills, which I did not understand at that time, we scrambled along, avoiding the constant dangers about us. The journey to Neriak would take forever, I felt. Step by step, often sitting still hiding for hours, we made our way east towards home.<br>
<br>
I spent the whole trip terrfied of the things I saw. The monsters were formidable. I still remain thankful to the kindness of some Teir'Dal who gave us safe passage <br>
through some of the most creature-laden territories.<br>
<br>
Finally we made our way through the West Commonlands and crossed into the East Commonlands. My mother and I smiled for we could feel the end of the journey so near. We bounded up to the top of the next hill...and there they were. A pack of young kodiaks converged on us. Mother pushed me hard down the hill. &quot;Run!&quot; she cried, as she desperately fought off their onslaught.<br>
<br>
With tears in my eyes, I noticed a group of men in shiny armor. They had pale skin, but at the moment, it did not matter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please, please! Help my mother. The bears are killing her! Please..now!&quot; I cried at the men. I froze in terror as they simply began to laugh.<br>
<br>
&quot;I bet she dies in two minutes,&quot; one of the humans cackled.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no...she's tough...I bet she can last 5 minutes,&quot; retorted the dwarf.<br>
<br>
They pushed me aside so they could watch the carnage. It only took a few moments, and my mother fell. It was only then, that the light-skinned men got up and dispatched the beasts.<br>
<br>
I recall trying to cry, but the tears would not come. A hatred began to well up within me. It was at that moment, I heard Innoruuk's voice so clearly.<br>
<br>
I tasted of death that day. When I sadly returned to my empty cottage in 3rd gate, I headed to the guild of the undead, and at that moment, became Selilya the Necromancer. I poured all my energy into learning the craft. I headed into the forest to hunt down the creatures there. The creatures had no chance against my hatred. <br>
<br>
One evening as I was out &quot;training&quot;, I ran into one Nospiratus, who noticed the furyI unleashed against the forest vermin. He told me of the Harvest. A peace fell over <br>
me that day, for I found my home.<br>
<br>
Yea, I miss Mother. I follow in her steps to be a master tailor. I will always honor her memory, and yet.....one day I must face my father........<br>

Creapiing reads the writ in Selilyas hand and feels outrage. Some day she will tell of her of childhood, but for now....She bites back tears.<br>
<br>
Surely this is why Selilya has risen so fast, for from our hatred comes power, and one such as this must be filled to bursting with hatred and the blessing of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
She pulls forth a sheet of paper and ink, dark as night, and pens, <br>

Subati stares at the parchment before, his demeanor unreadable, his eyes unblinking.<br>
<br>
Two phrases over and over again, mumble from his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;I bet she dies in two minutes,&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, no...she's tough...I bet she can last 5 minutes,&quot; <br>
<br>
The rage overcomes, the Fathers Hatred courses, ney tears through, bringing the berserker upon him. For a moment, he becomes the beast that is his name sake.<br>
<br>
With one slam of mailed fist, the table beneath shatters as chrystal.<br>
<br>
Howling, burning with anger, he screams into the night &quot;I bet they both die in one minute, should I find them.&quot;<br>
<br>
The thought, somehow calms him,<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes... maybe one day, Selilya would enjoy them placed in the arena, and made to duel.&quot; Smiling at the thought, &quot;Then we could wager on how long each of them would last.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling at the thought, he places the heavy silk clothe over his mounted lightstone, and heads for bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Another item for my growing list.&quot; He thinks for a brief moment, before making ready to sleep. <br>

(Sits back, trying to remember her past, but since her meeting the guild, she has no memories before that. She remembers fighting things to get what she needs but nothing else)<br>
<br>
Dark Brothers and Sisters, I am here to say sorry for my long time away, but journys elsewhere have needed me. I hope to somehow remember my past so i can share with thee. Till, then I ask for forgiveness for being away so long.<br>
