stalker prt. 2<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The calling of the darkness held strongly on Banshi's soul. <br>
<br>
Banshi forced her eyes to open, the pain wracking her nerves. “Must tend the wound.” She told herself. Her hand fumbled at her waist, to untie her field pouch, which held her bandages, and healing salves. She untied the pouch and almost had it open, when she moaned and curled into a ball, as a wave of pain rolled up her spine, she gave a bone gritting scream as her body convulsed harshly on the forest floor, blood and spittle seeped from her lips, as the spasms of pain welled over her and penetrated her every being.<br>
<br>
Banshi uncurls herself like an asp and her deathly gaze comes to rest upon a tree, not more then a couple feet away. “Crawl to the tree, if you fail, your no better then the halflings that lie at your feet!” She told herself in her mind, or was it something else that was telling her to do it, she didn’t know, her only thought was to comply with the voice. She pulled and crawled her way to the tree, coughing up blood, and shrieking in pain as she made her way across the forest floor. Her hand finally clutches the rough bark of the old oak. A bloody smile forms at the corners of her maw. As she pulls her self to a sitting position against the oak, she comes to rest on her haunches and starts to laugh out loud like a drunkard spouting off obscenities that would make a high elf blush. “Death be damned. ” The voice shouted in her mind.<br>
<br>
The mist before her starts to swirl and dance like a tavern whore, as six pairs of deep red eyes protrudes through the mist and circles her through the tree's surrounding her. She tries to rise to confront the new threat, her hand quickly moves to her scabbard but is rewarded with more mind numbing pain. To her recollection she remembers that she dropped her sword, after being impaled by the halflings blade.<br>
<br>
The red glowing orbs come closer to her, and as they near the oak. Banshi is awestruck at what she sees, red leathery creatures, their small wings hovering their tiny frame, leaving a deathly dark shadow in their wake. One lands at her feet and looks up at her, and gives a toothy grin. The imp saunters closer to her, watching her, it reaches out with its little arm and pets her leg as if to comfort her as if they where lovers. Banshi drearily watching through half closed eyelids, sits and awaits what she knows to be imminent. The thought of death seems to well in her mind, sleep, peace, she rolls it around in her mind like fine ale in a stein.<br>
<br>
A dark shadow moves through the mist like a plague, its dark wispy tentacles reaching out as it pulls itself through the mist. The shadow moves without making a sound as it nears its minions and a dark elf female propped up against a large tree. Banshi doesn’t even notice the dark shadow approach until it is upon her.<br>
<br>
Her eyes flare open at the dark monstrosity that stands before her in a black flowing robe of pure darkness, who's hate filled eyes, could consume your soul with just its gaze, it was the father, the shadow, Innoruuk prince of hate.<br>
<br>
Banshi bows her head. <br>
<br>
“A visit by the father before death, I am honored indeed!” She thought to herself. Many thoughts raced through her mind in seconds, but all she could do was keep her eyes averted. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk comes closer to her and lays his hand upon her head. Pictures flash through her mind, of the coming of Innoruuk upon the land, they race stagnantly through her eyes as if she was there to witness his resurrection and his glory. Another scene drops her maw in awe, a dark elf female with a pulsating axe of pure black, her white elegant hair tied back in a braid and armor of pure black that melded with her flesh as if it was skin. Her axe lifting and falling in quick succession, felling all before her, Banshi willed to see the face of this mysterious female. The dance the mysterious female displayed as she parried and thrust with her axe was beautiful and spoke to her like a whisper upon the wind. She knew what the axe was, it had a name, her mind ran over all the tales she was told as a child, now she remembered its name, “Hatebringer!” She whispered under her breath.<br>
<br>
The dark elf female raised her axe over her head and gave a battle cry that resounded through her ears like a shriek from beyond, her foes dropped to there knees and gripped there heads in pain. Some of her foes ears bled profusely, many took their own life to be rid of the pain from her wail. The moment she awaited for, the female pulled her helm from her head, Banshi couldn’t believe what she was looking at, it was she, and she was seeing herself.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk removed his skeletal hand from her head and Banshi passed out, the rising and falling of her chest the only proof she was alive. The shadow looked over Banshi as she slept, his gaze came upon her gaping wound, and with a wave of his hand over the gash, and her flesh came together and was mended, leaving a large scar. He looked over it satisfied, and then was gone. The Imp at her feet brought its wings out from its back and rose into the air, the little imp came upon Banshi’s maw and lightly kissed her upon the cheek, with a triumphant howl it raised higher into the air and was gone.<br>
<br>
Banshi awoke from a delightful dream of drinking from a dwarven’s skull, remembering she was wounded reached down real quick to see her wound but there was none, only a scar. She put her hand on the tree to push her self up, but her hand didn’t touch a rugged bark, but a cold shaft, she looked down and to her surprise, the axe she saw in the dream lied at her side. She grabbed the shaft with both hands and brought it to her front, it was light for such a large two-handed axe, and she made a couple thrusts and was amazed how well it moved in her hands. Then out of nowhere the axe spoke to her.<br>
<br>
“I am Hatebringer, serve the father well and I shall serve ye without fail.”<br>
<br>
She looked at the axe in bewilderment. “How can this be, it was a dream.” She told herself.<br>
<br>
“I can read your thoughts Banshi, I am attuned to you and only you, woe the poor fool that brings his hand upon my hilt, for it shall be the last thing the fool does.” <br>
<br>
Her brow raised in surprise. “Ye are’n a gift from’n Innoruuk that’n I canna not repay’n.” She said out loud.<br>
<br>
The aura of the axe brightened. “Your service to the father and your loyalty is repayment. The father has chosen you to wield me, you are his chosen, wailer of hate.”<br>
<br>
A smirk crossed her lips. “Then let’n us spread’n his hate, we’n shall serve’n him without’ n fail, hate be’n true or I shall’n fall.<br>
<br>
Banshi brought hatebringer to her shoulder and moved into the dense brush, she started to run through the forest, the thought of being honored by innoruuk fueling her pumping leggs that would carry her to neriak.<br>

I have seen the Father's gifts he has imparted, and while great, Hatebringer is not the greatest. You are filled with his power, and your faith is pure. Yours is a will that will win through to the end, and yours is a thirst that will never be quenched. I foresee the time when you will lead sorties beyond the Frost Gate, simply to let the Lightborn know they are not forgotten. You will not be content to sit and enjoy the fruits of the Harvest, the nature of paradise itself. Instead, your desire for conflict, for blood, will keep the Lightborn on their heels, preventing any unified assault from the Frozen North. Fear not, Banshi, you will not be alone in this, for there are a few more like you, who have the gift of the Father's spirit flowing through their veins. I salute you!<br>
