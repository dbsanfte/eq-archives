He has kidnapped me and is about put a spell on me. He hopes to tourture me mentally. <br>
We are going to pass through the commons. So Dragons please rally and help! Especially levels of 12-30.<br>
The spell he dares to put upon me is this:<br>
<br>
<br>
Minz’s ill timed deeds agonizingly blocks my cure!<br>
Slovenly done, by my God Innoruk for sure!<br>
<br>
Father, my Price of Hate<br>
Only with these words will my pain abate:<br>
<br>
Revenge shall it be<br>
Abduction the key<br>
<br>
This spell the way<br>
To force a beloved dark day<br>
<br>
No more the Elder Dragon’s light<br>
Only the Violent Harvest’s dark delight<br>
<br>
For soon the Dragon’s back shall break<br>
And this curse will take<br>
<br>
<br>
Soon shall she be an infamous myth<br>
Being one of the Elder Dragon’s Fifths<br>
<br>
Enchantress Ascrida by name<br>
Eternally young by fame<br>
<br>
A disgusting high-elf and light bearer by worship<br>
Hear now her insane and deadly courtship<br>

For now she is nauseatingly all honor and light<br>
This will turn to nervous glancing and twitching dark fright<br>

All her joyous laughter shall cease to be <br>
Changing to a crone’s cackling hehe<br>
<br>
All her noble words <br>
Shall become lower than a Froglok’s turds<br>
<br>
That is her fate<br>
Light and love sinking her to our Beloved Hate<br>
<br>
Her ever deepening insane sickness shall crack<br>
The morale of the Great Dragon’s back<br>
<br>
<br>
The only cure shall be<br>
A surname of Ascrida to be<br>
This will restore the Elder Dragon’s position<br>
And give a cure for Ascrida disposition<br>
<br>

Description<br>
Najena is the ancient home of a twisted dark elf magician named Najena, who carved out this hole in the hidden areas of the Lavastorm Mountains in which to carry out her experiments, as well as those of her allies. The undead walk the halls as if it is home. <br>
<br>
Basic Zone Information<br>
Najena is a place filled with undead of various types. The rooms are packed with them, with typically four skeletons of various types lying on the floor of any given room. Added to this are aggressive earth elementals and ogre guards, all of whom will attack on sight. For adventurers in the lower level ranges listed above (below 17th level or so), travelling in a group should be the rule, as simply walking in a room can result in four creatures jumping you at once. Once you've hit 17th, only the occasional Darkbone Skeleton will attack. For lower level adventurers, hunting in the front rooms and attacking the creatures that are there should provide enough excitement. <br>
<br>
Advanced Zone Information<br>
For higher level adventurers or groups, the zone is much more interesting than trying to fight off swarms of skeletons. There are several areas of interest. First of all, there is a whole key system to the lair of Najena. Various creatures and NPC's carry the keys to access other areas within the lair. I will use the keys to describe how to move through the zone. The ogre guards and Moosh carry a key ring, which will give you access to the prison cells. One note on Moosh, attacking him in the prison itself will make the injured halfling join in against you, although when you kill him you take hits with all the Rivervale factions. This is especially a pain because Moosh will stupidly attack people way above his level, so even hanging out in there is a bad idea for reasons of faction. The first monster in the key sequence is Bonecracker. Bonecracker is an approximately level 25 undead froglok who lives in a room with two lovely dark elf necromancers. He also spawns the Barbed Leather Whip and Leering Mask occasionally, and he himself spawns every 20 minutes. He gives you the dull bone key. The ogre captain must then be killed to get the shiny metal key. These first two keys are the only keys that aren't No Rent (i.e. they won't disappear when you log) so hang onto them. <br>
<br>
The shiny metal key is then used to open the cell outside of Rathyl's room. The dull bone key is then used to access Rathyl's area, where you can fight Rathyl. Note you need both keys to get to Rathyl. Killing him will give you access to the bloodstained key for Drelzna's room, as well as possibly the Traveller's Pouch or Pack. He then reincarnates (as Rathyl reincarnate) and sometimes has the Hollowed Bone Bracers as loot. Then you can access Drelzna's room, who is slightly higher level, and used to spawn the Journeyman Boots (but not any more)... Now you can get the Ashenwood Short Spear there. Getting the golden crescent key from Drelzna will allow you to access the room with Najena herself, who is about 29th level or so and has several high level protectors. She spawns the Flowing Black Robe and the Black Tome with Silver Runes. Also new to the area is a Widow Mistress, who drops the Stiletto of the Blood Claw, and appears near the spiders in the caves beyond the underwater tunnel to Najena's room.. <br>
<br>
There is also a prison area, which the intrepid explorer can find himself trapped in by falling through one of two pit traps located in the upper level. There is a damsel in distress here, as well as an injured halfling who won't talk to anyone, but, as mentioned above, will rush to the aid of his ogre guard for no apparent reason. <br>
<br>
Travelling To and From Najena<br>
The entrance to Najena lies in the southeastern corner of the Lavastorm Mountains. It is impossible to miss, as it consists of a huge set of double doors, with one blown off its hinges from some unknown force within. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Najena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is located in the zone of lavastorm. To find Najena you can take a right upon entering lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the Najena ruins in the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a green fog throughout. <br>
<br>
The entrance area is not too easy you will find greater skeletons and ogre guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find elements and tentacle terrors. The first few rooms are the ones most often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the dungeon however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in order.<br>
<br>
The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the hallways. This room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk right through. From this room you will see two passages. The door to the left of here leads to some level 20ish skeletons. The passage downstairs leads to the meat of this portion of the dungeon. <br>
<br>
You will find many necromancers and ogre's down in this area. However the prized opponents in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the Ogre Officer. <br>
<br>
Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is in a room with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a froglock ghoul who is level 24. He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This includes flesh rings and barbed leather whips. <br>
<br>
To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find the captains room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly. He is guarded by several ogres including an officer who is in the level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to Rathyl's room as well as the occasional ogre maul or large bronze platemail piece of armor.<br>
<br>
The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to the real juicy part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued straight when entering the dungeon you would undoubtedly have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the entrance. Behind this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC's in this zone: Rathyl, Drelzna and Najena. <br>
<br>
These NPC's must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the other ones chamber as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to party members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are no rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. <br>
<br>
I don't want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to chance(and it would be hard to describe anyway) so i'm just going to roughly describe each NPC and an example of what you might find on them. <br>
<br>
Rathyl is guarded by three magicians. He is a deadly foe even after death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be destroyed all over again! A typical item you might find from Rathyl would be a traveller's backpack.<br>
<br>
Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps even tougher than Najena.<br>
<br>
Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest of them all and is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but this is only because of her guards. One of Najena's prized possessions is the flowing black robe.<br>
