<br>
An Erudite's Death<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Dust motes swirled like a swarm of insects in the streams of amber and amethyst light, projected to the marble floors through stained glass set in the library’s ancient dome. Quiet footfalls padded between the racks of tomes, some old, some new, in the ever-expanding archives of Norrathian knowledge. A gasp echoed from the rotunda below, as a newcomer stood entranced by the awe inspiring view of the domed tower’s spiraling interior. The day of such gasps had ended for Caiius Betria many years ago. He was one of many in Erudin who owed their prestige, livelihood and identity to the marble tower and its contents. He was a Librarian.<br>
<br>
Caiius passed through the motes, bathed momentarily in a shimmering coat of light, as he passed between two seldom-used racks of books. The quiet erudite behind him moved with uncommon grace, silent and respectful as he waited for his guide to navigate the sea of pages and tomes. That his visitor was dressed in Oracle blue denoted either access to wealth, or more likely in this case, some experience in the world. Slightly shorter than many in Erud, the fellow seemed pleasant enough and most importantly, knew the one thing that so many did not when they arrived upon the threshold of the High Library of Erudin – the name of the tome he sought. Caiius knew nearly every title in his section, Antiquities and the Combine Era. Many craved the knowledge in the tomes, but knew not the title that would aid them. He detested such ignorant disdain of the efforts of great scholars, and gave to these passing folk little but scorn. But the serious scholar, one who knew the title, or even the author, to these he gave their just due- especially those that discreetly donated as generously as this one had.<br>
<br>
Finally, he stopped and squeezed between the ends of two racks into a small alcove girded by dust covered shelves. Caiius coughed once and motioned for the newcomer to follow him in. The Erudite slipped easily between the eight-foot high bookshelves, and stood in the alcove’s center next to Caiius. He watched the librarian, seemingly unimpressed by the treasury of lost lore surrounding him.<br>
<br>
“Now, that was Excerpts from the Journal of Tesh?” Caiius asked crisply. The Erudite was silent, but nodded his affirmation. Caiius returned the nod, then went directly to the shelf upon which the ancient tome rested. “Of course,” he said as he carefully lifted the worm-eaten book from its resting place, “you realize that you must read it on the tables provided. This particular book is reserved for in Library use, and even then only under the supervision of the Highbrows.” He stood and turned, then saw the Erudite reach into the folds of his robe and withdraw a pouch, moving as if to trade it for the book.<br>
<br>
Caiius understood the gesture at once, and with great affront lifted his chin. “How dare you attempt to bribe me. I am a Librarian of Erud, and you can either obey our rules or go without the knowledge. I accepted your earlier tip as a gift of goodwill, but this! This is nothing but sheer insult.”<br>
<br>
The Erud smiled slowly, then put his pouch away. Caiius nodded, about to speak, but as he did so, the traveler opened a satchel he carried at his side and withdrew a golden rod set with dark, shimmering stones.<br>
<br>
Too late, Caiius felt a twinge of fear build beneath his pride. Still smiling the Erud raised his free hand and muttered a brief incantation. At once, the alcove was filled with scintillating, shimmering colors, swirling about him and leaving him gripped in the bonds of vertigo. <br>
<br>
The shape before him moved slightly, and Caiius managed to mutter, “You want the book! You are an enchanter!” Another incantation pierced the ringing in his ears, and he felt his will dissipate like mist before the summer sun. “Charmed…” he gasped, the sound of his last word, little more than a whisper.<br>
<br>
Unable to control the betrayal of his body, he handed the tome to the Erud, who stood smiling with genuine delight. As much as Caiius loved his books, this Erud loved his glimmercrafts. And now, Caiius, respected by all in Erudin, was nothing but a thrall to the traveler’s whimsy. The blue-robed demon carefully placed the tome in his satchel, then slipped between the racks of books, flawlessly tracing his way back through the maze. Finally, he stood near the end of one rack, and peered down a narrow hallway. Caiius followed, unable to resist.<br>
<br>
Slowly, the Erud looked back to the Librarian of Antiquities, and offered a soft smirk that was at once cruel, sad and apologetic. Caiius approached him, and watched as the golden rod rose to point at a figure emerging from the shadows at the far end of the hall. Softly, in a language that had never before been uttered in the High Library of Erudin, the traveler commanded, “Pet…attack!”<br>
<br>
Caiius charged forward, his hands rising as he neared the purple-robed Feir Dal who had just emerged from a stairwell. Cold and efficient as always, the Erudin Sentry that escorted the visiting dignitary drew his blade and, stepping defensively before the High Elf, allowed Caiius to impale himself upon it as he leapt to attack. Caiius struggled for a moment to reach past the sentry, but the soldier pushed forward with the blade, forcing him back as the hilts pressed against his ruptured abdomen. The sentry pulled his blade back and quickly scanned the area. Caiius, still clawing weakly at the mage, slid off the blade and dropped heavily to the ground. Moving to the rail, he called down for the Captain of the Watch. <br>
<br>
&quot;I apologize for that scene, my lord,&quot; he said to the High Elf. &quot;These librarians sometimes go mad from their monotonous tasks here. Still, they serve a purpose I suppose.&quot; The High Elf waved a hand dismissing the apology, smiled, and walked aroudn the widening pool of blood on the library floor. The sentry removed a towel from his pouch and wiped down his blade, sheathed it, then stepped forward to continue his duties as escort and guide.<br>
<br>
Caiius lay still, his strength leeching away with his blood, his head lolling to one side. Just before darkness took him, he saw an arch of blue light form about a figure in Oracle blue. In that instant he saw the truth of the traveler, he saw the bringer of his death. He mouthed the words, but there were none to hear. As the voice of the apologizing sentry faded down the hall, Caiius watched the last glimmer of sparkling blue fade to slowly to black.<br>
<br>

<br>
The scribe wrote furiously as the Prophet labored beneath the touch of Hate, the images as fresh as if he had witnessed it all himself. The faces shifting, the shimmering light – an unusually vivid vision, even for the Mad One. Finally, the Prophet’s words trailed into the gibberish that often signaled the end of his pain. He was still for several moments, and the scribe looked longingly to the box he used to carry the tools of his trade. When he looked back to the priest, however, his eyes were wide open and seemed covered by a hazy white film.<br>
<br>
“Beware the Mist.” He whispered. “Tell Selilya, beware the Mist.” The scribe wrote the words, remembering them from a previous vision so many months before. The prophet sighed, and fell at once to a deep sleep. Waiting for a few moments to be sure, the scribe quietly rolled up the vellum and stowed them away. Yawning, he put the queries from his mind and left to find his own rest in the dark labrynthe of Neriak.<br>

<br>
&quot;Perhaps he is awake still,&quot; Faeolin thought. Her duties put aside for the day, she was not quite ready for sleep. Word of Nospiratus' return from the frozen lands of Velious had made her realize how much she missed talking to her old friend. With a little prompting he would willingly talk the night away, and the quiet clinking of glass from her satchel held precisely the sort of prompting he would appreciate.<br>
<br>
The only sounds she heard, were the heavy clanking footsteps of the guards as they patrolled unceasingly through Neriak. She gave and recieved the nods of respect as she passed through her city. The chill wind that blew as she approached the Temple of Innoruuk made her pull her cloak just a bit tighter than she liked to admit. &quot;Will I ever get used to this feeling,&quot; she wondered as shivers ran up her spine. Many times she had passed through the Temple doors, and the result was always the same. <br>
<br>
She had tried to describe it to her friend once, and Nospiratus had only laughed at her. &quot;The eye of Innoruuk is always upon us, it does not stare merely because you have put your heels in one place or another&quot; he had told her. &quot;The reason you feel that way is because you have not been giving enough in your tythes,&quot; he had told her. The result of that conversation was an emptying of her coin purse, and a day polishing his armour as &quot;penance.&quot;<br>
<br>
A couple of turns and his door came in sight. Hefting her pack again, the warrior ground to a halt in front of his door. There was silence within, and she contemplated checking his favorite &quot;tapestry,&quot; to see if he had gone departed that way. He called it that, but she knew that it was not the scenes of Halfling sacrifice that he liked so much, as what lay behind. His hatred of Halflings was well known. Their sacrifice would surely please him to no end, but the secret passage to Neriak Underground and The Blind Fish itself was his real reason for liking the Tapestry so much. <br>
<br>
A light sleeper, he should have awoke to the sound of her knock. She knocked twice more, and worried images crossed her mind. Many of the Harvest had their name on bounty lists, and knowing this she made the decision to enter uninvited. <br>
<br>
A loud snore greeted her as she opened the door, and a quick glance about the room told her all she needed to know.<br>
He had suffered another of his visions tonight, the half empty inkwell on his desk and the candle stubs about the room told her that his scribe had been here and gone already. A strange sensation crossed her heart at that moment, the name was unknown to her, but others would call it pity. A moments decision brought her to take quill and parchment and scribe a note. <br>
<br>
Nospiratus:<br>
<br>
I will leave this satchel for you, since I know you will have need of its contents. Seek me out soon, so we may talk of the events in Velious, and more importantly what you may interpret from tonights trial.<br>
<br>
Faeolin<br>
<br>
Leaving the pack on top of the note, she quietly closed his door and worriedly made her way back to her quarters<br>

<br>
A Bottle and A Note<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Nospiratus stood by the desk staring at the bottle and the note. A bottle and a note.<br>
<br>
He had raised his hands several times to touch the smooth texture of the glass, but each time, he stopped as if a barrier had sprung forth between himself and the thing he desired. The note lay open faced upon the desk and he had read it and smiled, appreciating the thoughtfulness of the newly installed Dread Lord, his friend from the earliest days when the Harvest wore violet. He knew who the gift was from, but he still could not bring himself to touch it, much less consume its cold contents.<br>
<br>
Once more he reached forward, and again, the vision of a bottle of swirling mist touched his mind. After the visions of the previous night he was so tired...too tired to welcome one while awake. Then he sighed. If a vision ust come this morning, he knew he would have to accept it. These were dnagerous times, and he would not let fear and exhaustion stand in the way of his duty to the Harvest. Turning to the side of the desk, he pulled on the dangling purple cord. THere was no answering chime, for the summons was set to sound in a remote part of the city. His scribe would need a bonus, he thought for a moment. While he waited, he penned an order for rare sweet meats and a new slave to be sent to the address of a little known merchant in the foreign quarter. He would seethat it reached the proper place.<br>
<br>
After several moments, the cowled figure of his confidant entered the room and dutifully sat upon the lone stool in the corner, removing his vellum and quill from his worn cedar box. At last, he looked up to Nospiratus with bloodshot eyes and nodded.<br>
<br>
Without delay, like the swimmer jumping into ice cold water before the heat of the sun had touched its surface, he gripped the bottle.<br>
<br>
...to be continued...<br>
