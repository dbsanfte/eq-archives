Zirrix, General of the Teir’dal Empire and Second Born of the Great House T’Rhennic, sat upon his sturdy mount and surveyed the landscape. He had recently obtained the dark steed from the moon of Luclin itself. That was after the Grand Spell cast by the combined might of the Wizards of Norrath had changed the very fabric of existence. The spell had completely exhausted the Wizards who participated, both physically and mentally, and had put many into a coma from which they have not yet recovered. It was even rumored that more then a few had actually died from the strain of the spell’s casting. Zirrix’s brother Tzlar, War Wizard and Chancellor of the Imperial Council, had been confined to bed for several days. His body incapacitated and his mind racked with violent and horrible delusions. Zirrix was concerned that he may need to end Tzlar’s life, for it was not wise for any Noble Line to have a babbling wretch it’s head for any length of time. Realistically, the time it takes for the perceived weakness of a Great House to be exploited by the ambitious or vengeful, is about as long as the life expectancy of a glass of frosty ale to survive in a room full of parched Dwarves. It was the way of the Empire, and rightfully so, that the weak or crippled must be eliminated for the benefit of the worthy. But, Tzlar had recovered, and then retreated into the seclusion and security of T’Rhennic Keep for a time afterward. He has since returned to his duties to House and Empire. After the spell’s effects had been set loose upon Norrath, the rest of the “Commoner” population was ready to slaughter any and all Wizards on sight. But the extermination of a Human “Punishment” force from Quynos, which had landed on the shores of Erud, soon taught the world the folly of that plan. The Wizards, in an attempt to mollify the enraged population of Norrath, had set “Scions” at various portal points, to allow all Norrath to travel to the mysterious moon of Luclin. After a time, the avarice and lust for slaughter of the various races overrode their anger toward the Wizards, and thus the race for new lands had begun.<br>
<br>
Zirrix had traveled briefly to Luclin, and was suitably impressed with the new stock of prey that abounded there. In fact, there was an entirely new race of slaves, distant relations to the Kerrans of Odus, called the Val Shar. They seemed to be less intelligent then the other varieties of slaves available to the Respected Race, but were sturdier and would make excellent laborers. However, the Empire still had matters to attend to on Norrath first, and that is where Zirrix belonged. Time enough to conquer other worlds, once the destiny of the Children of Neriak was achieved on this one first. Thus, had Zirrix returned to the frozen wastes of Velious to continue his slaughter of the Coldain pestilence and strengthen the Empire’s alliance with the Giants of Kael Drakkal. Alone, here in the icy desolation of the Eastern Wastes, Zirrix could reflect on the battles at hand and well being of his people. Soon, he would return to Neriak and attend to certain matters that required his special brand of authority. Fortunately his guild, the Violent Harvest, had continued to grow in both power and respect throughout time. Matters of Empire had forced Zirrix, who was a Dread Lord of the Harvest, into only a minimal involvement with regards to happenings within the guild. In time though, that would change. Looking up, Zirrix saw another Coldain patrol in the distance, slowly trudging through the snow. Turning his mount, Darkstorm, toward their diminutive targets, Zirrix cracked his whip into the air, as a herald of the doom about to befall the small scouting party. As if in response, the fridged wind began to howl in gleeful anticipation of the spectacle of battle that was about begin…     <br>
