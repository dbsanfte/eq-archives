 <br>
<br>
<br>
Version 1.51 fixes many small problems, especially with objects. You'll find a massive list of object tweaks, as well as some bug fixes, a host of Mordred (PvP) server tweaks, and some fun new card and dice playing commands. Also, a few more dungeons have undergone an expansion (see the world notes for details).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br>
<br>
- Previously, when you used the purge Realm Ability, your timer was not being reset, so if you used purge to get rid of a bad effect (mesmerize, for example), you could immediately be re-mezzed. This has been fixed.<br>
<br>
- The &quot;/random&quot; command is now in, which will give you a random number. Type &quot;/random #&quot; to print out a number between 1 and the number you chose.<br>
<br>
- The guild commands PROMOTE, DEMOTE, LEADER, and REMOVE now work by player name, not target, and work across zones. Use the format &quot;/gc promote [playername] [rank]&quot;, for example.<br>
<br>
- When you are above 1000 in your main tradeskill, any item you can successfully make will now have an even chance of being 94-100% quality.<br>
<br>
- There were some monster pathing problems in Darkness Falls that prevented pets from moving between rooms properly. This has been fixed.<br>
<br>
- You should no longer be able to &quot;screenshot jump&quot;.<br>
<br>
- Shadowed players - i.e. hidden players who have been uncovered by the See Hidden Realm ability, or friendly stealthed players - no longer &quot;pop&quot; into full view when they initially come into view. They now appear correctly as shadows.<br>
<br>
- You can no longer utilize an exploit to &quot;rez-pull&quot; a player through a keep wall or boundary wall.<br>
<br>
- Poison Merchants are now listed as such over their heads.<br>
<br>
- When you select an object with the mouse, then use F7 to select the nearest object or monster, the summary window should now correctly update. Previously, it would only show the monster's health bar.<br>
<br>
- You should no longer run into the &quot;cast while sitting&quot; bug. Players would tap on the forward key to stand (when sitting), then immediately cast and would get the &quot;you cannot cast while sitting&quot;.<br>
<br>
- Target Nearest Object no longer targets tombstones.<br>
<br>
- You should now get an icon on your screen when you are stealthed. <br>
<br>
- The Ignore Pain Realm Ability is a full heal every 30 minutes, with one 14 pt level. The documentation on the Herald will be updated to reflect this.<br>
<br>
- Added a new key (which is by default unmapped) that allows the player to target the last attacker. In general (if a player has no target already), his last attacker will be auto-targeted. This allows the player to switch to the last creature to do damage to him even if he's already targeted.<br>
<br>
- The Use Item key has been added to the /keyboard list.<br>
<br>
- /INVITE [name] now invites a person to a group by name - you no longer has to be targeted. /INVITE with no name still invites the targeted player.<br>
<br>
- Poisons can now be hotkeyed. When you activate the poison it automatically applies to the readied weapon in the right hand. If the right-hand weapon already has a &quot;poison&quot; effect, the poison will auto-apply to the left handed weapon.<br>
<br>
- Flying monsters should now face the correct direction when pulled into combat by a player.<br>
<br>
- Pets now correctly give faction hits when they make the killing blow.<br>
<br>
- The /GC LEADER command now prints the correct rank of the new leader.<br>
<br>
- The Darkness Falls entrance status is now on the /REALM command.<br>
<br>
- When you prepare to use a bow, you now longer get the extra messages about &quot;using&quot; the bow.<br>
<br>
- When you delve (shift - I) a duration effect on yourself, it now shows the time left in the effect.<br>
<br>
- You can now change your last name for a fee of 10 gold at the name registrar. You can do this as many times as you wish.<br>
<br>
- The /AREMOVE [LEADER] and /AREMOVE [number] now correctly work without typing additional words.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MORDRED (PVP SERVER) NOTES<br>
<br>
- All Mordred relic guards and doors in all 6 relic keeps are now de-spawned. Players will be able to carry relics and place them in frontier keeps. This one-time event is for testing purposes to get the relics &quot;into circulation&quot; for testing on the server.<br>
<br>
- Alliance Points are now capped at 5x a &quot;yellow&quot; kill for your level.<br>
<br>
- For 2 hours of played time after leaving a guild, you cannot join/rejoin another guild or pick up a relic.<br>
<br>
- Killing players less than half your level will give no Alliance Point rewards.<br>
<br>
- PvP immunity is now still 2 minutes after releasing (after death), but 20 seconds for any normal zoning or when you enter game.<br>
<br>
- Players with under 3 constitution can no longer attack other players or cast aggressive spells - but they can be attacked.<br>
<br>
- Alliances on PvP servers are now limited to ten guilds.<br>
<br>
- Players who use [setwho trades] will now have their tradeskill printed next to their name.<br>
<br>
- If a Relic is placed in an guild-controlled outpost, and the guild controlling that outpost runs out of Bounty Points to maintain it, the Relic will revert back to its original Relic Keep.<br>
<br>
- Crafters on PvP servers can use &quot;/craft [albion/hibernia/midgard]&quot; to set which Realm's items they want to make.<br>
<br>
- On PvP Servers, F8/F9 (select closest enemy/friend) now works correctly. Friendly players (defined as member of your guild, alliance, or group) will no longer show up when you use target enemy. Please note that all monsters, regardless of affiliation, will be selected by select closest enemy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JUST FOR FUN<br>
<br>
We've added a few new &quot;fun&quot; commands to Camelot that allow you to roll dice and even play cards.<br>
<br>
- a &quot;/roll [number dice]&quot; command is in, which simulates a dice roll. You can specify how many die rolls you want. This command simulates a six-sided dice only.<br>
<br>
- &quot;/shuffle [number of decks]&quot; will create the number of decks you specify and automatically shuffle them. Please note you must use this command before using the /deal command (see below).<br>
<br>
- &quot;/deal [name] [u/d]&quot; will deal one card to the player of your choice. u/d determines whether the card is up or down (whether it is printed to the other players or not). Please note you must use the &quot;/shuffle&quot; command first to actually create the decks of cards. Also please note that the &quot;cards&quot; are text-only; there are no graphics with the card system. Also, you may play cards only with your group members.<br>
<br>
- &quot;/held&quot; gives you a list of all the cards in your hand. Each of your cards are listed with a number beside them. &quot;/help g&quot; gives you a list of all the players in your group and what cards they are showing.<br>
<br>
- &quot;/discard [#] will discard the card in your hand that you specify. &quot;/discard all&quot; gets rid of all your cards.<br>
<br>
- &quot;/show&quot; shows your whole hand (turns all your 'down' cards to 'up').<br>
<br>
- Please note that you can filter off all card and dice text by turning off emote text.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPELL SYSTEM GRAPHICAL NOTES<br>
<br>
- All musical spellcasters now get the floating notes cast effect for some spell. The new notes effect is smaller and less obtrusive, though. Musical effects which seemed to have the old and new notes at the same time should be cleared up.<br>
<br>
- Pulse effects for musical casters are mostly removed, except for the speed song, which has the small foot twinkles. Other songs now just have a one-time hit effect.<br>
<br>
- A downward, colorful spiral was added to some of the stun effects to differentiate them from some other, similar effects in the game. Stun and &quot;mez&quot; effects are still being tweaked, and a better method of showing when such spells &quot;break&quot; is being looked into. <br>
<br>
- Two effects which make silver and gold twinkles were adjusted to a smaller, more appropriate scale. (Purely aesthetic change).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SOUND SYSTEM CHANGES<br>
<br>
- Random ambient outdoor sounds have been tweaked. Many confusing or otherwise annoying sounds have been removed, and replaced by different, more appropriate sounds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PLAYER FIGURE NOTES<br>
<br>
- The Firbolg male model no longer carries his shield too far away from his forearm. It is now much closer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CRAFTING SYSTEM UPDATE<br>
<br>
- Fixed all level 51 armor recipes that created the wrong item, as well as recipe values.<br>
<br>
- Level 51 armors will no longer be picked for consignments.<br>
<br>
- Added new items to fletching for all three realms:<br>
<br>
Albion: Heavy Short bow, Heavy Longbow, Light crossbow, Heavy Staff, Heavy Shod staff<br>
<br>
Midgard: Heavy Staff, Heavy Composite bow<br>
<br>
Hibernia: Heavy Short bow, Heavy Recurve bow, Heavy staff<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES<br>
<br>
General Quests<br>
<br>
We're continuing our introduction of a new type of quest intended to pick up where kill tasks leave off. These new quests are a storyline-based type of kill task. There are 21 of these quests being added for each realm, and they are intended for players between levels 21 and 41. To maximize your benefit we recommend you do them at the suggested level, but you may need to bring a partner to ensure your success in slaying the appropriate monster. Speak with your local barkeep for more info.<br>
<br>
<br>
Albion Quests<br>
<br>
- We have added a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete the following quests: &quot;Soul Gem&quot; and &quot;Fell Tooth Bounty.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps:<br>
<br>
- Keep lords now have the ability to see stealthed players.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeon Notes<br>
<br>
Three more dungeons have gotten an overhaul. These changes include new sections of the dungeons opened for player use, and new encounter areas.<br>
<br>
Albion: Tomb of Mithra<br>
Rumors of increased activity in the Tomb of Mithra have run rampant through the local alehouses. Lord Prydwen has issued an official edict that all citizens of the Realm are not to explore the dungeon. Any attempt to do so may spark greater evil than that which currently inhabits the tomb.<br>
<br>
Albion: Catacombs of Cardova:<br>
During a recent journey to the Catacombs of Cardova, a group of adventurers happened upon the corpse of a tomb raider. Upon closer examination, they found him to be mumbling incoherently, his body in tattered ruins, his flesh singed and hair completely burned off. Disregarding the dying thief's warnings, the group descended the steps into the darkness of the crypt. One member made it outside before he died.<br>
<br>
Midgard: Nisse's Lair:<br>
There have been rumors of recent activity in Nisse's Lair. The tomte of the region have begun digging new caves and passages within their home and more tomte have begun moving to the area. Hunters of the realm are unsure of the cause for this sudden flurry of activity. <br>
<br>
<br>
Monsters<br>
<br>
Hibernia: Lough Gur: Melancholic fairies have been harassing passers-by in the southwest of Lough Gur. These fairies will attack those that disturb their home or even get near it.<br>
<br>
Cursed Forest: Blight begins his life in the form of eight small skeletons. It seems that occasionally one of these eight would stray off from his group. This would result in Blight's second phase not appearing when the first group is killed since all of the small skeletons must be found and killed. The small skeletons will be much better about staying together now and will periodically regroup with one another just to make sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES<br>
<br>
We have begun to weed out items that have invalid skill bonuses or stat increases that are not useful. This is the first batch of fixes, and we will be continuing to fix these types of problems on an on-going basis. The majority of these items had evade, bow skill, and/or were Paladin items with chants or piety. None of these bonuses helped anyone, so they were changed. There are also a few other item fixes in here. Enjoy.<br>

Salvageable Items<br>
<br>
We've been going through in-game objects to make them able to be salvaged. Here's the first list of those items that can now be salvaged. Note that some of these items may have different repair and/or sell values, as they were using outdated values that are now correct with current standards.
