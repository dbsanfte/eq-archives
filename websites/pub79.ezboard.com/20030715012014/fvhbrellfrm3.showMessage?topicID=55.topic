My story<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Dark Family, <br>
<br>
It is with dark heart that I write these words to you. I have proven myself through both battle and the utmost loyalty with which I serve the Harvest. All of you know me strictly as Faeolin, Dread Harvester in the Violent Harvest.<br>
<br>
I will tell you now, that I am truly Faeolin R'Danya, of the disgraced House R'Danya.<br>
<br>
For long, I sought to hide my past from you, but now with the addition of one of noble blood to the Violent Harvest, namelyZressothT'Rhennic, of House T'Rhennic, I fear I must now come clean. I do not do this willingly, but I do it out of fear that my name and the fact that I have been using the name and seal of R'Danya in my correspondence, will be passed through the wrong channels. <br>
<br>
House R'Danya was never a strong house, and although it vied for power, as all Teir'Dal houses do. It was ever our destiny to be counted among the minor houses. <br>
<br>
In house R'Danya, it was tradition that when the heir had reached their hundred year mark, (as it is in many Noble houses) to be sent to one of the houses of the dead for training. I was the first in 14 generations to be unable to marshal and command the power of death through arcane means.<br>
<br>
This was a major blow against my house, as I was considered (and rightly,) a representative of my houses ability to serve both Innoruuk and the Empire. In this circumstance, the correct thing to do, would have been to erase my name from the lists of House R'Danya, and donate my body for use by the Necromancers at the school of the Dead. My mother decided that House R'Danya could not afford to lose any of it's young soldiers, and sent me to train in the Indigo Brotherhood as one from a common family. To be hired at the completion of my training by House R'Danya.<br>
<br>
I am not sure if Zressoth would remember the cause or even of the destruction of my house, since it has been nigh on one hundred and twenty years ago, but her father surely would. It was towards the completion of my training, and one of the few nights we were allowed to visit the shops in the commons. I travelled with my armsmates to the Blind Fish, for some.... recreation. It was there that House R'Danya indirectly met it's demise.<br>
<br>
I do not wish to relay the details of the nights events. Suffice to say that after suffering the repeated advances of several drunken Teir'Dal, my anger got the best of me. A brawl erupted and quickly escalated to actual combat. <br>
<br>
It was pure happenstance that several powerful Houses were meeting at the Blind Fish at the time the commotion erupted. Obviously they took steps to avoid actual deaths and when I was brought forward as one of the culprits, I stepped above myself and told them that they were &quot;cowards with no honor,&quot; and that they &quot;would be whipped and castrated like a stray dog, for daring to touch the heir of House R'Danya!&quot;<br>
<br>
As you can imagine all of the houses of Neriak, almost immediately declared war on House R'Danya. Sensing weakness, even our sworn allies turned against us. We stood no chance against them and the destruction of my house, and the striking of our names from the roster of noble families, came almost overnight. Because I was on the lists as a recruit of the Indigo Brotherhood I was somewhat protected from retribution. <br>
<br>
When I had finished my training, I refused to be hired on as a soldier in any of the houses. I instead set a solo course of redemption. The fires of my hatred which had been well stoked in the first place, erupted with renewed fury. Both at myself for bringing about the disgrace of our name, as well as all the noble houses of Neriak. <br>
<br>
Although I am no longer allowed to use the surname R'Danya, as that House has been declared anathema. I will have no other. I have sworn to restore the name R'Danya, and when the day comes that Norrath is claimed by the Harvest, I will be in the vanguard as a representative of my late house, and I will bring honor to our name once again.<br>
<br>

Faeolin R'Danya<br>
