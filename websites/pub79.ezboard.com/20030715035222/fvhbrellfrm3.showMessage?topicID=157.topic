<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Part I: &quot;The House that Death Built&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
It comes to pass during the course of events that all things must die.  Even as a loving mother tends to her progeny, this bittering knowledge lingers in her soul: as time passes, she and her young shall eventually cease to be.  Kings and paupers, cities and nations; death, the life-force most commonly associated with the Great Entropy to which all things must move toward, shall come to all.  The dynamics of every force in our universe, even those which constitute the continuing existence of the Gods themselves, shall diminish as they encounter friction by interaction with other forces in our universe.  In this manner, all momentum shall eventually be lost and Entropy shall drive all things to a static state, where there is no life...no movement or motion that would be evident in any living thing.<br>
<br>
I, Vanessa of House Karsel`Lyn, am a student of the grave.  Under the tutelage of The Dead, I have acquired vast knowledge about the death of living things and how death relates to that static force called the Great Entropy.  The research done in these dread halls has raised a plethora of questions that must be answered if we are to understand (or possibly subvert) the Great Entropy.  How do living entities die?  How does their death affect other living entites?  What happens when the accumulated force of Entropy unleashes itself on a group of living entities?  How does Entropy interact with Life, that dynamic forces which drags out the existence of the living?  The answers to these questions will allow us to better understand Entropy and how we can either manipulate it, diverge ourselves from it, or eliminate it entirely.<br>
<br>
I spend a great deal of my time working with death in all of its myriad forms.  At my abode in the subterranean city of Neriak, a whole host of materials, devices, tools, and constructs exist to further my study of the interactions between life and death.  The most common term for this study used by The Dead is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  thanatology</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
This evening, my specimen is one of great importance not only to my personal studies but also to The Dead, as we collectively work toward our common understanding.  A young male Iksar, who calls himself Sisska, lies on ice in a wooden coffin in the corner of the room.  As I have been away for several days, some of the ice has begun to melt, dripping into the floor.  But as I pry open the sealed coffin lid, I am glad to see that most of the ice has not melted, and that the Iksar lays immobilized and alive inside.<br>
<br>
There is a strange anomaly regarding the Iksar race that has made suspension in such a fashion possible.  Like a basilisk or dragon, the blood temperature of an Iksar fluctuates with the temperature around it; such features classify the Iksar as the only cold-blooded sentient humaniod species on Norrath.  Any other sentient humaniod would perish as its body temperature would be severely disrupted by the change.  Not so with the Iksar: entrapment in ice only reduces it to an immobilized state, rendering it quite feeble, yet not so feeble that it would perish.  Thus have I preserved the life of this Iksar child...for now.<br>
<br>
In the opposite corner of my laboratory, adjacent to the blood-cauldron and furnace, is a 50-gallon wine barrel that serves as a repository for the bone fragments I use as reagents for summoning corpse servants.  Looking within, I am glad to see that it is filled to the brim with the remains of living beings.  Taking a handful of bone chips from the repository, I toss them on the cold slate floor before me in preparation for the conjuration ritual.<br>
<br>
Gathering the forces necessary to create a death-servant is no simple task.  In doing so, I call a small fragment of Entropy upon myself in order to force out my own living essence and impose it on the bones on the floor.  As the pain of death roils in my blood, I take out a small pair of finger cymbals (much like the ones used by belly dancers in the brothels of the Neriak Commons), specially imbued for the purpose of such a conjuration.<br>
<br>
I extend my arm toward the mass of bones and chime the cymbals once, causing a sharp noise to reverberate throughout the room; my essence is unleashed upon the bones as they begin to coalesce and take form.  I chime the cymbals a second time; the essence of Entropy leaves my body and invades the skeletal form, giving it rigidity.  I chime the cymbals a third time; I invoke the name of this force of Entropy, giving it limited sentience.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jobaber,&quot; I whisper.  &quot;Come forth and serve me!&quot;<br>
<br>
The skeletal form stands and moves with a reddish-green balefire gleaming in its eyes.  &quot;Following you, Master,&quot; Jobaber replies.<br>
<br>
Pointing at the half-frozen Iksar child, I point at it and instruct my servant to move it to the granite altar in the center of the laboratory, which also serves as a laboratory bench.  &quot;Yes, Master,&quot; the skeleton lazily replies.  Jobaber hefts up the scaly mass and places it on the table.<br>
<br>
By now, the Iksar has awakened, but is paralyzed with cold and fear.  I place a clean white sheet over its body and face and begin to explain to him what is about to take place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fear not, little one,&quot; I tell the child.  &quot;This vivisection shall not take more than a few days time, and your release into Entropy shall tell us a great deal about the nature of the universe.&quot;  The Iksar whimpers slightly as I retrieve a rolling stand filled with medical instruments.  &quot;Now hold still.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every material subject that comes into my laboratory is another opportunity for me to observe and analyze Entropy in many of its myriad of forms.  Even as this Iksar's soul passes into the void, thanatology is advanced.  Yet, I cannot help but think that this is simply not enough to truly understand this great force that I persue.  After all, Entropy is not merely the death of a single being, or even the accumulated deaths of a string of beings, but the end of all things.<br>
<br>
After I am finished with this Iksar, I will have to go forth into the world and see how Entropy works in other things.  Perhaps a nation must die to further the work of thanatology.  We shall see.<br>
