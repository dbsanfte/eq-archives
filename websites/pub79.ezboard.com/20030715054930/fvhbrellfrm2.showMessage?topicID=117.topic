I am the Dark Elf Shadow Knight of the 10th Season known as Damia Darksky. I have come here on a mission. I would like to join the Harvest and help to spread the most anticipated rein of Innoruuk. Please do not send a lightborn, I simply can not accept a message from one of light skin...even if they are from the Harvest. Only for now...Maybe I will find the select lightborns that have joined the Harvest actually worthy of being under the command of Innoruuk's Chosen Ones. Good Evening Lord and Ladies.&quot;<br>
<br>
She bowed, turned on her heel, and left the room. She crept into the shadows silently, curling up on the floor to get some sleep while the Lords and Ladies of the Grange made their decision.<br>

Eyebrows narrowing slightly into a small frown.  Taking quill in hand, she begins to write in the harsh script that can only be hers.*<br>
<br>
Your disdain for those who walk in the glare of the light is noted, young knight.  I do believe that a bit of educating is in order though, since you are obviously not familiar with the Harvest itself.  No lightborn has ever, nor will ever claim leadership over any of the chosen.  Those who speak with and determine the worth of seeds will always be a Dread Overlord, unless you are somehow blessed with the presence of the Dire Overlord or one of the Triad.<br>
<br>
As for your acceptance of any message, what more message do you need than the fact that you draw strength from your hatred?  The Tillers and Harrowers have proven time and again their worth to our Father and the Harvest.  It is not for you to judge the worth of those who have already proven themselves to us.  That you question their presence amongst us, I find insulting.  Their is no need to apologize to them, since they know their place among the Chosen.  I wish for you only to understand what consequences your words have.<br>
<br>
Two other things of note, first do not address me ever again as a &quot;lady.&quot;  Secondly, there is no need to curl up on the floor like a savage from the frozen north.  Neriak has many fine inns.  To avoid staining your honor, I would urge you to utilize them.<br>
<br>
Now that I have had my say, seek out one of the Dread Overlords, Xareth, Ueudiinya, or myself.  We will guide you further concerning the Violent Harvest, as well as answer any other questions you might have.  <br>

She stands up, making her way to the Book of Seeds to see if anyone had responded to her request. Flipping through the pages, she finds the one with her script on it. Looking below her message, she notes a reply from one called Faeolin. She sits down, pulling the book towards her to read.<br>
<br>
Finishing quickly, she smiles slightly. 'Working with someone like her in the Harvest may prove to be a challenge.' she thought to herself as she grabbed a quill and opened a ink well. Flipping to the back side of the page, she set to work writing a response...<br>

<br>
My apologies, but I was told by one called Vresk, that you are to be addressed as &quot;M'lady&quot;. I am not questioning your authority, or anyone else's for that matter, it's just that I have never found the lightborn ones to be of much use. Sure, they make wonderful healers and all, but we have the ability to be Clerics ourselves...<br>
<br>
*Damia blushing, her mind returning to the remark about her sleeping on the floor...*<br>
<br>
Also, I'm sure Neriak has many fine inns, but I was not raised in a town like most. I was born in the wilderness and soon made an orphan. My parents, if they even deserve that title for their stupidity, ran off on a fool's errand and got themselves killed when I was only 2 years old. I had to live on my wits, and mind you, at my age, I didn't have many. I had to fight wolves for meals. I practiced hand to hand combat with skeletons that wandered and were stupid enough to cross my path. I *borrowed* their weapons, and trained myself.<br>
<br>
One day in my wanderings, I stumbled into a town, the one known as Freeport. Sad mistake. I almost got killed. Just my luck, a lightborn granted me the gift of the Spirit of the Wolf. After that incident, even though I owed that lightborn my life, I swore to never trust one again, for the one's in Freeport were after my blood. <br>
<br>
I often slept on the ground, not in a fancy inn, for back then I knew nothing of Neriak, where I would have been welcomed. All I knew of were the towns of the lightborn, who hated my kind with a fiery passion. So you see, Overlord Faeolin, I never was allowed the luxury of an inn. The other night I was just living the way I always had.<br>
<br>
I found Neriak only weeks after the Freeport incident. I was hunting for my dinner in the East Commonlands, when I ran into another Dark Elf. She was about my age, and she offered to bring me to her home. At the time, I was about 6. All I wanted was a meal, but she not only fed me, but let me stay with her. I was thankful, a nice warm bed was what I needed. Yet I never got to stay in an Inn. She gave me some gold and silver, and sent me on my way the next day. After that I hunted in the Nektulos Forest, and slept by the guards or in the Neriak Foreign Quarter. I saved my money up for armor and better weapons, not a place to stay.<br>
<br>
Now, Overlord Faeolin, I must close this. I have to go hunt for my supper.<br>

Decision made, she swaggers off, deeper into the Grange.* <p>Faeolin R'Danya<BR>

<br>
Overlord Faeolin, I did not mean to seem pert. Though working with you shall be a challenge, I am willing to take it, for my feelings in this aren't of importance. Please note that I know one of your ranks well. He is known as Daiunus Darkenvalor and has the title of Dread Harvester. He knows me best as Kildaili. Maybe you would like to fill him in on this, and see if he has any suggestions. He knows how difficult I can be. Just a thought...Good Evening.<br>

*Smiling slightly, Damia puts away her quill, closes the book and walks out of the room*<br>
