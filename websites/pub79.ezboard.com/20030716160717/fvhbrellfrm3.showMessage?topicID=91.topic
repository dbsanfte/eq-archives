Reaper of the Harvest<br>

Reply | Edit | Del All  a day of fishing<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Creapiing looked up from her desk as her assistant quietly walked in and dropped a new scroll upon the nearly finished work on her desk. Recognition crossed her face as she looked at the fresh seal upon the scroll. This information was something she had been waiting for all day. Cautiously, she removed the seal with her dagger and cast the red wax into the fire. Ominous crackling erupted and the smoke turned red and made a fiery dance upward.<br>
<br>
She eagerly read the contents of the scroll, and sweat beaded and dropped upon its words blurring them as she read. She reached for the pitcher of water on her desk only to find it empty for the second time this day. A racking cough hit her and she doubled over for a second, then straightened and motioned for her apprentice to fill the container.<br>
<br>
Payle had brought this terrible disease to Innoruuk’s chosen, but Mythral would be their salvation. The Mad One had forseen this in one of his alcoholic visions. Mythral’s release was the only way to know for sure the depth of the insanity caused by this dormant virus. This report would be the assessment of him, and would determine his ultimate fate. <br>
<br>
~we have followed Mythral noting his actions. He clearly has lost all mental facilities. He approaches every barbarian woman, calling them queen and shouts out that will rule Mistmoor. His wanderings seem to be random and not at all planned. Every short time he is forced to stop and find water, and he seems to be sweating in a most profuse manner. We await your orders.~<br>
<br>
Creapiing reached for parchment, and penned ~Take him now to the clerics in Neriak. He will be of no further use to us until after we explore the Crystal Caverns.~ She then removed a vial of dark red liquid and applied a seal to the scroll.<br>
<br>
She made a small motion, her apprentice scurried forward, snatched the scroll, and departed instantly.<br>
<br>
Creapiing looked about her office, her work for the day was done, stiffly she stood up, and walked over to her door, noting the blade of the silver shadows still stuck there. She reached for her fishing pole, ~it has been far too long~ she hurried to buy a few stacks of bait, and wished she had time to tie her own fishing flies. ~any chance to catch a few fish and break their necks is a good chance~ The Brightness of fires hurt her eyes and she clung to the shadows as she moved about the city. Down by the dock was a favorite spot where she could even catch fish with this inferior bait.. She reached the dock in record time and baited her pole and cast it out. <br>
<br>
Creapiing looked into the water, her fever burning bright, and dreamed of the coolness. ~woot! Fish on~ she pulled the flopping fish out and quickly broke its neck, watching its eyes glaze. The fish was so cool in her hand. Without a thought she pressed the cool body of the dead fish onto her burning forehead. ~ahhhhh! Much better.~<br>
<br>
Then she looked down and began to affix more bait to her line. As she did this, the dark shadowed water caught her eye. If the simple application of the fish brought her so much relief, how much more would come with immersion into the water. The deep dark color of the water seemed to call her as never before, the very ripples seemed to call her name. Creapiing stood, dropped her pole, and stripped off her armor. Looking at the depth of the water and the dark ripples upon it, she dove into the blackest part of the water.<br>
<br>
Instant relief filled her ravaged body. She swam down, into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Creapiing could not leave the water, she was driven in her delirium to stay in this place where she felt such relief. The last of her oxygen was gone and yet she could not make herself swim up to the surface where her gear lay. Slowly she drifting off into the dark comfort of the water, not caring if she lived or died, but focusing only upon the relief and pleasure the coolness and darkness brought to her.<br>

Khasirath  <br>
Thresher of the Harvest<br>
(3/7/01 6:46:13 pm)<br>
<br>
Re: a day of fishing<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Khasirath sat back from his desk with a deep sigh of frustration. Dread Harvester Raveneye had presented the Triad with maps and scouting reports from the Crystal Caverns in preparation for their hunt, but the Thresher could not focus on the text. He wiped the sweat from his brow and poured himself another cup of the herbal tea that Vhalshae had brewed for his cough. Though it helped some, he could still feel the cursed illness ravaging his body, making every muscle ache and his head pound.<br>
<br>
He could not bear this waiting. He wanted to be off on the trail of the rogue Anari. The Winnower had heard her in Highpass - the blasted Fier'Dal had even dared to taunt her! Khasirath was ever more grateful for his talk with Creapiing, for it was now clear that Anari was trying to draw him out in a blind fury. Painful as it was he forced himself to wait. Soon the time described in the Scrolls would come, and the Harvest would be free of Bertoxxulous' Curse. Then he and the Reaper would find her.<br>
<br>
A wolfish grin spread over his dry cracked lips at the thought of facing Anari. He remembered well the sweet taste of her blood and her hate when he and Kvariya had broken her. Facing her in battle would be far more delicious. She had hatred now, and thought she could use it as a weapon against him. But he had learned much and grown stronger within the Harvest and Innoruuk's Will. He would show her how little she truly understood of hate, and we would enjoy it more deeply than what he had done to her in the Arena.<br>
<br>
Glancing back down at the reports, Khasirath let out a soft growl. This was simply not helping. He quickly finished the last of his tea and slung his baldric over his shoulder. As he stepped out of his office he fastened on his light cloak. Outside his door stood Alartha, one of his two personal servants. The young Teir'Dal warrioress awaited any command or need of her master, and bowed her head respectfully when he came into sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am going for a walk. If anyone needs me, get their name and tell them I should return in an hour.&quot; Alartha clasped her fist to her heart in salute, her sapphire eyes full of concern. She could see how the curse wore at her master's strength, and she knew she was powerless to stop it.<br>
<br>
As Khasirath walked the streets of Neriak, he wished he had brought a heavier cloak. Despite the fact that the air of Neriak was always warm due to its proximity to Lavastorm, the fever made the air seem chill, and his face grew clammy. He wandered a roundabout route through the Commons, thinking perhaps to stop at the Bleek Fletcher. His quiver had been growing light, and he would need to be well prepared for the coming hunts. He knew without having to look that Dythos, his other servant, would be nearby. The young rogue almost always shadowed his master's path through the city. 'A double-edged blade, such loyalty,' thought Khasirath. 'I can be secure of his presence, but not my own privacy.' A small smile passed over his face as he thought of those dark and impish eyes guarding his back.<br>
<br>
As Khasirath passed the gateway that led to the docks, something out of place caught his eye - a crumpled pile of dark armour near the water's edge. At first he thought it might be a fallen warrior, perhaps some lightborne who stumbled too far into the city. But the distinctive folds and patterns of the Darkforge armour was quickly apparent. With a rising feeling of dread, he quickened his pace towards the armour, crouching down for a better look. Darkforge it was, sized and molded for a female Teir'Dal. And then he saw it pinned to the cloak - the guildpin of the Reaper of the Harvest. His eyes grew wide as he stood, scanning the area for any sign of her. He noted the fishing pole and pots of bait at the edge of the dock, and the small carcass of some silvery fish. The boards of the docks were wet from a recent splash.<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk, no!&quot; he mumbled in disbelief, frantically looking around. Trusting his instinct he flung off his cloak and dove into the deep water. His eyes were wide open he searched and searched, though his body soon began to shiver. The Thresher was a strong swimmer, having trained since he was young and Vlekk had demanded he go to the Ocean of Tears for siren scales. It was only the fact that swimming was so natural to him now that allowed him to continue, for his mind was too clouded by panic and illness to focus on such tasks. He circled around the pools and grottoes of stone, coming up for air only rarely, pushing his body beyond what he should.<br>
<br>
His ribs began to ache with the shivering, and the muscles were cramping in his legs as he rounded a boulder in the water. And there he found her floating face down, her white hair spread like a halo around her face. Gritting his teeth he swam to her side and rolled her over, supporting her carefully. Creapiing did not respond at all, and her eyes remained closed, but he could still feel the warmth of the fever burning beneath the clamminess of her soaked skin. Her brow sparkled where tiny silvery scales clung.<br>
<br>
Growling with the effort he lifted her waterlogged body onto the boulder and hoisted himself up beside her wild eyed. &quot;Reaper, can you hear me?&quot; he pleaded as he stroked her face, brushing her hair back.<br>
<br>
Did her eyes flutter a bit or was it his imagination? He could not tell if she was still breathing, and knew if she had no breath that his own powers could not revive her. The gifts of Innoruuk's Knights were only clumsily used for healing. He placed one hand over her chest, praying to feel it rise, but he felt nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk, you can NOT let her die this way!&quot; he cried, shaking his head. He leaned down and turned her head a bit to meet his own as he pressed his lips to hers, trying to breathe his life into her, pleading within himself for her to take his life, to live. Again and again he breathed into her, and suddenly she began to cough, water pouring up from her lungs. Khasirath rolled her to her side, helping support her as the spasms wracked her body. He drew on his hate and the Father's gift and poured his life-force into her, feeling himself shivering as violently as she was. The water danced and the cavern walls seemed to undulate around them, the darkness pressing in. Creapiing clutched at his arms as she tried to sit up, breathing in ragged gulps. Khasirath clung to her tightly as he knelt on the stone, his head pounding with the pain and weakness of giving his life to her. He feared he might not be able to stand at all.<br>

Re: a day of fishing<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Two bodies lay on a boulder, their skin as grey as the rock beneath them. The Thresher and the Reaper of the Violent Harvest, each too weak to even stand. The Thresher having impressed his own life force on the Reaper to keep her alive, and the Reaper barely clinging to life at all from her near drowning.<br>
<br>
Creapiing slowly came to an awareness. She felt the hard stone beneath her body and opened her eyes to see the Thresher of the Harvest by her side. Khasiraths body had an unnatural ashen hue. Too weak to even raise her hand, she said in a barely audible whisper ~you smell like fish~ before laying back and closing her eyes again<br>

<br>
Re: a day of fishing<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Vresk sat in the middle of the room, thick incense smoke filling his nostrils and expanding his mind. He felt a wave of calm and peace surround him. For a tidy sum, he had “permanently” rented this room in the middle of Neriak Commons. His home away from home.<br>
<br>
Though Vresk was highly adaptable, and had earned the respect of many in the Violent Harvest, the ways of the Softskins still bewildered him at times. It was pleasant for him to have this little piece of Kunark where he could find sanctuary from culture shock.<br>
<br>
As his meditation deepened, the monk’s mind slipped into a higher consciousness. Instinctively, his throat began to hum and chant in the ancient tongue of his people<br>
<br>
After several minutes his body relaxed even further, and the clouds in his mind separated. Images began to form, his inner consciousness providing him with the enlightenment he sought. Several minutes passed, with the monk not moving even to breathe.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the images stopped, and Vresk’s mind’s eye focused in on the picture before him. He saw two figures sprawled out on a rock near a body of water. Their limbs were akimbo, as if a child had thrown two dolls to the ground and this was how they lay. A red haze descended over the image, a sign of imminent danger. A sickly green aura surrounded the two, and Vresk recognized this as illness. And then the images were gone.<br>
<br>
The monk stood, jolted out of his deep meditation. His conscious mind recognized the rock as being very near his location in Neriak, by the border of the neighborhood known as the Foreign Quarter. Alarmed, but calm, Vresk knew that only an emergency to those he served could have pried him from his meditations.<br>
<br>
He grabbed his change purse and swiftly glided downstairs.<br>
<br>
---------------------------<br>
<br>
Once at the ground level, he located the barkeep wiping tables, preparing for the evening’s business. The Iksar approached from behind, waiting to be recognized. After 15 seconds, Vresk cleared his throat loudly, the urgency of his situation driving him to impatience.<br>
<br>
The barkeep nearly fell over at the sound, not having heard the monk’s soft footsteps. He did fall over completely when he saw the Iksar’s grisly image. “Oh deark Innoruuk!” he cried as he fell.<br>
<br>
Vresk, feeling bad for the old Teir’Dal, bent to help him up, but the man scrambled away from the ulcerous hand in alarm. “Whoah now! It’s okay,” he said, getting back to his feet. After a few moments of breathing deeply and repeating “I’m okay,” he finally settled a look on the Iksar.<br>
<br>
“Now listen here, ya scaly lizard!” he bellowed. “Ya can’t just go bargin up ta folks like that! Learn to make some noise or something, so people can hear ya comin’. Scared me half ta death ya did!”<br>
<br>
Vresk’s tail twitched in irritation. Here was a prime example of the Softskin’s confusing ways. The man was clearly upset because Vresk had approached unheard. Yet he was being chastised for “barging,” which the Iksar had learned was a way of saying that one was being obnoxiously noisy and rude. Besides, wasn’t it a Teir’Dal saying that the best knife was the one behind the back? Or was it the unseen dagger…? Vresk shook his head, trying to clear it of extraneous thought. He didn’t have time for this.<br>
<br>
“Forgive the intrusion on your work,” he said, bowing low. “But I have ssome tasskss that you will complete now.”<br>
<br>
The Teir’Dal looked at him half with rage at the audacity of the foreigner telling him what to do and half with pity at the obviously advanced stage the disease had eaten away at his body. “Now look here ya bleedin’ puss-ridden snake,” Vresk ignored the insult. He was used to being referred to as “snake” or “lizard” by this man, it seemed to be terms of affection almost. As far as the bleeding and the puss-ridden statement, both were true, so he saw no reason to be upset. “I have a thousand things to get ready for tonight’s business…”<br>
<br>
The barkeep trailed off as Vresk tossed a pouch at him. It jingled very satisfactorily in the hand. Frowning a bit at the weight, he untied the silk string tying it together and poured several coins into his hand. He gasped when he saw the number. “By Innoruuk man! There must be over 50 imperial platinum in this bag!”<br>
<br>
“One hundred to be preccisse,” Vresk hissed.<br>
<br>
The man blinked at the number. This was almost a week’s worth of business. “What do you need done?” he asked, making the pouch disappear.<br>
<br>
“Honorable Inkeeper, I require you to get together four pitcherss of your coldesst water. Thesse are to be sset in the room nexst to mine. Alsso in that room, you will take two wash bassinss, your finesst mind you, not the ssubsstandard fair you provide for foreigners like me, and fill them halfway with icce. Then you are to fill them the resst of the way with cool water. Are thesse insstructionss clear sso far? They musst be exsact.” The man nodded solemnly, too shocked to notice the comment about the quality of his services to the monk. “Good,” he said, pulling several vials from another pouch. “You will give thesse to your cook. I require two mealss prepared. Make it your finesst meat. Alsso, have the cook pour thesse vialss into 2 gobletss of goat’ss milk.”<br>
<br>
“What are these?” the inkeeper asked.<br>
<br>
“Ssarnak blood.”<br>
<br>
The inkeeper nodded solemnly, then narrowed his eyes in suspicion. “Ye ain’t plannin’ on bringin’ any more of yer kind here are ya?”<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
“Good, cuz one of ya around is bad enough. What, with yer bleedin’ all over and such. If not onna yer kind, then who?”<br>
<br>
“A pair of Teir’Dal nobless shall temporarily gracce thesse hallss. Pleasse, for your life, make sure you follow my insstructionss exsactly. Failure to do sso may ressult in their death. I do not believe THAT would be good for bussinesss at all.” With that, the Iksar ghosted out the door.<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
Vresk dove into the cool waters of Neriak Commons. Like all Iksar, his body was built specifically for swimming, and he slid as easily through the lake as he would on land. The monk revelled in the cool feeling of the water against the many sores and postules infesting his scales. While the Teir’Dal were affected by terrible fever and cough, he had been affected by a terrible wasting. From his recent bowel movements, his insides didn’t look much better than his outside.<br>
<br>
Within moments he arrived at the spot his meditations had led him to. Sure enough, laying there, gasping against each other, the Ambassador to Kunark found both the Reaper and Thresher wrapped around each other. Off to one side, Vresk noted another he did not recognize. He hovered nearby, but did not seem to be a threat.<br>
<br>
As he approached, he heard the Reaper whisper, “You smell like fish.”<br>
<br>
“Ssome would ssay I am a fish, Reaper,” he whispered back.<br>
<br>
He knelt beside the Thresher, knowing he had magics that would assist the three of them in getting back safely to the inn he had prepared. “Thresher,” he said as he nudged the shadowknight.<br>
<br>
“Hunh…” Khasirath responded.<br>
<br>
“Thresher Khassirath, Lord Innoruuk hass ssent me to retrieve you. You are to drain my sstrength for your own.”<br>
<br>
This seemed to trigger something within the Teir’Dal. Steeling himself, he managed to mutter the proper incantation. There was a small thunderclap, and both Khasirath and Vresk were surrounded with a red aura. The Iksar felt a small portion of his strength drain.<br>
<br>
Khasirath stood up, a grim, pained look on his face. “Ambassador, you look like Hell,” he said.<br>
<br>
“I imagine I do, Thresher. Though I have come for you nonethelesss. It iss not ssafe for the two of you to appear to your people in thiss sstate. If you will help me carry the Reaper, I have made reparationss for the two of you.”<br>
<br>
He turned to the one he did not recognize. “Will you help uss?” he asked simply.<br>
<br>

Thresher of the Harvest<br>

<br>
Re: a day of fishing<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Panting raggedly, Khasirath clung to both the rock and the Reaper, listening to the soft chattering of his own teeth as he inwardly cursed his impulsiveness. He had Creapiing, she was safe at the moment, but he had no way to get them back to the docks and ensure their safety.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Khasirath heard an unfamiliar voice from behind, &quot;Dark Knight of the Father, I know naught what has befallen your ally of the Harvest, but I would be honored to assist. You have it right I believe, it is not the healing magics of a Priest that is needed but the maledict force of the Dead.&quot; <br>
<br>
Khasirath turned his head unsteadily and looked up at the dark figure, most likely a noble like himself by the style of his garb and hair. The Thresher did not recognize the man, though there was something familiar about the angles of his face ... perhaps he was related to someone Khasirath did know. As he watched, the unknown Knight pulled on his gloves and knelt nearer to the Reaper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me aid thee, Brother. We will take her to the Masters of the Lodge. The unhallowed grace of the Father will awaken this fierce Knight, as she ought to be....&quot; <br>
<br>
Khasirath frowned, marshaling his own failing strength. &quot;I do appreciate your concern, Brother of the Dead, but the Lodge cannot help her, or me. Neither can the Spires. Only we of the Harvest can cure ourselves, but we must survive long enough to do so.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he spoke, the Reapers stirred for a moment, and he just barely heard her whisper, &quot;You smell like fish.&quot;<br>
<br>
Immense relief surged through him at hearing her voice, weak though it was, and a small smile spread over his face at the absurdity of what she'd said. <br>
<br>
Just then Khasirath felt a nudge, and a familiar sibilant voice said, &quot;Thresher.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hunh...&quot; he blurted, caught off guard as he had been so focused on the Knight and the Reaper that he had not heard the Iksar's silent approach. He shook his head in annoyance with himself for being so careless.<br>
<br>
“Thresher Khassirath, Lord Innoruuk hass ssent me to retrieve you. You are to drain my sstrength for your own.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath turned to look at the Ambassador more fully, seeing how the patches of pustules were spreading over the Monk's scaled flesh. Indeed he must be in great pain from it all, but he bore it silently, and had even come to help. Reaching deep to connect with his hatred, Khasirath whispered the incantations, and drew the Iksar's lifeforce into himself. He let out a hissing breath as he was almost overcome by the pleasure that always brought him, and the alien yet familiar 'taste' of the Iksar's life.<br>
<br>
Khasirath stood slowly as he looked Vresk over, hoping he had not weakened him too much. “Ambassador, you look like Hell,” he said.<br>
<br>
“I imagine I do, Thresher. Though I have come for you nonethelesss. It iss not ssafe for the two of you to appear to your people in thiss sstate. If you will help me carry the Reaper, I have made reparationss for the two of you.”<br>
<br>
Vresk turned towards the other Knight. “Will you help uss?”<br>
<br>
Khasirath looked back to the Knight with a nod, &quot;Your help would be greatly appreciated.&quot;<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Silently Dythos waited in the shadows on the docks, his heart hammering. His master had been gone for far too long. He crept to the edge of the water, near the pile of armour that had caused Khasirath to go rushing off looking for the Reaper. Dythos knew who she was, as he sometimes acted as Khasirath's scribe during meetings. He had a distinct feeling the Reaper disliked him immediately, so he tried to stay out of her way whenever possible.<br>
<br>
As a servant, Dythos knew plenty about staying out of the way, and also of staying unseen. From a very young age, he and Alartha had served Khasirath, and had been well trained by House S`Therik on how it was to be done. Both of them had grown very close to their master, who had always treated them well. In his heart, Dythos knew he would die for Khasirath if it was what his master asked or needed. There was simply no questioning his loyalty.<br>
<br>
But this? How best to help Khasirath? Dythos was not that good in the water, and did not know the pools and grottoes of Neriak like Khasirath did. The bathing pools of House S`Therik were as much swimming as he could handle. He probably wouldn't be able to find Khasirath or Creapiing. And the Reaper's armour! Dythos knew how valuable it was, and that it wouldn't be able to sit on the docks for long before someone would help themselves to the treasure. Khasirath had been unwell for some time, and Dythos was not sure he would be able to swim for this long. He couldn't just take the armour back to the House without knowing his master was alright.<br>
<br>
So the young rogue stood on the docks, trying to stay in the shadows, taking a step closer to the water than a step towards the armour and back in his indecision. He kept glancing back through the archway to the street, hoping someone he recignized as an ally of the House or the Harvest might walk by, so he could beg for their aid. And he also wanted to be on guard lest someone notice the Darkforge sitting unattended.  <br>
