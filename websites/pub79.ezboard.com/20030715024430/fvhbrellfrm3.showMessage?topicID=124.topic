The Unthinkable is Thunk. (*RP*)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
*ooc* I couldn't get my log of the event, but decided to approximate on the events of this past weekend and at least do it ICly. Hope you all enjoy.<br>
======================================<br>
<br>
The prophet, recently risen to the rank of Disciple within the Spires, muttered to himself. Why did Atoxus insist he leave this druid alone? All she wanted to do was the same as the rest of her fellow salamanders - ask why he wouldn't let their precious bard go. They kept speaking as if they thought he was some minion of Dread Overlord Xareth. They were fools one and all. Pravdameer was minion to nobody except for the Father of Hate. Granted, he held great respect for the Triad and the leaders of the Harvest, but it was the Father to whom he was committed, and the mission he had been given so long ago.<br>
<br>
The young prophet had come far in the intervening time - although many seemed to pass him by in prosperity and rank, he persevered. Atoxus was always there to stoke the fires of Hate within the young prophet, and these fires fed the flames of his devotion. Suddenly, yet again, the skies over the planes of the Overthere opened up, and spewed forth the rains from above. He screamed a curse to the skies, and could feel the accursed druid still nearby frowning at him. He decided to turn his flames towards her, and began to taunt her, to try and stoke the flames within her - at least then she would be somewhat more bearable.<br>
<br>
Just as he was about to say something to the young druid, he felt the power of hate surge through his arm and through his mace. It all seemed to happen in slow motion as the mace struck the rhino...<br>
<br>
The rhino began to roll to it's side in the death throws...<br>
<br>
The rhino's horn seemed to come out of nowhere towards his arm...<br>
<br>
His armor seemed to part as if something was baring his forearm...<br>
<br>
The horn sliced into the skin of his arm forming a deep gash…the world began to spin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pravdameer...&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophet groaned as things still seemed topsy-turvy, but slowly the form of Atoxus came into focus.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pravdameer!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want now?&quot; the young prophet asked. &quot;Are you responsible for that?&quot; he asked as he felt a burning in his arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed, fool - you have served the Father well - done as commanded. You have attained the rank of Disciple within the spires, you have mastered many of the skills set before you, and the father has rewarded your devotions by granting you yet another scar of sacrifice to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophet was surprised at that - none of the previous scars had felt like this. This one seemed...different somehow...it seemed to sear at his very soul. The 19 previous ones had not felt like this. As if reading his mind, and he very well might have been, Atoxus nodded and said, &quot;Indeed imbecile, this one _is_ different. It is with this one that you have earned the right to take on a family name, but as you were not raised within the walls of Neriak, the Father has commanded that I give you a family name at this time. From this day forth you are to be Pravdameer Pravdamorte - time will tell if you can live up to the meaning behind the name, fool.&quot;<br>
<br>
The messenger to the Father then reached out and laid a finger upon the prophet's forehead and the world spun yet again. When he came to, the young prophet stood up and felt the throbbing from the scar that would evermore adorn his arm. It reminded him who - and what - he was. He then left the druid behind as she looked at him with a mixture of curiosity and confusion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry, little salamander - I will take good care of your precious bard.&quot; Then he grinned a sadistically evil grin and added, &quot;Trust Me.&quot;<br>
<br>
He continued to run as he headed back home to Neriak to lay his new name upon the scrolls and records within. He was now Pravdameer Pravdamorte, Dread Harvester to the Violent Harvest, Disciple of Innoruuk, Bearer of 20 Scars of Sacrifice, Master Baker, Master Brewer, Master Imbiber, Master Potter, Master Smith, Master Compass, Master Swimmer, and Master Fisherman. Indeed, he had come far for one who was destined to be dead before his 10th scar. <br>
