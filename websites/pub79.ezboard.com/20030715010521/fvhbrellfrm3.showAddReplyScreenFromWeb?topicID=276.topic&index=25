Part 13.</span><hr size=1> A knock at her door awakened Tzanntiel around noon the next day.  One of the serving wenches explained through the door that she had a visitor.  Sitting up in the plain bed, Tzann told her to send them in.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later the door opened, and Tzann smiled at the Human Wizardess as she walked in.  &quot;I hope your travels went well,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Pulling off her cloak, the woman sat down on the edge of the bed, and nodded.  &quot;It wasn't bad.  I'm sorry if I kept you waiting here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a pleasant enough place to spend the night, don't fret about it.  Why don't you tell me what you have learned?&quot; Tzann said with a wide smile, stretching out under the blankets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, the Brood of Veeshan certainly had no hand in making this particular item.  The runes are not theirs, or even similar.  But they did recognize the basic theorems behind them.  Powerful temporal magics, designed to be permanent.  Not an easy thing to break,&quot; she replied.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel nodded, a slight frown creasing her brow.  &quot;Not easy, but possible?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Wizardess nodded, &quot;It should be, but they were not sure exactly how to go about it.  They say it is similar to the wards that used to bind the outcast Kerafyrm.  But those particular wards were bound to the four Warder dragons who guarded the Tomb.  So once the Warders were slain, the wards were weakened enough for Kerafyrm to break free.  In this case the spell is more directly tied into the materials of the collar.  But to destroy the collar while it is on someone would most likely harm, or possibly kill them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel rubbed her face for a moment, thinking hard.  &quot;Not good,&quot; she muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;They further theorized that there may be some way to weaken either the collar or the magics within it enough to open it temporarily.  But without the item to study directly, they could not divine the best way to do so,&quot; she added.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel looked up into the woman's eyes with a slight smile.  &quot;Well, that's hopeful news.  If I can't get any further on my own, perhaps I can bring it to them.  I would have to earn their respect first of course, but I'm more than willing to if it comes to that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling the Wizardess nodded.  &quot;Indeed.  I wish I could have found more for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann reached out and ran her hand down the woman's back slowly.  &quot;Don't worry about it.  You've helped a lot, especially by keeping my hopes up.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Wizardess smiled a little as she rested a hand on Tzann's leg through the blankets.  &quot;I wish I could stay, but I have to get back to my duties.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann squeezed her shoulder lightly.  &quot;I understand.  Take care, and let me know if you learn anything new.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I promise I will,&quot; she said as she stood up.  She began an incantation and moments later had disappeared into the portal she created.  Tzann blew her a kiss, then sighed.  She had hoped for better news than she had gotten, but at least it wasn't as bad as it could have been. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/03 5:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 14.</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel returned to Neriak the next day, and checked in with her contacts at the Library and the Tower of the Spurned.  Neither one had found anything.  Tzann thought it was probably because the books Shaede had were from their libraries.  She showed each one the books, and they agreed on the previous opinions, that there was no information about opening the collar.  As with the others, Tzanntiel left them with instructions to contact her if they found anything new.<br>
<br>
Next she returned to House S`Therik.  The stately manor house was quiet as she entered.  She was about to walk up to her sister's room when a servant stopped her in the hall.  He bowed as he handed her a sealed scroll, saying that it had been delivered the day before, but that they had not known where to forward it.  Apologizing for the delay, he bowed again and hurried off to his other duties.<br>
<br>
Tzann went into her room and closed the door.  Sitting at her writing desk she broke the seal on the scroll and slowly read it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dear Tzanntiel,<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The culling has returned, Innoruuk's word has reached me, and I am sure you know what I mean by this, for you have no doubt had something of the vision as well. The Grange has opened, and I dwell inside. Return to Innoruuk at haste, I await your arrival.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daiunus Darkenvalor<br>
Loyal servant to our Father</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Frowning, Tzanntiel read the letter once more.  She pondered what Daiunus meant by visions.  She had never had one herself, not a true vision like her sister and brother did.  She felt the Father's Hate keenly, ever since Anari had almost ended her life, but she was just not able to See as the others did.  She thought for a moment that she should not go to Daiunus.  She had so much work to do, and she was not certain it would be safe to be among so many ex-Harvesters.  Shaede had insinuated that others of their number had been involved in the plot against her brother.<br>
<br>
She sat and thought for a long while, but finally decided that she would go.  Something stirred deep in her gut the longer she considered the letter.  It was like the tension she felt when slinking through the shadows of Neriak, or out in the wilds and dungeons when she hunted and the warriors called out that the enemy approached.  Some part of her felt that call, that excitement, and she couldn't deny its lure.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel walked to the hearth in her room which was kept burning hot by the servants.  She tossed the letter into the flames, and watched it burn to ash, stirring it slowly with a poker to be sure it was completely destroyed.<br>
<br>
Next Tzanntiel went to Vhalshae's room.  As always the younger woman was meditating or praying, kneeling beside her bed.  She looked up as Tzann walked in, the slightest of smiles twitching at her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are closer, Tzanntiel.  I can feel it,&quot; Vhalshae said in her whispery voice.<br>
<br>
Tzann sighed deeply, &quot;I don't feel closer.  Every time I turn the news seems to grow worse.  Did those sketches help you at all?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae turned and looked at the wall beside her window.  All the parchments had been tacked up there, one next to the other.  She nodded, &quot;In some ways, yes.  I sense the mystery in them, but I cannot quite see the solution.  Those runes are the ice and amber I felt.  We must learn how to thaw them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a secret I've had no luck in unearthing, Vhal.  I'm starting to doubt the answer exists anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae was standing in front of her sister in an instant.  She grabbed Tzann's chin in a fierce grip, forcing her to look deep into her endless black eyes.  &quot;Never doubt, Tzanntiel S`Therik,&quot; she hissed.  &quot;Do not dare to doubt the Father's Will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann flinched at the pinching grip and the venomous words, but she did not try to pull herself free.  &quot;I'm sorry Vhalshae.  I just don't know where to turn now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae released her sister's face with a look of disgust.  &quot;To your faith, dear sister.  Perhaps you need to spend more time in prayer than in your drinking houses scrabbling after scraps with those rats.  The Father will provide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, Tzanntiel turned away from Vhalshae, lost in thought.  &quot;I will try, Vhal.  It doesn't come as easy for me as it does for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are the Father's daughter, Tzanntiel.  Just as I am.  Stop doubting and go do what needs to be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann walked out slowly, feeling more uncertain than ever.  She looked back just as she was about to shut the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soon, more than a month, but less than two, our Matron will bear her newest and last child, Tzanntiel.  Be certain you are ready, or the opportunity may have passed,&quot; Vhalshae whispered as she settled back down to the floor, running a fingertip across the symbol of Innoruuk she wore around her neck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/03 9:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 15.</span><hr size=1> Daiunus' meeting was the next evening.  Tzanntiel spent the day at House S`Therik, but kept to herself.  She didn't feel like talking to her siblings or cousins, or even her favorite playthings among the servants at the moment.  She tried to pray, as her sister had suggested, but her thoughts would not be still enough for her to concentrate on the litanies.  Growing agitated, she paced her rooms, frowning.  &quot;What does Vhalshae know of what I do and how I do it&quot;, she thought.  &quot;Prayer may solve her problems, but not mine.  I am of the Ebon Mask.  We find our answers in the shadows, down in the dirt and the blood.  Kneeling on marble floors is all well and good for the Prophets, but not the stealthy Eyes of the Father.&quot;  Silently she resolved to do whatever she had to, but she would do it in her own way.<br>
<br>
&quot;My eyes are the Eyes of Innoruuk, the seeds of Hatred shall be sown amongst all,&quot; Tzanntiel muttered softly.  It was the section of the Litany of Purpose spoken by the Rogues of the Ebon Mask as part of one of the high rituals of the Spires.  As a youth the words hadn't meant much to her, but now she understood and savored each word.<br>
<br>
When Tzanntiel entered the Grange the next evening, she felt a chilling calm over the hate that burned within her.  She couldn't recall a time when she had felt so directed.  She paused at the gate, looking over the pair of Trolls who guarded the door, outfitted in piece-mail armour that she recognized.  It had been re-fitted for the large creatures from the armour of the Teir'Dal guards who used to serve the Grange in the time of the Harvest.  She raised an eyebrow as she walked past them, wondering what other changes and surprises the once-Thresher had in store for the meeting.<br>
<br>
More Trolls patrolled and guarded the halls, looking awkward and uncertain of their new duties.  One noticed her wandering and directed her to one of the larger meeting rooms.  Inside she found Daiunus, and more than a dozen other people.  It seemed the spirit of the Harvest still moved many hearts pure in hate.  Some of the people she recognized, others she'd never seen before.  A few kept to the shadows so well she could not even identify them.<br>
<br>
The meeting itself was fairly brief as such things go.  Daiunus explained his vision, and what he planned to create.  Some of those gathered seemed uneasy, they argued for the new company to be more like the Harvest had been.  But Tzanntiel could see the wisdom of what Daiunus had planned.  The Harvest was over.  If they simply tried to recreate what the Prophecies had wrought, they would fail.  This new group, Hate's Culling he called it, would be something different, founded in the new age the Harvest had prepared for Norrath.  Tzanntiel also liked the idea of the non-Teir`Dal having more freedoms that they had had in the Harvest.  She herself used many contacts and allies from outside the Chosen Race, and she knew how capable they could be when given free rein.  By the end of the meeting, everyone present was in agreement, and loudly supported Daiunus' new guild.<br>
<br>
As Tzanntiel left the Grange, she felt buoyant, as if the secret weights she bore had been set aside for a while.  No one had mentioned her brother during the meeting, and she felt that was a good sign.  If one or more of the conspirators had been there, they must have no idea that Khasirath had been removed from their hiding place.  Though it may feel like time was growing shorter, no one was directly opposing her efforts in any way she could divine.<br>
<br>
Leaving Neriak behind, Tzann returned to Shadow Haven.  Her holiday was over, and it was time to return to work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
