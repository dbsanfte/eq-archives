(Kats Culling Raid)</span><hr size=1> It was time to begin gathering the forces. Time to start the planning. In order to take the city out they would need to work as one. Like a well oiled tinkered machine. They would need to move swiftly, and with stealth so as not the alert the enemy.<br>Kat sat at her small table, Nospiratus across from her. Between them lay the map. It was well marked by them both. <br>A descision was at hand. Should they first take out the northern part of the city? Or begin from deep within the southern part. Like a wound that festered from the inside out. <br>&quot;If we move against the north first. There's a chance that one will make it to the south to warn of the coming attack. Giving them time to refortify themselves. However if we come from within and work our way out.. this point here could become a bottleneck.&quot; Kat pointed to the narrow ally they would have to go through to reach the north. <br>&quot;Someone could slip past us and warn the north, They could then set up their ambush and bottleneck us in here.. Picking us off one at a time.&quot;<br>&quot;My thoughts are to take out the North side first.. then disappear into the sewers instead of coming through this alley. The imbeciles would never think to watch for us there. We could either battle to this point here, where we had held our first foray? Or, we could use stealth to reach this point and with subterfuge slowly draw them into our web.&quot;<br>She fell silent then looking up at him and waited for his input. &quot;We must do this soon Nospiratus, for this child will not wait till we are ready.&quot;<br>Nospiratus nodded to her words, from his silence she knew he was mulling over all the aspects of this campaign. &quot;Word has reached me that Sir Lancelot will prove a daunting foe to us. Do we allow him to live Ma Vie? To take him we'll need our strongest warriors. And many of them. He has developed a strong immunity to all forms of magics. And his bite*,&quot; Nos shook his head,&quot; is ten times worse than his bark.&quot; <br>Kat nodded at his words, &quot; This m'own we'll need to decide at the moment. It depends upon how many high ranking warriors we are able to bring with us. I would think those who know the way of discipline** will be needed to take him out. We'll also need clerics set up in a heal circle*** to continually keep the warrior who has his attention alive, till said warriors discipline is spent. At the same time.. we'll need one or two groups to handle any allies who may come to assist him.&quot;<br>Nospiratus nodded at this, &quot;Aye Ma Vie, this will be no easy foe. We'll need to call not only upon the Chosen, but all our allies as well.&quot;<br>&quot;Aye,&quot; she responded. &quot;Should we call others into our little planning session? Perhaps Vresk, Daiunus, Faeolin and Tzlar can shed some light upon this?&quot;<br>Again he nodded, &quot;Aye them and Kasirath, Shaede and Zirrix as well.&quot; <br>&quot;Aye m'own. We'll need all of them, if we are to successfuly take this city. And by Innoruuk's black heart. I mean to see Qeynos fall!&quot;<br>&quot;Daiunus and Khasirath, i'm sure will be able to perhaps persuade our allies in joining us Ma Vie.&quot; Nos reassured her. &quot;That city will fall, for Innoruuk, and.. for us.&quot; <br>She smiled at his words then stepped to the door to summon a servant. Word was sent then to those named to join herself and Nospiratus in confrence.<br>&quot;Have you decided Ma Vie, what will be left standing?&quot; He asked her softly as she returned to sit beside him. &quot;Yes m'own, the bards guild, here.. &quot; She pointed to the spot on the map, &quot;It is out of our way, they shall be left to live. To tell of the Fall of Qeynos. To warn others that the reckoning is at hand. They will herald our deeds for years to come. But, &quot; she smiled up at him then, &quot; They will also be the ones to shelter our child. From them he shall learn many things. With them he will find sanctuary.&quot; Nos nodded to her words, his hand moving to give her own a gentle squeeze. <br>&quot;When the others arrive Ma Vie, let me handle them. You are not exactly a diplomat, &quot; he chuckled softly as she grinned impishly at him. They both fell silent then waiting.. for the others. <br><br><br>OOC notes<br>* Lancelot is said to quad for 300-500  and is completely immune to magic of any kind.<br>** the discipline referred to here is the defense disc. It is my belief that if we have at least 4-5 warriors with this, and they take turns popping off their discipline and taking agro during the time they have their discipline going. We might be able to wear Lancelot down. Mean time all other melee not part of the MT cycle will beat on Lance from behind being careful not to draw his attention (agro).<br>*** The heal circle for those of you who've never experianced one will be tasked to keeping the main tank (the one using his discipline) alive. They will chain heal this tank until said tank's discipline is done and the next tank steps up and takes agro by popping his disc. <br>I am of firm belief that using this method we can defeat Lancelot. If however we dont have the required tanks and healers we'll have to skip him all together. As for the rest of the healers, clerics and such they will be tasked to keeping the non-MT's alive and working. <br>This raid will by no means be small. I predict that we'll need at least 6-8 groups to be successful. I hope everyone can attend this. I would like to set up for it for Friday the 17th of May at 7pm central time. If this time needs to be changed i need to know asap. In giving this raid nearly a months time I hope it gives everyone time to plan for it. G'day! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ushaedewavecaller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaede Wavecaller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Overlord</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/02 10:41:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/shaede.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Qeynos renewed.

(Kats Culling Raid)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Never does a star grace this land with a poet's light of twinkling mysteries, nor does the sun send to here its rays of warmth and life. This is the Underdark, the secret world beneath the bustling surface of the Forgotten Realms, whose sky is a ceiling of heartless stone and whose walls show the gray blandness of death in the torchlight of the foolish surface-dwellers that stumble here. This is not thier world, nor the world of light. Most who come here uninvited do not return. <br>Thos who do escape to the safety of their surface homes return changed. Their eyes have seen the shadows and the gloom, the inevitable doom of the Underdark.&quot;<br>-- R.A. Salvatore (part of the prelude in the Dark Elf Trilogy)<br><br>She paced from window to table, waiting ever waiting it seemed. Her gaze came to rest upon the dully lit courtyard below. No, this was not Neriak. The city of the dark elves. This was Katta Castellium. Their second home. <br>They had worked hard to gain favor with the denizens of this twilight city. Had been finally granted a room in the home of Nathym Illuminious. It was here that they had begun to put together their plans for the invasion of Qeynos. <br>She imagined it would take those summoned days to reach them. Some would need to enter the city under the cloak of stealth. While others would be able to boldly walk the streets. <br>A soft chuckle from the hearth drew her impatient attention. &quot;They will come Ma Vei.&quot; Nos comforted her from his seat near the fire. A book was open in his lap. He had been studying it for some time though as yet had not shared what he learned from the old tome. It was not in Kat to pry.<br>Her hands went to absently massage the dull ache in the small of her back as her gaze returned to the courtyard. Her mind reeling with so many things. The potential fall of the city she had long despised. The coming birth of their child. Their past and future collided. &quot;Aye,&quot; she whispered softly in reply, &quot;They will come.. &quot; She missed it, their home, Neriak. She missed the darkness, the shadows... the hatred. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukatarinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katarinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/3/02 3:17:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Qeynos renewed.
