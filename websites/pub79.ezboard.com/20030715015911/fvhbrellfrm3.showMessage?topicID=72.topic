The crucible (origin RP)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Innoruuk heaved his slim form out of his chair and awkwardly slunk of to his Maestro of Rancor's concert hall. There, not far from the Maestro and his beautiful organ, was the cauldron of souls where his task today lay. <br>
<br>
&quot;Play something suitably draconian and somber for me, my Maestro...I have work to do before those annoying insects come back here to interrupt our corporeal work again.&quot; Innoruuk knew that it was only a matter of time before a gang of those self-important hoodlums would storm his sanctum, and to get them to leave he would have to allow his physical form to be defeated yet again. Whatever left him in peace for a bit, he could stand the percieved defeat. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk looked deep into the Well of Souls, seeing the swirling, writhing mass of Teir'Dal within. Spying the one form he was seeking, he lifted a huge ladle from a rack next to the Well and dipped it into the intertwined forms. Cackling gleefully to himself, he lifted the ladle and poured it's contents into a nearby flute. Lifting the slender glass to the light, he savored the blood-red highlights within the amber fluid. <br>
<br>
Concentrating his Will, Innoruuk forced the awareness in flute to awaken from its slumber. <br>
<br>
&quot;My child, it is time we spoke. You have a choice, and I must tell you of the consequences of your choice.&quot; <br>
<br>
Within the flute, a presence seemed to resonate, and a voice heard only by the Holy Father spoke: &quot;Yes, Father, what do you wish of me?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I know you felt that your pain was at an end. You had been such an exquisite tool to me, I was inclined to give you that which you most desired...Even now I have a form here, a Teir'Dal woman who would be the perfect receptacle for your spirit. She is weak in will, and has done much harm to all my childrens' kind with her work so far, but one such as you would solve all of that. Her form is strong, and I think it would suit your desires for existence. This marriage of form and Will would suit both of our purposes, in fact.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Father,&quot; the voice within the fluid form spoke, &quot;Your reward is generous, and suits me nicely. You are indeed a just and rewarding Father.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;BUT...there is another path. I will not dictate your choice, child, it is for you to make. Such are the laws of the cosmos and beyond even my ability to change. I must, however, tell you of events of late revolving around your old self...&quot; <br>
<br>
-**********-&lt;edited text, not for public knowledge ;P&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Grave events, child. This all bodes ill for all of my children. But, something can be done, and I think you know what that is. You may choose to enjoy my reward for you, and enter this new shell. Kaeryn will be a worthy host for you, and as one of my Knights of Hate you will well be able to continue my work. But there you will be consumed with growing strong, and your past life will be closed to you. Or I could return you to your own form, and you could take a more direct hand in these events. If you choose that, you will still have the same concerns which ended your life. You will have to come to terms with them, and understand that each of my children have abilities. You will have to live with your dissatisfaction. How do you choose, daughter?&quot; <br>
<br>
Within the glass, colors swirled and shifted. A terrible longing eminated from the fluid, and a feeling of profound sadness touched Innoruuk. &quot;Yes, my child, I know. but you MUST make your choice.&quot; Innoruuk's fingers stroked the surface of the flute lovingly, but their caress did nothing to quiet the maelstrom of color and emotion seething within. <br>
<br>
Outside, a commotion was gathering. The Maestro's music intensified, signalling the coming clash which would be felt on many fronts. Voices could be heard, screaming in both pain and victory. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hurry, daughter! Time grows short! Make your choice!&quot; Innoruuk howled, as the gates of his home were rent asunder by tiny forms. <br>
<br>
Within the glass, the being once known as ****** swirled and swelled, desperately wanting to avoid such an unsavory decision. The Maestro's music stopped suddenly, as he was swarmed by nearly a score of small forms, all screaming war-crys. <br>
<br>
As the tiny creatures turned toward Innoruuk, he clutched the glass tightly in his huge hand...and squeezed. Thousands of glass shards flew in all directions. Neither Innoruuk nor the pathetic band of mortals assaulting his physical form paid any attention to them. The liguid form once known as ******* splashed to the floor of Innoruuk's castle. Her will was momentarily locked with that of Innoruuk. Pain lanced through her as she felt the sting of the blades piercinf Innoruuk's hide. <br>
<br>
The soul of ****** burned brilliantly, for a moment distracting the mortals' assault of her Father. <br>
<br>
And she chose.... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Kaeryn...Kaeryn!! Wake up, child!&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly, consiousness rose from the gloom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where...where am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're still in the Fancy, girl, where else? Now get up and get back to work! Molon will be here any moment now, and you know how he hates us to lounge around when customers are waiting!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeryn considered her dream, The Holy Father had come to her, and told her &quot;Here, in my crucible, I will burn away your weakness and impurity. You shall have the best part of my spirit from a fallen cousin, and you shall be my Tool.&quot;, how could she argue with her creator?<br>
<br>
&quot;No. No, Jivas, I will not get back to work. Nor shall I ever set foor in this place again. I am through here. I will go and get my things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you insane, Kaeryn???&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeryn strode by, ignoring her former friend's look of complete bafflement. She proceeded to her small room and pulled a few meager possessions from under her pallet. Steps could be heard coming down the hall. Angry footsteps.<br>
<br>
The door burst open. &quot;Girl, if you know what is best for you, you will paint your lips and get back to work now. Noone leaves me in this place, NO ONE. No go before I truly get angry.<br>
<br>
Kaeryn paused and considered again the vision she had been through. She looked at her employer's face and thought of the tragic fate which had first brought her to work in this place. She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Molon. And don't make me repeat myself. I go to the halls of the dead, to study under the knights there. It is the will of the Father. Get out of my way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will of the Father? Why, you wouldn't know His will if it reached up and bit you on your ass, you little strumpet!&quot; Molon reached out to grasp Kaeryn's arm, to hold her at bay in this place where he controlled her. <br>
<br>
She whirled on him and placed her palm on his chest. Brilliant light filled the room, and Molon T'Plith screamed.<br>
<br>
Kaeryn looked at her hand in wonder, and then slung her carisack over her shoulder. The first of the Father's promised gifts had manifested. More would follow, she was sure.<br>
<br>
She set out for the lodge of the dead, and for her training. Ahe would have to contact the one known as Kiros e'Kieron, for her creator had tasked her to stand at his side when the time of the judgement was at hand for the light-dwellers. <br>
