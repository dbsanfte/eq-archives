-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Khasirath finds Silverstarr behind the waterfall in Neriak Commons.<br>
You snarl meanly at Silverstarr.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'eep!'<br>
Silverstarr runs deeper into the tunnels.<br>
Khasirath steps out from the waterfall and finds Saludin near the Commons enterance.<br>
You say, 'Why are you here, wurm?'<br>
Saludin says, 'Me? Here? How did I get here?'<br>
Khasirath sneers.<br>
You say, 'What other wurm dirties my city?'<br>
Saludin says, 'Just getting out a wood elf that died from your guards'<br>
Saludin points at Windam.<br>
You say, 'Lies do not become you. You are here for the girl.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Girl? What girl?'<br>
You say, 'I see you are missing one eye. Does it make you completely blind?'<br>
Saludin says, 'No, it doesn't'<br>
You say, 'Then you must think me stupid. I do not take insults well.'<br>
Saludin says, 'I wish not to insult you'<br>
You say, 'How did that one die?'<br>
Saludin says, 'She was walking around with inviso, and it ran out'<br>
You say, 'Then do not insult my intelligence by acting as if I do not know why you and your kind are here.'<br>
You say, 'And why was she in Neriak invisible?'<br>
Saludin says, 'She is in this place invisoed or she will be killed by your men'<br>
Khasirath sighs in frustration.<br>
You say, 'And what is the reason she risked coming here into this place where her life was in danger?'<br>
Saludin says, 'Here... you go on of whatever you were doing... I'll go on for whatever I was doing'<br>
You say, 'Nay.'<br>
Saludin says, '*sighs* Silver'<br>
You say, 'Indeed. Why try to hide the truth I already told you I knew?'<br>
Silverstarr feels sick.<br>
Saludin says, 'Then why would you ask?'<br>
You say, 'To see if you would tell the truth or try to lie.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Thats very smart'<br>
You say, 'I like testing the honor of those who might prove to be my enemies.'<br>
Silverstarr says, '*sniffles* Saludin?'<br>
Saludin says, 'You choose your words well'<br>
Saludin says, 'Silverstarr? where are you?'<br>
Khasirath smirks.<br>
You say, 'Behind the waterfall last I saw her...'<br>
Silverstarr whines pitifully.<br>
Saludin says, 'I must be on my way'<br>
Saludin goes behind the waterfall, Khasirath follows.<br>
Saludin says, 'Silver!'<br>
You smirk mischieviously at Silverstarr.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'aCK!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'go away!'<br>
You say, 'Leaving us so soon, dear?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'GO AWAY!'<br>
Silverstarr backs away down one of the tunnels, keeping Saludin between herself and Khasirath.<br>
Saludin says, 'Yes, I am afraid Dinner is over'<br>
You say, 'This is my home. Who are you to determine my actions?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you didn't bring that horribe priest, did you!'<br>
Saludin says, 'No! I didn't!'<br>
You say, 'He is only trying to help you, dear.'<br>
Saludin says, 'I need you to get out of this place!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'not him, you Inkie.'<br>
Saludin says, 'And for you, Khasirath... Let us pass'<br>
You say, 'I meant the priest. The Prophet, in truth. He was trying to help you.'<br>
You say, 'You interrupt delicate procedures to help her. You put her in far greater danger than you know.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Her being with you is dangerous enough!'<br>
Khasirath shakes his head.<br>
You say, 'There is much you do not understand. In truth I only know bits of it.'<br>
You say, 'I am no Prophet.'<br>
Saludin says, 'That is true'<br>
Saludin says, 'But I am afaid it is our turn to help Silver'<br>
You say, 'But I know the Prophet is trying very hard to help her. Taking her away now could seal the curse upon her.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Khasirath, understand that we are helping Silver out as very hard as you are'<br>
You say, 'I do believe your intentions, warrior. She is your guildsister, and I am sure that means much. But you must trust that we also seek her cure, and have made great steps. This is a delicate process.'<br>
Saludin says, 'It is, and if you would just be nice enough to let us help, we could help her as well'<br>
Khasirath shakes his head.<br>
You say, 'It seems you do not hear my words, only your own desires.'<br>
You say, 'If you take her now, yuo will hurt her far more than you realize.'<br>
Saludin says, 'How? Us Dragons can help save her'<br>
You say, 'So you say... Why were you not able to help her before the Prophet brought her to Neriak to help her?'<br>
Saludin says, 'She didn't tell us the curse back then'<br>
Saludin says, 'At least i didn't know about it'<br>
You say, 'And why do you think that is? Perhaps even she knows the cure does not lie with the Dragons.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Why do you plan on helping a person like Silver?'<br>
You say, 'I am here to help the Prophet. His reasons are his own. I have helped him many times in the past.'<br>
Silverstarr cringes.<br>
Saludin says, 'Then let me take Silver and the Dragons can reason with the Prophet'<br>
You say, 'The Prophet's procedures could be ruined if you take her. Then she will be beyond his help.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Khasirath, she needs to see the sun light again, if you keep her traped in here, she will become one of you'<br>
Khasirath sighs softly.<br>
Silverstarr sniffles.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'don't say that....'<br>
You say, 'You wish to condemn her to the curse then...'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't want to be a dark Inkie!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'go away!'<br>
Saludin says, 'You won't Silver'<br>
Windam walks in invisible.<br>
You say, 'Hail Windam.'<br>
Windam says, 'Hail Khasirath'<br>
Windam drops invisibility.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'go away, inkie!'<br>
You say, 'Silverstarr, I know you do not comprehend what the Prophet has been doing, but he truly is working to end your curse.'<br>
Windam says, 'Sil! Are you alright?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'that one jsut hurt me a lot!'<br>
Saludin says, 'We will know when we get poof'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'that Prophet. i hate him!'<br>
Khasirath tosses his weapons and shield into his pack, an annoyed look on his face.<br>
You say, 'There, child. I have put away my weapons. I shall not harm you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'GRR! i don't like you either!'<br>
Windam frowns.<br>
You say, 'You do not even know me, Silverstarr.'<br>
Windam says, 'I think he's telling the truth Sil.. they're trying to help you'<br>
Saludin says, 'For the spells you have power for, I still won't let Silver get near you'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't want too, either! that's what pravdameer said!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Wait...'<br>
Saludin says, 'Who are you?'<br>
You say, 'I am the Thresher of the Harvest.'<br>
You say, 'Long ago I was the Emissary of the Flame of Hate.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he's one of their head honchos.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'and he's mean!'<br>
Khasirath smirks with a chuckle.<br>
Saludin says, 'Thanks for pointing that out to us, Silver'<br>
You say, 'Why do you call me mean, Silverstarr? I have never even set eyes on you before.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'just make him go away!'<br>
Windam says, 'Silver.. I think they're trying to help you..'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you haven't. but everyone of you i have is mean!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Windam... You THINK they are helping her... you don't KNOW if they are helping her'<br>
You say, 'We are. I know the Prophet isn't big on explaining his actions, so he may not have thought to explain why he was doing those things to you.'<br>
You say, 'But his intent is to help you, and end this curse.'<br>
Windam says, 'I do know though.. They know the cure'<br>
Saludin says, 'How long do you think you can get rid of this curse?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'that crazy priest kept doing weird experiments. and he kept talking to himself. what kind of help is that?'<br>
Windam says, 'As do I. '<br>
Silverstarr feels sick.<br>
You say, 'I wish I knew, Warrior. Only the Prophet Pravdameer has that information.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Then I would love to meet him face to face in a meeting'<br>
You say, 'He speaks not to himself, but to one who speaks for the Father.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'don't bother. that one doesn't give straight answers.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he talks to himself!'<br>
You say, 'I wish he were here so that you might.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i think he's crazy.'<br>
You say, 'Many think Prophets are mad. But his madness is that of divine wisdom.'<br>
At some point Windam leaves (sorry I can't find the exact place.)<br>
Silverstarr says, 'blech. i don't believe that.'<br>
You say, 'You are not a Prophet. I know two. And I have seen the power of their Prophecies.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Silverstarr... We want the best of you, so. Untill I get a meeting for the Prophet Prav. I think you should stay here untill then'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'WHAT?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'now you're crazy!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Look! I don't want you getting sicker!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i'll just die here.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Ok then, I'll take you with me out of here'<br>
You say, 'We will not let you die, Silverstarr. You must believe that.'<br>
Silverstarr says, '..... no.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i won't believe it.'<br>
Saludin says, 'I think it is safe that I take care of Silver untill I get that meeting with Prav'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'huh?'<br>
You say, 'No. If you take her, you will interrupt what he is doing. His work may never be recovered.'<br>
Silverstarr snarls meanly at Khasirath.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't wanna stay!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Then make up a meeting quick enough that that won't happen!'<br>
You say, 'I do not know if her being gone from his rooms so long hasn't already ruined the process!'<br>
Saludin says, '*sighs* It doesn't seem I can reason with you...'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i'll never go back there! he has weird stuff laying around all over!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Look, I'll make you a deal. You keep Silver, but you must make up a meeting with Prav with me'<br>
Saludin says, 'And only keep her for a period of time!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'Sal! don't leave me here!'<br>
You say, 'His methods are unfamiliar to you is all.'<br>
You say, 'I will contact Pravdameer and arrange a meeting as soon as possible.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Thank you'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you wouldn't do that. you wouldn't!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'don't you DARE leave me!'<br>
Silverstarr turns an icy glare upon Saludin.<br>
Saludin says, 'Now, Silver. I have to.... Live today, reason tomorrow'<br>
You say, 'We all want your cure, Silverstarr. Your friends know where you are.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but... '<br>
You say, 'You shall not die here. I promise you that.'<br>
Saludin says, 'You are strong! You can make it!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but they don't have to deal with this horrible place!'<br>
Silverstarr sniffles.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i can't believe you're deserting me, Sal...'<br>
You say, 'If things go well you will not have to remain much longer. You must try to help the Prophet with his work, so that he can help you.'<br>
Saludin says, 'I am not deserting you, I am giving you a chance to live'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'are not!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Are too!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'are not!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Are too!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'are not are not are not!'<br>
Khasirath stifles a chuckle, rubbing his nose and lowering his eyes a moment.<br>
Saludin says, 'Hmph...'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you're mean, Sal....'<br>
Silverstarr sniffles.<br>
Silverstarr cries.<br>
Saludin says, 'Silver, I don't want you to die. And I know our people wouldn't like it'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i know, but... '<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but they won't really help! they just like to torture!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Look, Silver. I can promise you this... In the end, we will make it thro, you will be outside enjoying your life'<br>
Saludin says, 'What kind of torture have they done to you so far?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i'll be dead!'<br>
Saludin says, 'No you won't!'<br>
You say, 'You will not die.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i haven't seen the sun! i've been stuck in a little room for a long time, and the crazy preist jsut hurts me!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he does weird experiments.'<br>
Saludin says, 'How does he hurt you?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'funny looking little tools and spells!'<br>
Saludin says, '*sighs*'<br>
You say, 'He is trying to determine the cause and therfore the cure of your curse. His methods are simply unfamiliar to you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't like it!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Khasirath, try making sure that ya'll be easier'<br>
You say, 'Many doctors know that to heal sometimes one must hurt. Have you ever had to have a broken bone set?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'GRR!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'no. and i don't want anything broken, either.'<br>
You say, 'I will talk to the Prophet, as I said.'<br>
Saludin says, 'Silver! Please. If you stay her for another day or two, I'll be with a meeting, and we will all work out a plan'<br>
You say, 'When he gets deep into his work he often forgets to tell his patients why he is doing certain things.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i refuse! don't leave me!'<br>
Saludin says, 'Silver... It is for my interest for you to live... I am sorry...'<br>
You say, 'Silverstarr... Do you want this curse to run its course? Or do you want to fight it?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i would rather die in freedom, than live here.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'it's too far gone! that blue skin is all over me!'<br>
Khasirath sighs in frustration.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'and i feel sick all the time.'<br>
Saludin says, '*sighs* Silver... I promise that I will get you free when I am done with Prav'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'kill him!'<br>
You say, 'If you work with the Prophet instead of fighting him, he may be able to reverse the effects you have already suffered. That is our hope.'<br>
Saludin says, 'I cannot...'<br>
Saludin says, 'I must leave now, Silverstarr... You will make it'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'Sal!'<br>
Saludin leaves.<br>
Silverstarr backs down the tunnel away fron Khasirath.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'go away!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'don't take me back there!'<br>
You say, 'Silverstarr, I just want to help you be cured.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'don't believe you.'<br>
You say, 'How could I prove my words?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'by letting me go?'<br>
Silverstarr looks hopeful.<br>
Khasirath shakes his head.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'awww.'<br>
You say, 'I cannot do that.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'meanie!'<br>
You say, 'If I want to help you I cannot let you go.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't want to see that crazy one again!'<br>
You say, 'Without help, the curse will take its full course. I am sure you have already guessed what that could mean.'<br>
Khasirath looks pointedly at the indigo patches upon her flesh.<br>
You told Silverstarr, 'Oh?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'those.... i want out of here!'<br>
You say, 'Those started before you came to Neriak, didn't they?'<br>
Silverstarr says, '..... '<br>
Silverstarr says, '...yeah.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i got stung by a big scorpion.'<br>
You say, 'Being here isn't making it any worse than being anywhere else would.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but i don't like this place. it's dark and creepy, and so is everyone here!'<br>
You say, 'I know what the Prophet has to do is unpleasant. But he does seek to cure you. If you would like I can try to be with you when next he works.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't believe that. he jsut wants to torture me.'<br>
You say, 'His experiments are sometimes painful, but it helps him learn about your curse so he can stop it.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he thinks it's funy when i squeal!'<br>
You say, 'I have a sister about your age... I know I would want to be at her side if she had to be going through this... Let me be there for you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'and he told me that his invisible buddy likes it too!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'GRR!'<br>
You say, 'I know it seems strange that he talks to someone you cannot see, but the being he speaks with is helping him to cure you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'your people jsut cause trouble. your people kidnapped me in the first place!'<br>
You say, 'Only so we could help you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i still don't believe that. your people never help anyone else.'<br>
You say, 'You know you would not have come willingly if we asked.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'no, i wouldn't have. that...that... HE comes here.'<br>
You say, 'We have our reasons. Just be glad we do, else we wuold not be helping you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'wait a minute.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'is that stupid warrior sick too?'<br>
You say, 'What warrior?'<br>
Silverstarr fills with rage.<br>
You say, 'I know many.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'Xareth...'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'HE wants to kill me.'<br>
Khasirath shrugs his shoulders.<br>
You say, 'I do not know... He has seemed well enough when last I saw him.'<br>
Silverstarr says, '.... i don't know. usually when i get sick, he does too.'<br>
Khasirath frowns slightly. <br>
Silverstarr says, 'i saw him when i was hauled to Neriak. he had this big hole in his throat.'<br>
You say, 'As I told your warrior friend, I do not know the reasons we are helping you. But I know that we are.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'if he's sick too, then that's why. but if he's not....'<br>
Silverstarr shrugs unknowingly.<br>
You say, 'Pravdameer is working hard, taking much of his time in helping you. For that reason alone I want to help too.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i hate that one.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he likes inflicting pain too much.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'and he's scary.'<br>
You say, 'I imagine his methods do seem abhorent to one born of light, but they are very effective. If anyone has a chance of curing you, I would bet much that it is he.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'why can't one of the clerics from a light race do it??'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'why does it have to be HIM?'<br>
You say, 'Do you think this curse is made from light or dark?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i don't know!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'it... might be dark or light. or..maybe both?'<br>
You say, 'Why didn't you tell the Dragons about it? Did you think perhaps they would not be able to help?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'no! i didn't want them to cast me out.'<br>
Khasirath frowns.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'they don't like dark races. so i didn't tell them'<br>
You say, 'Do you think so little of your friends?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'no, i don't! but if they had known...'<br>
You say, 'Or have they shown they are unwilling to help one so 'tainted' as I am sure you se it?'<br>
Silverstarr shakes her head.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i wish i knew.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i was afraid for them to know. so i looked for a cure by myself.'<br>
You say, 'And what did you learn on your own?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i need to find a necklace. and two other things.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but i don't know what they are...'<br>
You say, 'Indeed. Have you told the Prophet this?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he made me tell him.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'and he took my dagger ,too.'<br>
You say, 'Good. The more he knows the better he will be prepared to divine the truth.'<br>
Silverstarr says, '*glare* i didn't wanna tell him that. but since he made me..'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'it doesn't matter now, since i'll die here.'<br>
You say, 'If you would stop fighting him he might be able to help you better. And perhaps he would not have to use some of the more painful experiments.'<br>
You say, 'As I said before, Silverstarr, yuo will not die here.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'he doesn't let me get away, though! he keeps all these chains around so i can't move.'<br>
You say, 'I will have the Prophet speak to your Warrior friend. Perhaps they can find a way to work together.'<br>
You say, 'He keeps you chained becuase you force him to. Here I find you, trying to escape. Obviously the chains were required.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but i got away a little bit.'<br>
You say, 'That you did. You are very resourceful it seems.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'being stuck in a little room all the time is ... i don't like it.'<br>
Khasirath nods thoughtfully.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'don't take me back!'<br>
You say, 'I am sure Tzanntiel and Vhalshae would feel the same. They are my sisters.'<br>
You say, 'Perhaps we can compromise?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'hmph. how?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i jsut know you'll make me go back. you won't leave me here.'<br>
You say, 'For now you will come with me to my home. I will send word to the Prophet and have him meet us there to discuss your further treatment.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'how is your house better??'<br>
You say, 'You will have your own room in my House for now. You will eat at the table with my family.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'that sounds fishy.'<br>
You say, 'You will not be chained, you will be allowed to explore, with certain limitations for your own safety.'<br>
You say, 'Believe me, escape will not be possible. But you will be more comfortable.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you might try to eat me instead!'<br>
You say, 'My larder is well stocked. I have no need.'<br>
Khasirath winks.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but the guards try to kill me every time i see one! Pravdameer had to stop them.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'eww!'<br>
Khasirath sighs softly.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you have Wood Elves in your larder??'<br>
Silverstarr shivers. Brrrrrr.<br>
You say, 'An attempt at humor, ill-timed. Forgive me.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you scared me!'<br>
You say, 'I did not mean to, I am sorry. The humor of the Teir'Dal is very different from your people's I am sure.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'ugh.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i... can try, i guess.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'anything's better than that place i was before.'<br>
A few minutes of tense silence as they reguard one another. Then Khasirath looks away, sensing something.<br>
You shout, 'Hail the House of Ka T`et!'<br>
Silverstarr cringes.<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you shouted....'<br>
Dezmona shouts, 'Dark Tidings Khasirath'<br>
You say, 'I sense an old friend of mine. I'd hate her to think I am ignoring her.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you scared me!'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'an that hat looks creepy.'<br>
Khasirath pulls off his helm, holding it under his left arm.<br>
You say, 'Is that better?'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'hey... you're not ugly!'<br>
Khasirath chuckles softly.<br>
You say, 'Well, thank you.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'i thought all of your folk were ugly.'<br>
You say, 'We are elves... Not the same as Feir'Dal, but there are some similarities.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'like the pointy ears?'<br>
You say, 'Indeed.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'but i don't see anything else the same. you're blue. yuck.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'wah... i'm turning blue!'<br>
Khasirath chuckles softly.<br>
You say, 'Hopefully we can fix that.'<br>
Silverstarr says, '*sniffle*'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'you don't looks as scary with your hat off. but pravdameer's ALWAYS scary...'<br>
You say, 'Prophets tend to be very intense people.'<br>
Silverstarr says, 'scary!'<br>
<br>
Khasirath takes Silver to House S`Therik in Third Gate, where I am sure there are many more interesting conversations. *chuckles* <br>
<br>
Khasirath S'Therik. <br>
Knight of Innoruuk. <br>
