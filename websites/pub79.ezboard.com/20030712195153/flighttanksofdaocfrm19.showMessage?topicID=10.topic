What we're seeing are a ton of doodz playing the class and using the &quot;uber&quot; spec of 50/50/28 so they can try to own everyone.  This guy just spammed Doublefrost, had no clue when to frenzy and lost cause he's a moron.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying I could have done better, but if I had parried and evaded that many times vs. you; you never would have lived to use that IP *wink*.   By far and away our most damage styles (as in Zerks) are our rear positional, followed by our parry and evade chains.  Doublefrost has been nerfed down to a usable anytime style but without end regen isn't worth using in a one on one fight unless its for that last hit.<br>

However, if the relic situation on my server was neutral instead of stacked in my favor (20% relic bonus), that one trick pony (Vendo + DF) WOULD win.  I would say Dragonfang or Hypnotic Darkness could turn the tide, but Purge beats Stun.<br>

Big /salute to Ekim for actually fighting solo and unbuffed.  It is apparent that he ran out of endurance, and it would have been interesting since I screwed up and wasted my own endurance.  Unfortunately, Hootavoota decided to come back with friends and spoilt the fun.<br>
<br>
But seriously:  Not many mids will fight without at least a shaman end buff...these kinds of opportunities are very rare.  But while he had Endurance, Ekim was swinging at 3 delay speeds same as me, but was nearly doubling my damage output including my 20% relic bonus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerrecsnowmane>Kerrec Snowmane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#000000>(3/1/03 11:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercenary vs. Axe Spec'd Berserker</span><hr size=1> I tried to just use my Obscure style (high defensive bonus) when Vrexxon went Vendo.
