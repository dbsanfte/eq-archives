Part 2</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel stirred in the darkness of her chambers, knowing it was deep into the day when most in Neriak sought their rest.  She shifted languidly between her silken sheets, sighing softly in satisfaction and pleasure as she tried to decide what had woken her.<br>
<br>
Clump.  Clump.  Clump.  Soft and slow and steady.  A footstep she knew well, armoured boots walking the corridors of the old manse.<br>
<br>
Wriggling silently out of her warm sheets, Tzann pressed a finger to the sleepy lips of the handsome young servant who shared her bed.  His eyes fluttered open for a moment before he rolled over, burying his face in the pillows.  Tzann smirked, slipping into her silk robe as she padded to her door.  The footsteps in the hall receded, passing off to the left of her door.  She opened the door a crack, the well oiled hinges making no sound.<br>
<br>
Peering out into the dark hallway she saw the man's back, walking slowly away.  His dark armour gleamed dully, and one gauntleted hand rested on the hilt of his long blade in its scabbard.  Tzann watched him silently, weighing his tired gait in her memories.  As a child she never remembered hearing his step.  He had always moved with the silent grace of a panther, but now his heavy armour dragged his shoulders down when he thought no one was watching.  He reached the end of the hall and turned towards the stairway, pausing.  Tzann frowned as she studied his profile; the deep lines on his face, the faint yellowing of once-silver hair drawn back in a traditional short tail at the nape of his neck.<br>
<br>
Slipping the door closed, Tzanntiel stepped across her room silently, gazing out the small window at the quiet courtyard below.  Age comes ungracefully to Vazkiel S`Therik, she thought to herself as she watched the skeletal guards slowly crossing the grounds.  She knew her mother was looking much the same, her body gaunt from long centuries of practicing the Necromantic arts, though she was currently heavy with a child who was due to be born in about five months.  The sixth, and Tzanntiel figured last, child of Sikaethia's Matronship.<br>
<br>
A soft sigh escaped her as she thought of the young noble in the alley.  What use defending her House while she watched its strength aging away in her father and mother.  If no one else could step forward to lead House S`Therik, its fate was inevitable.  She could not assassinate everyone who would move against them.  Neither did she feel that she would make a suitable Matron to the House.  She was more at home in the shadows, helping the House from the darkness, and in the underbelly of the city, rather than sitting at the Council of Nobles, and in the drawing rooms of the Empire.  Thinking over the variety of her siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles, she could think of only one who could run the House as well as Matron Sikaethia.  Her older brother, Khasirath.<br>
<br>
But Khasirath was gone.  Just after the last meeting of the Violent Harvest he had vanished, and no one had found any trace of him.  Tzanntiel refused to believe that he was dead, but she could also not explain why he was gone.  Honorable to a fault, he would never have abandoned his duties to his House.  Not one of her contacts anywhere on Norrath or Luclin had heard rumor of him, or whatever plot had taken him in the ten years since he'd been seen.<br>
<br>
Leaving her plaything to sleep, Tzanntiel walked back to the door, and listened a moment to be certain her father hadn't returned to the hall before she slipped out and walked down the hall to another door like her own.  It was unlocked, and Tzann let herself in and closed the door behind her.  This room was far plainer than her own suite, and she saw her sister kneeling on the bare floor under the window, meditating.  Sighing she sat down beside Vhalshae and waited for the younger woman to come out of it.<br>
<br>
After a while Vhalshae lifted her head, turning endless black eyes on her sister.  &quot;You've been thinking about him again,&quot; she said quietly.<br>
<br>
Tzann frowned and nodded.  It always unnerved her when the young Prophetess seemed to be able to read her mind.  &quot;Have you seen anything, Vhal?  I've had no luck at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vhalshae looked out the window again, thoughtfully.  &quot;I know he is alive, Tzann.  But not free.  It is very hard to understand what I've seen.  The dreams are very dark, very troubled.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If he's alive then we have to try to find him.  Please tell me everything you can remember,&quot; Tzanntiel said.<br>
<br>
The young Prophetess looked back at her sister, seeming to shrink into herself as she thought about what she had seen.  &quot;Normally I would have another from the Spires to help scribe the vision, to help me translate.  I am not certain if I can explain it all to you well enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann closed her eyes as she tried hard to control her temper.  &quot;Do your best, Vhalshae.  Anything you can tell me is more than I have now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Breathing slowly and deeply, Vhalshae drifted back into meditation, speaking softly and hollowly as she let the vision flow back into her.  &quot;Cold stone is his bed and bier, deep within the halls of those who fight and serve Hate in the same breathless breath.  Blood and Hate are all he knows now.  He remains true, trapped as in ice, or amber.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaking off a sudden chill, Tzanntiel sat quietly, thinking on the strange words.  Vhalshae slowly returned to herself and stood up, walking over to her narrow bed stiffly.  &quot;It's the best I've been able to see,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;I need to rest now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel walked back to her room slowly, slipping back into her warm bed.  Her plaything tucked an arm around her waist as she lay on her side, thinking and planning.  There was a lot of work to do, and she feared there was not much time left to do it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A> at: 1/22/03 1:59:41 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
