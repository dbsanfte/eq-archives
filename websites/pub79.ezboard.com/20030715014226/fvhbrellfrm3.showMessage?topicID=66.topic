A brief history of Raveneye.....<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It all began with a foundling laid upon the steps of the Lodge of the Dead in Neriak's Third Gate. Rumor in the taverns was that the baby was the product of a High Court noble's affair with a dancer at the Maiden's Fancy. Whatever the provenance of the baby, the Lodge of the Dead was never reluctant to accept new members that could so easily be fostered and molded as they grew…..<br>
<br>
The child was dubbed Raveneye by the elders of the Lodge because of the resemblance of his pale green orbs to those of the symbolic bird, said to carry the souls of the dead away to be judged by the Father of all Teir'Dal, Innoruuk himself. Born under the height of the ascension of the dark star astrologers associate with Innoruuk and the power of his divine hate, Raveneye was given the surname Shadowstar to be bestowed upon him at the time of his own ascension into adulthood. As he grew, the child Raveneye showed a natural talent for the ways of the warrior and a special affinity for the magic of the Dead. Nezzka Tolax, commander of the Shadowknights, took an interest in him early on, and Raveneye was schooled in the dark path of the Shadowknight by the finest teachers and battlemasters the Lodge had to offer. As he grew in power he learned to channel his hate into strength, and use the strength to defeat stronger and more difficult opponents. Quests were assigned by the taskmasters of the Lodge, and all were faithfully carried out by young Raveneye. Finally the day came to pass when he reached adulthood and was granted the surname long held for him on the scrolls of the Lodge. <br>
<br>
It was on that day that Raveneye Shadowstar was given a new quest, one that would challenge him like no other and forever change him. Because of his unique status as a foundling with no family and no close ties to anyone in Neriak, Raveneye was sent on a quest to learn all he could of those that dwell in the light and the plans they were making. Once every few seasons he was to report back to the Lodge what he had discovered, and he was to tell no one but his direct superiors of his travels and his discoveries. It was an important and dangerous mission, and also a veritable exile from all he had known for so long. He undertook it gladly and with great pride.<br>
<br>
Season after season Raveneye traveled among the light races slowly earning their respect and then their trust. His faith was sorely tested time and time again, and his love for the Father questioned often by those he once knew. Even the superiors who had designed his mission eventually came to question whether he had spent too much time among the enemies of the Teir'Dal, yet none dared abort the mission and stop the flow of information he brought back with each return to Neriak. Eventually the returns became fewer and farther between, until one season someone noticed Raveneye had not returned in a very long time, and he was given up for lost, put down in the annals of the Lodge as missing in action, presumed dead.<br>
<br>
Now Raveneye has returned! Welcomed warily back into the ranks of the Lodge, noone can say for sure exactly what he has seen or done for the many seasons he has been gone. Some distrust his return, and yet there is nothing to arouse suspicions other than his extended absence and the enigma surrounding him. On the surface his love for the Father Innoruuk and his devotion to the Lodge are as strong as the day he first left Neriak. Underneath only Raveneye knows what lies within himself.<br>
<br>
Raveneye Shadowstar is a born soldier. A militaristic nature makes him seem taciturn and cold at times, but also make him value qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. A true Shadowknight, he embodies all those qualities along with the gift of mastery over death, disease and pain. More warrior than necromancer, Raveneye is tactical in the use of magic, seeing it more as a tool than an art. Preferring to put trust into blade and bow over incantation, he is nevertheless very skilled in the arts of spellcasting and uses magic to his advantage in combat. He eschews the use of &quot;pets&quot; whenever possible, and has been heard to say, &quot;Skeletal warriors are fine when there is noone else to fight beside. They wield a sword well enough, but by Innoruuks teeth they are the stupidest creatures on Norrath! Give me a halfwit Troll over a pile of animated bones any day, at least the Troll can follow orders!&quot; Stalwart and steadfast, Raveneye will not flee a battle until all of his comrades are safely away. He does not make friends easily, but once proven to him, you can expect his total and unswerving loyalty until the day you die, or longer even…...<br>

Creapiing looks up from the writ sent by the lodge of the dead, sealed by the hand of Master D'warathes himself. So know one knew where the seed Raveneye had been, she pondered. I wonder if anyone has asked him. Deftly she hoisted Wurmslayer and set out to find the new seed and ask him herself about those years.<br>
