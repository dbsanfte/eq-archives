I am very much aware of the new Light Tank definition and I don't think trying to fight this new mold to achieve the &quot;less defense, more damage&quot; equation is something I have a hope of being successful at.  To be honest, I never felt Mercenaries should be doing significantly more damage, or that other classes should either.  The most memorable battles I've had in RvR happen when 2 forces, be it group vs. group or larger encounters, fight for several minutes.  I've had one 8 vs. 8 battle last nearly 8 minutes (used flurry 3 times, and it refreshed shortly after I released).  These kinds of fights, which I endorse, can not happen when any class can frontload large amounts of damage in a short period of time.  I believe it is fairly safe to say that Mercenaries, as well as Light Tanks, will not be seeing any increase in damage for the forseeable future.<br>
<br>
That being said, what differentiates a Mercenary from an Armsman other than our usefulness as &quot;bubble busters&quot;?  I hope it is agreed by the community that the new Light Tank role is that of a Positional Fighter that provides melee &quot;support&quot;.  It's that &quot;support&quot; that I hope to expand upon.  I envision the majority of the Dual Wield spec line to be positionals and chains.  These positionals would provide &quot;effects&quot; that are detrimental to the opponent being attacked, such as effective snares, slows, stuns, and hopefully debuffs.  I can come up with many other ideas that would add uniqueness to the Mercenary class, via the DW spec style list, given time (of course).  For example, a rear positional style that causes the opponents next attack to fumble.  I hope to receive ideas like this from the community and receive commentary from the community as to why these ideas would or would not work.<br>
<br>
For the time being however, the Mercenary is going to have to wait for the mentioned Style and RA reviews to see any changes to the class.  Kate has already said what needs to be said regarding the Mercenary and we've been told to wait for these reviews.  I'm going to be looking for new issues that I can address in a class report whenever one is asked of me, and could use plenty of feedback on this.  <br>
<br>
The issues I feel need the most attention:<br>
<br>
Flank needs a boost.  Either a To-Hit bonus, or make the Flank/Shadow's Rain chain do more damage to make up for the fact it will fail often.<br>
<br>
Charge is near useless in its current implementation for anyone other than a soloing Merc.  Even then, End Potions negate this unique ability of our class.<br>
<br>
Shield Swapping/Interface.  For those few who are Shield spec'd and want to switch from DW to S/S without dragging and dropping from inventory.<br>
<br>
Dirty Tricks.  One final tweak to add an effect that will make using DT against a non-melee an option. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasagh>Vasagh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#000000>(9/25/03 12:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=351.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercenary Vision</span><hr size=1> My comments:<br>
<br>
First I mostly agree with your assessment.<br>
<br>
1) Flank improvements. While a med or high-to-hit bonus is needed for any style to be worthwhile, to me it's not something I care about when we have a poor rear-positional chain. Flank chain to me is just fluff not what I rely on in most combat situations and I don't see it changing even if they added a stun to shadow's rain. (On my 2H armsmen for a year I tried playing around with the side chain which has  higher growth rates than flank chain and a stun on 2nd style and still didn't find it effective enough to always use it). In short I'd rather see more effort in improving our rear-positional styles similar to  berserkers. Or work on improving both <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) Regarding charge, I find it quite useful in RvR. I also carry endurance potions and they save me a ton compared to my armsmen who goes through them 3x faster because I sprint a lot. There is also a timer on potions if I recall right (i haven't tested this recently though since I have been playing my merc more). Of course any improvements to charge would be welcome. A lot of mercs find charge switching to sprint a problem, would be nice ot have a toggle option for this.<br>
<br>
3) shield swapping and DT ideas right on. DT could perhaps apply the same fumble effect on casters with their spells once it procs including if they use Mastery of Concentration. Shield users can do this with a stun so this would be a special form for the merc to acheive a similar but lesser result (high chance to distract vs a 9second stun).<br>
<br>
4) There maybe an issue with Evade I for mercs not scaling up with dex/qui buffs (with or maybe if the merc doesn't have dodger levels). This has been reported before in other tests by a number of people but I was never able to confirm if fact or fiction. I did run some tests some time ago and couldn't see a difference but my sample was not large enough to be confident of my results. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danyan@lighttanksofdaoc>Danyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#000000>(9/25/03 1:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=351.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercenary Vision</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>shield swapping and DT ideas right on.

I don't think adding even more ways to fail casts is what casters need right now, in particular, I don't think us being able to interrupt a 24 point 30-minute timer RA with our free 7-minute timer ability is a good plan. MOC is already the most expensive ability in the game (24 points buys you 15s every 30 mins), it doesn't need nerfing to the point of uselessness. The difference with a shield stun is that the caster can purge the shield stun and is then immune for 1 minute so cannot be reinterrupted with a shield. Dirty tricks can be reprocced easily and has no immunity.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what a suitable proc for dirty tricks is that affects caters but not tanks - perhaps a dex debuff or casting speed debuff of some sort. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerrecsnowmane>Kerrec Snowmane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mercenary TL</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#000000>(9/25/03 2:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=351.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercenary Vision</span><hr size=1> I've had one suggestion of adding a Nearsight effect to Dirty Tricks (makes some sense, right?).  It won't stop the caster from going to town on you if you just land a hit as you run by, but it will prevent the caster from nuking your clerics or support if they're far enough away.<br>
<br>
Other ideas I've received is, a stacking haste while DT is active or a reduction in end cost for styles while DT is active.<br>
<br>
Keep the ideas coming. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyke>Zyke</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#000000>(9/25/03 6:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=351.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercenary Vision</span><hr size=1> I think a 30-50% ( based on resists 50% at 0) Nearsight effect on Dirty tricks would &quot;wtfpwn&quot;. perhaps &quot;wtfpwn&quot; a bit too much, consider the following: I'm on a healer ( and you should be too~) and some of his buddies are getting hurt ( paladins guarding the healers~) he's trying to kite me and say he gets away ( not likely, thanks to PF but say he does) and casts a spread heal with the nearsight effect on his group heal's range is gonna be devastingly small, even if i were to switch off and attack say their other healer the one with dirty tricks would be having a nasty time getting in range for heals. <br>
<br>
Now as a merc I'd LOVE to have such an ability, but I don't think that kind of power is really needed for the mercenary to be effective. the trouble is a small like 15% nearsight has no real noticable effect and a high effect is overpowering. If we want omething to harm casters I would think a medium sized acuity debuff or small power drain over time ( something like 5-8 power a tick, which equates to one less cast of a 33 power nuke or half a spread heal) or something of that nature, which hinders their ability to do dmg to a small degree but doesn't cripple their primary str ( range). I could make roleplay explainations about the distractions and such but its all tripe anyway since Mythic could make bull explainations for mercs growing wings and flying if they were so inclined.<br>
<br>
Also I'd ask it be looked into ifT CAUSES fumbles or simply makes natural misses into fumbles more often. I get the impression its the latter and personally think that the effect is not significant enough Vs a high wpn skill melee ( who seldom miss). I have no logs of this or anything but its something  to look into at some point.<br>
<br>
Also on Flank+ shadows rain its been shown the + to hit for rvr has such little bearing so as to be neglible and thus any change to it would be a pve orientated one. Thus I don't think its really a problem, although on the other hand I wouldn't turn down a + to hit bonus on it either since I remember pve being quite the suck before dual shadows~<br>
<br>
As for a style change I wouldn't mind some kind of positional chain/non-reactionary stun. Eclipse/penumbra/shadows rain all prime candidates for change in the future and possibly removing slash styles from hotbar altogether ( damn you back slash~)<br>
<br>
Anyway I'm a relatively content fotm reroll~ a little boost to DT to make it have some effect on my primary targets and I'd be happy as a pig in...mud.<br>

We should have unique effects like that which can only be utilized in a group further emploring our role as a 'support tank' if that is what the idea of a light tank has become...<br>
<br>
At the moment, sure I can flank and shadows rain until my hearts content, but that doesn't help anyone else much and I figure the definition of a support tank would be to support another tank... And a fumble effect, maybe once per mob (Like how stun negates after consecutive stuns, but for this it negates after that first attempt) which will support the tank in that he may not take damage for one attack... Then when the effect is negated, we could move over to the side and utilize flank and get the effect of it off...<br>
<br>
If anything, we should be able to cripple and hinder the hell out of a mob or opposing force IF given the chance to get off our reactionaries... Which we won't be able to do solo or one on one which would also promote grouping even within RvR and give us some worth other than cannon fodder to the extent of &quot;Grab the Merc, if he lasts long enough, he will be a great asset in the dismemberment of their force&quot;<br>
<br>
And I also agree with your take on damage, with buff bots being the norm, fights don't last long at all anymore... 4 or so hits at the most... <p>Vith<br>

<br>
Even though you can purge a shield stun, it breaks MOC once hit with one. And a merc can already do this with a 3 spec in shield but has to go through the trouble of switching. With my pole-armsman I hot-swap to shield use the low level 3 numb style for 2second stun breaking a MOC caster. Since we don't have hot-swapping on a merc this would just be more convenient without being as powerful as slam (42 shield style).<br>
<br>
Compare this with frenzy or Triple wield which do more damage and can effectively kill a caster faster. <br>
Hmm.<br>
<br>
Actually if hot-swapping is fixed for mercs, this is in fact irrelevant unless we could DT a caster and move to another target and they would for a few seconds have a greater chance to fumble spells.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1) Styles:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> From Blademaster TL report(blue) feedback(red)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">Role of the Light Tanks – The concern of the ability of the light tank to play the role of an &quot;assist tank&quot; in PvP combat is still a major issue. Most of this relates to the inability to control player aggression (versus mob aggression) - there is also the issue of &quot;fun factor&quot; in this role, as the vision of this class has seemingly changed from the original vision, which many who play the class still currently hold. One suggestion to help in this role would be to allow Light Tanks to use reactionaries based on the main tank's reactions (parries, evades) to the target.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

- Starting races doesn't affect it<br>
- Buffs as well<br>
- Advanced evade almost useless<br>
- Evade Reactionaries too<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4) Interface:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Beside the shield swapping I'd like a bigger qbar, not a longer one but I think adding another line with 10 slots would be fine. Many abilities/styles are considered useless because we don't have space on our quick.<br>

<br>
Suggestions:<br>
<br>
Flank needs a to hit bonus, even if it's just small.<br>
<br>
Charge needs to have a 10-15% speed boost while using it, since we are charging ahead, often to our doom.<br>
<br>
DT could use an added effect, but is already good the way it is.  At least I think so.<br>
<br>
They need to take our other DW styles (ds, flank/s.r., reflect/h.d. not included) and give us some toys to play with.  I'd love a good DW anytime, back style, effects, debuffs, etc etc.  Just something.<br>
<br>
Parry spec.  Parry is a light tank's main form of defense (providing you aren't a shield merc).  Perhaps a chance to parry arrows given at 25 spec.  Maybe a 2 sec stun &quot;proc&quot; at 35 spec (you parry, you stun your target by a jarring their hands; think softball bat and hitting the ball wrong).  Maybe even a 3 sec stun with 1/4 of your flurry's damage proc at 40 spec? (jar their hands so hard it hurts).  All things above given a 5% chance to proc.  Just ideas.  Would be applicable to all light tanks.<br>
<br>
Now let's hope Mythic gives us some even better toys to play with when we get our Master Levels and they fix our existing ones before it's released.<br>

<br>
1) Hot swap<br>
I doubt mythic will do it, or will have time to do it. Surely want that on my mins too, but I dont' want to face an assassin class with many weapons.<br>
<br>
2) Better structure of DW<br>
If you look at reaver flex style, you'll realize DW is really laughable. Flex has a clear structure of 4 style chains<br>
Parry: Kingsnake, tigersnake, anaconda (stun)<br>
Block: viper, copperhead, taipan, cobra (133 lt)<br>
Side: indigosnake, constrictor<br>
Behind: asp for range, levi for damage<br>
Then it is taunt/detaunt, a lvl 2 style, and an aoe debuff anytime python.<br>
<br>
Well, when we look at DW styles which you all know better than me, we see something here, something there. If I can get stun from reflection/hypnotic and go front DS bleed him, why do I need bleeding from DT? etc etc.<br>
<br>
Another two things are actually for my reaver too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
1) Rear arc nerf<br>
Now I have to line perfectly behind them to levi out, 80% time it is the backup indigo hitting in.<br>
2) &quot;You are strafing in battle and missed!&quot;<br>
For god sake, I am a light tank and supposed to be positional. Why can't I even hit in strafing when I can style at will when I mindlessly /stick? Can we get a style that stun the enemy, AND make them turn their back to us? I would love that part! <p>Sleepyjoe<br>

<br>
You get stunned, which interrupts your cast. If you purge then subsequent hits do not interrupt for the duration of MOC. So a stun is a one-time interrupt for moc with purge. Your proposed change to dirty tricks would have effect for the entire duration as there's no immunity.<br>
The only thing that breaks MOC itself is dying (other than the timer running out of course). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danyan@lighttanksofdaoc>Danyan</A> at: 9/25/03 11:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fester@lighttanksofdaoc>Fester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#000000>(9/25/03 11:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=351.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mercenary Vision</span><hr size=1> Here are some of my thoughts.<br>
<br>
1) I agree with Kerrec in not giving any more damage to Mercs but for gods sake please tell Mythic to tone down some of the damage from other realm toons. Savages, Zerkers (still), LW Heros+Annihilation hit damn hard and our clerics have no way of getting away from them (unlike bards and healers with insta mez/stuns)<br>
<br>
2) Flank +hit would be nice.. also removing the defense decrease on Dual Shadows would be helpful<br>
<br>
3) Please make sure that they don't nerf Prevent Flight (which MacKey mentioned in one of the TL response reports). The only way we can defend any of our casters is with PF as it forces tanks to stand and fight you. LW have the AnnhiliationIWin style which takes no skill and has a huge 9 second stun and takes you out of the fight unless you purge.<br>
<br>
4) Flurry - is there any reason why this isn't on a 1 minute timer? Most battles are over in 30 seconds. Your epic 6 minute battles (as per your post) happen once in a bluemoon.  Most of the time people get to use it once.  Also is there a reason that it doesn't work on mobs? It would be a very nice aggro control tool.<br>
<br>
5) Advanced Parry Skills - people who put trade off damage by putting 30+ into parry should have a benefit over those to max weapon damage. Many ideas have been put forward such as Parrying Arrows, Parrying Guard (equivalent to shield guard)<br>
<br>
Well thats all I have for now. More later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Ir seems you see most of the problems immediatley, which has little to do with half the Mercs on this board screaming for them.... seems like forever...<br>
<br>
IMHO;<br>
Positional light tank support fighters right? IF that is our, now to be, role then in that light all our positionals need work!<br>
<br>
On the other hand, one of the main attractions of a Merc in my opinion is its oure simplicity - fun! To use my other Tank (and I have two) as an example, to stay roughly in class, A Good, and I use that work advisedly, Pally is soo busy most of the time. Playing a Merc is actually like a break.<br>
<br>
I fear many of the suggestions and complicated style lines are beginning to &quot;fuzz&quot; up the Merc line. Merc kiss, keep it simple...<br>
<br>
DT - yes needs improvement. Needs even increased fumbles chance and or a Debuff. This would be good for both PvE and RvR. Satisfying both purposes. (we still loot at 50)<br>
<br>
Parry - Given that Parry is our only &quot;real&quot; defence, needs improvement still. GJ last time, but a little more please.<br>
<br>
Evade - I'm not a dam Friar! Plus I don't need even more semi-useless styles on my Qbar. I know when I'm going to evade because I clearly see the pigs fly past first. I rarely (almost never except experimentally) equip this style.<br>
<br>
Styles - We all I think, use Flank/ Shadows Rain (support right?) I and many others have long argued that we need, sometimes major, improvements to our positionals. We are finally getting some movement in that direction.<br>
Flank needs, at least, a low bonus to hit, med/ High and a slowed effect. Shadows needs a med bonus to hit (as second in chain), med/ high and a stun! not bleed as we have those all around this in the other chains.<br>
<br>
Reflection/ Shadows Rain? I Dont use em. I've never seen such wonderful results them in thousands of tries. I Rarely Parry, almost and certainly in RvR. I uuse Dark Tandrils only as my rare parry response and find its Loe E use and Med damage with bleeding sufficient to occupy one place on my Qbar (which has little room without swapping, also against Merc simplicity)<br>
<br>
So for me? Simple - fix Flank/ Shadows Rain as above and DT. I, personally will be a happier camper....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hi dude and welcome.<br>
<br>
Gonna annoy you here, not on purpose. The reason you see such logic applied to the Reaver class style lines is simple, 1. Mythic must have learned something in all these years (nevermind complaints) and 2. In my discussions with many, many Mercs - The reaver &quot;Flexible&quot; unique style line SHOULD have been given to Mercs! It was rightfully ours. Should have been our design improvement - we were due - paid for in blood and pain.<br>
<br>
At least thats what many Mercs I talk to think.<br>

Is camelotherald outdated? or the shadowrain lvl 39 style is chained off Dragonfang, the 50 thrust style? From your post, it seems now Flank is opener for Shadowrain, then we'll need a to-hit for flank. <br>

They just have it all - they're the best offensive melee in the game and also have the best melee defence in the form of their melee resist and parry/evade buffs. Additionally they have pure tank RAs which I don't think they should have as they are obviously a hybrid. It also makes me wonder what mythic was smoking when they gave a powerful melee class a self end regen shout, madness.<br>
<br>
As for zerkers, they do similar damage to merc now, about right. Annihilation isn't that overpowered - PF is definitely better, there's immunity on the stun, there isn't on PF. <p>----<br>

I've been thinking about styles, but I want to touch on a couple things that have been mentioned here first.<br>
<br>
Evade:  It's nice to think that evade isn't scaling or being affected by stats, but I'd like to have a bit more solid ground to stand on if I bring it up.  I guess what I'm asking for are ideas on HOW to test something like this.  I'll do the testing myself, or ask some people I know might help... but as it is, there's no method to test it to my knowledge.<br>
<br>
Dirty Tricks:  Ideas for enhancing this ability are flying around and I'm liking that.  So far:<br>
<br>
-Nearsight<br>
-Stacking Self Haste while DT is active<br>
-Reduction in style endurance cost while DT is active<br>
-Acuity stat debuff<br>
<br>
Parry Skill:  A reason to spec into it, or spec high into it with benefits similar to shield spec.  It's already been mentioned in TL reports and Mythic is entertaining the idea as far as I know.  I'm all for this as well.<br>
<br>
Ok, on to styles.  This is a DRAFT!  This is not what I intend to add into the next TL report.  Everyone knows there's a Style Review on the way sometime, and I want to be ready to plead my case to take the opportunity to revamp DW.  The Style and RA reviews, as well as the ToA expansion, will be the only chances to get improvements to the Mercenary class in the near future.<br>
<br>
General Philosophy:<br>
<br>
  Front Positionals and follow up chains (defensive nature)<br>
    -Low End costs<br>
    -Detaunt<br>
    -Defensive Bonuses<br>
    -Attack speed debuff (slows)<br>
    -Keep Dual Shadows as is (lvl 50 style).<br>
<br>
  Rear Positionals and follow up chains (utility styles)<br>
    -High End costs<br>
    -Taunt<br>
    -Defensive Penalties<br>
    -Snares/Roots, Cause Fumble<br>
<br>
  Side Positional and follow up chains (Offensive nature)<br>
    -Medium End costs<br>
    -High Damage (high growth rates)<br>
    -Procs, Stat Debuffs<br>
<br>
  Parry Reactionary and follow up chains<br>
    -Basically keeping Reflection/Hypnotic Darkness as is.<br>
    -Stuns<br>
   <br>
  Evade Reactionary and follow up chains<br>
    -Highest damage (rarest form of defense)<br>
    -Bleed?<br>
<br>
  Openers all have High End costs and To-Hit bonuses.<br>
  Follow up chains have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lower</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> End costs and the big payoffs.<br>
<br>
Styles:<br>
<br>
2-   Beginner Style, Anytime<br>
4-   Side Positional<br>
8-   Front Positional, Detaunt<br>
10- Evade Reactionary<br>
12- Rear Positional, Taunt<br>
15- Target is Blocked (TIB) Reactionary<br>
18- Parry Reactionary (Reflection)<br>
21- Target is Parried (TIP) Reactionary<br>
25- Front followup<br>
29- Rear followup<br>
34- Parry followup (Hypnotic Darkness)<br>
39- Evade followup<br>
44- Side followup<br>
50- Front Positional (Dual Shadows)<br>
<br>
Reasoning:  <br>
<br>
1) All Mercs will have access to a second style list to draw from for utilitary styles.<br>
2) Infiltrators share the DW spec line with Mercenaries, so I tried to have the potentially powerful stuff late in the spec.<br>
<br>
Basically, when you hit lvl 5 and are allowed to spec into DW, you have the potential to get the lvl 2 and lvl 4 style.  That gives you an anytime style for low level PvE and the first taste of the &quot;positional fighter&quot; philosophy with an offensive side positional.<br>
<br>
By lvl 8, after using the offensive side positional and drawing aggro all the time, the Merc will be all too ready for a defensive (detaunt) style, which is conveniently on a front positional (wouldn't make sense on any other positional).<br>
<br>
At lvl 10, Mercenaries get Evade I, and if they spec 10 in DW, they'll have the opportunity to use their Evade Reactionary (once in a blue moon).<br>
<br>
At lvl 12 they round out their positional arsenal and begin using styles that help a group with CC type effects and Taunt.<br>
<br>
By lvl 15, both Armsmen and Paladins are using large shields and Reavers get large shields at lvl 17.  All 3 could be using guard by this level.  Being able to use a reactionary based off these classes ability to block would be a nice addition to the class.<br>
<br>
At lvl 18, Mercenaries can take advantage of the Parry ability they received at lvl 17.  They have another reactionary in their arsenal.<br>
<br>
At lvl 21, they improve on their lvl 18 ability by being able to use a reactionary based on groupmates parrying.<br>
<br>
At lvl 25, the Mercenary begins to learn how to chain their styles.  The followup to the front positional allows them to slow their opponents which gives groupmates a chance to draw aggro.<br>
<br>
At lvl 29, the Mercenary learns to chain a rear positional style which Snares the opponent in the event that Taunt doesn't succeed.<br>
<br>
At lvl 34, more chains, and a stun.<br>
<br>
At lvl 39, yet more chains, big damage..watch out for that uber Merc Evade!<br>
<br>
At lvl 44? Yup, more chains.  Best place for a Merc to be, is the side!<br>
<br>
Finally, lvl 50.  Just the &quot;I'm spec'd 50 DW, think ya can take me head on!?&quot; style.<br>
<br>
Bah, too long!  Don't be too brutal when you pick this apart..  :P <p>Kerrec Snowmane<br>

I think Kalysta_DAoC (once Xandau_13) could help you, she runs many interesting tests and once she did a test on defences ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=52193534&replies=15">vnboards.ign.com/message....replies=15</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ).
