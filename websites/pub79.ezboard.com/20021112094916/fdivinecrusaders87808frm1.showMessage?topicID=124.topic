Success?</span><hr size=1> 6 of us Raided Dragon Necropilos the other night. It was a big success. Dark died only once on the way there. Chip died as well.  They both drown cuase of the root the sirens happen to cast on them. We got vengence. After the drowning, and rezzes from a passing cleric, we entered Sirens Grotto. Here we beat the crap out of a couple Ulthorks. From there we went to the Western waste and was suprised that all of us were dubious and none were KOS to the drakes dragons and wurms.  We followed Dark (I know I know, not the brightest ideas) to DN where we were warned not to touch the bones.  Sajjin (bad spelling of a hard to remember name) keep asking what bone and was told to look down. He said he still couldn't see it. I got a good laugh. I don't think he got it. 8D. When we got in DN I was surprise that there was only one mob on track, even though I could clearly see 2. One was way off and if you know my tracking ability you know that's saying something for the size of this place.  The 2 mobs I saw where spiders. On was close enough to shot, but I didn't.  Before we could commence to slaughtering the spider, the server went boom. We all had fun in chat trying to figure out who was who and how to change out names. When we finaly got back, missing Dying, we had fun being shadow steped just about every time the spider would hit us. Unfortunatly he didnt' drop crap. We started medding and getting ready for the next pull, and picking on the warrior. And then watching the warrior kick Kom's butt in a duel. And I almost got my butt kicked by a velium hound when I went outside to..errr.... reSoW.  The next fight was funny. I realized that if the spider couldn't hit you, you wouldn't be shadow steped, so like the good (read stupid) ranger I am, I attemped to keep agro and stay out of reach so the others could beat on him without trouble. It was working somewhat with the exception of some casters siting and takeing agro hehe. Some how, and no one know's how, another spider got aggroed. This was not good.  To make a long story short, I died <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . (That is suposse to be a smile, dont' like dieing, but the whole thing was fun). Kom died. Dark and Chip didn't die in DN. Chip died when he zoned and a velium hound jumped him.  We got outside to rez Chip. I was watching for hounds. One got the jump on me. I saw Shadowhaven for the second time in under 10 min it seemed. <br>
Now I may have some facts messed up seeing as how I was half asleep at the time, but the majority is correct. The others can make corrections as they see fit. I do know that Dark was haveing a fit cause I didn't loot every single item on my corpse. I had left an arrow. Anyway, there was probably more to mention, but it slips my mind now. I call the crazy raid a success because I had fun.<br>
I think I had better list those involved. I may get names screwed up cause I do all the time.<br>
Tracker (me), Chiptooth (Chip), Kom (cause I can't remember the correct spelling of the whole name), Dark (cause it's easy to just put part), Sajjin (Just a wierd name, but he's a warrior so what can you expect), and Dying (and I just don't know why someone would want to be called Dying, but then, he is a necro)<br>

Pretty accurate account Tracker! It went pretty well and I learned not to hail those crazy Walrusses when you Lesser Evac thru Sirens Grotto! I wouldn't have died cept that port device didn't work when I clicked it over and over for some reason! We should bring a full crew and click the bones.<br>

I had the misfortune to run into a construct on two occasions suffice it to say i spent 4 hours per corpse run. =p and Gaeadilea was 54 at the time with Level 60 ranger Beohram and Lvl 60 paladin Blag Jarterius 60 shammy and 60 cleric Wolfen and 60 necro Cardeospites. Somehow we managed to spawn two constructs /cringe spider shadowstepped blag into the bones for them =p killed spider and one construct. then started the fun corpse run nekkied tanks and others dying as they zoned in =p finally blag made the decision and aggroed construct running as far from zone as he could get before dying ignonimusly =p we zoned in got rezzed and summoned Blags corpse then we killed construct and headed deeper for the rats  =p little easier prey but they tend to come in groups hehe chanter really helps back there =) .  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=124.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=124.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=124.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.threadControl?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="divinecrusaders87808frm11">Leadership Voting!<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm10">Guild Bank<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm1">General<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm2">Events<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm3">New Members<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm4">Officer Information <option value="divinecrusaders87808frm5">Guild Member Listing <option value="divinecrusaders87808frm6">Humor<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm7">Guild's Order<option value="divinecrusaders87808frm9">Hunting Guide</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bdivinecrusaders87808>Divine Crusaders</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fdivinecrusaders87808frm1>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
