I'll try and get some more up, but I'm getting ready to move out of my apartment just now, and on the 22nd I get to hop on a plane and go east to see my wife and kids for a whole week! *BOUNCEBOUNCECHEERCHEER* In any event, I wish all of you and your's a very happy holidays and a joyful and bountiful new year.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I'll be cross-posting this to Brell VN, OED, Evoluxa, and House W'Rath, so if ya don't wanna read it more than once, just read it in one place. *chuckle*<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
A bead of sweat rolled down his forehead as the young one-time-prophet toiled away on the Father's plane. It had been a long time, and there was still much to be done. He was hoping that his request to return to Norrath would be granted and he could return to the work he craved - spreading the Father's Gift.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pravdameer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it, Atoxus? Do you have word from on high? Has my wish been granted?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am told you have not yet earned that privilege, whelp.&quot; Atoxus replied with a sinister smirk. No need to let the young priest know the whole truth just yet, after all.<br>
<br>
&quot;How badly do you wish to return to your family, child?&quot; the messenger of the Father asked.<br>
<br>
The young priest thought a moment. *Just what are you after, Atoxus - what torture do you have planned for me next?* &quot;It is not as much my family that I wish to return to, although I welcome that. It is the Father's work I wish to continue - there is much I can relay to the Harvest now that The Mad one has gone into a retirement of sorts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; the Messenger intoned. &quot;Are there no priests in the Harvest anymore?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course there are, but with what is to come, there are more needed still. Also, there are certain...others...I seek to reacquaint myself with.&quot; The young priest smiled a sadistic grin as he made mental plans of what he might be able to do with those who had not yet learned the power of True Hatred.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well then, Pravdameer. There are a few more tasks to be done, and then you shall be ready to return to that accursed land. The Father has left it to me to decide how you shall return and in what form…&quot; Atoxus smirked with malevolent glee. &quot;Perhaps a Fier'Dal would do for your new form?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT?!?&quot; The rage boiled inside the young prophet as the Messenger raised an eyebrow at the young priest's outburst. Slowly, Pravdameer reigned himself in funneling the Hatred to other uses. &quot;What I mean to say is I hope to prove myself worthy of otherwise, Atoxus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is also the question of how to return you - perhaps sometime when the Harvest ventures into the Father's plane, or perhaps I will send you back another way - I will think on it child. For now, continue with your tasks. We will speak more later.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young priest went back to work with visions of the tortures he could inflict upon those enemies he had left behind - he was certain they would kill him again, or come close to it, but so long as he was able to fan their flames of Hatred, he was fairly certain he would be allowed to return. Oh yes, there was much work yet to be done. <p>Pravdameer Pravdamorte<br>

<br>
Most often this time of prayer and communion with the Father is a quiet affair, just himself and his thoughts. But sometimes, Innoruuk would show him things. Not outright visions, as the Knight is no Prophet, but brief sensations, or messages. Whispers...<br>
<br>
And this eve the whispers had carried along a familiar voice, still far away. And the sensations of hatred were still as pure as he recalled oh those many moons ago.<br>
<br>
Soon, he felt, soon he shall return. The Mouth of Innoruuk will once more speak the Father's Will directly unto the Harvest. And with the recent reveltion of the Priestess Sigyn proving her own gift of Prophecy... With every day the Harvest grows stronger, the worlds more open for the reaping blades.<br>
<br>
The dark hunger began to twist within him at the thought, and he reined it in tightly with his well-trained will. Not long now... Then the Harvest shall descend to blanket Norrath and all the realms in the Father's Shadow.<br>
