He was traveling through the area known as the Iceclad Ocean, in search of certain prey. The Iceclad Ocean was populated by various denizens, all dangerous, devious or deadly. Some lived here because it was their habitat, others as merchants, and others as guards. There were the basic animal life forms of Snow Cougars, Dire Wolves and various marine life. These animals were much more hardier and deadly then their warm climate kin of Antonica. This was due to the far harsher conditions necessary for survival. Next, there were the slightly more intelligent clans of Snow Dervish Nomads, Ice Paw Gnolls and Pirate Gnomes. The Gnolls and Gnomes had established small settlements in the icy frosts of the packs of ice that served as land in the Iceclad Ocean. The Snow Dervish’s seemed to be isolated Nomads, driven insane by some unknown force. They wandered the wintry plains, attacking any and all they saw. At the top of the food chain were the Giants of Kael. These were usually Frost Giant guards and scouts, sent to the Iceclad for punishment duty or incompetence. That is because there were no worthy enemies to defeat here, only overgrown cats and dogs to shoo away, and annoying little Gnomes to listen to. No self respecting Giant would voluntarily patrol the Iceclad, even the Tower of Frozen Shadows was off limits to the scouts, only the vast Dragonbone Bridge was of any concern. It led the way into the Eastern Wastes, and allowed deeper entry into the whole continent of Velious. Thus, was the Iceclad one of the least desirable places to be, on one of the least desirable continents in all Norrath. Nonetheless, Zirrix had his own reasons for being here now. <br>
<br>
As his association and comradeship with the Giants increased, he was able to learn more of their secrets and knowledge. They had been here since the time of the Curse of The Rathe, and knew much about the entire realm of Velious. Both Zirrix and the Giants shared a common contempt for all the lower life forms (read: non-Teir’dal or Kael Giant) that lived on Norrath. Still, on occasion, the lesser races did have their uses. They might have objects, the value of which was beyond their meager mental abilities to understand or comprehend. Since such items were too good for them, it was Zirrix’s natural right to take them away for his own purposes. It was of such an object that Zirrix had heard of in Kael Drakkal. While drinking with King Tormax’s personal guards, Zirrix had learned of a certain Gnome that was rumored to live in the Iceclad. He was apparently lost, and was desperate to return home. But, for some reasons of Gnomish class prejudice or feud, no other Pirate would help him. As such, the Lost Gnome had to rely upon others to help it return to Ak’Anon. Zirrix had no love for Gnomes, in fact, quite the opposite. He hated the wrinkled, babbling little pests, and looked forward to the day the Empire would eviscerate the entire tinkering pestilence once and for all. However, for today, the disgusting diminutive had turned out to be of some value. Zirrix had spoken to the pint sized pest, and learned that in exchange for a completed map home, the wrinkled wretch would reward the map finder with an artifact he had found in his wanderings. It was an item of headgear, that when activated, would cast a spell of haste upon the wearer. To a Warrior such as himself, such an item would be an extremely useful addition to Zirrix’s equipment. Thus had he set off to find the pieces of the map, and obtain the prize.<br>
<br>
The first and second pieces were easily found and obtained with but a little killing. The third and fourth piece would prove to be more difficult. In fact, the last piece was said to be possessed by an elusive ancient sea turtle of great power. That would be a campaign of it’s own, but first Zirrix had to obtain the third piece. It was known that a particular scavenger of awesome cunning and ferocity called the Iceclad Ocean it’s home. Even the Giants of Kael kept a watchful eye out for the flying monstrosity. It was a Snow Griffon called Stormfeather, who terrorized the igloos of the Gnomish Pirates. It was a solitary beast, that appeared infrequently and at random times. It would swoop in to carry off a Gnome, or other hapless creature in it’s deadly grip, all to the screams and painful howling of the dying prey. During it’s many attacks, the Griffon had managed to feed upon the holder of one of the map pieces, and now had the object tangled on the fur of it’s leg. Zirrix entered the area where Stormfeather was known to hunt, and prepared for a long wait. Suddenly, as if in answer to his arrival, the flying terror appeared off the coast, and headed directly for the Gnome igloos. As the Pirates scattered, Zirrix charged the beast and launched his attack. Despite his years of experience over the Griffon, the battle was not easy. The beast stuck at Zirrix with talons sharper then razors, and a beak hard as diamond. Zirrix was taking sever injuries, and may have had to withdraw from the vicious avian. Then, something happened that changed the tide of battle. During a strike with his living whip from the Plane of Fear, the Griffon managed to catch the tip of the weapon in it’s mouth. Before Zirrix could react, Stormfeather slashed with its claw, and severed the whip in half. For a second, Zirrix stood stunned. He thought, “How could any mortal being destroy an item of Planer nature?”. But this question, and all others, were quickly pushed to the back of the Teir’dal’s mind, as the Snow Griffon resumed it’s savage attack upon the Warrior. Regaining his concentration, his eyes suddenly narrowed in anger and Zirrix became enraged at the loss of his favorite weapon. Then, as his stoic visage broke into a mask of fury and hatred, he slipped into a berserker’s rage. <br>
<br>
He suddenly rushed in and closed the distance to his enemy. As he threw the broken whip on the ground, he grabbed at one of Stormfeather's deadly claws. Pulling the now startled creature toward him, Zirrix used his other hand and began to pummel the beast about it’s chest and skull with the handle of his sword. As the fight continued, Zirrix ignored the snapping beak seeking his face, and the one remaining free claw, which rend his armor and tore and sliced at his chest. The now severely wounded avian tried to take off, actually carrying Zirrix a few feet aloft. But Zirrix slammed his armored head into the Griffons chest, causing it to lose it’s breath and descend back down again. As they two landed together, Zirrix twisted his body around, causing himself and Stormfeather to crash to the ground together in a tangled heap. As the Griffon screeched in pain and protest, Zirrix grappled to grab the handle of his now destroyed whip, which lay a few feet away. The Griffon clamped it’s beak down on his left arm in a crushing vice, causing Zirrix’s sword to fall from his hand. Ignoring the pain, Zirrix finally grabbed the whip handle with his other hand and returned to the offensive. Bashing the side of avian’s skull with his free elbow, Zirrix broke the feathered monstrosity’s grip upon his now broken arm. Shouting in praise to the Empire and challenge to the bloodied and wildly thrashing Griffon, Zirrix used all his strength and forced the handle into the things snapping maw. Using his weight and will, Zirrix shoved the handle down the things throat, suffocating it. The strangled sounds of gurgled shrieks, pain and anger, mixed with the vehement curses in the fluid and snarling voice of the battling Warrior. After a few moments the struggle was over, and Zirrix rose unsteadily to his feet. He spat at the Griffon’s corpse and kicked it viciously for a few moments, before his strength gave out and his sank to the ground due to fatigue and loss of blood.<br>
<br>
After a brief rest, he regained his energy and pulled the tangled  map piece from the body of his dead enemy. Looking sadly at his now useless whip, which was coved in the gore and blood of his slain enemy, Zirrix had a thought. What better weapon to wield, then the weapon that destroyed his weapon. His face yet again the mask of stoicism that he always wore, Zirrix kneeled down and cut the leg from the carcass of Stromfeather. He returned to the igloos and used a nearby cauldron to boil off the flesh and sinew from the bone. He then removed the Stromfeather claws itself, and fashioned a makeshift leather strap to act as a handle. The weapon was surprisingly well balance, light and strong. With a more stable grip, and a little practice, the claws would prove a formidable weapon. Turning to the direction of Kael Drakkal, Zirrix began his long, cold journey back to the Giant City. Once he arrived, he would rest, recuperate, and plan for the achievement of the final piece of the map. He would plan the attack and destruction of the Great Turtle Lodizal.        <br>
