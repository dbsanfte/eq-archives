Winnower of the Harvest<br>
(12/19/00 5:42:08 pm)<br>
<br>
The Reunion<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The guards had now been gone for several days, and<br>
yet there was no word. No sign. No hope.<br>
<br>
Selilya's duties as Winnower and soldier of hate kept<br>
her near Neriak these days. She could not allow <br>
herself to leave without positive proof of Ernseax's<br>
whereabouts. She feared the worst but hoped for some<br>
intervention by the Prince of Hate himself.<br>
<br>
The daily meals held little interest for her, and she<br>
barely touched anything. The prophet was becoming<br>
concerned for she seemed frail and distracted. This<br>
was not a state of readiness he saw. <br>
<br>
&quot;Selilya, you must take care of yourself,&quot; he voiced.<br>
Yet she merely gave him one of her vintage smiles and<br>
waved him off.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Harvest is strong, Nospiratus,&quot; she chided. &quot;I<br>
am doing my duties. We attain new recruits almost daily.<br>
Our spies continue to gather important intelligence. We<br>
shall have Salidina back any time now. Do not fret, my<br>
friend. Innoruuk's commands are obeyed; His will is<br>
followed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would be remiss, young lady, if I didn't point out<br>
what was going on. Some of us care about you.&quot; He smiled<br>
at her, then reached into his pocket pulling out the silvered<br>
flask filled with his latest brewing triumph. He extended<br>
the flask to Selilya, and she simply grinned, took the flask,<br>
and gulped down a small sample.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is that?&quot; she coughed. Nospiratus laughed and shook<br>
his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, the Halas Heater? Do you like it?&quot; he inquired. &quot;It<br>
was time to try a new recipe. I rather like this. Another<br>
good use of spider legs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selilya involuntarily shivered, then pointed to the door of<br>
her cottage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time for you to go Prophet,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;I have some <br>
work on these scrolls planned. I do thank you for you <br>
concern. You know this. I just want to know where my<br>
husband is...&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded understandingly then departed, closing the door<br>
softly behind himself.<br>
<br>
She lit another lantern before sitting down at her table<br>
yet again to decipher more of Miragul's writings. With all<br>
the events in the guild transpiring recently, she had had<br>
to leave the scrolls untouched longer than she wished, but<br>
tonight she wanted to steal a few hours for herself.<br>
<br>
She just needed the key. The answer was there somewhere.<br>
Sighing, she put her head down on the table and closed her<br>
eyes. The world seemed to slow down...and the voices of<br>
the children down the alley seemed to grow quieter....<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
She lifted her head from the table with a start. The light<br>
from the lanterns had dimmed. It was apparent that she had<br>
drifted to sleep at the table, but something was amiss. <br>
<br>
There was a presence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Selilya?&quot; came the voice. It was weak and raspy. It was..<br>
<br>
&quot;ERNSEAX??&quot; she screamed. She saw the silhouette in the <br>
doorway and ran to it. The pale light of the streetlamps<br>
was barely sufficient for her to make out his features, but<br>
she could tell he was in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly, come in,&quot; she whispered. Her heart was racing.<br>
She helped him into their bedchamber. He wasn't wearing<br>
much of his armor, no doubt to the extent of his injuries.<br>
She sat him down, and reached over to grab the lantern on<br>
their night stand. She all but ran to the fireplace to <br>
grab the kindling to ignite the wick. She gasped at what<br>
she saw looking upon her love.<br>
<br>
His face was clearly paled and scuffed. Bloody bandages<br>
covered his chest and thigh. Yet through all of the pain<br>
he was feeling, he managed a smile, and reached for her.<br>
He wrapped weak arms around her waist and pulled her to<br>
him. She cradled his head in her arms and kissed him <br>
gently on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm home. I'm home,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I couldn't let <br>
them have the victory, Selilya. You need me and I need<br>
you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shhhhh,&quot; she began. &quot;Don't speak another word. You <br>
need to rest now. There will be time for sweet words <br>
tomorrow. For now, sleep, my love.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selilya cleaned his wounds and wrapped new cloths around<br>
them. She would have Nospiratus look at him later, but<br>
for now, she needed to be near him...to hold him...to<br>
gaze upon him...to love him.<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC...welcome back, Ernseax.<br>
