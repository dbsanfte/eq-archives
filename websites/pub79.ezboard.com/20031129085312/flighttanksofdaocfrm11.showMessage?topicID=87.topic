And although not the biggest of servers, theres a tons of Highlander Mercenaries and a handfull of Briton Mercenaries. I'd like to see just as many Saracen Mercenaries.<br>
<br>
I chose Saracen because I wanted to dual wield thrust weapons and have access to Dragonfang. I know I know, I knew going into it that Dragonfang wouldn't be viable...but I don't think thats fair. I think Saracen Mercenaries speccing thrust should become just as viable as those Slash Briton and Highlander mercenaries when it comes to using their weapon skill. <br>
<br>
This is in no way a complaint..I love my mercenary more than I expected I would. It's a pure positional and reactionary fighter. However, we're totally dependent upon Dual Wielding because Thrust is useless to us. Once in a blue moon, literally, I'll both evade and successfully land Dragonfang. For me Dragonfang doesn't deal quite as much damage as Dual Shadows, the stun effect is nice and allows me around three to four extra attacks. <br>
<br>
The point of all this rambling? I think Mercenaries should have atleast Evade II. I've read over this forum, I've seen the arguements against Evade II and why we'll never get it, we're too defensive and etc...but..Not everyone plays a Highlander or even a Briton. I'm play a Saracen Mercenary, my con is low by default and raises only tetriary. I drop faster than any other tank and light tank I'm grouped with which is expected, even with +hits and +con maxed in my template. Ontop of that when going toe-to-toe with another tank class, I can only use Dual Shadows which warrants a defense penalty I can't afford as a Saracen Mercenary. While Highlander and Briton Slash Mercenaries are able to use their Slash anytimes. Yes I know Light Tanks are meant to assist and not go toe-to-toe with tanks, but sometimes you can't avoid it..in RvR you're usually snared and can't avoid such confrontations.<br>
<br>
Really, what defense do we have? We have extra absorb on our armor, thats ALL. Yes we have Evade I and Advanced Evade, but with most mercs high parry checks and the ridiculously low chance to evade, would you miss having Evade I and Advanced Evade all that much?<br>
<br>
I don't get heavily involved into the mathematics behind the game, and how often something should happen and etc. All I know is that in RvR, I as a Saracen Mercenary lack in defense, where Highlander and Briton Slash mercenaries lack in defense they make up in damage and versatility, being able to use Amy Slash and Diamond Slash along with their Dual Wielding styles.<br>
<br>
Purchase Dodger? Really, I tried, even with Augumented Dexterity II, Augumented Quickness II, Dodger II, 200 Dexterity (including Aug Dex II), 157 Quickness (including Aug Qui II). I still evaded once every blue moon. I even took away MoParrying and the +parry from my SC template to lower my chance to parry and hopefully let my evade check more.<br>
<br>
Even if Evade II is out of the question which I don't think it is. There has to be some way to make Thrust viable for Saracen Mercenaries, maybe make Dex and Qui modify the Evade chance more for mercenaries than other classes? It'd increase a thrust Saracen's efficiency while not overpowering Highlander and Briton mercs. <br>
<br>
Just some finishing notes, this post is about making Saracen Thrust Mercenaries more viable. I'm not looking for options on how to make my mercenary better, such as respec to Dodger 5 or respec to Slash. I want to see my spec as viable and as efficient as any other Mercenary spec. I think this can be done through either a thrust style revision from mercenaries or simply raising our evade chance through some method. Also, again, I'm very satisfied with my merc, I just noticed I underperform in areas where I feel I should be equal with the other merc specs. If you agree with me your highness Team Lead (no sarcasm I'm thankful you do this), I hope you could come up with some better ideas than me to suggest. <br>
<br>
I'm new to these boards so take it easy on me if anyone is tired of giving the same response to people like me. This isn't a &quot;please give Evade II&quot; post, I'm just wondering if anyone feels the same about me in regards to Saracen Thrust Mercenaries and their performance compared to other merc specs and other light tanks in general.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nirala>Nirala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mercenary Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 714<br> <font color=#000000>(10/12/03 10:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Saracen Mercenaries</span><hr size=1> Okay, first off, Evade is checked <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>before</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Parry, so lowering your Parry is a BAD move.  As a Saracen your MUCH higher Dex will improve your defense substantially (especially when buffed) so that it balances out the lower Con (ideally anyway).<br>
<br>
I'm Saracen as well (and since this was my very first character, I don't think I even optimised my starting stats...).  While we do tend to miss out on some Weaponskill due to low Str (though Thrust spec does even it out, ya got a bonus there), I think our increased defense tends to balance things.  I personally don't feel that we're lacking anything as a race, especially since we have the option to raise stats through RA's.<br>

Well, I'm a Thrust spec'd Highlander Mercenary.  I've used Thrust since release, and I'm going to have to be honest.... half my styles I use regularly in RvR are Thrust.  Pierce, Basiliskfang mostly.  I complement that with Dual Shadows, and Flank/Shadow's Rain.  I keep Dragonfang on my &quot;solo&quot; hotbar along with reflection/hypnotic darkness.<br>
<br>
If you want a change to Thrust to suit your Mercenary, you'll have to do alot more convincing.  My stance for the upcoming style review is DW is for Mercs.  Slash/Crush/Thrust should be geared for classes that have no other specs.  That way, Slash/Crush/Thrust will automatically be useful as filler for a Merc.<br>

Get rid of our three worthless evade-chains, give us more positionals, utilities and leave the base specs to the other classes.<br>
<br>
I think the up-n-coming Crush changes (well, in the UK) are probably Mythic's attempt to give Crush 'identity' or meaning when compared to the other base specs. What they've really done is give this base spec a load of really good utility styles (the like of which I seriously hope DW can get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  !).... perhaps made (pre-style thinkthrough) to benefit the offensive 'no defense at all FFS' albion tank?<br>
<br>
*Or to stop everyone whining about what the savage has got...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm actually hoping they open out the base specs a little more by way of versatility. At the moment, Slash &quot;is&quot; for anyone in plate, Thrust &quot;is&quot; for infiltrators and, well, like I said about Crush. Maybe it should originally have been tailored for the hybrid armsman or something, heh. <br>
<br>
My thought on Saracen Thrust mercs - if you knew you weren't gonna get Dragonfang as a viable style, then you should have just picked your race based on what looks/stats you wanted. I too would love Evade2, though I have no decent moves to do after it (Slash Brit), but our Qui is far from amazing and TBH it's a bit of a joke. On the other hand, you should have great parrying, and though your offensive slash-crush stat (str) and lower HP (by about 50) might balance this out, you will still do better thrust damage than any other Albion merc. Just think you traded 10 con for 10 'offensive-defensive' stat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=87.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=87.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=87.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.threadControl?topicID=87.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=87.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=87.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm11>Ask the Mercenary TL</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
