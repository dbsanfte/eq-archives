Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Camelot 1.56b Test Release Notes <br>
<br>
Tuesday, November 26, 2002 <br>
<br>
======================================= <br>
<br>
<br>
1.56b has a lot of class tweaks and balance changes, and new stuff to test. Hunters and Warriors get the love their team leads and community have been asking for. We've re-implemented the new resurrection system so that there is minimal impact on anyone's playing style, and even introduced a new healing system for each Realm's primary healers that will make keeping people alive in RvR much easier. We have also taken steps to address the problems of Assassins being able to fight in melee combat better than we intended. Read through these notes closely. <br>
<br>
<br>
HUNTER CHANGES <br>
<br>
We've decided to make Hunters more effective in Melee combat. These changes will help them greatly in both PvE as well as RvR: <br>
<br>
- All Hunter melee skills base damages have been increased &quot;behind the scenes&quot;. The specific melee skills involved are sword and spear. Hunters will now notice that they do more damage every time they attack an opponent with these weapon types. Hunters now do more base damage than the other two Archer classes, and will not need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it will happen automatically every time they hit with a weapon. <br>
<br>
- Hunters have been given a new line of spells in their Beastcraft specialization that allows them to insta-cast a wolf pet. This can be done at any time, even in combat. These are shouts that cost 25% power and have a 30 second recast time. Please note that if a Hunter is controlling a charmed pet, they cannot summon a wolf pet. Here's the list: <br>
<br>
1 Hunter's Companion 80% <br>
7 Hunter's Pet 80% <br>
13 Hunter's Ally 80% <br>
20 Hunter's Protector 80% <br>
32 Hunter's Avatar 82% <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WARRIOR CHANGE <br>
<br>
In order to make the Warrior more of a melee damage-dealer, we've increased his weapon skills (again, behind the scenes, as with the Hunter) so that he will do more damage every time he hits with an Axe, Hammer, or Sword (both 1 and 2h). With this change, the Warrior now does more base damage than any other class in the game. Warriors don't need to do anything to take advantage of this change - it will happen automatically every time they hit with a weapon. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ASSASSIN CLASS CHANGES <br>
<br>
Because of the great advantages Assassin classes - Nightshades, Shadowblades, and Infiltrators - now have over almost any other class in the game (poisons, stealth, devastating combat styles, good base damage, extremely high evade, etc.), we've decided to take some steps to bring them back in line with the rest of the classes in the game. We realize that these three classes are not exactly the same, but they all have a combination of abilities that make them more powerful than other classes of their level. The overall design goal of the assassin is to have them be able to defeat opponents using a combination of stealth and their &quot;backstab&quot; combat style chains. Now, with these changes, they'll have to use more strategy to defeat their target opponents. There's no way to sugar coat this - these steps will make Assassins less effective in direct combat. <br>
<br>
- We've removed the Ignore Pain Realm Ability from all three Assassin classes. These classes have been granted back the realm training points they spent to get Ignore Pain. It was an oversight that Assassins were given IP at all, and we should have taken it away sooner. <br>
<br>
- We are capping the maximum amount that any player (of any class) can evade at 50%. Assassins are the only classes that can currently go above this cap, by linking together their Evade 7 ability, plus the Realm Ability Dodger, plus bonuses from dexterity. Assassins will be granted a Realm Ability respec for those who no longer want Dodger ability (as it is usually Dodger that pushes them above 50%). Please note that you will get the realm ability respec only if you currently have Dodger and you are either a Nightshade, a Shadowblade, or an Infiltrator. <br>
<br>
Of course we know that the Assassin community in general will not like these changes - however, this is one of those things we have to do for the good of the game. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPREAD HEAL SPELLS AND BATTERY HEAL REALM ABILITY <br>
<br>
The three base healing classes (Clerics, Healers, Druids) now have a new type of healing spell that will help them in heavy battle - particularly RvR - situations. This spell type is called a &quot;Spread Heal&quot;. These spells need no target - they search through the group applying healing power to whoever is lowest in health (As a percentage of their max, not as a straight value) until the group is full or the pool has been used. These spells should be especially useful in RvR encounters where targeting is a problem and many people can be taking damage at the same time. In normal PvE encounters or where one target specifically is taking the most damage, directed heals remain the most efficient and effective option. When everyone in the group is low, standard group heals remain the best option. Spreadheals fall somewhere in between - when some members of the group are still full or near full, and some members are falling fast, these heals will be the most efficient option. <br>
<br>
Cleric Rejuvenation spec <br>
30 Gift of the Host <br>
39 Boon of the Host <br>
48 Blessing of the Host <br>
<br>
Healer Mend spec <br>
30 Ancestor's Gift <br>
39 Ancestor's Favor <br>
48 Ancestor's Boon <br>
<br>
Druid Regrowth spec <br>
30 Regenerating Spirits <br>
39 Resuscitating Spirits <br>
48 Reviving Spirits <br>
<br>
<br>
Battery of Life Realm Ability <br>
<br>
Also, a new realm ability is now available to the primary healers in each realm at a 10 realm point cost, called Battery of Life, which is a different variety of spreadheal. It allows the user to create a spreadheal pool which essentially remains on him as a battery, checking every round to see if anyone needs healing and applying it when needed just like a spreadheal. If the entire battery is not used, the remaining amount remains on the caster waiting to be used. This ability should also be particularly useful in RvR - it can grant the healer the initiative to heal before everyone in his group starts taking damage. As soon as the group begins taking damage they're already being healed by the battery, and the healer can begin casting another spell which will hopefully be cast before the battery runs out. The battery and the spreadheal used together should go a long way towards allowing healers in RvR to do what they're intended to do - keep the group alive as long as they have the power left to do so. One important difference to note about the battery from spreadheal - it does not flow into the caster, only their group mates. This is not intended to be an automatic complete heal for the healer. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RESURRECTION SPELL CHANGES <br>
<br>
We're now ready to go back into testing with a modified version of our Resurrection system change that we started working on in 1.55. Due to the recent change where you now receive Realm Points for resurrecting your realm-mates in RvR battles, we've had to change some of the resurrection spells. Here's the list: <br>
<br>
- All resurrection spells now have a 4 second cast time. <br>
<br>
- The power costs for all resurrection spells have not been changed. <br>
<br>
- When casting a rez spell, you receive a message and the spell cancels if the target is already considering a res from someone else. <br>
<br>
- Resurrection sickness now goes from 100% to 50% when doing a &quot;full rez&quot; on another player. <br>
<br>
- Low level resurrection spells now give 5% RP's to the caster and high level rezzes do up to 15% of the RP's to the caster. Mid level ones are between the two. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW INTERFACE OPTIONS FOR EXPANSION CLIENT <br>
<br>
With 1.55b comes some new interface options for Dark Age of Camelot Expansion Shrouded Isles Client: <br>
<br>
- You can now choose one of three interfaces (&quot;classic&quot;, &quot;Shrouded Isles&quot;, and &quot;Transparent&quot;) from the options window in the main menu of the game. Classic is the original game's interface, the SI interface is a more modern looking version, and Transparent is a minimalist implementation. Please note that there are some font issues with the Transparent interface that we are currently looking into. <br>
<br>
- There is a new window - the Command Window - which has two rows of buttons of commonly-used Camelot commands. You'll find things like &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;relic status&quot; and so forth on this window. We are currently working on making these buttons drag-able to the hotbar - that will come in a near-future patch. <br>
<br>
- There is a new &quot;Options&quot; window (displayed by clicking &quot;options&quot; from the character stat/information window). This dialog lets you specify in-game settings like sound/music/ambience/ambient music volumes, clipping plane, shadows, water settings, name-color scheme, and other methods of tweaking the game. Please note that the sound effect settings are not hooked up in this version - we'll get that working soon. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ART NOTES <br>
<br>
We are finally truly implementing the new player helm system (the one that we started on last Friday). In the new system, there will be many more helm/texture combinations that have previously existed. Now, you can have leather, studded, reinforced, scale, chain, and plate versions of almost all helmets. These helmet changes will be on both the original game as well as the expansion, so we've tried to make the helmets that replace the ones you are used to looking at as visually close as possible. <br>
<br>
This system is still being tweaked, so you may notice some bad texturing or - especially if you are a Troll, Kobold, or Inconnu - your ears may stick out. We're working on fine tuning the system now that it is in the game. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- We now support eight characters per realm per server. Please test this thoroughly on Pendragon and Gaheris, as we are now using a new character server altogether, and it may have issues. Please check out your vault, your inventory, etc. for oddities of any kind. <br>
<br>
- Healing-type classes will now receive Realm Points for resurrecting a friendly player. Please note that you will not get Realm Points for resurrecting someone if they did not &quot;give&quot; Realm Points when they were killed. Also please note that the number of RPs you can get from one resurrection is capped at 2x the RPs that you yourself are worth. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ORIGINAL CONTINENT WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
Note - all of the below quest fixes were read onto the live servers this afternoon. <br>
<br>
Midgard <br>
<br>
A Deed of Old: Players should no longer have difficulty completing this quest. Just return and speak to Aleaniver. <br>
<br>
Hibernia <br>
<br>
Roane Skin: Nightshades should be able to get this quest again now. <br>
<br>
Seek the Moonstone: Empar has returned to his normal location, and players on this quest can now interact with him again. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COOPERATIVE SERVER NOTES <br>
<br>
Frontier Keeps: Ambassador Crae respawning over and over when killed at Dun Crimthainn has been fixed. Caer Benowyc, Arvakr Faste, Dun Bolg and Dun Nged will now switch between monsters and realm guards correctly. <br>
<br>
All monster held &quot;Frontier keep&quot; doors will now spawn with the correct number of hit points. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXPANSION WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
Midgard/Aegir <br>
<br>
- More named guards have been added to Aegir’s Landing. They can be found at the two guard towers near Aegirhamn and in Dyrfjall. <br>
<br>
- Tuscaren Glacier: Will monsters in the Tuscaren Glacier will now spawn immediately after a server reset. After this initial spawning the dungeon's spawn cycle will operate like it normally does. <br>
<br>
- Aegir's Landing: Renamed some 'sand ooze' monsters to 'granulator' to match up to what they were changed to elsewhere. These monsters spawn via AI rather than by normal <br>
means. In setting up the AI spawning several alternate versions of the original 'sand ooze' were created to facilitate the spawn system. The alternates now have the proper names. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hibernia/Hy Brasil <br>
<br>
- More named guards have been added to Domnann. They can be found at the guard towers between the Grove of Domnann and Bann-didein, as well as around Bann-didein. <br>
<br>
- Players can no longer exchange their Guardian Leaf Gloves with Syrana. All players should be receiving a working pair of gloves from the quest now. <br>
<br>
<br>
Albion / Avalon: <br>
<br>
- Dales of Devwy: Fixed some path AI problems on Ris'nir Cruss which caused him to walk in a very large endless circular loop. He will now properly follow his path. This will also fix the spawning of Ris'nir's 'avalonian apparitions' which he calls to infest derelict houses south of the river in the eastern region of the Dales. <br>
<br>
- Some 'avalonian apparition' monsters were scaled incorrectly. These have been fixed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Treasure, General <br>
<br>
- Items for the expansion classes are now available on the appropriate Darkness Falls merchants. <br>
