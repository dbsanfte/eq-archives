<br>
The southern states decided they no longer consented to be part of the united states, and seceded.  The federal government decided they didn't have the right to do so, war was begun.  <br>
<br>
Freeing slaves was NEVER a goal of the Northern states.  It was a tactic to try and disrupt the southern economy and lifestyle, and bolster the forces in the Northern army. <p></br>

The Revolutionary War was about Taxation Without Representation(tm).  Was money a factor?  sure.<br>
<br>
The War of Northern Agression was about States Rights.  Was slavery a factor?  Sure, it was one of the issues the 2 regions couldn't agree on.  But the was was still about State's Rights. <p></br>

<br>
Representation in what regards?  you mean in deciding on taxes?<br>
<br>
Independence war was about not having a say about the money that was taken out of the colonies.. plain and simple.<br>
<br>
Lets say they had gotten representation... which what have meant what?  1-2 representatives?  and they would do what?<br>
<br>
Fight the new taxes against the colonies?<br>
<br>
The south wanted to seccede cause they felt that if there were more states in the union without slaves.. they would sooner or later end up loosing their &quot;right&quot; to own other humans as slaves.<br>
<br>
They felt better to seccede now... before the vote was taken to abolish slavery... than later when such a vote would arise and the mayority of the states would be anti-slavery.<br>
<br>
Or can you claim that sooner or later that vote wasn't going to happen?<br>

<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
The South seceded to protect its right to enslave other humans. Lincoln's party had a big component of abolitionists in it and the South feared he would try to restrict or abolish slavery, in spite of his denials.<br>
<br>
The North fought initially to preserve the union, and tried terribly hard to ignore slavery as an issue, because they wanted to keep Maryland, Delaware and Kentucky in the union, and those were slave-holding states.<br>
<br>
As the war went on, as so often happens, the war aims of the North expanded from preservation of the union to abolition of slavery. A reason of pure politics (since you don't want to admit anyone could be so altruistic as to want to free someone from bondage) was to dissuade (on moral grounds) Britain and France from intervening on behalf of the South.<br>
<br>
But to say that no one in the North cared about slavery is so completely, utterly, wrongheaded that I can't help but /boggle.<br>
<br>
People in the North had horribly racist attitudes about black people, but they were not fans of slavery either.<br>
<br>
My town is full of stops on the Underground Railroad. People rioted in Boston to prevent captured slaves from being returned to their masters in the South.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; was not a best seller because it attacked states' rights, but because it graphically exposed the evils of slavery.<br>

I will always believe that slavery was a convenient battle cry, just as the &quot;poor invaded people of Kuwait&quot; was one for protecting the US oil interests.  Think about how many times Africa has changed geographical faces, many times using the tool of genocide and we turned our cheek.  Same with South America.<br>

Most of the countries industry was based in the Northern states, while the south was mostly agricultural. The economy of the world at the time was still based on textiles and manufactured goods. This slowly made the Northern states rich and slowly started to bankrupt the southern states. A new Tariff on imported goods further weakened the South's economy. With this weakened economy the south desperately depened on the cheap labor the slaves provided. With laws passed causing imported goods to become more and more expensive and all the money in the country moving to the North the Southern States began talking of secession. Also the threat of the abolision of slavery pushed the South to secession.<br>
<br>
To simply say that the American Civil War was simply caused because by the salvery issue or because it was JUST for the tarriffs is ludicrous and an uneducated answer.<br>
<br>
I suppose you want to tell me that WWI was started just because Franz Ferdinand was murdered, or that WWII was started JUST because Hitler advanced into Poland. <br>
<br>
There are MANY reasons why wars begin. You cannot just pick one and say that was the cause.<br>

I can't help but think you are a Northerner. History is written by the winners. The North wanted it to be about Slavery to make it look like they were right. So that is what was written in History texts.  We all know that there are two sides to every story. Make a trip to the South and talk to a Historian. I'm sure that you would get a TON of information from them.<br>
