Enjoying the lag free zone getting some exp and having fun. <br>
<br>
The next thing I know Aeranae, Handol and Aerinae come in and start camping the zone line with me.  I walk up to them and say &quot;ummm I am hunting here&quot; ... no response then they start talking in an unknown tongue.  I say &quot; sorry can not understand you&quot;  shrug no response.  I pull a mob and solo it.  I start to get mad,  no /ooc camp check ( like they could not tell I was hunting there) no nothing. Just walk up and take my hunting ground. I finish up my mob and go to pull another one.  And what do I see two of the trio dead and the third one almost dead.  Too bad I went LD ATM to watch the finish of this fight.  When I log back in I see all of the trio dead on the ground.  All I could do was chuckle to myself.  What comes around goes around.  <br>
<br>
So I decided to send a tell to an officer ( Quos ) just to say hey FYI your guild members are camp stealing.  Not really wanting anything done just an FYI and maybe a sorry that happen. Did not even get that.  <br>

<br>
As for the unknown tongues, they're weird and they like to talk in unknown tongues. I'm gonna guess it wasn't to personally offend you in anyway.<br>
<br>
They died and learned their lesson... most likely. They're nice peeps and I could never see them trying to intentionally take over your camp. I'm guessing it was a mishap and they were being flighty (which we're all known to do once in a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
If you should have issues in the future, please be sure to let Cwenah, Infi or Kuros know. They are our officers and can deal directly. Again, sorry for the confusion on their part. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=FF66CC strength=5);font-family:georgia;font-weight:BOLD;font-size:'10pt'"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20525><font color=#FFFFFF>

We understood that he was camping there, when he cleary stated &quot;ummm I am camping here.&quot; he was the only one in zone at that time so we where going to move to another postion in the zone to pull to. As where making our way past all the stuff he had killed we ran into a bit of trouble and rin and ran died. I zoned. If this guy thinks we where camping I am sorry. As far as the unkown tounge hell we are teaching each other out tounges. I could get all complain about how many other times we all had camps stolen, but thats just part of the game and I have learned to live with it. I am just a little pissed that this guy / person did not even send me a tell asking if we where camping, maybe I dont talk to bears in the game ( hell i have seen kodiak bears travel across WC to kill, not a joke really happens). <br>
<br>
It is only a game I play to relax and this kinda really offends me that someone complains and does not even speak to me and just asumes that because that we are killing something that is camp stealing.<br>
<br>
anyways . I am sorry for the trouble . Sorry that this even came this far.<br>

*clears throat* <br>
<br>
 We zoned in to chardok and DID see that Whytstar was killing mobs at the zone in using the pull solo , Root .. nuke nuke method , I know where the spawns are in that area and suggested to Ran and Handol that we move down the tunnel some so that we could leave the front end to the Lvl 57 Shaman and take our mobs from further in .  Ran pulled a couple from further in and we killed them in the tunnel. When I ran oom I pleaded for a mana break and we ran back to the front corner to med. Whytstar was in bear form and was looking directly at us . So sis commented on the Cute Teddy bear in Elvish , I /hugged and said that it was soft and fluffy in Elvish , Wytstar replied in /say that he /she did not understand our language so I switched to barbarian and asked if that was his /her language , he/ she Replied that it was but said no more ,I made mention to Whytstar that there was a pop behind him/ her and Whytstar pulled and proceeded to kill it.  Ran and I had a bit of ridiculous chat in Dwarvish after that as I commented that her Dwarvish sucked and that her Barbarian was worse  . We laughed and moved back down the hall when I was FM , there were no pops in the Frontend yet so we were able to continue safely back down the tunnel . Ran then pulled the mother of all bad pulls by accident and ran them back to us . I did see her Health drop and she was dead , started the Evac but accidentally Foraged instead, ( oops) and Handol botched a LOH trying to save me . It turns out that Ran had pulled 2 Sniffers and 1 Sarnak .. We then got an Add from the pops near the frontend. so I was killed nearly instantly and Handol survived . I went LD in the bazaar and couldnt get back in right away. Handol rezzed Ran and they waited for me right near where Whytstar was medding , I came back in , Handol  Rezzed me . I saw Whytstar camp out .. then Ran decided that she should LD .. .Waited 15 min then ported out . At no time was there ever any complaint or mention of KSing or Camp stealing as there were more than enough mobs for everyone . I am sorry if there was a misunderstanding or Inconvenience but I do not regret it since there was no mention at the time . If my guildmates have any questions regarding this situation please send me a tell in game .<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time .<br>

That bit in guildchat, that was a wonderful mistell to Rin about why I hadn't posted a reply to this yet. I was so hot looking at this that I would of said or done something really stupid if I didn't take time to cool off.<br>

hope this is all cleared up if you read this Whystar. Rin, Ran, and Handol are weird (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but a couple of the nicest people you'll meet in the game. <br>

When I go to places where people are camping,  I try and tell them I am just waiting for a friend, or passing through good hunting etc.  This allows every to have fun with no worries.  Oh and I do tell them in common tongue so no misunderstanding happen.<br>
