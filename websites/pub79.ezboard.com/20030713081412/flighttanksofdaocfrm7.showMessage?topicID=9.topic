<br>
The Mercenary is doing better, and we're looking forward to the other changes on the way. However, we're still not convinced the Mercenaries are living up to the expectations we had for them based on the information on the camelot web site and the manual.<br>
<br>
Recent Changes:<br>
<br>
Dual Wield received at level 5 - Thanks! It makes much more sense this way.<br>
<br>
Thrusting initiate weapon now received - Thanks for that too!<br>
<br>
Missing style bugs fixed - Yay!<br>
<br>
Style endurance costs and damage output tweaked - A great change benefiting all melee classes <br>
<br>
Bugs:<br>
<br>
No outstanding bugs to report at this time.<br>
<br>
Major Issues:<br>
<br>
Lack of a unique ability - Mercenaries are the only class in the realm of Albion that has to share every single one of their abilities with some other class. While it's true some other classes seem to lack uniqueness, all of them still have at least one skill or specialization that no other class does, except for Mercenaries. This also denies them any role in RVR other than &quot;weak tank.&quot; Many players had ideas for unique skills to give Merc's. I have covered this in previous reports, and I do know that Mythic is already working on a unique skill for Mercenaries.<br>
<br>
Still being outdamaged - Despite the 10% increase in the base Dual Wield chance, we are still being outdamaged by 2-handed weapon users in the field. Why is this? A few reasons - 1) the big &quot;first hit&quot; that 2-handed weapon users get is not negated by our better damage variance because the average fight is too short, 2) the DW style list is much less effective than the Polearm and 2-handed weapon style lists, and 3) the bonus damage from our styles is limited to only half what it should be because it is only applied to the right hand weapon and not the left hand weapon. 2-handers get bonus damage dependant on their total damage that hit, but we often get bonus damage dependant on only half our total damage that hit (1 weapon out of 2 used). More details below.<br>
<br>
Negating the &quot;first hit&quot; damage of 2-handed weapons - You hit (battle_length/weapon_delay) plus 1 times in a battle. <br>
<br>
That plus 1 is your opening hit. <br>
<br>
Both slow and fast weapons have that 1. But, for slow hard-hitting weapons, that 1 is a huge percentage additional damage. <br>
<br>
Based off both in-game and out-of-game studies, it gives 2-handed users a 25% edge on the Dual-Wielder, taking all considerations into account. If the battles were 4 times as long, this wouldn't be a problem, but they're short, especially in RVR, so it's a big difference.<br>
<br>
The easiest solution - give us a big first hit too. Here's a simple idea - along with whatever else you have planned for our special ability, give us a timer-based attack, able to do about once per fight, that does a chunk of extra damage. The idea is to use it near the beginning of each fight, such that our &quot;first hit&quot; is almost as good as the 2-handed users. To keep with the Merc theme, make it &quot;Cheap Shot&quot; or something.<br>
<br>
An alternate solution - give us a base 0.5% increase in chance to Dual Wield every character level, independant of and in addition to specialization in the DW skill (making a max of 75% chance to double hit at level 50). This may increase our damage output enough to compensate for the big bonus of the first hit of 2-handed weapon users.<br>
<br>
Dual Wield style list problem - Polearms and 2-handed weapons get several no-opening style chains to do great damage at any time. Dual Wield is the only style list in the game that doesn't have any no-opening style chains - even Celtic Dual has one. This means after the first hit, the 2-handed users maintain higher damage output by their superior styles. Solution: Make the Dual Wield style Eclipse (spec 12) to be a no opening style. Then change Dark Tendrils (spec 34) to chain off of the new Eclipse. These two styles are never used by Mercenaries anyway - the first is a chain off of Shadow's Edge, but we already get another style that chains off of Shadow's Edge that's actually better. The second is a reactionary style off of Evade that doesn't chain into anything - but we already get a 2-style chain off of Evade and one off of Parry, so we don't need (or use) that one either. Transforming these unused styles into a 2-style no-opening chain would fill this severe gap in our style list and allow us to have a decent style chain to use in RVR or soloing. Combined with the above, our damage output will finally make losing shields and platemail seem worthwhile!<br>
<br>
Dual Wield style functionality problem - A Dual Wield style only gives it's bonus damage based on the right hand weapon, and it always forces you to use that weapon. This means we are essentially getting a style bonus penalty compared to 2-handed users. The style bonus damage should be applied to BOTH weapons if we happen to Dual Wield during that style - otherwise, we are only really getting half of our bonus damage. The is another reason 2-handed users outdamage us - every time they do a style, they get bonus damage dependant on their total damage for that hit, but every time we do a style, we only get bonus damage dependant on half of our total damage - i.e. one weapon out of our two that hit. Please look into this.<br>
<br>
Shortbows can't be trained - Armsmen can put spec points into Crossbows to increase their accuracy and base damage. We can't train in Shortbows. This makes no sense, since we do get Shortbows earlier, it seems we would be trained in how to use them - yet once again, we are outclassed by Armsmen .<br>
<br>
No use in RVR - We want to fit a role in RVR. We are tired of just being light tanks without any of the assumed benefits of the definition. We want to be light infantry, shock troops, to run in quickly, harass the enemy and soften them up, cause some chaos, and be followed up by the main force of our army (heavy tanks and casters). We expect to die quickly because of this, but that's just the nature of being a light tank. We also want to be feared by archers and casters because of our increased ability to close in on them and take them down. But right now, this isn't possible.<br>
<br>
The problem, however, is not easily solved. The obvious solution would be increased mobility, but that would give other benefits that could throw PVE balance out of whack - such as increased ability to escape from a bad fight, lower travel times, etc. This is not what we're after and not something Mythic is willing to give us.<br>
<br>
We have devised a solution that should give us the role in RVR we desire without unbalancing us in any other aspects. Please give this idea your serious consideration for inclusion into the Mercenary class as well as blademasters and Bezerkers.<br>
<br>
Ability: Charge (given at level 20?)<br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
- You must have a target.<br>
- The target must be an enemy.<br>
- The target must be in your current cone of view and visible to you.<br>
- The target must be within a certain distance of you.<br>
<br>
- You press the Charge button.<br>
<br>
- You immediatly lose a chunk of endurance<br>
- Your character runs at high speed (at least as fast as the Hunter's speed boost ability) directly toward the target.<br>
- Your character cannot be steered by you, and cannot be stopped by you.<br>
- If your target dies before you get to them or they stealth or get out of range or you charge for too long, then you stop automatically.<br>
- Once your character reaches your target, the charge is over and you auto-attack your target (kind of like when you use a Style and it turns auto-attack on for you).<br>
- You must now wait for a timer before you can Charge again.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this ability would not decrease travel times, nor would it allow you to escape a bad fight (since you have to attack an enemy to use it, which would just make the situation worse). What it would do is allow us to charge into the battle quickly in an effort to take out weaker characters and act as shock troops. Optional things you could do is to give a higher Charge at a later level - perhaps one that also grants resistance to mez/stun or allows dodging of arrows while charging to make it easier to get close to casters and archers. But that's just fluff, the main thing we want is what is described above.<br>
<br>
Minor Issues:<br>
<br>
The level 50 Dual Wield style sucks - Reports coming in from level 50 Mercenaries that Amethyst Slash, a spec 29 Slash skill, does far better damage, as well as being easier to use, then the 50 DW spec Dual Shadows (a front positional style). Amethyst Slash as listed as low/medium damage and Dual Shadows is listed as medium damage, but this doesn't seem to be what is actually happening.<br>
<br>
Level 40 epic quest rewards unsuitable - The DPS and proc of the weapons given for this quest are fine, but the speed is much too slow, and they can't be used in the offhand. Mythic is the one that told us we should be using fast weapons in order to be good at Dual-Wielding. Why then are you giving us these slow weapons that we can't even use in our left hand? Mercenaries are using Barrows drops instead because of the better delay. Please make these rewards faster weapons (if you need to, lower the power of the procs to keep it balances).<br>
<br>
Reactionary Styles Problems - Reactionary styles are difficult to execute in laggy conditions or when fighting double-hitting monsters (why can monsters double-hit with two handed weapons anyway? No player class can ever hope to double attack with polearms, so why can humanoid NPC's?). The reason for this is that just after parrying/evading and pressing the reactionary style button, by the time the server gets the message that you want to do that style the monster has already attacked again and the style fails (epsecially if it's a double-hitting monster and it was the first hit of the double-hit that you parried/evaded, then it's completely impossible). This game traditionally has tried to avoid forcing people to have &quot;twitch skills&quot; but these styles are difficult to do even for the experienced twitch gamer. I suggest instead of forcing it to be &quot;after the action but before you get attacked again&quot; have it be a straight timer like &quot;within 3 seconds of when you parried/evaded&quot; regardless of whether or not you were attacked again during that time.<br>
<br>
Beartooth thrust style - This style is based off of Block, which Mercenaries essentially never do. Please consider changing it to react to something else.<br>
<br>
Using Shields in RVR - Since a shield and our secondary weapon both go into the same slot, it is very difficult to quickly switch to a shield for purposes of blocking arrows/spells in RVR. Please consider allowing our secondary weapon or shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield weapon combo.<br>
<br>
Parry and Dual Wield - Many players felt that while Dual Wielding, the chance to Parry should be increased since we have two weapons to parry with. Parry chance should be 1.5 - 2x normal while a second weapon is equipped. This would ensure our defensive superiority to Infilitrators (they don't get Parry, but they do get DW Evade VI rogue stuff compared to our DW Evade I chain), improve our chances of doing reactionary styles (if they are fixed to work off of Parry instead of Evade I) and allow us to be emergency backup tanks if no Paladins or Armsmen can be found. This may be unbalancing though, testing would be needed (and I'd rather have our damage output increased and be given some unique ability before considering a defensive boost, at least for now).<br>
<br>
High solo downtime - Mercenaries still have some of the worst solo downtime I've seen. This is largely because by the end of a solo fight they have very little HP left and no way to recover it. I think fixing a lot of the above issues would take care of this, but one other option would be to give some kind of downtime-decreasing skill such as Mend from EQ's monks, or if you give us Second Wind perhaps make it increase HP as well as Endurance, or implement bandages or potions or something. This isn't a big deal though, just a suggestion.<br>
<br>
Lack of spec path variety - This may not really be much of an issue since some would consider this a benefit (less decisions, more focused power), but there’s really very few paths open to the Mercenary - most just max a weapon and Dual Wield and dump the rest in Parry. Some may argue that you could put a lot in shields, but there is absolutely no good reason to do that - if you wanted to have high spec in shield and sacrifice Dual Wield, you’d be better off with an Armsman or Paladin who gets all the same skills plus better armor and more HP. Perhaps Shield spec should be replaced with a different spec altogether, one unique to the Mercenary class to set it apart.<br>
<br>
Balance:<br>
<br>
The Mercenary is doing fairly well against blues, and can solo yellows in the right conditions. We are a bit better than we were before with recent changes. However, we are still easily the weakest tank of the realm of Albion, and for the game in general for that matter (with the exception of the blademaster).<br>
<br>
Questions:<br>
<br>
Dual Wield chance affected by enemy level? - Does the level of the mob you are fighting affect your chance to do a double-hit? If so, this could be the factor that's messing up the math - I don't think mob level affects the 15% bonus damage that 2-handed users get, or the damage bonus from using Left Axe, but if it affects the chance to double-hit with Dual Wield then that would explain a lot of the damage output complaints I am getting and the reason our percentages in tests never seem to hit what they are supposed to...<br>
<br>
Quick Breakdown<br>
<br>
These are most of the changes we'd like to see made in a quick summary:<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Add some unique/interesting ability to the Mercenary to make them more desirable to play similar to how Bezerkers get Bezerk and (later) Shapeshifting.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Make the Dual Wield style Eclipse (spec 12) to be a no opening style. Then change Dark Tendrils (spec 34) to chain off of the new Eclipse. This will make these unused styles useful as a 2-style no-opening chain, which Dual Wield doesn't have currently (Left Axe has a 3-style no-opening chain, by comparison...).<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; When we do a double-hit while using a style, have the bonus damage from the style applied to BOTH weapons, otherwise we are getting only half the bonus damage out of our styles when compared to 2-handed weapon users.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Give Merc's, BM's, and Zerker's the Charge ability as outlined above, with the restritions outlined to prevent it from giving any mobility advantages other than charging toward an enemy.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Allow us to train in Shortbows like Armsmen can train in Crossbows.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; When our unique skill is added, consider including a timer-based strong hit that does significant damage, that can be used about once per fight, to give us a decent &quot;first hit&quot; like 2-handed users get. OR, give us a base 0.5% increase in chance to Dual Wield every character level, independant of and in addition to specialization in the DW skill (making a max of 75% chance to double hit at level 50).<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Allow shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield/weapon combo for RVR purposes.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Improve reactionary styles interface to be more lag friendly (by allowing them to be done based on a straight timer rather than &quot;before getting hit again&quot; or &quot;before attacking again&quot;)<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; If the chance to do a double-hit while using Dual Wield is affected by the enemy's level, please remove this factor. It is unfair considering that the 15% 2-handed bonus and the Left Axe bonus damage are unaffected in this way (other then the normal damage reduction from a high level mob that we all have to deal with). This could be the reason that DW/CD still seems to do less damage then expected.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Consider an increased chance to Parry while using Dual Wield, since we have 2 weapons to parry with and/or consider allowing Parry to block arrows when Dual Wielding, and remove our Shield spec since arrow blocking is about the only thing we use shields for anyway.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
While the Mercenary has the potential to be a fun class, and the recent change to Dual Wield has increased their appeal, a lot of Mercenary players are still disenchanted with the class's lack of uniqueness and are dissapointed with how it compares to Armsmen. Overall the class has great potential and a good concept from a roleplaying perspective, but there is little compelling reason to play one when compared to classes like the Armsmen and the Bezerker. They also have no abilities, skills, or traits to reflect their &quot;light tank&quot; or &quot;Guild of Shadows&quot; or &quot;blade for hire&quot; background.<br>
