<br>
Put all of them on shorter timers, like 3 minutes. When I think &quot;berserker,&quot; I imagine someone who goes berserk more often than once every 7 minutes. The duration for the effects should be equalized and at shorter durations than current ones, something like 15 seconds. The shorter durations would balance out being able to use the powers more often. I would really prefer an ability that's usable more often but doesn't last as long.<br>
<br>
Next, the specific changes to the class abilities:<br>
<br>
Berserkers should have a hp boost while their ability is active, like the hero's ability, but not as powerful since berserkers will have a damage advantage. The added hp represent the berserker's ability to keep on fighting after taking a whole bunch of hits and somewhat counteracts their lack of parry. At the same time, they have an endurance boost. They keep the same damage boost.<br>
<br>
Blademasters should have the ability to activate any positional or reactive style at will while their triple wield is up, even when the opening requirements for initiating the style are not met. The positional and reactive styles normally represent taking advantage of openings in the enemy defense to do superior attacks. By distracting the foe, the third blade helps to create openings where they normally would not exist, allowing the blademaster to continously use better styles for a while. The third blade also has a chance to redirect the effects of hostile spells that hit the blademaster, like a Jedi's lightsaber redirects blaster shots. The spell effect is redirected at the blademaster's current target, or at the original caster if the blademaster has targetted nobody. The target of redirection must be within range of the spell's caster, or the caster just gets hit. The subject must simply be targetted, not necessarily attacked. The ability works even if the blademaster is just part of an enemy AoE. He redirects the portion of the effect he would have suffered. If the blademaster is standing within an allied AoE, there is a check to make his target take the effects that the blademaster would have suffered had he not been allied with the caster. If the target redirected at would have been hit by the AoE anyway, he acts as if only hit by one spell effect, but only counts as a character half his true level and having half his resistances for purposes of calculating power of the spell. The redirection chance should be based on the blademaster's parry. Of course, the triple wield is also a damage add, as usual, but should be toned down a little because the redirection ability is pretty strong.<br>
<br>
Mercenary dirty tricks should actually have a chance to blind the enemy with a successful attack while the ability is active. By blindness, I don't mean the fumble chance. Eliminate the fumble entirely, and instead make the enemy player's screen black for a few seconds when he's hit to actually BLIND him. At the same time, the target looses the ability to stick, face, or follow, so he really is blind. He can keep attacking or cast spells or whatever, but he doesn't know whether or not the merc is in front of him, so he'll have a lot of trouble actually hitting a merc with anything. The merc, of course, doesn't stay in the target's forward arc to get hit, but moves around to the side to do positionals and stuff. This ability would be much more useful against casters than the current dirty tricks. They aren't bothered by a little fumble chance. They could freak out and run, but wouldn't know what they are running into. Assassins who target a blinded foe can use backstab or perforate artery without being in stealth mode (since the target can't see them anyway). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blame@lighttanksofdaoc>Blame</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://homepages.internet.lu/lordoftherings/images/boromir.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Determined Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#000000>(5/30/03 2:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> -</span><hr size=1> I think that would be a bit too good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theravensclaw>The Ravens Claw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Journeyman</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#000000>(6/1/03 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Merc DT</span><hr size=1> How would that version of DT work in PvE? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tatsumaruiii>TatsumaruIII</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#000000>(6/1/03 5:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Merc DT</span><hr size=1> &quot;Put all of them on shorter timers, like 3 minutes.

<br>
You'd be correct in thinking so. In the Era of vikings, they had a group of people called Bezerkers. While they didn't morph into some giant racoon, what they'd do is come into battle heavly clothed. Once they meet with the enemy, they will begin shouting wildly, swinging their axes (used only axes) in all different directions while removing parts of armor/clothing. Eventually, once all clothes (typically left their pants on.. thankfully.. but only typically) they would start self mutilation and cause injury to themselves in front of the enemy. What this did was phyic out the enemy. From the standered soldier back then (british, saxon, ect) the common attitude twords battle was either offensive with some defense, defense with some offense or a veriaty between the two. They always assumed that no one would ever completly give up defense, even if it was just in the back of their mind (they would, at least, try to dodge or jump or duck). The bezerkers could, and would, give up complete defense for complete offense (which is why they only used axes. They are not made well for parrying or such, and all the weight/impact was put on one end meaning you'll have to be very offensive with the weapon and would always need to keep it in motion). The tactic worked (for the most part) untill they invented a weapon designed againts it.. but that's another store.<br>
<br>
But yeah. IF they were to follow history as it was written and be as real as possible, zerkers would not have a zerk ability, but would always considered to be zerked. They don't wish to keep to a strict real-life scene though, which allows us to have so much more to work with (how else can we get elfs, lurikeens, ect? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

It was a polearm with a pointy tip, a heavy flat surface on the left side, a hook on the right and a row of spikes around the base of the flat surface.<br>
<br>
Yes, it was a brutal weapon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It worked well because while a bezerker was so mindless in his strikes, leaving himself vulnerable, you could also keep him from getting in close where his axes can actually do something. Only an elite-like force could use the weapon, not only because of its tremendious size and weight, but the phyic-out ability that zerkers used had to be nullified by a very iron will and no real care for ones health, which not many people had back then. Guess they were the british version of suicidal maniacs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
An interesting note on bows an archers; No one liked them back then <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They were not considered a very strong force, and were very poorly equiped and trained. Only people who wanted to be an archer and showed interest in it were recruited. They never really proved effective out in the field (which is why no one ever really considered them as a real part of an army) because a common and easy done tactic to avoiding arrows was holding your shield above your head. The armor was also very hard to peirce and without proper trainning, they could never hit any un-plated areas (Even chain was effective against arrow fire). It was later that they finally gave archery some thought, and not only did it become something extremly usefull, but a lot of inventions stem from the idea of a bow and arrow.<br>
<br>
Yes, i'm an overflowing mass of knowledge. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If anyone's interested in finding out how I know this, I had to do a very very large report in school regarding the era that Kind Arthur supposidvly lived in (The whole report spanned the total 4 years of my high school career!!!) which was very close to the brition, saxon, viking (ect..) era.<br>
<br>

     -&quot;About Conquest: Tune-in Sundays at 10.30pm/9.30c! Whether it's ancient combat or modern sports, Conquest issues a challenge to host Peter Woodward to conquer a highly unusual array of skills. Woodward's body and mind are repeatedly challenged as he pits himself against the masters of various disciplines, in tests ranging from the medieval tournament to the demolition derby; from weird weapons of the Middle Ages to bull riding and knights in plate armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Demolition Derby one was also really cool.<br>
<br>
Peter also has a group of people he sometimes does these things with, such as swordfights in platearmor, or whatever that episode is about. <p>&quot;We will never be what Mythic promised we would when DAoC started, we might as well adapt or delete.&quot; -Avandor<br>

I take it your studying the Britons versus Saxon era (when arthur probably lived) rather than the &quot;legendary&quot; arthurian knights era (which could never have been <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )?<br>

The Bernard Cornwell (bloke wot wrote Sharpe) Excalibur novels are really well done - he's put Arthur as a pagan Briton fighting off the Saxons and the Angles (i.e. a bit closer to the time Arthur might have actually lived if he ever existed). Very good stuff.  <p>Fingoniel MacAlpine<br>

The idea of Camelot we are given (full of damsels in distress and shiny chivalrous plate armour) was set totally in the wrong time zone from anyhting it could have been. The reason we assume it was set in the chivalrous years (if tehy ever existed) was beacause of the ideals of the era in which the folktales became popular and, probably, were doctored or re-written <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ... <br>
<br>
I can't recall the exact time (I'm no History buff, I'm an English student) , but it was after the French invasion of England when all the people with influence in Britain were the French nobles (which is why all the words to do with fine food, luxury, entertainment seem to be of French origin). It was here that the ideas of chivaly and courtly love (meaning devotion to a a lady's service without wanting her personally, like) caught on. You notice all the 'poncy' people liked this sort of stuff, the Victorian upper classes often had portraits made depicting themselves as chivalrous knights <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But, yeah, in all reality King Arthur was bit more of a bastard than we think. I think they did a pretty good job mixing the two extremes of shining chivalry and caveman brutality in &quot;EXCALIBUR&quot;, myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
As I said before, blindness in RvR is turning the enemy player's screen black and negating his face/stick/follow.<br>
<br>
In PvE, the monster would be &quot;blinded&quot; by still keeping its initial target selected (whoever it was attacking before being blinded) but then continually spinning around in circles as it attacks (trying to find the target in every direction). If it happens to be facing in the right direction (at its original target) during its attack, then the attack is resolved normally. If it is not facing the original target, then the attack does nothing, even if it is facing somebody else. It cannot select a new target while blind, but aggro can build up as normal, and once it can see again, it can select a new target based on its level of aggro then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tatsumaruiii>TatsumaruIII</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seasoned Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#000000>(6/3/03 5:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theotaku.com/trigun/pictures/trigun12/Simage_12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;blindness&quot; DT in PvE</span><hr size=1> &quot;I take it your studying the Britons versus Saxon era (when arthur probably lived) rather than the &quot;legendary&quot; arthurian knights era (which could never have been <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )?&quot;<br>

I actually did both.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  my original idea was to support facts that Kind Aurther really did live (It was hard, but I found some really good points that could very well mean he did! I also recorded a whole bunch of TV shows on the subject <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). I wasn't able to place him in the recorded timelines that was avaluable to me, so I improvised and placed it around what was considered to be used at the time. Between the Brition and Saxons era seem to fit it best, although to be completly honest, I had no proof this was the correct spot. But hey, what they don't know can't screw my grades up (seems to have worked, too). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This era was really hard to get reports on though. For some odd reason, all the books and such kept diving off into the Britian and Saxon wars, and not Britian and/or Saxons themselves (or only touched on them breifly). Had to apply a lot of logic to it, because there was just some spots that could not be confermed as true, so I had to fill in missing spots with reasonable events or whatnot. Some of the stories, like the lady of the lake, helped me create more of a picture.<br>

Just stumbled upon this topic(kinda hard to notice the All-Classes General Discussion up there)and think it's very interesting.  The blindess with Dirty Tricks can't happen.  Sounds good.  But Mythic would have to be stupid to implement it.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Stupid people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://rinkworks.com/stupid/">rinkworks.com/stupid/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Check out that sight.  Pretty funny until you realize it's real stuff.<br>
<br>
Anywho, if some jackass was wondering around in RvR and their monitor suddenly went blank they would freak the fark out.  'OMG!  My computer crashed!  Ugh!  Oh no!  Tech support!'<br>
<br>
They'd have to put in big gigantic bold letters&quot;YOU HAVE BEEN BLINDED BY THE MERCENARY'S DIRTY TRICKS TECHNIQUE!&quot;<br>
<br>
And wouldn't that look plain stupid?<br>
<br>
Also, Tatsu, my respect for you is pretty great.  Not up their with Blame(dangit you're cool Blame), but pretty high.  So if my following statement seems insulting or arrogant foolishness, I apoligize greatly.<br>
<br>
I discovered I was 1/4 Norwegian when I was 9 when my grandmother started doing all this pointless research on geneology(old people are stupid...).  I'd always liked Vikings in particular since my favorite color was purple back then and I thought the Minnesota Vikings were just plain cool.  So I started checking out Norse Mythology books and Norse Culture books from the library.  I was a pretty big reader when I was young too...wait I'm still young...anywho...I really liked the theme of the pillaging, nun-raping viking jarl-dude.  I also was interested in the idea of a berserk.<br>
<br>
From my reading(I've read a lot on the subject),  Berserkers went into battle either naked or wearing loose garments made of bear-hide.  The word berserk is branched off of a similiar word in the Scandinavian tongue which means bear-shirt.  Hence the name berserker, bear-hide clothing.<br>
<br>
Berserkers didn't use just axes.  While the axe was a popular weapon among vikings and such, the sword was considered greatest of all weapons.  Jarls always wielded swords because the sword was a noble weapon and was thought of very highly.  Spears were also very popular because Odin, All-Father and Leader of the Aesir, wielded Grungnir, a spear which would always return to its wielder's hand, similiar to Mjollnir, Thor's weapon.  Axes were used only slightly more than the spear because spears weren't quite as adept at...pillaging should I say?  Anywho, though the berserker wasn't distinctly a very noble person, they used swords and axes quite evenly.  While berserkers did sometimes mutilate themselves in battle, it wasn't*always*willingly.  The berserkers threw themselves into a psychotic rage by sometimes consuming narcotic berries and mushrooms that were commonly found in northern Europe.  Berserkers threw themselves into rage by sheer determination to kill and plunder and rape(They missed they're ritalin that morning).  Sometimes they would become so enraged they swung their weapon so hard they wouldn't keep track of where it was going and injure themselves.  Hence them usually missing ears, fingers and toes.  This unbridaled fury and bloodlust unnerved the defenders greatly.  It's also commonly said berserkers were unreliable and dangerous infantry mainly because they would strike out fellow comrades-in-arms and would fall dead after the battle was done.  Berserkers did sometimes lose control and injure a fellow soldier and the reason some berserkers died after the battles calmed down was because they overdosed on the consumation of the mushrooms and berries so forth their systems gave up the fight after the muscles calmed down.<br>
<br>
One site I found a few months ago was a translate version of a recorded saga from a Rosetta Stone-like object unearthed from a temple.<br>
It was something along the lines of:'The man sat at the jarl's shoulder only at only the lord's request.  He was a great bear of a man, shirtless and scarred.  Bristly black hair sprouted from his head, he reaked of bear fat and grease.  His eyes were gigantic, sunken pits of darkness.  Glazed and angry were they.  He had a bristling beard from which food and twigs were entiwined.  He ate with fervor, smacking loudly and spewing remnants of the meat across the long table.  He drank seemingly dozens of horns of mead, all in one labored gulp.  The jarl himself did not know the man's name but for the man speaking near unintelligably, usually communicating with hand gestures and body language.'<br>
<br>
The scholar who translated it believed the scripture referred to a berserker who was seated at the jarl's table only because the jarl was impressed at his battle prowess.  The man was uncivalized and grotesque but was a battle-worthy opponent.  Hence the probability the man was a zerker.<br>
<br>
Anywho, that's all I can remember off the top of my head from my off-and-on research that has spanned about 3 and a half years now(I'm 13 at the moment.)<br>
<br>
Y'know what's funny?  I hate the realm of Midgard.  So far Albion is the only realm that's worked for me.  The Savage is the only class in Midgard that seems appealing.  H2H styles and bunch of Evade looks fun.  Anywho...<br>
<br>

<br>
You'v pretty much stated what I said <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   just added a bit more on the subject.<br>
<br>
I do know that axes were perfered over swords for bezerkers. You see, a sword can be used both defensivly (parry) and offensivly (slash). With an axe, you have 75% wood, rest a big block of sharp, heavy metal. You're not likly to parry with it. This makes it ideal for the zerker because he is ALL about offensive. Vikings and not-zerkers did use all kinds of weapons besides swords and axes, but zerker did stick to axes or similer weapons (An axe that had two heads on each side for instance). I'm sure there was more then a few who used swords, but you gotta admit, would you think a man going naked with a sword is scarier than a man going naked with an axe? You know that axe is going to be swingin, probably non-stop. With that sword, he's going to deflect (or try) your attack in some fashion. Kind of puts a damper on the &quot;I'm going to go completely offensive on you&quot; trick. I'd also believe since an axe makes you full offensive, it would be even more wanted by the zerker, to help keep him from thinking of parrying that blow. It had to take some effert to put aside every peice of defense, i'd imagine.<br>
<br>
When I said heavly clothed, bear-skins were included. It was viewed as the more you took off, the more fightening they were. Of course, they didn't wear a mediocre amount of clothing. Just enough to get their point across.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm crazy, I'm naked, and I DON&quot;T LIKE YOU!&quot;. I did say they typically left their pants on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   that's only typically though. Books say that about half-ish a squad would leave pants or at least some form of undergarmet on. The ones who didn't were probably the ones who self-mutilated themselves and tripped out on those berries.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say I know more than you. That's just foolish. Age is only in the mind, and wouldn't be right to say you're wrong just because I have 5-6 years on you. Nor will I say i'm correct. I do know that some books are misleading, and you or I could have been givin' some wrong information. However, that's unimportant. I finished my report months ago, got out of high school and onto college. The only axe I want to see is either one hanging on my wall, or in this video game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Perferably, not the sharp part.<br>
<br>
To be more on topic: I would perfer a DT that didn't require ANY chance at all to give me some potentiel. The bezerker's ability to morph is 100% going to make a difference. a Blademaster's Triple Wield will also make a difference. But a DT can, and probably will, get resisted. The others get an ability that works all the time, yet our ability is based on a poor chance (People are already reporting procing the ability ten times, and have each resisted!). The other two get an increase in damage (damage add or just more damage). I assume we are suppose to get an increase in defense, since we're the ones with Chain. Perhaps make it unresistable. Or make it so our chain is more effective. I don't really care, aslong as it's something that WILL work and I can rely on it adding to my potentiel without any worry of a resist or some sort of failure.<br>

<br>
I think Mythic needs to change their thinking and classify us as &quot;Offensive Tanks&quot;.  Light Tank implies that we're like diet coke or pepsi one itll taste kinda like the original but watered down and weak.  I hate that.  Basically all I really want is more base damage close to what zerkers had that includes all light tanks.  Our defense allows us to survive but just so very barely so let us have some offense.  Let Reavers do the &quot;supporting&quot; I'm their to chop some $#!% up let the pally support me for a change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=113.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=113.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=113.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=38><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.threadControl?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm18>General Light Tank Discussion</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.31d<br>Copyright 1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
