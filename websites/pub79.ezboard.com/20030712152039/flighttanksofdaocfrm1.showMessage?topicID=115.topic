<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Overview</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Blademasters received a number of changes in 1.62.  The most significant change was the shortening of the timer on Triple Wield to 7 minutes.  Triple Wield now also grants immunity to melee critical hits.  Celtic Dual for Blademasters also received a few changes, including an increase in damage on the Ice Storm -&gt; Tempest -&gt; Supernova side-positional chain, as well as the addition of a 4-second stun on Ice Storm.  Bleeds on both Tempest and Twin Star received increases as well.  Melee snares were also fixed in this patch, as was the block/parry bug.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Concerns</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Role of the Light Tanks</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – In 1.62, Light Tanks were described as serving the primary function of an assist tank.  The intention being that the heavy tank takes the brunt of the damage, while the light tank assists on the target to do extra damage, above that of say, a second heavy tank.  Concerns with this relate to this role in PvP combat.  In PvE, where mob aggression can be controlled via Taunt and Detaunt styles, this hierarchy functions well.  In PvP, however, there is no means to control a player’s aggression.  A smart player can choose to attack the light tank, who is less able to handle direct combat, rather than attack the heavy tank. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Utility</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – Blademasters provide nearly the same utility as Heroes.   Whether it be Sword/Shield Blademaster vs. Sword/Shield Hero, or CD Blademaster vs. CS/LW Hero, there is little to distinguish the two classes in terms of contribution to, and function in, a group.  The class needs something to give it more utility – one possibility might be a form of assassin-only Detect Hidden, which would give the class a more unique role.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Melee Snares</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – The usefulness of melee snares is questionable due to the fact that they break on the next hit/damage done to the target.  It would seem to make more sense to make all melee snares of a reasonable duration (12 seconds, perhaps), make them unbreakable for that duration, and have them trigger an immunity timer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Specline Issues</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Celtic Dual</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> –  Some parts of the style line are still lacking.  Hurricane is the most glaring example.   This chain is still inferior to many of the anytime chains in base style lines.  It has no effects, and Hurricane has a medium defense penalty in addition to high endurance usage.   When compared to Squall, the taunt style, there is no reason to use Hurricane at all until 39 spec, when Solar Flare is received.  Even then, it’s usage is questionable.   There is still inequality among level 50 styles, Supernova being one of the poorer ones.  It is the third style in the side chain, and while it does decent damage, it has no effect.  I would propose that it be changed to a style where the target evades, and it procs a long duration stun.  The crux of the issue is, should there be an overwhelming reason to use CD styles over equivalent base styles? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Blades</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – Blades currently has two block reactionary chains.  The line currently has neither a parry reactionary or an evade reactionary.   Changing one of the block chains to a parry reactionary chain might make more sense.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Piercing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – Sidewinder appears to have an incorrect growth rate.  At low Piercing specs, it does more damage than it’s predecessor, Black Widow.  At high Piercing specs, however, it does less damage than Black Widow.  This is despite being listed as a &quot;High&quot; damage style.  Wyvern’s Bite currently procs a bleed.  Since bleeds do not stack, this is a redundant effect because its predecessor, Dragonspider, also procs a bleed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Blunts</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – Slam, the taunt style, is considered superior to the Force of Might, the anytime style.  Slam consistently does more damage than Force of Might, at a lower endurance cost.  This is a problem seen among other taunt and anytime styles.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Realm Abilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> – Winter Moon, our unique RA, is worthless.  It costs far too much, for too little benefit.  Flurry provides essentially the same function, but is on a 2 minute timer rather than 10, and is a free ability.  Whirling Dervish is also useless – it provides a 5% boost for 60 seconds to dual-wielding chance per level.  Given that dual wielding chance is based on the RNG, there is no guarantee that you will see any benefit from this RA during the 60 seconds, since it normally takes hundreds of rounds of attacks to attain the proper percentage of dual-wield attacks.  Mastery of Arms currently has no effect.  A lot of Blademasters have asked why we do not receive Avoid Pain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Other Issues</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
-        Change Triple Wield from Energy damage to Slash damage<br>
-        Endurance costs not adjusting with haste<br>
-        Charge needs to not switch to sprint <br>
-        Make Charge faster than sprint speed<br>
-        Make shields hotkeyable<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Item Problems</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
-        We need a greater variety of craftable 16.5 dps off-hand weapons.   Most off-hand weapons are of median speed, faster/slower ones are also desireable.<br>

I know that you speak for the majority of us and thus have a much better understanding of what’s going on than I, or anyone else, ever could. But one statement in particular in the latest report just struck me as wrong and not very well thought out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Celtic Dual – Some parts of the style line are still lacking. Hurricane is the most glaring example. This chain is still inferior to many of the anytime chains in base style lines. It has no effects, and Hurricane has a medium defense penalty in addition to high endurance usage.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
For as long as I can remember, everyone has been ranting about the many problems of the Celtic Dual line- the detaunt being part of a behind chain, the poor anytime chain, and other various things that have either gone unnoticed or ignored, but never the less unfixed. It all seems to revolve around Celtic Dual being a poor replacement for the base style lines; which, agreeably, truly is where the problem lies. However, it’s not as simple as that; the real problem is not with the skill itself, it’s with the misconception that has developed from it.<br>
<br>
Celtic Dual is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a replacement for the base lines, it augments it. The mainstay of the Celtic Dual line is it’s pleasing positional chains, and I believe that’s the way it was designed. Our base lines were planned to cover our rudimentary chains, most of all being an anytime chain; whereas out Celtic Dual line covers things like behind, side, and parry chains.<br>
<br>
Saying that our Celtic Dual line should cover every conceivable aspect of combat (and doing so in a way that’s superior to any base spec) is just unrealistic and I don’t think it should stay an issue any longer. Things like fixing the bleed effects on piercing (which you covered nicely) and other such things should be where our attention is focused, not trying to make Celtic Dual the “end all” of Blademaster spec lines.<br>
<br>
Oh, and your statement about Supernova is wrong. In fact, it has a haste debuff attached to it. While this seems to be a minor error, it makes your issue with Supernova (being a poor level 50 style) invalid and at the same time questions your knowledge of the Celtic Dual line. Changing Supernova to proc a stun after an evade destroys the Ice Storm -&gt; Tempest -&gt; Supernova chain, which is something most Blademasters are currently happy with; therefore, I don’t think it’s a good idea and should not be included in the latest report.<br>

Quote from Jelinar:<br>
Utility – Blademasters provide nearly the same utility as Heroes. Whether it be Sword/Shield Blademaster vs. Sword/Shield Hero, or CD Blademaster vs. CS/LW Hero, there is little to distinguish the two classes in terms of contribution to, and function in, a group.<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
Well, there is in my opinion... how about a 12 second anytime stun and major LW/CS damage output on Hero Side... and what? A bigger bleed on a side positional style chain on BM side...<br>
<br>
What would you do if you are the group leader and see:<br>
Player001: 50 Hero LFG<br>
Player002: 50 BM LFG<br>
<br>
You would pick the hero, even if you already had a hero in the group, because hero+bm damage output isn't better than hero+hero damage output. I still am unsure whether Mythic's description of the Light Tank followed by patch 1.62 should make me laugh hysterically or cry endlessly. <p>==================<br>
