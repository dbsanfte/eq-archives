A very touching roleplay.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 Life, Death, and Rebirth <br>
<br>
Once upon a time…. <br>
<br>
The morning fog slowly rolled in as the 6 adventurers made their way to the Fortress of the Mountain Giants, <br>
deep inside the Frontier Mountains. Silently as a shadow a lone scout was sent to examine the defenses… <br>
much time passed and she had not returned. <br>
<br>
Using the silent hand code famous of the drow the other 5 quickly decided to advance closer to the Fortress <br>
and see why their scout might not have returned. As they neared a hill the sounds of battle rang out. The 5 <br>
dashed to to the top of the hill and as the Fortress loomed into view so did the forms of 3 Giants and one tiny <br>
dark elf female fending them off. <br>
<br>
She was losing. No doubt about it. Massive dents in her armor, and already her massive 2 handed sword was <br>
snapped in half, she fought with what was the other damaged half. Parrying mostly yet still taking more hits <br>
than giving. Off to her side she heard the yells of her friends as as they stormed down the hill to come to heraid, <br>
hopefully they would not be to late….. <br>
<br>
Noiruuk lead the others as he ran full speed down the hill to the raging battle. Skidding up close to the closest <br>
Giant he rammed his sword hilt deep into the Giants shin then with a glint in his eye he called upon the Power <br>
of Innoruuk and Layed his dark hands upon the Giant causing dark energy into the creature. The Giant <br>
stiffened immediately while letting out a low moan as his heart exploded then toppled over dead. <br>
<br>
The other Drow leapt, whopped, and attacked a 2nd Giant. The Giant to stupid to realize it was severly <br>
outclassed by the Drow Warriors he soon fell just like the one before him. A loud scream filled the air that <br>
made Noiruuk and the other Drow whip their heads around. Just in time to see the Giant that their scout had been <br>
fighting swing his massive club in a low arc hitting the scout and sending her flying back to crasj into a nearby <br>
outcrop of rocks. The scout slid to the ground and lay still. The Giant raised his massive club and howled in victory…… <br>
which soon turned to screams of anguish as 5 Drow made blades sunk into its hide. It toppled forward quite dead. <br>
<br>
Noiruuk quickly ran to the scout’s still form ripping off her helmet. Her eyes were open but alive. Blood flowed <br>
from her mouth. “Trance, hang on. How bad are you hurt?” Hack up some blood Trance strained <br>
to lift her head to stare at her brother. She lookeed him in the eyes and lifted her arm to lay a hand on his <br>
cheek. Noiruuk grasped the hand at his cheep and watched the life fade from his sisters eyes. Her arm went <br>
slack and her head drooped down and Trance D’Nocturne sat very still. <br>
<br>
“Trance…. Don’t go please. Trance… Trance… Oh Gods No... Trance! Trance! <br>
<br>
“It kinds feels like I’m dreaming” Trance said to herself as she floated their looking at the progression of her <br>
funeral in Nektulos. “Dear Noirruk looks so nice in his suit. … and Kryx and Sioned in their robes….. <br>
I wonder if she could make me into a skeleton…” <br>
<br>
Trance floated over to her casket and looked in. “Well I’ve looked better… much more alive!” <br>
Trane laughed at her joke. Trance looked up and Sioned looking in her direction, as if looking into her eyes. <br>
Trance floated over to look at her friend. “Can you see me dear Sioned? Hear me <br>
perhaps?” Sioned looked over to Ryenn then lowered her head back down to look at the ground. <br>
“Or perhaps you my dear Sister, Tarnna…. Nae, I didn’t think so.” <br>
“So is this my fate? To wander Norrath a spectre! Always in company yet always alone!” No answer came to he calls. <br>
“Serves me right being agnostic, I suppose.“ Atleast I can keep an eye on everyone…. Or perhaps Ill go haunt <br>
Vox!!! Muhahahahaha… hhhhmmm” <br>
<br>
The Pallbares lifted the casket and moved into the forest to the site designated for the buriel. Trance floated <br>
along seeming a bit agitated. As they neared the plot, a wonderful clearing in the forest, they lowered the <br>
casket into the ground and asked if anyone had anything to say. Each in turn her friends and family <br>
bared their hearts and feelings. Trance wept herself upon seeing tears well up into her brothers eyes and as <br>
her dear sisters lower lip quivered. “Ah Noiruuk and Tranna what will you do without me?” <br>
<br>
Trance took stock of all her friends reactions. Ryenn sobbed uncontrolably. Sioned wept. Kryx stood quiet <br>
with slightly wet eyes. Morrgoth stared at the ground. Pandoran just stared at the corpse. Many others cried and <br>
sobbed or simple greived. Trance knew they all grieved in their own ways. She for one never wept openly, <br>
only when alone. Though being followers of hate the love that was felt at the funeral touched everyone. And <br>
Trance herself cried. As the funeral came to close and her friends <br>
and family started off back to the city Noiruuk stayed behind to <br>
see to the actual buriel. He had asked for this privialge to do alone. Tarnna had asked to help and he <br>
requested that she go back to Neriak and retrieve Trance’s now repaired sword and coveted Opal helm. <br>
<br>
Noiruuk stripped off his suit jacket and grabbed for the shovel. He stuck the dirt into the nound of dirt and <br>
stared at the closed casket down in the ground waiting to be covered with dirt. Noiruuk quickly burst into <br>
tears and sank to his knees shaking uncontrolably. <br>
<br>
“I can’t do it!” He screamed. “I can’t go on alone!” The tears came like a river <br>
“You are never alone” came a voice from behind Noiruuk. Noiruuk slowly turned his head to and gasped in <br>
surpise as his eyes layed upon a little gnome. “Who... who are you?” <br>
“My name is Terald” said the Gnome “And as I said you are never alone, not really” <br>
&quot;What do you mean? My Sister in gone. And she’s not coming back. <br>
“Think so do you? Terald said with a grin as he sat down on the ground. “Let me tell you a story. Their <br>
was once a small (smaller than aaverage) Gnome who lost his one and only child in an accident. The Gnome <br>
decided that with out his child life had lost all meaning. He reverted to drinking and gambling and living a life <br>
<br>
that would have ended to soon for him. Until oneday while looking for change to buy more ale he came across <br>
a little latched box. Quicky forcing it open he discoved many drawings and writings from his child about hos <br>
much she loved father and how much she greatly admired him. At seeing this the little Gnome wept at not the <br>
lose of his child but at the person he was and had become. If only his daughter saw him now! What would she <br>
think of him!?!?! The little Gnome straighted his life out and rejoined society having learned one cannot <br>
live in sorrow and misery while still cherishing their loved one. And besides think of how much seeing you this way <br>
pains Trance.” <br>
<br>
Noiruuk sighed. “She is probably wherever dead people go having already forgot me” <br>
Terald grinned “Think so do you?” Terald waved his hand and low and behold sitting cross legged on the <br>
ground a weeping spectral Trance came into view. <br>
<br>
Noiruuk gasped and doved for his Sister tackling her to the gound “Trance!” he hugged her fiercly <br>
“Noir…. You can see me?” She quickly returned the hug. “Terald thank you!” <br>
“You know him, sis?” Noiruuk asked “He is….. a God… more or less. And a friend” she replied. <br>
<br>
Terald grinned. Do not thank me, yet. It was all I could do as one last favor to her before she continues <br>
her journey. “Contiues her journey?” Noiruuk asked, “Make her stay.” <br>
“I have to leave again?” Trance quickly breaks into tears again as she buries her head into her brothers shoulder. <br>
Terald eyes drift to the ground with a sad look onhis face. “As powerful as I am, it is not in my power to <br>
allow her to stay. Though I can grant her the abilty to be seen and felt for a short period of time. You have a <br>
few minutes than she… we must be on our way.” <br>
<br>
Noiruuk’s eyes welled up as he realized this was the last time he would ever talk to his sister again. <br>
And at that moment Tarnna walked into the clearing and gasped dropping her load onto the ground. <br>
“Sis!! I thought you dead!” She ran over and all 3 D’Nocturnes embraced. <br>
“Tarnna! I had hoped to see you before I go.” Trance said “Go? Where you goin? I’ll go wit <br>
ya... let me go get my backpack” Tarnna said as she turned to leave <br>
<br>
“Where I am going you cannot follow.” Tarnna’s lip began to quiver again. “We shall not be parted for <br>
long. I shall see you in the afterlife or in the next life…. It wont be so long a wait, I promise” Both females <br>
quickly burst into tears. Noiruuk layed his arm around Tarnna to comfort her. <br>
“Sis, There is so much to say and so little time. I don’t know how I can express how much me and your <br>
sister love you.” Noiruuk said is a shaky voice. <br>
<br>
“Hush my brother. You have just said all I ever needed to hear.” Trance said as she slowly began to <br>
fade from view. “Know that I will be seeing you both again. Even death cannot separate the D’Nocturnes for <br>
long.” And then she faded away forever. Noiruuk stepped forward as if to touch her <br>
one last time but she was already gone, as was the Gnome who worked one final miracle <br>
<br>
Everywhere she looked was a bright white light. Trance gasped in amazement at the absolute splender. She <br>
quickly noticed she wasn’t alone. “So what now, Terald?” She asked her Gnome companion. <br>
“That depends on you, Trance. What would you like to do? Before you lies nothing but possibilty” Terald replied <br>
<br>
Trance look around in all directions while thinking to herself. “Hhhhhmmm well I whats over that way?” Trance <br>
asked pointing off into the distance “Only one way to find out, my friend. Only <br>
one way to find out.” Terld stuck out his hand which Trance grasped and the 2 figures began to walk.. <br>
“Have I ever told you the story of my Great Uncle Ferald, Trance?” Terald asked <br>
<br>
“No., but I bet im about to.” Trance said with a grin <br>
<br>
“Oh well in that case like all great stories this one begins with ‘Once upon a time…….” <br>
<br>
