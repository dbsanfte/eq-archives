Fearful Thoughts (RP)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
General Zirrix T’Rhennic stood in the Ogre transport along the railing, on his way to the lost continent of Kunark, and reviewed the recent raid on the Plane of Fear. Upon meeting the rest of the group in the Ferrott Swamp, they all passed through the Specter Caves and crossed the Inter-Planar portal. The portal itself was rumored to be older then Norrath itself. It was though this “doorway” that the Cazic-Thule, God of Fear, first crossed through the Planar dimensions and deposited his creations upon the world. It was said the portal could not be destroyed or closed, not even by the Gods themselves. But, due to the physical and mental stresses involved, only an experienced adventurer could hope to survive the journey between Planes. Thus, only the strongest and most skilled of groups dared to cross the threshold and enter a different realm. The portal itself looked like a mirror upon a pedestal. The “mirror’s” surface was a haze of grayish, swirling smoke. While it emitted no sounds, a person could not help but feel a deafening shrill piercing their soul upon approaching it. Stepping through the portal, a person had the sense of simultaneously being frozen in time and space, and pulled apart in a thousand directions at once. One could almost feel themselves, mind and body, slowly elongate and “scramble” into what seemed an eternity. Zirrix knew that any adventurer of lower season would not survive even the entrance into the Plane of Fear, much less the environment itself. <br>
<br>
It was odd, but for some reason Zirrix could remember no detail clearly while on the Plane itself. It was as if he were trying to remember a nightmare through a fog of confusion. Granted, he remembered certain actions, and was sure he was clearheaded and active on the raid, but now he had a difficult time grasping any one moment to examine it in his mind’s eye. It was like the Iksar saying, “The slipperier the fish, the harder it is to bite off the head”. He did remember that there was something about the Plane itself that made even him “uneasy”. More then once, he would “start” at some thing that wasn’t there, and felt the constant need to look over his shoulder. In fact, his fists were sore from gripping his swords so tightly and for so long. And the sky! It was the color of a sickly fire, which cast a blood red pallor over everything. The land itself resembled a swamp, but none like Zirrix had ever seen. He seemed to remember fleeting images of an hourglass in the sky, and a wall of flame upon the ground. It made no sense to him. But, the images were in his thoughts. The whole place seemed to grate on nerves that had been rubbed raw. All this Zirrix could, even now only 2 days later, barely remember. Yet still, despite the “slippery” memories, Zirrix did recall certain of the denizens of the Plane quite clearly. <br>
<br>
First, there were the huge Amygdalin behemoths. They were as tall as Sand Giants, but built as solid as a well muscled Barbarian. They moved with lightning speed and hit with bone jarring force. But, most horrifying about them were their heads. To Zirrix, their heads looked like some squid type creature, complete with wriggling tentacles. Their appearance alone was enough to cause some in the group to turn away in terror and shock. Then there were the crawling hands. It was, as the Halflings said, “ Enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck not just stand up, but pack a bag and move out”. Also, there were the small impish beings who seemed to radiate a cold, penetrating aura, that made anyone who came into contact with them want to flee. Zirrix further vaguely recalled giant cubes, carnivorous and hungry; stallions of blackest night, with eyes of scarlet death; flashing lights, that drained all courage from the soul; and terrible undead, from which the stench of rot and disease flowed as water through a raging river of putrescence. <br>
<br>
All this was in his mind, but almost beyond his memory. He recalled the battles, the deaths of his enemies and his group's many victories. It was those victories that gave him the will to build a barrier strong enough to withstand the terrible fear that threatened to overwhelm him and drive him weeping to his knees in weakness. As the boat came to dock at the Teir’dal outpost in Kunark, and Zirrix was pulled from his recollections, he noticed blood running down the rails of the ship. Pulling his hand away, he saw where the splinted timbers had cut into his hands, because he had been gripping them so tightly. Putting on his gauntlets, he hoped that whatever caused him to be forgetting his journey to Fear, would make haste to complete it’s course and drive the visions of that place far from his mind and spirit. Because, in spite of all, even the Respected Race can awake screaming in the night… <br>
