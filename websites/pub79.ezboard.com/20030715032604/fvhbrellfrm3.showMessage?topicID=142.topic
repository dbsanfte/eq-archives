He was searching for a Gnome named Hasten Bootstrapper, in order to complete his quest for the Journeyman Boots. The boots themselves were a rare and amazingly useful piece of magical equipment, sought after by many. It was rumored that recently another Gnome, located deep within an outpost in the caverns of Solusek in the Lavastorm Mountains, had discovered the secret of the boot’s creation. It was said that he would now sell the boots, for a substantial sum, to all who could pay. But Zirrix did not much care to pay inflated prices for something he could achieve through his skill and resolve. So, after gathering all the items the Gnome Hasten wanted, Zirrix was ready to trade for a pair of the boots from him. It was known that Hasten was slightly unbalanced and often easily distracted. Zirrix had spoken with many who had actually met the Gnome, and was told that they had to call out to the Gnome many times and work to constantly keep it’s attention. Otherwise, it would scamper off at breakneck speed and disappear into the mountainous landscape. What’s more, the Rathentear Mountains was an inhospitable place, filled with creatures who would find a speedy Gnome quite a tasty treat. Thus, after completing his camp, Zirrix set off to a certain spot where it was rumored that Hasten would sometimes pause to get his bearings.<br>
<br>
The General had taken much time to research all this information before hand. What he could not find out for himself, he would extort, bribe, or force from those who did know. Fortunately, all the information had turned out to be accurate thus far, so he was confident that his mission would soon be completed.  Zirrix also knew that the annoying little pest of a Gnome had a deep set fear of a Drake that infested the region. The flying snake would routinely patrol the mountains, seeking food and a nest. Thus, while it was out in flight, the Gnome would cower in some hidden nook, waiting for the Drake to fly off. Zirrix however, was not known for his tolerance. Patience yes, tolerance, no. Therefore, Zirrix stationed himself in a good position, and promptly exterminated the Drake as soon as it was unfortunate enough to cross his path. While waiting, he also ambushed and destroyed any wandering Cyclops or Giant Skeletons that came by. Those for the glory of Rallos Zek and in the name of Innoruuk and the Empire. Zirrix dare not return to his camp and sleep. For if he did, the delicate and unstable weapon of the Shadowed Man would destabilize and disappear into nothingness. Finally, after some time, Zirrix saw a movement off in the horizon. It was fast approaching his position, and he quickly saw it was the Gnome he sought. At first, Zirrix thought to simple put an arrow through the little pest’s throat to stop him in his tracks. It would also insure no other would be able to gain the advantage of the boots. But, since the other Gnome in far off Lavastorm still made then, and since Zirrix was not sure if Hasten would even have a pair on him that the Teir’dal could use, he decided to just confront the running fool.<br>
<br>
Leaping from his ambush point, Zirrix called out to Hasten Bootstrapper. The Gnome, who seemed to be distracted and disoriented, looked at Zirrix but did not seem to see or hear him. Normally, Zirrix would see a look of fear and hatred in the eyes of one of the lesser races, but this particular Gnome’s eyes shone with a madness all it’s own. Stepping closer, the Teir’dal Warrior called out to the Gnome again, this time getting a response. Rather then waste time talking to the quickening little vermin, Zirrix simply handed him the items, and was given in return a pair of the vaunted boots. Then, without warning, the Gnome took off and ran into the distant hillside. Just for enjoyment, Zirrix got off one arrow before the Gnome was out of sight. He was rewarded by a high pitched whelp of pain which echoed off mountainside, and followed the departing Gnome. Suppressing a smile of satisfaction, Zirrix put on his newly won boots. Willing them to function, he saw the brief scarlet sparkling haze of a spell envelope him then dissipate into thin air. Taking a step forward, he found himself propelled several yards distant. Nodding in satisfaction he ran to his temporary camp and broke it down. As he did so he realized that the boots, while bestowing speed of travel, did not give the advantage of a Shaman’s  Wolves-Speed spell. It was a near thing though, and this new piece of equipment would be of tremendous value, both in his personal combats, and his strategic duties as well. Looking to the sky with hooded eyes, he noticed that the sun was setting, and realized how long he had been away from his Velious Command. Taking a deep breath, he ran off into the Ferroot Swamp, heading to the docks of the Northern Ro desert. From there, he would catch a pirate transport and return to the frozen land of Velious, with it’s plains of ice and snow. He would go to the Giant city of Kael Drakkal, and prepare for further campaigns against both the Coldain plague and Dragon menace. All in the service of the Teir’dal Empire, the Respected Race, and his guild of the Violent Harvest!<br>
