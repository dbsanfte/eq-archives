Kat fadded into shadows just as the young priest moved past with one of the temple guards. They still had not accepted her presence in Neriak. She would do well for now to avoid them until she had found a way to fix things. <br>
She shrugged slightly, it was little consiquence to her. Turning away from them she made her way to his Office. <br>
Nospiratus stood before the glass, a small smile upon his lips as he watched the halfling swim past the window. Kat studied him silently a moment. Wondering what the draw was. <br>
Gathering herself she stepped into view. &quot;Dark Eve Prophet.&quot; <br>
He turned to her, not in the least surprised to see her, &quot;Hello Kat.. &quot; Turning from the window he resumed his seat, indicating a vacant chair to her.<br>
Kat took the seat and pulled a set of maps from her satchel. She glanced about, &quot;I must speak with you, could you send the servants away for now?&quot; Nospiratus nodded and with a motion of his hand sent the servants scurrying from sight.<br>
Setting his drink down he leaned closer, his gaze falling upon the maps. A slight arch to his brow as he realized of what city they where for. &quot;I've been set to task, And have decided to form a scouting party so to speak. I've a theory i'd like to test concerning this area here.. &quot; Kat circled the area she spoke of with a finger.. &quot;I think we can enter from this place here.. Their guards have grown lazy, and would not expect infiltration from this place. However.. the tunnels leading to the entrance, are guarded by followers of Cazic, and Bertoxx. But if memory serves me, there is a way past them.&quot;<br>
Nospiratus nodded a wild gleam coming to his eyes, &quot;I would be happy to assist you in this. You and I could go in and test your theory concering the safe passage. If it proves thus we can lead a party in.&quot;<br>
Kat nodded, &quot;Are you ready for this Prophet?&quot; she asked as she rolled the maps up again. &quot;I've been ready Kat, for a very long time now. &quot; he sighed his response. Settling back once more in his chair as his gaze locked upon her. <br>
Suddenly he laughed at her. Kat arched a brow at the sound, the smile fadding from her lips. &quot;Something amuses you Nospiratus? &quot;<br>
&quot;You do,&quot; he replied still chuckling, &quot;Or rather the vision of you, wearing white robes as you stand upon the battlements overlooking this city.. perhaps tis a vision of things to come, or a prophecy if you will.&quot;<br>
Kat grinned impishly at his words, &quot;White eh?&quot; She shook her head slightly. &quot;I will need to gather more information, I shall contact you soon when I am prepared to lead you through and test that passage.&quot; <br>
Nospiratus nodded as she rose from her seat, there gazes once more holding for an extended time of silence. Then without word she turned and left him there to his meditations.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukatarinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katarinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 8:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=237.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fall from Grace - The Plan &lt;cont. from seed post&gt;</span><hr size=1> They had wandered deep into the bowels of Chardok and had begun setting up camp when the first insidius whisper came to her. She glanced back to look at the Chanceler.. <br>
&quot;Was that s'posed to insult me?&quot; She asked him in return. Holding a tight reign on her anger. Her own whispered response only met more. <br>
Kat paced her room as she reflected on their war of words of earlier that day. Each memory stirring the anger higher once more.. How dare he.. Insult Her? The Handmaiden of Innoruuk! <br>
The unmitageted gall of the man! A glass was sent shattering into the fire place as she continued to rage silently over the earlier incidence. <br>
The feel of the Prophets steel grip upon her shoulder holding her at bay, his dressing down in front of Tzlar. She knew he could feel her displeasure through the heat alone eminating from her. Her anger had flamed further, turning to the Prophet as well then. <br>
What right did either of them have to insult and humiliate her? Again a glass was sent kareening for the fire place. The sound of it exploding against the stone not near as satisfying as the sound of His head falling from His shoulders would be. <br>
She mutter spinning away from it. The Prophet was right however.. regardless of how angry his words had made her. If she was to survive this, she would need a stricter hold on the hatred and anger. Never again would she allow the Chancellor an opportunity to goad her into unwise words. She must at all cost keep her true identity a secret. To many would seek her death otherwise. <br>
A growl of pure rage was released. Coming from deep within her very soul. Her fist clenched tight enough to gouge her nails into her palms. She stood there in the middle of her rather small room. Coming to grips with it all and.. accepting it for now. One day, she knew.. she'd have the pure pleasure of seeing the Chancellors face as he faced Innoruuk and saw her by the Fathers side. That in itself would make any humilation she felt now.. well worth it. <br>
<br>
After a moment, her shoulders released the tension they had held. If one had viewed her they would see the tension slowly seeping from her. Control once more was maintained. <br>
Deliberate strides brought her to the small table kept in a cornor on it lay the map. She viewed it once more. <br>
Noting every little detail. She would have to know this like the back of her hand when the time came. Taking a sheet of paper from her satchel she sat down to make a list. <br>
First she would need a warrior. One she could trust not to let anyone know what the plan was until all stages where ready. General Zirrix was considered for only a very very short moment. She hated him nearly as much as his brother. Faeolin was next to come to mind. Indeed. She would do perfectly. Kat knew she could trust her beyond death. Knew she could work with her. With Faeolin's skill of the sword to keep herself and Nospiratus alive. The initial scouting trip should be a success. <br>
Only problem.. where to find the Warrioress...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ukatarinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katarinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 1:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=237.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fall from Grace - The Plan &lt;cont. from seed post&gt;</span><hr size=1> Kat rose from the table and resumed her pacing. A few more people would be good. Who else would prove detrimental to this. Perhaps someone capable, through magics, of taking them from immediate danger should things turn badly? But who could she trust? <br>
By His black heart! She needed answers and fast. Vresk, the ambassador. He held quite a reputation. His skill as a monk was nearly unsurpassed by most others she had come across. He too was capable of keeping his tongue in check. Perhaps, she would enlist him as well. That made four should all chose to go. <br>
Two more would be good. A thought dawned on her. Shintenshi would perhaps know where Faeolin was keeping herself. She had been banished until she redeemed herself, whether voluntarially or by order Kat did'nt know. Shin she was sure would know where Fae was. <br>
Sending him, however, after Faeolin would open a new set of problems. He would want to know why. Kat felt he too could be trusted. So he too would be included. That left room for one more... <br>
Still the quick escape came back to her. She did not know the druidess well. So would not include her this time. Tzlar came to mind which quickly brought a growl to her lips. No, her first reaction was to not even think about it. But then, another thought came.. &quot;Keep your friends close.. and your enemies closer yet..&quot; Yes.. if they took him. Keeping him in the dark as much as possible until the actual day.. It might work.<br>
It would serve two purposes in fact. She would be able to study him better. He was after all Mortal and therefor subject to weakness. Kat wanted to know that weakness. She nodded to herself. She would find a way to include him as well. <br>
Stepping to the hall she called out to a servent who loitered near. A whispered command and the servant scrambled off to find the shunned.. Shintenshi. <br>
Kat returned to her room. All turmoil calmed now that she had an idea of the scouting party. Thresher Daiunus would be informed of the actual raid once they had gathered sufficiant information and where assured her plan would work. <br>
Smiling softly to herself as she prepared her for her rest. Her mind wandered back to him. To the few times that they actually had some peace. To a place in the twilight where all the cares of this world and the next where but a dream and the dream was the reality. They would go again soon, she vowed to herself as she crawled into her covers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=237.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=237.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=237.topic&index=2><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=237.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=237.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=237.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=237.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate<option value="vhbrellfrm19">Hate's Culling Guild</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
