Signature Block Assistance Wanted<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 In trying to develop a logo for a standard Violent Harvest signature block, I've found I'm stuck for pictures to use. The VH crest has been described as a scythe over sheath design. I have software to put this together, but no photos. If any of you have photos of a ole-timey real actual sheath of grain and an actual photo of a scythe (like the harvester), please email them to me.<br>
<br>
The address is selilya@aol.com. Ebonbone has designed one for us to use, but he'd prefer to use photo's instead of clip art.<br>
<br>
Thanks all!<br>

If you take a look at mod.fragalot.com/<br>
you will see a scythe down the left of the screen.<br>
Is that any use to you?<br>
<br>
Take a look and let me know. It isn't clipart or a photo.<br>
It's my own artwork, and the original (sans menu text) is<br>
available for use if you so wish.<br>

 I will certainly aid in teh search for a photo of a sheaf of wheat - I will check out farmers almanac type sites, etc - maybe an on-line ag supply shop will have it, or International Harvester - anyway - will check around.<br>

 just a quick idea:<br>
<br>
there arent photos, but there are some nice pictures in the Dungeon Master's Guide and in the various weapons books for D&amp;D. If you want I can borrow the books from friends and scan some pics.<br>
<br>
lemme know...<br>

 Here is a Sample of what my Mistress has forced me to labor over last couple of days. Of all of the Winnower's ways of making people cringe, this has got to be the worst one yet (this project, that is).  <br>

 Well, I haven't had a lot of feedback on what folks think. I had one say it was awesome and one say they didn't like it very much. I'd like to at least have a few more made up for some folks to see what they think.<br>
<br>
So...two things.<br>
<br>
1) If you'd like to get your pic done, just holler, and<br>
we'll get a pic of you and add a background and your<br>
name. Then we'll attach that pic to the VHLogo that<br>
was designed.<br>
<br>
2) Please let me know what you like or don't like about<br>
the logo part...that's the part on the left. We want<br>
folks to be proud to have their character's photo<br>
displayed with a logo...so...if you really can't stand<br>
something on it...speak up.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I have to thank Ebonbone for his hard work. He's put in a lot of time to this.<br>

 Hey Sel,<br>
<br>
I think it looks great!!! I want one but don't have any good screen shots of Merryk. As soon as I see you again in game PLEASE take one of me so I can get a block like this for my signature.<br>
<br>
Thanks and tell Ebonbone that he did a great job.<br>

I'm of mixed mind about the logo. I love it personally. It looks like Ebonbone put some hard work into it, and it shows.<br>
<br>
I guess my only problem with it is...well it's not very period, to use a phrase from my days in medieval recreation. I just have trouble marrying the concept of an old-style emblem with the photo-realistic background presented.  <br>
<br>
Am I making sense? <br>

 I for one really do like the block. But if I were to make a suggestion to improve it, I'd have to agree with Vresk, if for different reasons. I like the sunset background, but it makes the sheaf look sort of muddy and indistinct.<br>
<br>
I also like paying a bit of homage to the guild's original name. A violet background would make the 'golden' sheaf stand out really well. If you could find a purplish/violet sunset photo it might work better. Another thought that might mesh with Vresk's thoughts would be a violet field with some sort of small pattern to it (what I believe was referred to as diapering in heraldry.)<br>
<br>
And my only other reservation is the bone typeface. I keep going back and forth as to whether or not I like it. It does and doesn't work. The bones make a good symbol, but it almost seems too cartoonish. *sigh* I don't know. I lost all my best fonts so I don't have a suggestion off hand to replace it. I'll try to look around.<br>
<br>
And please don't think I'm tearing your work apart, Ebonbone. I truly appreciate the hard work you put in on this! These are just suggestions. <br>

 I like the Thresher's Idea of going a bit retro concerning a VIOLET back ground for the wheat and the scythes. I can't honestly say I'm sold on the old english lettering though, at times it's a bit hard to read. Maybe something a little sleeker might be in order. Just my opinion, and Ebonbone I can truly appreciate the hard work you've done.<br>
Now if I can just get Faeolin to pose for the camera, we'd be all set. She's stubborn like that sometimes.... sheeesh!<br>

 I think your wheat block looks great, nice work Ebon.<br>
<br>
The english text is kinda hard to read, perhaps a cleaner yet still evil font.<br>
<br>
Olgivie is my favorate, my name is done in it below.<br>
<br>
But I like it, I think its great to standardize a guilds logo, and I think you have a good one there.<br>
<br>
Purple background would work and seems to carry a nostalgia for the senior members  <br>

 Okay, you know...adding sound to a message...IS HORRID. I'm sorry, I'm in a pissy mood. Let me soften my stance a bit...<br>
<br>
At first it scared the heck out of me, I couldn't figure out why my computer was howling at me...<br>
<br>
Then I thought it was hilarious when I figured out what it was...<br>
<br>
Then I had to read through several messages (and type this one in) with that constant noise going on...<br>
<br>
So I'm kinda back to horrid.   <br>
