<br>
My report could probably be summarized in two words: Celtic Dual.<br>
<br>
The Problems<br>
<br>
Celtic Dual<br>
<br>
Celtic Dual is at the heart of what is missing from the Blademaster class. As a specialized skill line, it is sorely lacking. There are three major problems with this style line:<br>
<br>
1) Lack of any style damage bonus above base weapon skill lines. Unlike other specialized skill lines, Celtic Dual styles do no more damage than regular weapon skills. The style bonuses given to Celtic Dual styles are usually equal to, and in some cases lesser than, those bonuses given when using Blades, Pierce, or Blunt styles. This makes little sense. There is currently a severe inequality between Left Axe and Celtic Dual (and Dual Wield). Left Axe base damage is reduced to compensate for both hands swinging every round. Base damage is increased as one specs in Left Axe. Celtic Dual base damage is at 100%, to compensate for the off-hand swinging only a percentage of the time. As such, the inequality occurs because Left Axe also has a much higher style bonus, due to it being a specialized skill line, while Celtic Dual does not. As a result, Celtic Dual styles are severely out-damaged by Left Axe styles, when everything is equal.<br>
<br>
2) Lack of useful styles and style effects. There is no stun effect in Celtic Dual. There are stuns in Large Weaponry, Left Axe, Pierce, Blunt, etc. There are none in CD. When weighed against equivalent styles in the base weapon style lines, Celtic Dual styles, for the most part, hold no advantage in damage dealt, effects on target, or bonuses/penalties to defense.<br>
<br>
3) Poor damage scaling in style chains. A lot of the style chains in the Celtic Dual line exhibit poor or no scaling in style damage bonus. As one example, Tornado/Meteor Shower/Twin Star often has little or no scaling, with Twin Star often having a lesser style bonus than its predecessors.<br>
<br>
The result of all this is that most Blademasters have resorted to using their base weapon styles over their Celtic Dual styles. Celtic Dual styles have, in effect, become “filler” styles for when the particular reactionary is unavailable in the base weapon line. <br>
<br>
Blades-using Blademasters (who have no stun available to them) typically choose the Blades anytime chain because of the better bonus to defense, and the attack speed reduction on Spectrum Blade. Solar Flare, the second part of the Celtic Dual anytime chain, has no effect, and has a lesser bonus to defense, and despite the fact that it is listed as being high damage, it typically does no greater damage than Spectrum Blade, which is listed as medium damage. Blades-using Blademasters typically use the after-evade and after-parry chains from Celtic Dual, due to lack of such styles in the Blades skill line. <br>
<br>
Pierce-using Blademasters have even less use for the Celtic Dual styles. The 4-part anytime chain in Pierce is superior to the Celtic Dual 2-part anytime chain. It has better to-hit bonuses, lower fatigue costs, and effects on target. The Piercing line also has a 3-part after-evade chain that includes a medium-duration stun in the first part, Diamondback. The after-parry style chain from Celtic Dual is the typical “filler” for Pierce-using Blademasters. <br>
<br>
Blunt-using Blademasters have a reversed situation, in that they have an after-parry style chain in the Blunt line that has a long duration stun in the second part of the chain.<br>
<br>
The take-home message from this? When most Blademasters are resorting to using their base weapon styles over their Celtic Dual styles, something is wrong.<br>
<br>
Lack of Identity<br>
<br>
Another issue that has plagued this class for a long time is that there is currently no overwhelming reason to play this class other than personal preference. The Blademaster is a master of nothing. They do not excel at offense, nor do they excel at defense. They can bring nothing to a group that another class cannot. This leads to an identity crisis for the class. What is a Blademaster for, exactly?<br>
<br>
<br>
What Needs to be Done<br>
<br>
We need more damage, pure and simple. No more band-aid fixes that make us viable for one round per battle. Flurry has been a nice addition, but being on a 2-minute timer, it allows us to do once per battle (meaning not once per opponent, but once per skirmish) what we should be doing all the time. The other problem with Flurry is that it doesn’t solve the problem of Celtic Dual styles being, for the most part, useless.<br>
<br>
1) Celtic Dual styles need to give significantly better style bonuses. There is no reason for these styles to not give higher style bonuses than base weapon styles. That, or increase style bonuses slightly, and have style bonuses applied to BOTH the mainhand and the offhand. <br>
<br>
2) Increase the chance to dual swing to 70-75%. At 50 CD spec, to have only a 50-60% chance (depending on which formula you use) to dual swing is insufficient and somewhat ridiculous. In it’s current form, it is too unreliable, especially given that it is prone to streakiness.<br>
<br>
3) Make Celtic Dual styles useful. Fix the scaling issues, and put a stun in the line. <br>
<br>
3a) Put a long duration stun in the Level 34 Style, Meteor Shower. <br>
<br>
3b) Remove the medium defense penalty from Hurricane.<br>
<br>
3c) Make Ice Storm the Level 4 style and make Blinding Rain the Level 18 style. This would make Ice Storm, a side-positional style that is more useful in PvE than PvP, available earlier. Make Tempest the Level 12 style, and continue to chain it off of Ice Storm. Make Blizzard the Level 29 style. Change Supernova, the Level 50 style, to chain off of Blizzard, and give it a heavy attack speed reduction effect.<br>
<br>
3d) Styles with a bleed effect should have the bleeding damage increased.<br>
<br>
3e) Gale should be changed to an anytime detaunt.<br>
<br>
4) As an alternative, a fellow Blademaster, khirgoth, put together a very comprehensive outline of other possible style changes. Ideally, this would be an entirely new style line for Blademasters, separate from other classes:<br>
<br>
————————————————<br>
There are 15 slots for styles (I used the current skill steps of course) so I broke up those 15 slots into 5 chains with 3 styles in each chain. <br>
<br>
1. Side position styles: Reduce enemies chance to hit <br>
2. Behind position styles: Movement speed reduction <br>
3. Evade styles: Increased defense <br>
4. Parry styles: attack speed reduction in first style, bleed in second, long stun in third. <br>
5. No opening styles: Straight Bonus damage. <br>
<br>
The first 5 styles I have titled Novice, the second 5 are Adept and the last 5 styles are Master. <br>
<br>

————————————————<br>
<br>
<br>
5) If not more damage, then Blademasters need to have one of the, if not the, best style lines in the game. Make the Level 50 style the third in the anytime chain, and give it a medium duration stun and put a long duration stun in Meteor Shower, the second in the parry chain. Fix the snare in Snow Shower, and make it unbreakable. Other effects that could/should be in the line: heavy attack speed reduction, strength/dexterity debuffs, AE attacks. Increase the number of defense bonuses and the to-hit bonuses. <br>
<br>
6) Add a new skill, Riposte, that will increase with level, either in damage or percentage. What this new skill will do is give the Blademaster an automatic, immediate attack after parrying an opponent.<br>
<br>
7) If any of these changes are implemented, a respec will be required for all Blademasters, as this would be a significant change, and currently most Blademasters do not spec Celtic Dual to 50.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other Issues/Bugs<br>
<br>
Snow Shower – The snare on this style is still not working. Previously, the problem was that it would break immediately when the off-hand hit. Currently, it does not work at all.<br>
<br>
Charge – This ability needs to change to make it more useful. First, it should be made faster than sprint speed. Second, it should NOT switch to sprint when the Charge time is up. This is causing major problems with it eating up endurance once engaged in combat.<br>
<br>
Prevent Flight – This RA simply costs too much. 14 points for a 35% chance to snare is not enough bang for the buck. I would propose taking the cost down to 10 points, and increasing the chance to snare to 60%, or simply reducing the cost to 6 points.<br>
<br>
Winter Moon – Even before the introduction of Flurry, this RA was deemed too little reward for too much cost. With Flurry in the picture, it has become completely unused. Blademasters need a new class-specific RA.<br>
<br>
Damage Scaling – This seems to be a problem with not just Celtic Dual styles, but other weapon styles as well. For example, in the Piercing anytime chain, Sidewinder is listed as having high damage, but it has a significantly lower style bonus/damage than it’s predecessor, Black Widow, which is listed at medium damage.<br>
<br>
Inability to Hotkey Shield – Make shields able to be equipped in the 2-hand slot. Currently, speccing in both shield and Celtic Dual is not a very attractive option, due to the inability to hotkey both an off-hand weapon and a shield. The only way to switch from one to the other at this time is to manually swap from the inventory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
<br>
In summary, the style bonuses for Celtic Dual need to be increased dramatically. They need to be made higher than base weapon styles, and more comparable to Left Axe bonuses. The styles in Celtic Dual need to be overhauled, with emphasis on putting a stun in the after-parry chain. Style bonuses in Celtic Dual need to scale properly in damage. Make Celtic Dual a style line worth using.<br>
<br>
Blademasters have been asking for these changes for a long time, and we are long overdue. There is absolutely no reason why Celtic Dual styles should not be giving higher bonuses. We do not want further band-aid timer fixes, that make us viable against one target, and then back to the same old story for the next 2, 3, 4 targets. The Blademaster should be the best melee damage dealing tank in Hibernia, and these changes would go a long way to fulfilling this. The above solutions would finally make this class a desirable class to play, and a force to be reckoned with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Elven Blademasters - There are some people out there who would like to be able to play Elven Blademasters. I think this would be a nice idea, and I think Elves would make fine Blademasters, particularly Piercing Blademasters, given their high dex. With the new addition of Lurikeen Heroes, I ask that it please be considered to allow Elves to become Blademasters.<br>
