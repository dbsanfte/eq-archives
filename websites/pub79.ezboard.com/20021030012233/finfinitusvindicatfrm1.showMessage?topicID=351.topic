<br>
I believe i was cheated on that night. The Broken Golem was up, and i was the only wizard up there, out of 3, that was needing the oil. Yet, when it came time to give the gear to the golem, someone beat me to it. I was bewildered as to who had triggered the Enraged Golem since there was no other wizards to be seen. Eventually the Enraged Golem was take down, and the oil was looted by the one and only Morkenlar (unaware of his class-but he is NOT a wizard). I find this totally outragous since i was the only class up there out of the entire raid that could use the oil. Now, i understand that other people have other characters, and such is a reality to me...BUT i believe that i deserved the oil since i was up in that plane all night waiting my turn for me epic. Second, i also think that if there is another person there that needs the piece, he (evidently me) should get the piece. If Morkenlar was up there with us with his wizard, and farther along on his epic than i, i would have no trouble backing down on my argument, yet this was not true. <br>
Another injustice i was done was the rudeness of the one they call Maxamillian. I asked him who had triggerd the Enraged Golem and told him i should be the one to get the piece, due to the circumstances. His response as rude as it was, was said like this &quot;its our raid&quot;...i find that to be very rude and are not the way things should go. Guilds do not go around ruling their raids and favoring their own memebers. If there was one of your wizards up there in need of the piece, i would not be here writing this, i understand that much. <br>
<br>
Lastly, i think i will withdraw from being an applicant of youd guild, your ways will not be tolerated with someone such as i.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>

<br>
Malkum I truely understand your frustration as it happened to me a few times but at the same time venting you must understand that we are a big guild and as PoF was &quot;our raid&quot; we reserve the right to distribute any loots droped as our leaders see fit.  Its an ugly way to look at it but its honesty and truth in the barest sense, so plz don't let this get you down and continue to persue the epic, believe me its worth it.  <p>Rymer Rundancer<BR>

We get you a robe the week before in Fear and you gate out right afterward.  You take off from a Kael faction group last weekend because there's not enough phat lewt in it for you.  You drive Morkenlar and Treston and God knows who else insane the entire Fear raid about the golem with a barrage of tells.<br>

<br>
1. Did anyone actually tell you ahead of time? Did you check ahead of time? That you would be the one who would get the peice if it drops? Raids are done for the sponsering guild, and I think that you should expect that anything you get in that raid as a petitioner is like a bonus. By demanding to have the piece because your the only wizard is just silly. Now had ANYONE said to you before the raid (Before you got in) that all epic pieces are do be merited to those furtherest along (In guild or out of guild) then I'd side with you.<br>
<br>
2. IV doesn't do Fear and Hate for equip anymore, thats what ToV is for, and I'm sure other raids. They're only there for epics.<br>
<br>
3. A Guild by a quick Denzil definition is this: A group of people to accomplish a difficult goal easier for those people. The whole reason you join a guild is to get special treatmetn by that guild. IF you could join any raid and get the loot cause yer the only class there then why be guilded at all?<br>
<br>
4. You where there just grining to him in tells saying your the only wizard there and that all the Combine (or whatever) stuff was going to go to you... NOW you don't get a epic piece that you didn't even spawn and your upset? Man you had the cake or you eat the cake... to try and have both is pretty Greedy.<br>

 <br>
First, let me explain the concept of merit to you somewhat.   Merit means,  simply put, that when you get something, it is because you  have earned it.  Occasionally, due to rareties of spawns in the game and such,  a person is  unable to be present to reap the rewards of their past  contributions.  In some of these cases, the item is held for them.  The most  clear-cut example of this is a mage that goes for an entire PoA raid, but can't  be there the day we farm the drake isle, while all of the other mages  joined when we were on the drake isle.  Guess who gets the first crown?  That't right - the mage that earned it, but due to circumstances beyond his control, couldn't be there for it.  The same principle applies in some other cases, where mobs are rare spawns and are very difficult to catch before they are killed.  <br>
<br>
It's an effort vs reward issue.  You don't go get a job, and  ask to be paid before doing any work - the same principle applies here.  You want  something?  Put the time and energy in and EARN it.  Don't expect to get something for nothing, others have been contributing to raids for a while now, and they have more merit than you, and will therefore get things before you will, because they have earned it and you have not.<br>
 <br>
 Second, raid ettiquette.  This was the most glaring issue that I had with  you, to the point that I debated telling to you just leave,  but me being a  nice guy, I decided to let you stay, in case any carmine  dropped (which it  did, incidentally, and rotted, because you had left).  You DO NOT go on<br>
 someones raid, and DEMAND loot.  Of any nature, for any  reason, EVER.  You  do not tell people to hurry up and get you something, so you  can leave -  that is particularly bad form.  I don't care if you've been  wanting your epic since they existed (who didn't, after all?), I don't  care if you spent umpteen Gajillion played time hours working on your epic.   You DO NOT go on  someone's raid and DEMAND they give you something.  Doing so is probably the most sure way to insure that you do NOT get the item, or even  a spot on a raid again.<br>
 <br>
We raid for fun.  That goes for the raid leaders as well, who  incidentally  tend to have less fun than the other raiders, because they  have to do more to make sure things happen and the raid succeeds.  So if you  whine about and demand loot, you are taking away even MORE fun from the raid  leader.  This  means that you are quite likely to be unwelcome if you wish  to raid with that leader again, because your actions have taken away from their fun.  It may SEEM minor, but raid ettiquette is a serious thing.  If you make the game less fun for me, when you're on my raid, I have 3 options: I can play/raid less, and not get to spend time with my friends; I can just resolve to play a game that is less and less fun for me; or I  can not let you come on raids again.  Guess which I'll take?  That's  right, I'll spend time with my friends, and you (or anyone that has a negative contribution since they only come on raids to get stuff and whine the  whole time) can go jump in a lake, because, &quot;sorry, we're full&quot; is a statement  I'm more and more willing to use of late, even if we don't have ANY of a  class on a raid.<br>

<br>
I do not leave raids because the loot is insufficient.<br>
<br>
Second, the Fear raid the week before...i did NOT leave just because i got what i wanted(Carmine Robe). As i told Faeline before, i had to leave anyways, whether or not i got the robe i would have been gone. You have just taken it as something else(perhaps because of my whole discussion here) and are making it seem negative.<br>
<br>
And once more, i did not leave the Kael raid with Gruberman, Bimbur, and Faeline because the loot was not good enough or to my standards. I had to leave no matter what the circumstance. Again, you have taken it the wrong way and have misconstruded my actions.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

It seems you haven't grown up too much since the time in NK when you 'borrowed' my lightstones and turned them in for plat.  I was willing to give you a chance but you seem to be extremely good at burning bridges my friend.<br>
<br>
You make it seem like we are all beating you up for leaving early on raids.  Maybe contrary to what you think, some of us DO have lives (work, school, friends) and we DO understand very clearly that real life takes precedent.  Even as an Enchanter I've never felt people were upset with me when I left a raid, but I DID make efforts to help as much as I could and communicate with the raid leader.  The issues with you are slightly different:<br>
<br>
1. You whine about the Golem and make it seem like we are doing a bad thing by supporting our OWN members on a raid.<br>
<br>
Don't quite know what to say to that except /boggle<br>
<br>
2. You have left a number of raids before the end without proper consideration to raid leads and raid members.<br>
<br>
As WELL as notifying the raid leader well before hand, try this sometime /shout Gotta run in 5 min guys, thanks for the wonderful raid.  Anyone for some last min TL's or ports before I get out of here?<br>
<br>
3. Whining to raid leads and pullers about loot.<br>
<br>
Extremely bad taste - let the pullers do their job and the raid leaders do theirs.  You need to concentrate on helping out instead of having everyone work around YOUR schedule.<br>
<br>
4. Posting a flame on our boards AFTER getting a carmine robe.<br>
<br>
I'd expect a 'thank-you' not 'you bastards should have given me more loot'.  You DO realize Mork looted it for MQing right?  Well you certainly lost any hope of him MQing it with YOU. <p><center>
