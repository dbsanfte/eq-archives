Zirrix had been in the city meeting with the representatives of King Tormax on various treaty negotiations. Such meetings usually dragged on, and were hampered by the continued attacks on the Giants by various foreign races. Unfortunately, there were always a few Teir’dal involved in such attacks. Such incidents made Zirrix’s efforts damnable difficult, and usually stalled talks. But, the Giants of Kael did not view such random and isolated attacks as declarations of war, but rather annoying sideshows, that were always dealt with victoriously. In fact, the only “Enemies” that the Giants did acknowledge were the Dragons and the Coldain. Zirrix had campaigned against those two factions of Velious long enough such that the Giants believed his commitment to their cause. Zirrix worked daily on cementing an alliance between King Tormax and the Teir’dal Empire. Such an alliance would give the Respected Race a solid base here in Velious and later, when the time came, help to facilitate the annexation of even this frozen land. He was in one such meeting when the High Priest of Rallos Zek had summoned Zirrix to the Temple of Zek.<br>
<br>
It was well know that Zirrix revered the Great Battle God, Rallos Zek, as well as the Dark Creator Innoruuk. It was no easy feat, the Gods were a jealous lot, and the more powerful Zirrix became, the more he was obligated to act on their behalf. Thus, he had to do twice as many “errands” of the Gods then others. Zirrix followed the High Priest deep into the Temple and stood before the alter. The priest had said nothing to Zirrix, and only commanded him to wait while he began his meditations. Zirrix nodded and stood by, wondering what all this was about. After a few moments, the alter flared with a grayish/black flame, and all went silent. The Priest turned suddenly to Zirrix, and the Teir’dal General fell to one knee. In place of the Priest’s face, there was the pulsating mask of Rallos Zek, the eyes burning a dark scarlet . The animate of Zek then spoke in a deep, hollow voice of power and might. It said, “ You who call yourself a true servant of Rallos Zek, you who have followed the path of battle, you must now perform a service for me. The God of Fear, Cazic-Thule, sent a minion from his Plane of Fear to steal an object of power from me. It failed, but such an insult may not go unavenged. You, who call yourself my servant shall travel to the home place of Cazic-Thule and punish the transgressor!”. Zirrix stood silent and still. He knew that the Gods often were at odds with each other and used their creations, both mortal and divine, to cause havoc and advance themselves against each other. Zirrix also knew his duty and what was required of him. Zirrix shouted in a voice clear and strong, “My Lord, Great God of Battle and Slayer of all, tell me thine will, such that I may show my faith and devotion to your everlasting Glory!”. The Priest/Messenger of Zek then spoke again, “ Go then and be my Sword, strike down the mighty Enraged Golem, and show the Fear God the folly of his treachery! Thus will I grant you your due. Go now, Dark Elven Warrior, and follow your destiny!”. The last word was like a thunderclap, and threw Zirrix against the far wall of the Temple. When his vision cleared, Zirrix saw that the High Priest was crumpled on the floor of the Temple, seemingly in a deep, exhausted sleep. Leaving the Temple, Zirrix did return to Antonica, there to dispense the vengeance of his God.<br>
<br>
Later, after his and the Violent Harvest’s victory against the Enraged Golem and other minions of Fear, Zirrix returned to his home city of Neriak to rest and plan his next campaign. Waiting at the city gates was a Herald from their Imperial Majesties with a message. It held the official seal and encased in a bejeweled platinum scroll case. Written upon the silken parchment, in the flowing script of King Naythox himself, was the following announcement:<br>
        *********************************************<br>
Be it known to all citizens of the Empire that this day an Imperial Proclamation has been issued. For his unfaltering loyalty to the Empire and the Royal House; for his honorable service to the Teir’dal and their causes; for his glorious attacks against Kelethin and Felwithe; and for all his noble victories against all the enemies of the Respected Race both ancient and newfound; Zirrix, General of the Empire, Second-Born of House T'Rhennic and Dread Lord of the Violent Harvest, has this day been proclaimed a Champion of Neriak. Let all the city and it’s people rejoice at his achievements and pay him homage. Hail Zirrix, Hail House T’Rhennic, Hail the Teir’dal Empire!<br>
       **********************************************<br>
The announcement was signed by the King, Queen, and Zirrix’s own brother Tzlar, Chancellor of the Imperial Council. Looking up from the letter, Zirrix could hear the sounds of the citizens of the Empire raised in tumultuous praise, welcoming home the newest Champion of Neriak…<br>

OOC:<br>
     To celebrate Zirrix’s 51st level, I will be hosting a gathering in the Blind Fish to celebrate. It will be held at 9:00 PM EST this Monday Nov. 26th. Please RSVP to this post so that I know how many people can attend. I need an exact count because I am preparing “packages” of food and drink for each person, so be sure to come with one empty inventory slot. Thanks in advance and have a nice Thanksgiving.<br>
