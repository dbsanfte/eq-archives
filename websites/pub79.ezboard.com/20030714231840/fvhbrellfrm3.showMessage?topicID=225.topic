<br>
The deep inhalation of a woman broke the deathly silence of the room. The woman’s green eyes fluttered open seeing clearly even though the room was enshrouded in total darkness. She found herself on a bed in her room. She pulled the heavy covers off of her and sat up on the edge of the bed. She then slid down to the icy floor. The normally immaculately clean obsidian floor had a gritty feel on her bare feet. She looked down at the floor quizzically noticing a layer of dust coating it. The woman thought this was quite odd as she employed a team of very capable servants. <br>
<br>
The woman casually reached out to the glow ball that resided on her nightstand at the head of the bed. Instead of touching the smooth glasslike surface of the ball her hand met with rough cloth. The woman, now annoyed, removed the cloth from the light and touched it. Instantly the ball took on a soft glow illuminating the room in its gentle light. <br>
<br>
For the first time she closely looked around her room. All of the furniture was covered by heavy white canvas, a think carpet of dust clung to the obsidian floor, and an aged smell hung in the air. Only her footsteps in the dust and the slept in bed disrupted the appearance of abandonment. She could not comprehend how or why the room was in its current condition. While this is the sort of practical joke her husband would pull he had long since moved beyond this realms existence. <br>
<br>
The woman silently padded over to her armoire with a thought of finding something to cover her nakedness. She pulled the canvas sheet off of the Armoire letting it drop to the floor in an explosion of dust. She then opened the door and glanced inside. She pulled out a robe of the finest silk and a pair of matching slippers from the Armoire. <br>
<br>
She silently put the soft garments on then she moved to the door leading out of the room and to the rest of the house proper. The hinges of the oaken door screamed in protest. As she stepped out of her room and into the dark hallway she reached up touching the glow ball that resided next to her door. Its light illuminated the hallway. She was greeted with more of what was in her room. Covered furniture and dust. <br>
<br>
She walked around the House and everywhere it was the same. Not surprisingly even in its obvious abandoned state the House had not been looted or robbed. The House had a long history of being unkind to rogues wishing to enlarge their purses from its riches. Many rooms held long forgotten failed experiments that were quite deadly. That with the fact that the House had been ran by Necromancers with a well-earned reputation for a depraved, by Neriaks standards, sense of humor, especially when concerning trespassers.  <br>
<br>
All throughout the House it was the same she lit glow lamps and found more dust and covered furniture. If one where to look at the House from the street in Third Gate it would seem as if the long sleeping House was coming awake. <br>
<br>
Only one room differed from the rest, the entry hall. While it too had a healthy coat of dust and canvas enshrouded furniture this room also had a single skeleton standing in the middle of it. The woman walked up to the skeleton and looked into its lifeless eye sockets. Both its immobility and the lack of unholy glow from its eyes marked the thing as a true skeleton and not one of the restless undead. <br>
<br>
The woman began to walk away from the lifeless skeleton she got no fewer than three feet when she was interrupted by a voice that sounded of dry leaves blowing in the wind, “Matron D`Plith has returned.”<br>
<br>
The woman turned to look on the creature again it now swayed back and forth and a sickly green light was emitted from its empty eye sockets.  <br>
<br>
Yes Matron D`Plith has returned, but from where and why.<br>

The hot-spring lakes were crimson, the streets black with blood old and new. Doubled and tripled patrols of guards marched through the streets with weapons at hand.<br>
<br>
His unearthly new white eyes scanned the empty streets with grim determination. Soon this must end. Innoruuk's Will must be done.<br>
<br>
He walked past the older Manses of the Noble families as he made his way back to House S`Therik, and paused as he came upon House D`Plith. Light glowed from behind every window, though the facade of the House remained dark and forboding. He arched an eyebrow as he considered the meaning of this. The Vicar Yathrin had stood beside the Violent Harvest once, if only for a brief time. Had Innoruuk returned her to Norrath then? Why.. and why now? How would this ancient power play in to the Blood Harvest, if at all?<br>
<br>
Slowly he returned to his own House to pray and prepare. Much was left to be done, and there was less time in which to do it.<br>
