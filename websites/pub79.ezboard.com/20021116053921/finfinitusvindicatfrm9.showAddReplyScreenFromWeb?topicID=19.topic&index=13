&quot;Should the government be able to make Substance X illegal?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm...  Does the government have to deal with the side effects of Substance X abuse?  Well if yeah.. Then well guess what...<br>
<br>
When you live at home with parents and parents have to deal with what you do.. then they have a right to complain and regulate what you do...  If you don't like it... move out...<br>
In regards to drugs... WEll if the government didn;t have to deal with side effects of drugs i would say.. do them all..  The more of you who kill yourselfs using drugs... the more jobs open for those who don't.<br>

<br>
1. Last year over 850,000 americans were imprisoned for marijuana related crimes.<br>
<br>
2. Of those 88% were for possession only, the other 12% were for manufactiruing/sales.<br>
<br>
3. It costs the US 10 BILLION dollars a year to fund these prosecutions and incarcerations.<br>
<br>
4. General Ashcroft has spread the umbrella of Illegal marijuana to inlcude ALL hemp products, including birdseed, shampoo, nature bars (granola type), etc. This increases the money needed to track down the offenders AND hurts the businesses and trade agreements with those countries that supply the US with HEMP products, and raw materials.<br>
<br>
5. Previous to Gen Ashcrofts descision, Commercial Hemp production was a 10 BIllion dollar a year industry in the US. This generally would put Hemp in the top 10 cash crops of the US.<br>
<br>
6. The ONLY addiction found associated with smoking pot is psychological, and the effects are usually over after a few days of non use. You will not find it so easy to stop smoking cigarettes, or drinking liquor (obviously only true if you are an achololic)<br>
<br>
7. There has been so far, no proven medical evidence that supports any physical ailments because of imbibing in marijuana, in fact, the benefits in most cases out weigh those of commercially produced &quot;hospital&quot; drugs.<br>
<br>
8. The government has an interest to protect the health of it's population, yet substances which are KNOWN to KILL people, AKA cigarettes, get government subsidies... umm, hello?<br>
<br>
9. Did youknow that Hemp can be used to make paper? Very good paper at that. Do you know how many trees can be saved every year if the Newspaper industry alone were to switch over to hemp paper? And this replacement would be by an annually renewable resource. But then I gues the logging industry would lose billions of dollars wouldn't it? Well we certainly do not want to hurt industry as long as we can breath have crap air with a growing hole in our atmosphere.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, pot was made illegal, In my opinon, in the 1940's, for political and economical reasons. Lies and half truths were developed, and to this day are supported, and spread. Making the nation ignorant and paranoid to the true value of this NATURAL substance. We can't even get Congress to VIEW legislation introduced. They do not care about facts, they only care about the myths. There is a reform act right now that has made it through the supreme court, and is on its way to the white house, concerning medical marijuana. Over night 5 people filed a lawsuit FORBIDDING DC INHABITANTS THE RIGHT TO VOTE!!! on the issue.. Sorry I thought this was America where voting was the way we decide things...<br>
<br>
I certainly understand parents not wanting their childeren to be inundated with pot commercials. I am a parent and don't want my kids smoking pot before 18, but think of the alternative. If kids see anti drug commercials &quot;drugs will kill you&quot;, and they smoke pot.. notice there are no harmful effects.. well soon they are going to get the idea that REAL drugs, Heroin, Cocaine, must not be all that bad, since pot didnt hurt me. And then they are dead from an OD. There definitly needs to be a distinction from an herb and a man made chemical.<br>
<br>
Pot is available, I personally would like to purchase it from a convieniece store or drug store than someones house.. or even better grow my own.. we really just need to get over the misconceptions, and of course, like with ANY psychoctive agent, use moderation. Pot certainly isnt for everyone, and I think that those of you that had bad experiences, or got depressed, paranoid (cause it's illegal?), should not imbibe, but I really dont think that is a good reason to make the WHOLE population suffer. This is now the 21st century, we need to start opening our eyes to what the political machine is feeding us, and take it for what everyone seems to think the big bad pot legalizers are doing. They are simply putting spin on something they wish to control for purely financial reasons.<br>
<br>
And finally to sum up, England has as of 6 months ago, stopped arresting people for misdemeanor marijuana infractions. Instead they were giving verbal warnings. This was done mainly to free up their police force and monetary resources. In the time since then they have seen a %50 decrease in street crimes. Next month they will be reclassifying marijuana from a class &quot;B&quot; drug (on par with amphetamines), to a class &quot;C&quot; drug (No Doze). This move will make marijuana possesion a non arrestable offense across the boards, I believe trafficing and large amounts of cultivatoin are still a no no.<br>

<br>
2) See 1(A crime is a crime)<br>
<br>
3) Maybe they should maye the criminals pay for their own prosecution...  (I bet that would cut down on crime too...)<br>
<br>
4)  Can you produce the help and other prpoducts without producing the drug part?  The active component Cannabis sativa?What happens with the drug part that was produced with the hemp part?  How is it disposed off?<br>
<br>
5)  Crops imported into the USA.. (aka trade deficit)   That means 10 BIllion dollar a year that won;t be leaving the USA... Or are you claiming that the USA was exporting hemp and other products?<br>
<br>
6)  If pot smoking was so... benign... why was it that &quot;Last year over 850,000 americans were imprisoned for marijuana related crimes.&quot;?  Think about it.. why would i risk going to jail for something so... petty...<br>
<br>
7) Hey... even to this day alot of people claim tobbaco does not cause cancer... Who knows what side effects will in 10-20 years be found out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So you are saying look Tobbaco is bad  and it's legal.. why don't we make another bad substance also legal... Or... should it be the other way...? Pot is already illegal...  It's alot harder to make a substance that is legal illegal.. than it is to legalize a substance...<br>
<br>
9)  Paper can be made from any cellulose..  Why not advocate recycling... that would work better than what you are claiming.  think about it...  How many patches of land get altered to grow cash crops...  what do you think would happen to whole forrests if it became legal and acceptable to grow pot...<br>
<br>
England... the same country whose police force doesn;t carry a gun..  hmm...<br>
<br>
&quot;...stopped arresting people for misdemeanor marijuana infractions. Instead they were giving verbal warnings. This was done mainly to free up their police force and monetary resources. In the time since then they have seen a %50 decrease in street crimes... &quot;<br>

No. Duh... If they stop arresting people... think there won't be a decrease in street crime?  Without arrests and prosecutions... where would you get your numbers?<br>

<br>
Could the government profit from the taxation of it?  Sure - good idea.  <br>
<br>
Should it be legal in public?  No - like smoking it effects those around you without their consent - but in your home?  On you Property?  sure.  In your car?  No.<br>
<br>
Being a libertarian I have a hard time with my tax dollars going to support the prosecution of pot related crimes.  I have a hard time with seat belt and helmet laws as well.<br>

The government should exist to protect our rights and our soil.  Not protect ourselves from stupidity.<br>

<br>
Are you only protecting those who drink and drive by making it illegal and throwing them in jail?<br>
<br>
Are you only protecting the drinker by making it illegal to drink below a certain age?(note: I do not agree with our current age limit)  I think that you should have to proove you are mature enough to handle drinking.  Age does not = mature enough.<br>
You legalize pot. prices go down... Maybe more pepople start smoking it.. maybe not.. but those who already smoke it will smoke more of it...<br>
<br>
Higher demand could actually work to raise the prices. Higher prices could in the end cause addicts or some users to commit crime to have more of it.<br>
<br>
Too many IFs to make a judgement.. but once a substance is legalized.. its a lot harder to make it illegal.  Tobacco is a perfect example of a legal substance that i doubt any of us here will ever live long enough to see made illegal.. yet doubt anyone here can argue that its nmot costly to society.. EVEN the courts agree with the cost of tobacco to society... as is evidenced by some of the big lawsuits against the tobacco companies.<br>

Drinking and driving laws supposedly exist to protect the innocent driver who might get hit by a drunk driver - the proponent for these laws are the same people who formed MADD.<br>
<br>
Seat belt laws were created the same way - someone some where was hurting and said &quot;if only they had their seat belt on!&quot;<br>
<br>
Their solution was to push for these laws.  I understand that and I can empathize with their pain - but seat belt laws are not the answer - education is.

Lets break it down...<br>
You say education is the answer... I do not disagree with you... but some people EVEN with all the education still do not put seat belt on... but the moment that they get hit with a 50-75 dollar fine.. that they remember...<br>

Do you think steabelts only protect those wearing them?<br>
<br>
now as to how this relates to the marijuana issue...<br>
<br>
I would love to live in a world where there were no laws about substances because everyone was smart enough not to abuse them.  But we don't live in such a world.  So since people can not get themselfs to think about how their actions affect the lives of others.. we have to have intermediaries to protect everyone in a more equitable way.<br>
<br>
Now since it seems enough people can not do the right thing on their own.. we had to make laws to... enforce the right things...  I'm not saying all laws are right.. but unless a law is hurting someone... well why break it?  <br>
<br>
Can you explain to me why i should feel bad and want them to legalize a drug for recreational use?<br>
<br>

<br>
1. A crime is a cirme, and that is the problem here. If it was legal that would 850,000 people whos lives would not have been destroyed because they were holding a joint. Some of those people are just like you and me, with the exception of the weed.<br>
<br>
3. To a good degree they do. By paying monetary penalties, life of imprisonment, and in most cases governent possesion of their holdings (home, cars, electronics, etc.). Now whatheppens to that stuff, is anyones guess. A Louisiana police chief was indicted a few years ago for living in the houses and driving the cars instead of selling them..<br>
<br>
4. Yes, and to a large degree that is what they do use, tho in some cases the amount of &quot;offensive&quot; THC is below .005%. You would die of smoke inhalation before you would get high, or you would have to eat so much of it that you would be sure to have your yearly fiber intake.<br>
<br>
5. No Exported crop. The US was until recently cultivating LARGE amounts of Hemp and exporting it. So our farmers basically lose 10 Billion in an environemtn where they are already losing money. Now those farmers will ahve to retool for different crops or sell out.<br>
<br>
6. Freedom? The right to choose what is best for you and your family. If my son has cancer and he has a choice between a painful medication that will only prolong his suffering, or smoking pot to subside the effects and relieve the pain, well that is a desicion I would support with every lsat ounce of strength I had.<br>
<br>
7. People have been smoking since , well, I think recorded in america since 1870ish. I know for a fact is a farvored past time in the 20's. If there were serious side effects associated with it we would know. The fact is someone dies every 63 seconds from cigarrette smoking, no one has died from smoking pot.<br>
<br>
8. Well your saying pot is a bad substance, I think that those of us trying to legalize think that it is a beneficial substnce, when properly used and in moderation, that has been wrongly viewed in a olitically skewed light to be harmful. Let' make illegal the substance known to KILL and legalize those with no known side effects. They have even recently proven in studies the smoking a pot during pregnancies, tho not encouraged to so so, show no ill effects. I think we know what really harmful drugs like cocain and cigarretts can do to a fetus, and to the early developement of a child. If not just ask, I'll fill you in.<br>
<br>
9. I agree, we should recycle more, but for those that do not wish to, hemp is better to chop down than forests. And to the second part of your statement, howmuch farm land is currently laying waste cause nothing will grow there, or its too expensive to grow a certain crop. Hemp is a weed, it will grow anywhere, and requires little to no maintanence, and can be renewed every year. Supply will follow demand as far as how much land will be talken up by the farms.<br>
<br>
England, yeah I think they got a good idea. Why does everyone need a gun? But you can be damn sure that if they need it, they have it and quick. They have some of the best armed and trained police commandos in the world. It's just a matter of when and where to apply the force. I personally am more intemidated by cops with guns than cops with night sticks..<br>
<br>
&quot;No. Duh..&quot;<br>
Well silly, they are not going to stop arresting burglers, muggers, car jackers, and so forth.. these are the &quot;street&quot; crimes, not holding a joint.<br>
<br>
Good rebuttles, keep em coming =P<br>
<br>
Peace to ya!<br>

<br>
Rez, on occasion I use the 'reefer.'  I don't smoke cigarettes, I never have smoked cigarettes, and I don't plan on ever smoking cigarettes.  I think they're gross, it's not a huge thing, it's just not for me.<br>
<br>
I don't smoke weed to &quot;be cool.&quot;  I don't smoke just for the sake of smoking.  I smoke to get high, once I'm high, I stop smoking.  <br>
<br>
The reason I do this, on occasion, is because, well, it's a helluva lotta fun.  Now, I feel that if you resort to drugs or alchohol to *have* fun, then that is a problem.  If it's one of the things you do, occasionally -- like getting drunk -- then it's fine.  I believe *anything* is bad if you do it too much.  Drugs.  Alchohol.  Sex.  Eq.  Eating.  Sleeping. <br>
<br>
But in moderation?  Hell most things are fine.  Just play it smart, use your head, and don't abuse what you use.  God taht sounded like a commercial.  I'll give you a quick list of things that are so much more fun high, you wonder why you hadn't tried the stuff earlier =p<br>
<br>
1. Swimming<br>
2. Hot tubbing<br>
3. Snowboarding<br>
4. Walking around hehe<br>
5. Any of the above, while listening to ANY music<br>
6. Any music<br>
7. Snowball fights<br>
8. Just sitting and talking with friends<br>
9. Playing video games<br>
10. Reading a good book<br>
<br>
Any number of things, you get the idea.<br>
I had to leave and run some errands mid-post, and I lost my train of thought once I got back, so I'm just posting what I have.<br>

<br>
I am for legalization because it should be my choice to do something that is not THAT harmful.  If we set the standard with Alchohal and go from there, Marijuana should be legal as it's detrimental qualities are certainly not more than that.<br>

British Study Warns of Health Danger of Cannabis<br>
Mon Nov 11,12:32 PM ET<br>
<br>
LONDON (Reuters) - Smoking three pure cannabis joints is as bad for your lungs as smoking 20 normal cigarettes and marijuana is more dangerous now than it was in the 1960s, British researchers said on Monday. <br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
In what it described as a shocking new report, the British Lung Foundation (BLF) said tar from cannabis cigarettes contained 50% more carcinogens--the agents that produce cancer--than tobacco. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage to the lining of the airways as 20 cigarettes,&quot; it said in a statement. <br>
<br>
<br>
It also said the health dangers of cannabis have substantially increased since the 1960s because today's marijuana has increased amounts of a key chemical compound. <br>
<br>
<br>
Campaigners for the legalization of cannabis disputed some of the findings. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Saying that cannabis is stronger now than it used to be is like saying that orange juice is stronger these days,&quot; said Alun Buffry, spokesman for the Legalize Cannabis Alliance. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I smoked stuff in the 1960s which was certainly stronger than what's available now and, anyway, when it's stronger, people smoke less of it.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
BFL chairman Mark Britton said: &quot;These statistics will come as a surprise to many people, especially those who choose to smoke cannabis rather than tobacco in the belief it is 'safer' for them.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is vital that people are fully aware of the dangers so they can make an educated decision and know the damage they may be causing,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
<br>
The BFL stressed it was not taking a moral stance on the contentious issue of legalizing the drug. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We're not trying to say 'smoke' or 'don't smoke' cannabis,&quot; BLF Chief Executive Dame Helena Shovelton told BBC Radio. &quot;We're saying that if you do, understand the risks involved in doing so. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't have the same situation we had with tobacco, which was years of denial about the problems,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
The BFL urged the government to implement a public health education campaign on health risks of the drug. <br>
