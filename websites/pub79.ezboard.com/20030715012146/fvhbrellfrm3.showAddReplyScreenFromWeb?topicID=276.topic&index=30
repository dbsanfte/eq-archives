Part 18.</span><hr size=1> The great library of Myrist was on odd place to find a Rogue, but Tzanntiel had found a quiet little niche on one of the highest floors away from the researchers and lore keepers where she could study the notes that Galtran had written for her.  She leaned her back against the stone wall between two immense bookshelves full of neatly organized tomes that were no doubt worth more than some kingdoms.<br>
<br>
The ingredients were an odd collection, some easy to find, others near impossible.  A gill of the juice from green seedpods of the white poppy, the scale of a dragon, a draught of the blood of a vampire, a dram of dust from Kerafyrm’s tomb, five leaves from the hemlock plant, two grams of pure granulated amber, the bezoar of a poisonous frog, and something from a person whom the cursed one loves enough to live for.  Reading that last one, Tzann idly wondered if she could just double up on the dust from Kerafyrm’s tomb.<br>
<br>
The poppy extract and the hemlock leaves Tzann had established suppliers for; she was fond of both for different reasons.  Sure a gill’s worth of the poppy extract was a lot, but she was certain her suppliers could come through for her.  The vampire blood was also a simple enough matter for her.  Amber could be bought almost anywhere.  Khasirath had a number of dragon scales he had saved from different hunts stored in his rooms at House S`Therik.  Normally Tzann wouldn’t dream of stealing from her brother’s trophies, but under the circumstances, she felt he would approve.  The bezoar was an oddity, but Tzanntiel had heard of them.  She knew a few merchants who would sell her something they swore was one, but she thought it would be better to slaughter the poisonous frogs on her own until she could retrieve the reddish stone from one of their heads and be sure it was authentic.  A side benefit of that would be restocking her supplies of their venoms.<br>
<br>
All those things were simple enough. It was the other two ingredients that worried her.  Sleeper’s Tomb was a fearsome place, and not many hunted there.  Doubly so now that Kerafyrm had been awakened.  Finding someone who knew the secrets of entering the place would be hard, but she felt not impossible.  Her mind already raced through possibilities for gaining the dust.<br>
<br>
Staring at the page of notes without seeing it, Tzanntiel tried to think hard.  Did her brother truly love anyone?  And enough to want to live for them?  She knew of her brother’s lovers, even a few dalliances that would make such lovely blackmail material if he weren’t her favorite sibling.  But she sincerely doubted that Khasirath loved any one of them.  If one were to twist the meanings of the words, her brother did want to live to serve Innoruuk, but she somehow felt twisting the meanings of words in a recipe such as this one could be disastrous.  Even if it would work, she wasn’t about to go off hunting the Plane of Hate for the Father’s nail clippings.<br>
<br>
Further, so many of these ingredients were fatally toxic.  Sure the bezoar was purported to neutralize poisons, but she didn’t know if she would trust her brother’s life to that legend.  And was Khasirath supposed to drink this concoction?  She may have the recipe, but it didn’t answer everything.  And a part of her still doubted that it was the cure.  It could be a trap; something designed to kill her brother despite the collar’s wards.  But why wouldn’t the person who placed the basket and note simply have killed him then?  Or they could have stolen him away and done it elsewhere.  Perhaps they were trying to trick Tzanntiel into doing it for them.  But why go to such lengths?<br>
<br>
Putting the notes back into her cloak, Tzanntiel rested her face in her hands, sighing deeply.  She had too many questions and too few answers.<br>
<br>
Tugging her cloak more tightly around herself, Tzanntiel stood up.  She left the library at a leisurely pace, thinking while she walked to the southern end of the Plane where she found the portal to Neriak.  In an instant she was transported to the welcoming familiarity of Nektulos forest, and she walked slowly to Neriak, then down to the Third Gate and into House S`Therik.<br>
<br>
No one bothered her as she went to Vhalshae’s room, but she found it empty.  Frowning she wandered the huge manse, searching for her sister.  Stopping a servant, she found out that her sister had been called into the Matron’s chambers earlier that day, and had not yet emerged.  Tzanntiel returned to her room with a sigh, waiting for Vhalshae to return.<br>
<br>
Sitting at her desk she pulled out the notes again and read them over.  She pulled a fresh sheet of parchment from her desk and copied the list out in Teir`Dal script.  She carefully blotted and dried the ink, then folded the new page up with the others and tucked them back into her cloak pocket.<br>
<br>
Restlessly Tzanntiel paced her room for a few minutes.  She despised waiting.  Wandering into the hall she walked down the corridor and stopped in front of a door near the staircase.  She rested a hand on its smooth surface, taking a quick moment to look it over for any traps or wards.  With a bit of surprise, she realized it was safe.  She looked up and down the hall and stairs, listening closely to be sure she was alone.  Then she pulled some slim lock picks from her pouch and bent to unlock the door.  It only took a moment for her to open the door silently and slip inside, closing the door behind her.<br>
<br>
There was no light in the room she entered, but she could see well enough the simple chairs and table next to a small shelf of books.  Two doors led deeper into the suite.  Crossing the floor as silently as a ghost, Tzanntiel pushed open the leftmost door.  She stood in the doorway silently for a long while, looking at the simply decorated bedroom.  The bed was neatly made with dark furs over the equally dark blanket; the floor was covered in a rust red rug.  An armour chest sat at the foot of the bed, and an armoire of ebon wood stood against one wall.  There was only one small high window in the room, and underneath it was a small altar table.  The pale mage-light Eye of Innoruuk over the window shed the only light in the entire suite.<br>
<br>
Tzann wrapped her arms around herself, holding onto her shoulders as she looked at her brother’s room.  She hadn’t been in here since he’d gone missing.  It was so still and dark, yet somehow she felt that she was being watched.  She shook off the feeling with effort.  She knew where Khasirath was, and there was nothing here that could harm her.<br>
<br>
She crossed the room to the altar table, and stood silently looking at the staff and sword under the window.  Her gaze traveled slowly down to the altar itself, with the brass brazier, the minotaur-horn drinking cup, the old bone and blade all carefully arranged on a red silk cloth.  She could smell the faded spicy aroma of the unlit incense in the brazier.  She wanted to touch these things, wondering what rituals her brother had performed here, wondering what he has Seen while staring at the flame that would have filled the brazier.  She stopped herself though, it just didn’t seem right.  She knew Khasirath would be furious with her for even being here.<br>
<br>
Kneeling, Tzann lifted the hem of the altar cloth and looked under the table.  She pulled out an old dark wood trunk and gently opened it.  Inside were many bundles of different colored silken cloth.  With a softly muttered apology, she began to sift through them, setting each one aside carefully.  There were all manner of fangs and claws, bones, tufts of hair and fur.  A small jar held what looked to be a preserved tongue; a scrap of parchment across the cork of the jar was labeled ‘Nindyilied’.  Shrugging Tzann set that too aside, and kept searching.  Finally in a large black velvet pouch she found a number of bright red and shining white scales.  Each one was only a bit larger than her hand, and she knew them to be from dragons that Khasirath had slain.  Looking through them, she selected one of the red ones, and then packed everything else back into the trunk carefully.  Sliding the trunk back under the altar table, Tzann stood back up, looking around the bedroom with a sigh.<br>
<br>
Though she wasn’t often given to prayer, Tzanntiel paused as she was about to leave the bedroom, staring back at the altar she softly muttered her hope that the Father would see to it that this room wasn’t empty for long.<br>
<br>
Tzann leaned her ear against the door leading out to the hall before she opened it, and heard a faint tread moving down the hallway.  She waited, counting the soft footsteps until she heard a door open, then a moment later it closed.  Counting slowly to twenty, she heard nothing more.  Carefully she slipped the door open and stepped into the hall.  Resetting the lock she pulled the door closed and made sure it was well latched.<br>
<br>
Finally she walked down the hall to Vhalshae’s door.  If her guess was right, the footsteps had stopped there.  Sure enough, when she gently rapped at the door, her sister opened it.  Vhalshae stepped back to let her in without a word.  Her eyes shone dully, as if she were deeply exhausted.<br>
<br>
As Tzanntiel walked in she shut the door.  “Are you alright, Vhal?”<br>
<br>
The Prophetess walked slowly to her bed and sat down, rubbing her face with one hand.  “Aye.  Our Matron grows weary of carrying this child.  She demands attendance at odd hours, insisting I stand and pray for the child’s strength and quick coming.  She only just permitted me to leave.”<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel chuckled softly, “As much as she enjoys increasing our ranks, I’ve never felt she liked bearing children.”<br>
<br>
Vhalshae nodded slowly, “Aye.  Six children is quite a good number, and at her age it is not getting easier.”<br>
<br>
Tzann reached into her cloak and pulled out her newest translation of the notes, “I hate to do this when you are already so tired, but I have something I need you to look at.”<br>
<br>
Vhalshae held out her hand without looking, and Tzann gave her the page.  Vhalshae read it over slowly, her brow creased faintly in thought.  “This is a strange list, sister.  What is it?”<br>
<br>
Tzann shrugged, “I’m not certain, and that is what has me worried.  It could be a cure, or it could be a trap.  I need you to pray, to see if you can divine its purpose.”<br>
<br>
Vhalshae sighed deeply, and refolded the page.  She slipped it under her pillow and lay down on the bed, still in her plain dark robe.  “Let me sleep on it, sister.  I am too weary for the rituals.  Perhaps I shall See in my dreams.  If not I will pray when I wake.”<br>
<br>
Nodding, Tzanntiel moved to the side of the bed, looking down at her sister.  Though she was a woman now, there still seemed to be a child-like frailty to her.  It was a strange contrast to the ageless wisdom and ancient powers she wielded.  Almost hesitantly, Tzanntiel bent down and kissed Vhalshae on the cheek.  “Good luck, sister.  I will be in my rooms if you need to see me.”<br>
<br>
Vhalshae put her hand over her own cheek gently, holding the place that Tzanntiel had kissed.  She looked up into Tzanntiel’s eyes silently for a long moment, her face almost unreadable.  Tzann couldn’t decide if it was shock or something else she saw deep in those endless black eyes.  “Hate guide you, sister,” Vhalshae whispered softly, rolling over to face away from Tzann.<br>
<br>
Silently Tzanntiel left her sister’s room, and walked back to her own.  She shook her head faintly, wondering at what had possessed her to do that.  Yes, Vhalshae was her sister, but she was a Priestess, and a Prophet!  People had been slain for far less.<br>
<br>
As Tzanntiel slipped out of her clothes and prepared for bed, she looked over her other copy of the notes.  It was just as meaningless now as it had been, but she couldn’t get it out of her thoughts.  Drifting off to sleep, her mind pulled forth the image of her brother, pale and cold, and so very far away.  A small shiver ran through her as sleep stole her sight.<br>
