His kit was open beside him, and with care he saw to cleaning and fixing each piece of armour. He replaced and oiled the straps, fixed small dents and scratches, then scrubbed and polished the bronze until it gleamed in the violet and blue mage-lights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He smiled to himself as he placed the armour in his chest between sheets of oilcloth. With only a few modifications, his gear should serve him well until he could earn the Dark Forge armour he had been coveting since he was a child. Armour just like his Sire Vazkiel wore.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Standing up he closed the chest and turned slowly, looking around his bedroom. As eldest child of the House, Khasirath had been given a large suite of rooms which he hardly used. The bedroom was sparsely furnished, holding only a plain and narrow bed, his armour chest and an armoire for his other clothing. Under the single small window sat his altar table, covered with a cloth of crimson silk. The House of course maintained an altar room dedicated to the Father, but Khasirath felt the need for a personal altar to meditate at. Looking out the window he saw the dark beauty of Third Gate, and the waterways winding between the various Noble Houses.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a soft click his door opened and Khasirath turned around with a frown of annoyance. He came to his rooms to be alone, and his family knew that. For the most part they respected his wishes, and his Matron or Sire would only send a servant to bother him if something were wrong.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But it was not a servant that Khasirath saw. It was his sister Tzanntiel, her silver-white hair dripping as she walked in with a smile, wearing only an emerald green silk robe with a wide trailing black sash. She left damp footprints on the rug as she crossed the floor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath sighed, his frown fading. He rested a hand on his hip as he watched Tzanntiel sit down on his bed. “Do make yourself at home, dear sister,” he offered with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel just laughed, looking up at him, “You should come swimming with me, Khas. You’ve been spending far too much time away to just hide away up here when you do come home.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath shrugged faintly. He felt his hunting and duties to Innoruuk and the Flame of Hate had to come before the luxury of spending time with family. But the thought of a long soak in the bathing chambers was very tempting. Part of the basement of House S’Therik contained deep basins carved in the living stone, fed by the hot springs of Lavastorm. The water was hot and mineral rich, both soothing and invigorating.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Perhaps I will join you later, Tzann… I still have some things to see to.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The younger Teir’Dal pouted, then patted the bed beside her. “At least come talk with me a while. I really have missed you.” Her vibrant green eyes glittered with mischief.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath smiled softly and sat beside his sister. He really could not resist her for long. As soon as he sat she crawled around to sit behind him, sliding her long slim legs to either side of him. She enjoyed the feel of his black doe-suede breeches against the insides of her thighs. She began threading her nimble fingers into his long hair, combing and coiling it playfully. Khasirath’s hair was much longer than most male’s, flowing down to the small of his back, one of his few vanities.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath closed his eyes and lowered his head with a deep and purring sigh, his whole body relaxing. His sister chuckled and continued to play with his hair, plaiting some of it into fine long braids, adding small glass beads of black, silver and red that she’d tucked into the pocket of her bathing robe. She wiggled a little closer to him, leaning her lithe body against his strong back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So tell me where you have been, brother. What have you been hunting?” she urged.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath smiled at the hunger in her voice. They were so very much alike; both had a strong desire to see the world, to drain all they could from the experiences it offered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have been to the new land, the Danak Outpost. It is a strange place, full of bizarre new creatures. I have battled the Sarnak, which are like tall wingless dragon-men, and also walking plants.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Like the Treants?” Tzanntiel asked with excitement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Somewhat,” he replied slowly, unbothered by her interruption, “But much smaller, about the height of a human. They have tough skin and vicious barbs and thorns. They are much like the plants of the desert. There are also great saber-toothed cats, and the Rhinoceroses,” he added with a smile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The what?” Tzanntiel asked, blinking at the foreign word.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They are hard to describe. You have heard of the elephants of the Southern Plains, correct?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye, I have seen some diagrams and descriptions at the Library.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They are a bit like those, but not quite so large. Still thick of hide and grey in color. They do not have the long trunk, instead they have a powerful horn at the end of their muzzle.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They sound fierce,” Tzanntiel admitted with awe.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They are,” he chuckled. “And swift. I have heard of them running down men who run with the Wolf’s Spirit.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel just nodded, her mind swimming with her imaginings of those creatures. “I wish I were old enough to travel with you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It will take time… You have much to learn, much growing to do.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am not a child anymore, Khasirath. I have been to Freeport,” she said with a frown, feeling she had to defend herself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What?” Khasirath demanded angrily.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel pulled away, standing up to look down at her brother. “I have been hunting on my own for a long time now. You have been too busy with your Guild to take notice.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath frowned, “You should not be leaving Nektulos so soon! You are not ready.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel’s eyes narrowed. “I am stronger than you know, brother. The forest holds nothing for me now; there is nothing more for me to learn there. I must hunt further afield or stagnate.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath shook his head, his violet eyes sparking with anger and disbelief.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Just because I did not join the Dead or the Spires does not make me some weakling that must be kept cloistered on the House grounds!” she continued to rail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath turned away, his face growing flush with embarrassment that she knew his thoughts so well. He found himself staring at his altar, the Eye of Innoruuk hanging over it in pale hued mage-lights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Forgive me, Tzanntiel. I have indeed been away too long. It is just hard for me to believe that you are already so strong in the Will. I was already beginning my journey on the Path when you were born, already Emissary of the Flame when you shocked us all by joining the Ebon Mask…” His apology trailed off and he looked up at his sister with genuine sorrow in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel still had a hard look in her eyes, her fists on her hips. Then with an impish grin she walked closer to Khasirath, standing right between his legs as he sat on the edge of the bed. She reached down and lifted his chin with a finger. “I forgive you, big brother,” she said, kissing him softly on the lips. “You should come hunting with me tomorrow. That should prove to you that I really am old enough to take care of myself.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath smiled indulgently. “You win, Tzann. Tomorrow I will go swimming with you, then you can take me to the Commonlands and show me what the Mask has taught you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel all but glowed with excitement and happiness. “I will hold you to that promise, dear brother. I know your honor will not allow you to fail me.” She turned around and sat between Khasirath’s feet. “So tell me more. Where else have you been, and where do you plan to go when next you leave us?”<br>
<br>
Khasirath began to massage Tzanntiel’s shoulders and neck, smoothing her hair to one side and sweeping it over her shoulder. She purred softly, tilting her head forward, stretching her smooth indigo neck to his touch.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have hunted some in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. I fought beside some Rogues of the Ebon Mask there, and in Kunark, and I must admit their skill has impressed me. I have even recovered some pieces of decayed armour that in time I will have made into my Dark Forge armour.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Very nice. Father will be proud of you,” Tzanntiel said with a smile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath grinned openly, continuing to massage his sister’s neck and shoulders. “As to what I will be doing… I must travel to the Arena. I have been called upon to defend the Father’s Will against the lightblinded.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That sounds most intriguing,” she said softly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I cannot tell you much. There is a woman who has acted against the Father too much as of late. She turned a Teir’Dal away from Innoruuk, blinded him with false ideals of free will and love,” Khasirath sneered at the words. “I will see that she pays well, and that she be made an example to her fellows so that Hate may swell within them.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel nodded slowly, her brow creasing with worry, “It sounds dangerous, Khas. Surely her friends will come to her aid.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are correct, dear sister. But the Will must be obeyed. I do not fear mortal retribution or death, for my hate is strong and I am true to the Will.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel sighed softly and remained quiet. She could not admit to any of her House, her brother especially, that she did not hear the Father’s Will, as they all seemed to. She did worship Innoruuk, and drew upon hate as her strength, but she followed the Will as taught by the Priests and Prophets. She did not feel the Father’s Hand upon her. And most of all, she feared that Khasirath already knew of her weakness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lost in his own thoughts of coming battle, Khasirath did not notice his sister’s concerns. He gave her neck one last warm squeeze, and then patted her shoulder. “Alright my little rogue. You should get to bed and let me do the same. There is much for us to do on the morrow.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tzanntiel stood with a soft sigh, and pulled Khasirath to his feet with a smile. “As you wish, my brother. I cannot wait for our hunt.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath grinned wolfishly at the blood lust in his sister’s eyes. They embraced tightly, and Tzanntiel leaned up to give Khasirath another kiss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She paused at the doorway, smiling over her shoulder. “Sleep well, Khas. Dream of the darkest days.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You too, Tzann. I will see you tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After she had gone, Khasirath sighed deeply, turning back to his altar. He knelt before it gracefully, bowing his head before lighting the incense in the blackened silver brazier at the center of the altar. The heady spicy scent was like blood on the battlefield and the wailing sorrow of the lost. Khasirath breathed it in deeply, his chest rising and falling in slow meditative breaths. The brazier’s flame represented the Father’s Hate burning within the breast of His chosen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Minotaur-horn drinking vessel rested in a silver stand behind the brazier, but tonight there was no offering of heretic’s blood for the Father. Khasirath grinned with pleasure as he anticipated sharing that libation with his Lord after the upcoming battle at the Arena.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To the left of the brazier was an old and blackened femur scribed with runes in the Elder Teir’Dal. It represented the undead servants of the Will that Khasirath, as a Knight of Shadow, commanded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To the right lay a fine sacrificial blade with an ebony handle, the metal glowing sanguine in the brazier’s light.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And above the altar, just below the small window, hung crossed a sword and staff. The staff was made of Treant wood, polished and carved with more Elder runes, and adorned with small tokens of Khasirath’s battles. Teeth and claws, bits of fur and bone were bound to it by cords of silk and sinew. It was a testament to his strength. There were twenty-three tokens on the staff.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sword was old and plain, with an ebony pommel. The edge showed some nicks of real use, but it was well honed and polished. It represented the Path of the Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath removed his shirt, folding it carefully and placing it to one side. Across his indigo arms, shoulders and chest were vivid and wild images of blood red. Some formed Elder Teir’Dal runes and others were stylized patterns. Though the markings looked much like tattoos, they were more truthfully scars. An experienced healer could recognize the scarring as being the effects of the Father’s Touch left to heal without magical assistance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Khasirath looked above the altar table at the floating Eye of Innoruuk, and beyond it to the crossed sword and staff. He drew one more deep breath and let his thoughts drift into a mantra of Hate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am Teir’Dal. My will is the Will of Innoruuk. We shall unmake the world. I am born Shadow Knight. My sword is the Sword of Innoruuk. The Mouth of Innoruuk shall not be closed,” he intoned, beginning his hour-long meditation and communion with the Father. Only with this task complete would Khasirath allow himself to sleep.<br>
