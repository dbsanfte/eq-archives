<br>
Drinking and driving laws supposedly exist to protect the innocent driver who might get hit by a drunk driver - the proponent for these laws are the same people who formed MADD.<br>
<br>
Seat belt laws were created the same way - someone some where was hurting and said &quot;if only they had their seat belt on!&quot;<br>
<br>
Their solution was to push for these laws.  I understand that and I can empathize with their pain - but seat belt laws are not the answer - education is.

<br>
Lets break it down...<br>
You say education is the answer... I do not disagree with you... but some people EVEN with all the education still do not put seat belt on... but the moment that they get hit with a 50-75 dollar fine.. that they remember...<br>
<br>
Do you think steabelts only protect those wearing them?<br>
<br>
now as to how this relates to the marijuana issue...<br>
<br>
I would love to live in a world where there were no laws about substances because everyone was smart enough not to abuse them.  But we don't live in such a world.  So since people can not get themselfs to think about how their actions affect the lives of others.. we have to have intermediaries to protect everyone in a more equitable way.<br>
<br>
Now since it seems enough people can not do the right thing on their own.. we had to make laws to... enforce the right things...  I'm not saying all laws are right.. but unless a law is hurting someone... well why break it?  <br>
<br>
Can you explain to me why i should feel bad and want them to legalize a drug for recreational use?<br>
<br>

Sure have - deer run out into the road... roads get icy - bad things happen.  Everyone should wear a seatbelt - everyone should wear a helmet.  However it should not be a law.  <br>
<br>
Speed limits while just as annoying are different.  If you lose control of your car while exceeding the speed limit you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> willfully</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> endanger the lives of others.  That should be illegal.<br>

If you willfully endanger your own life by choosing to stupidly leave your belt off its your choice.<br>

<br>
1. A crime is a cirme, and that is the problem here. If it was legal that would 850,000 people whos lives would not have been destroyed because they were holding a joint. Some of those people are just like you and me, with the exception of the weed.<br>
<br>
3. To a good degree they do. By paying monetary penalties, life of imprisonment, and in most cases governent possesion of their holdings (home, cars, electronics, etc.). Now whatheppens to that stuff, is anyones guess. A Louisiana police chief was indicted a few years ago for living in the houses and driving the cars instead of selling them..<br>
<br>
4. Yes, and to a large degree that is what they do use, tho in some cases the amount of &quot;offensive&quot; THC is below .005%. You would die of smoke inhalation before you would get high, or you would have to eat so much of it that you would be sure to have your yearly fiber intake.<br>
<br>
5. No Exported crop. The US was until recently cultivating LARGE amounts of Hemp and exporting it. So our farmers basically lose 10 Billion in an environemtn where they are already losing money. Now those farmers will ahve to retool for different crops or sell out.<br>
<br>
6. Freedom? The right to choose what is best for you and your family. If my son has cancer and he has a choice between a painful medication that will only prolong his suffering, or smoking pot to subside the effects and relieve the pain, well that is a desicion I would support with every lsat ounce of strength I had.<br>
<br>
7. People have been smoking since , well, I think recorded in america since 1870ish. I know for a fact is a farvored past time in the 20's. If there were serious side effects associated with it we would know. The fact is someone dies every 63 seconds from cigarrette smoking, no one has died from smoking pot.<br>
<br>
8. Well your saying pot is a bad substance, I think that those of us trying to legalize think that it is a beneficial substnce, when properly used and in moderation, that has been wrongly viewed in a olitically skewed light to be harmful. Let' make illegal the substance known to KILL and legalize those with no known side effects. They have even recently proven in studies the smoking a pot during pregnancies, tho not encouraged to so so, show no ill effects. I think we know what really harmful drugs like cocain and cigarretts can do to a fetus, and to the early developement of a child. If not just ask, I'll fill you in.<br>
<br>
9. I agree, we should recycle more, but for those that do not wish to, hemp is better to chop down than forests. And to the second part of your statement, howmuch farm land is currently laying waste cause nothing will grow there, or its too expensive to grow a certain crop. Hemp is a weed, it will grow anywhere, and requires little to no maintanence, and can be renewed every year. Supply will follow demand as far as how much land will be talken up by the farms.<br>
<br>
England, yeah I think they got a good idea. Why does everyone need a gun? But you can be damn sure that if they need it, they have it and quick. They have some of the best armed and trained police commandos in the world. It's just a matter of when and where to apply the force. I personally am more intemidated by cops with guns than cops with night sticks..<br>
<br>
&quot;No. Duh..&quot;<br>
Well silly, they are not going to stop arresting burglers, muggers, car jackers, and so forth.. these are the &quot;street&quot; crimes, not holding a joint.<br>
<br>
Good rebuttles, keep em coming =P<br>
<br>
Peace to ya!<br>

<br>
Rez, on occasion I use the 'reefer.'  I don't smoke cigarettes, I never have smoked cigarettes, and I don't plan on ever smoking cigarettes.  I think they're gross, it's not a huge thing, it's just not for me.<br>
<br>
I don't smoke weed to &quot;be cool.&quot;  I don't smoke just for the sake of smoking.  I smoke to get high, once I'm high, I stop smoking.  <br>
<br>
The reason I do this, on occasion, is because, well, it's a helluva lotta fun.  Now, I feel that if you resort to drugs or alchohol to *have* fun, then that is a problem.  If it's one of the things you do, occasionally -- like getting drunk -- then it's fine.  I believe *anything* is bad if you do it too much.  Drugs.  Alchohol.  Sex.  Eq.  Eating.  Sleeping. <br>
<br>
But in moderation?  Hell most things are fine.  Just play it smart, use your head, and don't abuse what you use.  God taht sounded like a commercial.  I'll give you a quick list of things that are so much more fun high, you wonder why you hadn't tried the stuff earlier =p<br>
<br>
1. Swimming<br>
2. Hot tubbing<br>
3. Snowboarding<br>
4. Walking around hehe<br>
5. Any of the above, while listening to ANY music<br>
6. Any music<br>
7. Snowball fights<br>
8. Just sitting and talking with friends<br>
9. Playing video games<br>
10. Reading a good book<br>
<br>
Any number of things, you get the idea.<br>
I had to leave and run some errands mid-post, and I lost my train of thought once I got back, so I'm just posting what I have.<br>

Marijuana doesn't impact me the same way it does a casual smoker.  I don't smoke for the &quot;high&quot; I do it because I enjoy smoking, much like a Tobacco pipe or Cigar smoker.  The fact is that Nicotine makes me sick to my stomach.  Marijauna relaxes me, and makes me hungry (sometimes).<br>
<br>
I am for legalization because it should be my choice to do something that is not THAT harmful.  If we set the standard with Alchohal and go from there, Marijuana should be legal as it's detrimental qualities are certainly not more than that.<br>

People use other drugs because of bad judgement moreso than because they smoked marijuana.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ufakr420.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fakr420</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/26/02 2:03:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legalization of Marijuana: Good or Bad?</span><hr size=1> im sittin here blazed, half confused on wtf most you people are talkn about. i think i understood some of it, but most of it<br>

British Study Warns of Health Danger of Cannabis<br>
Mon Nov 11,12:32 PM ET<br>
<br>
LONDON (Reuters) - Smoking three pure cannabis joints is as bad for your lungs as smoking 20 normal cigarettes and marijuana is more dangerous now than it was in the 1960s, British researchers said on Monday. <br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
In what it described as a shocking new report, the British Lung Foundation (BLF) said tar from cannabis cigarettes contained 50% more carcinogens--the agents that produce cancer--than tobacco. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage to the lining of the airways as 20 cigarettes,&quot; it said in a statement. <br>
<br>
<br>
It also said the health dangers of cannabis have substantially increased since the 1960s because today's marijuana has increased amounts of a key chemical compound. <br>
<br>
<br>
Campaigners for the legalization of cannabis disputed some of the findings. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Saying that cannabis is stronger now than it used to be is like saying that orange juice is stronger these days,&quot; said Alun Buffry, spokesman for the Legalize Cannabis Alliance. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I smoked stuff in the 1960s which was certainly stronger than what's available now and, anyway, when it's stronger, people smoke less of it.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
BFL chairman Mark Britton said: &quot;These statistics will come as a surprise to many people, especially those who choose to smoke cannabis rather than tobacco in the belief it is 'safer' for them.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is vital that people are fully aware of the dangers so they can make an educated decision and know the damage they may be causing,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
<br>
The BFL stressed it was not taking a moral stance on the contentious issue of legalizing the drug. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We're not trying to say 'smoke' or 'don't smoke' cannabis,&quot; BLF Chief Executive Dame Helena Shovelton told BBC Radio. &quot;We're saying that if you do, understand the risks involved in doing so. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't have the same situation we had with tobacco, which was years of denial about the problems,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
The BFL urged the government to implement a public health education campaign on health risks of the drug. <br>
