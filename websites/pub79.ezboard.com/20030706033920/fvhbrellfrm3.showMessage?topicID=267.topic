Knowing that the assassin would not stay on the wall for long, Natori went straight for the nearest exits, let the trackers search for signs of passage, that was their place.   After an intensive search, none had found either the assassin or signs of his or her passage, and Daiunus called the Father’s chosen back to the Dragon of Hate.   Natori took a few seconds before returning to see if a similar attack had been made on her father.  She knew it was only a matter of time before the botched attempt on his life was completed.   Or maybe it wouldn’t be, it was a far greater dishonor to the man to remain in his current state.  But that is what was ordered, in the hopes of finding both a cure and the identity of the assassin.  As usual, she found the bumbling idiot that had once been a great ambassador sitting in the maiden’s fancy with a drink in hand.   She was his daughter, and his gaze passed through her as if she did not exist.   It still pained her to be forgotten to him, even if it was not his fault.<br>
<br>
An attempt was made on Darkrayne’s life.  That means one will be made on her own soon.  Heading back to the Dragon of Hate, Natori wondered exactly what she would tell the others.  Darkyrane had insisted on secrecy in this matter, but an attack at a sacred meeting of the Harvest did bring them into it, weather she wanted them involved or not.   Almost as soon as she approached the others, Daiunus gave an order for someone to remain with her for the time being, and Natori was left wondering exactly how much he already knew.<br>
<br>
Before taking her place in the circle, Natori knelt behind Daiunus and whispered, “I know something of the assassin.   They are the same as those that made the assassination attempt on my father’s life.”<br>
<br>
Tevesh, be the request of  Shaede, and the approval of Daiunus was to stay with her.  Yet another person that would need the full story, but not before Daiunus was told.   Later, she found  Daiunus, and requested to be heard.   <br>
<br>
At his nod, she closed her eyes and began to speak.   “I am not the simple warrior that I have led all of existence to believe.  I am the daughter of an ambassador.   When an assassination attempt was made on his life, the one that took over my care and education ordered my identity to remain hidden, for our protection.”<br>
<br>
She took a deep breath, opened her eyes and continued.  “Darkrayne.  He was my caretaker after the failed assassination stole my father‘s faculties.   It wasn’t my intent to bring the Harvest into this.  I fear that we have placed you all in danger.  If you wish me to leave for the harvest’s safety, just say the words.”<br>

We are a family, and we look after our own.  We will deal with this as we deal with everything; with Hate and Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
With nothing left to say between the two, Daiunus saluted the warrior of Hate, and walked off to begin preparations.<br>
