III. Hand-To-Hand<br>
IV. Miscellaneous<br>
V. Suggestions<br>
VI. Conclusion<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I. Overview</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We've seen a couple small changes in 1.56 which have done a good deal to improve our melee ability.  It's quite noticable how much of an improvement having the Attack Speed Debuff style work actually is.  I now swing 2-3 times for every single attack of my enemy in PvE.  There are some minor issues that I would like to bring up with the Hand-To-Hand style lines; couple small additions of to-hit bonuses on a couple styles and an addition of low damage to one of them as well.  The Savagery line is looking pretty good, save for the perpetual bug of randomly resisting our own buffs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>II. Savagery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In many views, this should be the 'bread-n-butter' line for the Savage. Without this line, the Savage becomes a dual-wield/parry class, or a Berserker II. There is still concern that the cost-benefit ratio still has not reached an acceptable level. The recent increase in duration and decrease in costs has helped some, but some of the abilities are still not showing much combat performance improvement when compared to performance when not using them at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bugs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Savage Abilities Not Giving Valuable Info</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The Savagery buffs are giving most of the information about the abilities, but they are not giving the most important information:  what they actually do.  The delve information lists duration, cost, etc, but it does not list an effect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Resisting Own Buffs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The Savage still can sometimes resist their own buffs.  This needs to be addressed, as it has been an issue since the inception of the class.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Issues</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>DPS Buff Increase Not Enough, Especially at Lower Levels</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
For instance, the DPS buff. At level 1, the buff increases DPS by 5%. On a level 20, 7.1 dps weapon, this is little more than a .3dps increase. This is barely noticable. Even with the high level version, the 25% DPS increase on a 16.5dps weapon only increases the DPS of the weapon to 20.6. Through the damage formulae, this works out to be roughly equivalent to an 8dps Damage Add. However, the damage provided by the DPS buff is all subject to the melee resistance of the target, which Damage Adds are not. The buff needs to exceed that of other self damage add buffs in the game because of it's much shorter duration and much higher cost.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion: Alter the range of the buffs 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>III. Hand-to-Hand</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The main concern with the style line is that there are no 'anytime' styles that grant to-hit bonuses or have any real damage associated with them.  The line needs at least one style with one or the other, really.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Issues</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Anytime Styles Lacking Damage Production</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There are two useful anytime styles in the HTH line:  Kelgor's Might (PBAE Atk Spd Debuff) and Taunting Call (High Defensive Bonus).  Wild Call is too low level a style to produce quality damage at a later level, and is very bad for the Savage to use with its Medium Penalty to defense.  Kelgor's Claw isn't useful because the Evade enhancement isn't noticable, and is overshadowed by Taunting Call's high defensive bonus.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:<br>
<br>
1. Add a &quot;Low&quot; attack bonus to Taunting Call.<br>
2. Add a &quot;Low&quot; attack bonus and &quot;Low&quot; damage bonus to Kelgor's Claw.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Clan's Might - No To-Hit Bonus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Clan's Might is the followup to Clan's Call; it does the exact same damage as Clan's call, but can hit 2 targets.  However, it actually ends up doing much less damage than Clan's Call because it does not have an attack bonus associated with it.  This style is a second teir style off a positional opener.  It deserves more power than it currently has.  Right now, it's more useful to simply re-use Clan's Call for the same damage and better chance to hit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Add a &quot;Medium&quot; attack bonus to Clan's Might.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Clan's Might - Bleed Style Removed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
When the Hand-To-Hand line was introduced, Clan's Might had a Bleed effect associated with it.  This effect is no longer listed on the Herald, and has never worked.  Where did it go?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Return the Bleed effect to Clan's Might.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>+Evade/+Parry Styles</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We are not noticing that using these styles actually has any effect on our chance to evade/parry.  If the effect is there and functioning, it is not intense enough to be noticable to the eye.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suggestion:  Enhance the +Evade/+Parry styles to increase the chance more.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IV. Miscellaneous Issues / Bugs</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. The Savage retains the small shield ability. However, upon becoming a Savage, the player can no longer equip small shields.  This either needs to be fixed, or the ability needs to be removed from the Savage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>V. Suggestions</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sense Aggression</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - this would be an ability added to the Savagery line. Radius: 350, Duration: 10s, Cost: 25% health/instant, Casting Time: Instant, Effect: Cause Savage to see 'shadowed' form of all stealthers within the radius of effect for the duration of the ability. Midgard needs a class with anti-stealth abilities to counter Albion's and Hibernia's. This ability would help distance the Savage from the Berserker's role in Midgard as well. With the health cost so high, and instant, this spell could not be used to solo hunt assassins, but it would be useful in helping protect a group of friends. Place this at Spec 40 in Savagery.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kelgor's Recovery</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - the biggest problem with soloing a Savage in PvE is the downtime.  Yellow-con mobs will often take the Savage down to 1/4 health, leaving a long rest before fighting again.  Kelgor's Recovery would fix this; it would be a non-combat only ability that would slowly draw points from Endurance and increase the rate of HP regeneration as follows:<br>
<br>
Spec 10: Kelgor's Refreshment - each non-combat tick reduces End 1% and replaces 2% HP.<br>
Spec 20: Kelgor's Aid - each non-combat tick reduces End 4% and replaces 7% HP.<br>
Spec 30: Kelgor's Revitalization - each non-combat tick reduces End 8% and replaces 13% HP.<br>
Spec 40: Kelgor's Recovery - each non-combat tick reduces End 12% and replaces 20% HP.<br>
<br>
(Do not replace Kelgor's Boon with this ability, though.  Kelgor's Boon shoulds stay.)<br>
<br>

<br>
I think a recasting timer is in order for sense agression though. Sure it would be neat to have, but from an objective balance point of view it is very overpowering. If this were to be introduced a recast timer of atleast 10 minutes should be in order, possibly more. Also due to the extreme altering of game style, the cost should be more closer to 50%. This ability just seems like a major boon to the entire realm of midgard, and hence should have some pretty heafty penalties. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Do not replace Kelgor's Boon with this ability, though. Kelgor's Boon shoulds stay.)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Small typo in this line. Remove the s from shoulds. <br>
<br>
I really like the Kelgors Refreshment line. Would give Savages a way to use their buffs in solo combat, because like you said, as it stands now the cost to benefit ratio is not up to par. <br>
<br>
Some balancing might have to be done so alternating between the buyback end skill and this one could not be used to artificially increase the effectivness of your proposed ability.<br>

I do not know the % though because a debuff icon does not show up in the top of the screen to my much dismay. So that means you will most likely have to do it twice in a fight. <br>
<br>
The +/- are actually quite helpful if you know your resists. <br>
<br>
I know that studded takes extra from slash, so if I see +dmg I throw up slash. If I see a high -dmg I throw up thrust (studded is resitant) and if I see a low -dmg I throw up crush because I know I've got some crush resists from my SC armor. <br>
<br>
Its definatly not a point and click deal. Gotta think just a tad. Also common sense can factor in as well as experience. Say your fighting a wolf, its pretty obvious that wolf is not going to use crush. Or say you've fought alot of rock type golem creatures and in the past they were crush...most likely they are going to be crush even if they are a different named mob.<br>
<br>
Those factors combined can actually give you all the information you need, and of course if your unsure and the @#%$ is hiting the fan... just use em all!<br>

Since our haste (and the valewalker haste) is approximately *twice* as effective at a given spec level, is Savagery haste overkill?  That is, with capped quickness (300), what amount of haste is useful?  Based on the FAQ, here are my calculations:<br>
<br>
Capped quickness = 300.  (300 - 60) / 6 = 40  That is, approximately a 40% haste effect from quickness.<br>
<br>
Based on a 3.5 weapon speed:<br>
<br>
3.5dps * (100% - 40%) = 2.1dps<br>
<br>
To figure for maximum useful haste:<br>
<br>
1.5dps / 2.1dps = 0.714<br>

So if you have capped quickness, only a 28% haste effect is useful.  But, of course, our haste goes up to 39%.  I suppose this means that we can forgo a good portion of quickness buffing, or that we'll still be in good shape after we're debuffed or our buffs fail.  But, you want quickness anyway since it also apparently effects evading, and I'm not entirely comfortable with &quot;you can buff yourself way higher than your cap so that later on you can still be okay.&quot;  Especially since we're paying for our buffs in blood.<br>
<br>
This could mean that the haste buff is actually less useful than it seems at the highest levels. <p>Harana Nyao - Guinevere - Valkyn Savage<br>
