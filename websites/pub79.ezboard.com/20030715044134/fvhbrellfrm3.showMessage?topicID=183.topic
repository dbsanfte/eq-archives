She was clad only in protective symbols, painted upon her body with woad, and a heavy chain around her neck which bore her sacred symbol of Innoruuk and her betrothal ring from Daiunus.<br>
     Outside, in the commonlands, it was inordinately quiet.  An already moonless night was further obscured by a steady, cold drizzle.  And inside the abandoned plague hut that Payle had called her home for more than six winters now, the pallid, painted woman had slipped into an almost trancelike introspection while waiting for her kettle of water to boil.<br>
     The last few weeks had not been easy, the last few days... harder still, and the future?  Payle winced, in anticipation.  The only thing certain about the future was that it would be the most difficult journey of her life.  <br>
     She had somehow known in her soul since the night of the last Harvest gathering, that she would end up here tonight.  She had felt the greatest oppresion of her life that night, standing by the Dragon of Hate, and before her consort, as he took his oath of Dread Lord.  She still did not fully comprehend exactly what had happened, but of all the energies that began to pull on her at that moment, the most pressing she felt was from the Prince of Hate himself.  Certainly, something was terribly wrong, and maybe it always had been.<br>
     So she had done the only thing she could do to protect those whose lives she valued far more than her own.  She had fled again, this time into herself.  <br>
     &quot;And into this wretched little cottage,&quot; she thought bitterly, pulling her attention back to her physical surroundings.  The kettle, unnoticed for a while, had come to a full boil.<br>
     Payle stood and stretched her aching body.  It felt somehow lighter to her, longer.  She was slightly startled as she noted the sight of her own ribs and hip bones protruding.  Her body had never looked like this before, but then again, she could not recall the last time she had actually eaten something either.<br>
     She pulled her hair into a severe twist at the back of her neck and stood with her back to the fire.  She breathed deeply, trying to ground and prepare herself for what this night would bring.<br>
     The heavy hide flap that normally served as a door, was tonight reinforced by a summoned guardian spirit.  Even though this was all the protection she really needed, she almost wished now that she had taken the time at some point to do repairs on the place.  She had simply never planned on being here this long.  It was only to have been a place to lay her head, until she and Daiunus were wed, and they set up a household somewhere together.<br>
     She smiled, remembering Daiunus' last words about the whole matter.  She had had to postpone the wedding again.<br>
     &quot;You live here because you think it your penance, Payle&quot;, he had said most matter-of-factly, as if he had always known this, and just had never voiced it.  She had smiled then also, from pure amazement.  He knew her well, after all.<br>
     Payle solemnly carrried the kettle to her altar, from which rose a glorious velium staue of Innoruuk.  Crowded all around this was every manner of religious and tribal item, and personal and sacred relic that she would require on her spiritual journey tonight; bits of feather, flesh and bone from various conquered foes, rocks and gems from visited lands, even a chunk of ice from her maternal exile in Velious, magically preserved.<br>
    She sat cross-legged before the altar, and filled a tall earthenware chalice with the water.  To this, she bagan to add the herbs, one at a time, that would make the Potion of Far Sight; mugwort for the vision, cinnamon for clarity, myrtle leaves for protection, agrimony for the constitution to survive it.  <br>
     Her face twisted into a hateful scowl as the acrid smell from the tea filled the room, and she was reminded of her first encounter with this powerful brew.  The sullen twelve year-old had been sickened by this same bitter stench when the tribal Wise Woman had prepared it for herself.  Payle had been sent to her for her obligatory divination, part of her coming of age rite.  However, the drink had served its purpose, and that night had set her on her path to Innoruuk and the Violent Harvest.  Too bad the visions had proved too much for the old hag.  She was found on the open tundra a few days after, incoherent and feverish, jabbering about fantastical things.<br>
     Payle's hand shook ever so slightly as she stirred the seeping concoction.  She had never made this particular journey herself, not out of fear or distase, but because there had never really been a need.  She had before, unerringly, heeded the Mad Prophet's visions and counsel.  However, Nospiratus had entered seclusion, and she would not trouble him now.  Besides, the insight she needed now could only be gained for and by herself.  <br>
     She set the chalice upon the altar to cool and began to pray to Innoruuk.<br>
     &quot;Lord of Hate...&quot;, she intoned, &quot;Accept this offering of blood and forgive me my failures.&quot;<br>
     The candlelight flashed briefly on the sacrificial blade as it bit deeply into the pale flesh of her inner forearms.  It cross-cut older scars, some of which were proof of past rituals, some merely the product of yourthful self-loathing.<br>
     Payle let the blood collect in her offering bowl.<br>
     &quot;For weeks, I have felt your disfavor,  I ask on this night, only that I be shown my shortcomings, and the way in which to atone for them.&quot;<br>
     Improvisatorially, she raked her arms down the sides of the statue, smearing it with her blood.  The altar candles blinked wildly, as a cold draft slipped about the small cottage.  She raised the chalice before the statue.<br>
     &quot;I am ready to See myself.&quot;  And with that, she tossed back its entire contents.<br>
     Instantly, her head swam, and the distinct physical lines of the altar, her body, the room began to dissolve.  She slumped forward slightly, and firmly grasped her altar, as the layers of reality melted away, along with fragmentary thoughts and memories.<br>
<br>
     She stood before the Dragon of Hate... alone.  All around her, she could sense spirits.  They seemed to be judging her.  The Dragon began to speak in a loud, commanding voice.  It was the voice of the reaper of the Harvest, Creapiing.<br>
     &quot;Do you swear to serve Innoruuk and the Violent Harvest...&quot;  It was the ceremony of binding.<br>
     &quot;May Innoruuk bind my blood in stone, if I fail,&quot; she heard herself say.<br>
     The Dragon suddenly altered, and became made entirely of stone.  The voice continued.<br>
     &quot;You bind not only yourself, but your family for generations to come... state now the oath.&quot;  The oath spoken to become a Dread Lord... something she would never be.  She looked around again, certain it could not be speaking to her.  But she was the only one standing before this Stone Dragon of Hate.  It was speaking directly to her.  <br>
    &quot;State now the oath.&quot;<br>
     Payle opened her mouth to recite the oath, but no sound came forth.  She struggled.  She tried frantically to make the words come, but they would not.<br>
     She felt very ill.  She was suddenly overwhelmed by all the old feelings of doubt and guilt, and worthlessness.  Standing there, head bowed before the Sacred Dragon and assemblage of judging spirits, she felt it more keenly than at any other time in her life.  How could she ever have expected to spread the Hate of Innoruuk, when she had selfishly guarded it all her life.<br>
     &quot;STATE NOW THE OATH&quot;, the voice of the Reaper/the Stone Dragon bellowed.<br>
     Payle fell to her knees, covering her ears with her hands.  She watched dutifully as it crumbled to dust and rubble before her widened eyes, leaving only a vacuous silence.  Even the spirits had gone.<br>
     She crawled upon the pile of debris, laid her exhausted body across it.  She had never felt more alone in all her life, not even growing up in the North.  After a while, she slept and dreamed.  <br>
<br>
     In the world Payle dreamed of, she was walking through some unfamiliar landscape.  The journey seemed endless, and every step a struggle.  She felt weak, perhaps even sick.  But she knew she had to keep walking.  After many hours, she finally crested an impossibly large hill.  The road forked here, and seemed to lead down into two totally separate worlds, divided by a dense fog.<br>
     She scrutinized the world to her left.  It seemed to glow from its own sanguine light.  There, people, mostly light-born,  scoured the earth like a plague.  They were all shockingly pale.  Everywhere she looked, there were plague markers.  Feeling naseous, she turned to the world to her right.<br>
     It was the world that she came from, and in it, she saw people that she recogized, flourishing as never before.  This world, their world, was bathed in perfect twilight.  And it felt so right, that looking at it made Payle's heart twist inside her chest.  She fell to her knees again, this time in reverence.<br>
     &quot;I choose this world,&quot; she cried out, and clenched her right hand into a tight fist.<br>
     From the formless void that separated the two worlds, there began to coalesce a most aweful image, and with it, a rushing, howling wind.  An enormous, beautiful, Teir Dal female evolved from the chaos, richly dressed in the garb of a  high priestess.  Her image constantly shimmered and swirled, never quite becoming physical.  She stood with one foot upon each world.  In her left hand, she carried a deadly looking scythe, marked with runes of dull light.  In her right hand, she wielded a long, slender whip, which was barbed at the end by some strange metal.<br>
     Payle bowed her head so low before the irradiant visage of the priestess, that her lips touched the ground.<br>
     &quot;You have chosen well...&quot;, said the priestess, her voice seeming to roll in and out, much like her image. <br>
     &quot;I am the spirit of Divine Wrath, and I bring a message from our Lord.  Your actions have been judged as displeasing to Innoruuk, and He demands punishment, sacrifice and atonement for your deeds.   Know ye, your sin?&quot;<br>
     Payle, awestruck, nodded.  She understood all too clearly now.  It was her own lack of belief in herself and self-absorption  that had put her here.  She had gone too long without facing her own fears, her destiny, and it had kept her from doing Innoruuk's will, from assuming her true place within the Harvest, and in her life.  She had failed them all, and worse now, she had ired Innoruuk.  She would find a way to overcome all this, to correct it.  She simply had to.<br>
     &quot;I understand my transgressions,&quot; she was surprised by the strength of her own voice. &quot;I am utterly repentent.  I ask for the chance to atone.&quot;<br>
     The spirit priestess smiled, intimately, approvingly.  <br>
     &quot;Then accept now, this... the Scourge of Innoruuk,&quot;  she said and she drew back her iniquitous looking whip.<br>
     Payle tensed her body, as she realized what was to come.  A razor thin slice of pure magic cut what felt like an inch deep strip into her back.  She felt her mana and magical powers sucked away with it, depleted.  She gagged, gasping for air.  <br>
     Whir-ack.  It slashed her again.  She felt like she was being voided, like her very soul was being stripped from her with every lash.<br>
     Once more, the terrible instrument buried itself in her flesh and spirit.  Her ears were ringing, and her soul felt very far off from her body.  Both had become dynamic, living pain.  Behind the roar in her ears, she became aware that the being  was speaking.<br>
     &quot;Innoruuk will withold His favor until such time as your atonement is satisfactory.  Until then, you will meet your tribulations with a fraction of His former grace.&quot;<br>
     Payle struggled to her knees on ground slippery from her own blood. <br>
     &quot;I... I... wish to offer a sacrifice.&quot; Her voice sounded miles away to her.<br>
     &quot;Seek out your Winnower, and offer your sacrifice to the Violent Harvest.  Only then, may you atone.  Fail? And you will be removed.  But, succeed well, and be restored to Innoruuk in such a way, as you have never experienced, and you will find your true place within the Harvest.&quot;<br>
     And then her image dispersed into light and smoke, pulling with her and into her, layers of reality until Payle found herself once again in her dilapidated shack, face down in very real blood.  Her head throbbed.  She felt hollow and weak.  Her back had become an entity of pain unto itself.<br>
     Slowly she struggled to stand, pulling a blanket around her.  It was near to dawn.  She would need to speak to the Winnower immediately.  She felt her heart shrink inside her, realizing that she would have to speak to Dainunus, as well.  She did not know how she would tell him that she could not become his wife, not now, maybe not for a while, and perhaps not ever.  She would not ask him to wait any longer.  <br>
     The road ahead would be very difficult, and unfortunately for now, she must walk it alone.<br>
