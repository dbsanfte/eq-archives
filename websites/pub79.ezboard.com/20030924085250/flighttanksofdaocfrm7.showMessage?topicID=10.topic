<br>
Mercenaries have received some welcome improvements in the past few months, but they are still the least most popular tank in Albion by a large margin. New Fighter players that ask for help are immediatly warned against playing a Mercenary. Why? Read on to find out.<br>
<br>
Recent Changes:<br>
<br>
DW Boost for high levels - Although we aren't sure what exactly was changed, our best guess based on parsed logs is that the formula for doing a double-hit was changed to 25% DWspec*0.5% CharLevel*0.25%. Even if this is not the actual formula, it is clear that is was a boost, and at high levels a noticable one. Our damage output before styles is now on par with large weapon users.<br>
<br>
Dirty Tricks - This unique skill is not what most of us were hoping for, although it does have potential. However, there are currently some problems with it that make it a dissapointment to many:<br>
<br>
1) It can only be used every 30 minutes - long enough to make it so you feel you have to save it for an emergency, and thus will probably never use it at all.<br>
<br>
2) It's resistable, meaning after waiting all that time, it might not even work.<br>
<br>
3) Its effects on orange or higher enemies (Most people fight orange or higher enemies in groups!) is so minimal (when it isn't resisted) that we can't see any difference anyway.<br>
<br>
4) We have no styles that react off of an enemy Fumbling anyway (even though some other poor classes do, yet they can't make an enemy fumble like we can now...ironic, isn't it?).<br>
<br>
5) It lacks &quot;coolness&quot; factor - it doesn't have any cool visual effects, it doesn't even use proper text (&quot;You cast an increased fumbles spell!&quot;??), and some people are even insulted at being called dirt-throwers.<br>
<br>
We appreciate getting a unique ability, but the one we got is hardly worth the effort of putting in your hotkey bar unless you solo Yellows a lot or fight a lot of prearranged one-on-one RVR duels. Please consider changing this ability or adding additional &quot;Dirty Tricks&quot; to go along with the one we have (on seperate timers!!).<br>
<br>
Bugs:<br>
<br>
Missing Engage skill - Many Mercenaries that trained past 7 in shields to get Engage never actually got it (which is a shame, since it's the only good reason for a Mercenary to put points in shields at all...). Even with the fixes a while back, these Mercenaries are still missing Engage.<br>
<br>
Major Issues:<br>
<br>
Still being outdamaged despite boosts - Despite the recent boosts to Dual Wield, we are still being outdamaged by 2-handed weapon users in the field. Why is this? To put it simply, because the DW style list really sucks in many ways. 1) Dual Wield and Celtic Dual styles have the weakest bonus damage of any style list in the game. This includes &quot;base&quot; style lists like Slashing, 2) the DW style list is much less effective than the Polearm, 2-handed weapon, and Left Axe style lists because it is the only style list in the game that has no no-opening style chains, 3) the bonus damage from our styles is further limited because it is only applied to the right hand weapon and not the left hand weapon. 2-handers get bonus damage dependant on their total damage that hit, but we often get bonus damage dependant on only half our total damage that hit (1 weapon out of 2 used). More details below.<br>
<br>
Dual Wield style damage way too low - DW styles are much weaker than any other styles, including Slashing, Polearms, 2-handed, Large Weapons, Left Axe, Blades, and more, in that they do less bonus damage per use than any of these others. In fact, Dual Wield styles do an average of 1/3rd or less bonus damage than equivalent Left Axe styles! Slashing Mercenaries NEVER use DW styles because the Slashing styles are just better damage. This does not make any sense, if we are pulling off styles where we are stabbing people with two weapons, we should be doing more bonus damage than a slashing style! Even our 50th level style, a positional style, does LESS damage than the no-opening Slashing style Amethyst Slash, despite the fact that your style lists list Amethyst as a lower damage! Solution: Simple - give a big boost to the damage output of Dual Wield (and Celtic Dual) styles, such that they are up there with 2-handed, Large weapons and Left Axe, instead of inferior to basic style lists like Slashing.<br>
<br>
Dual Wield style list missing no-opening style chain - Polearms and 2-handed weapons get several no-opening style chains to do great damage at any time. Left Axe gets an awesome 3-style no-opening style chain. Dual Wield is the only style list in the game that doesn't have any no-opening style chains - even Celtic Dual has one. This means after the first hit, these other characters can maintain higher damage output because even if none of the special openings come up, they can keep using their no-opening style chain. Solution: Make the Dual Wield style Eclipse (spec 12) to be a no opening style. Then change Dark Tendrils (spec 34) to chain off of the new Eclipse. These two styles are never used by Mercenaries anyway - the first is a chain off of Shadow's Edge, but we already get another style that chains off of Shadow's Edge that's actually better. The second is a reactionary style off of Evade that doesn't chain into anything - but we already get a 2-style chain off of Evade and one off of Parry, so we don't need (or use) that one either. Transforming these unused styles into a 2-style no-opening chain would fill this severe gap in our style list and allow us to have a decent style chain to use in RVR or soloing.<br>
<br>
Dual Wield style damage needs to apply to both weapons - A Dual Wield style only gives it's bonus damage based on the right hand weapon, and it always forces you to use that weapon. This means we are essentially getting a style bonus penalty compared to 2-handed users. The style bonus damage should be applied to BOTH weapons if we happen to Dual Wield during that style - otherwise, we are only really getting half of our bonus damage. The is another reason 2-handed users outdamage us - every time they do a style, they get bonus damage dependant on their total damage for that hit, but every time we do a style, we only get bonus damage dependant on half of our total damage - i.e. one weapon out of our two that hit. Solution: Apply the bonus damage from the style to both weapons if it's a double-hit, or further increase the styles bonus damage to compensate for this problem.<br>
<br>
Shortbows can't be trained - Armsmen can put spec points into Crossbows to increase their accuracy and base damage. We can't train in Shortbows. This makes no sense, since we do get Shortbows earlier, it seems we would be trained in how to use them - yet once again, we are outclassed by Armsmen .<br>
<br>
No role in RVR - We want to fit a role in RVR. We are tired of just being light tanks without any of the assumed benefits of the definition. We want to be light infantry, shock troops, to run in quickly, harass the enemy and soften them up, cause some chaos, and be followed up by the main force of our army (heavy tanks and casters). We also want to be feared by archers and casters because of our increased ability to close in on them and take them down. But right now, this isn't possible.<br>
<br>
The problem, however, is not easily solved. The obvious solution would be increased mobility, but that would give other benefits that could throw PVE balance out of whack - such as increased ability to escape from a bad fight, lower travel times, etc. This is not something Mythic is willing to give us.<br>
<br>
We have devised a solution that should give us the role in RVR we desire without unbalancing us in any other aspects. Please give this idea your serious consideration for inclusion into the Mercenary class as well as blademasters and Bezerkers.<br>
<br>
Ability: Charge<br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
- You must have a target.<br>
- The target must be an enemy.<br>
- The target must be in your current cone of view and visible to you.<br>
- The target must be within a certain distance of you.<br>
<br>
- You press the Charge button.<br>
<br>
- You immediatly lose a chunk of endurance<br>
- Your character runs at high speed (at least as fast as the Hunter's speed boost ability) directly toward the target.<br>
- Your character cannot be steered by you, and cannot be stopped by you.<br>
- If your target dies before you get to them or get out of range or you charge for too long then you stop automatically.<br>
- Once your character reaches your target, the charge is over and you auto-attack your target (kind of like when you use a Style and it turns auto-attack on for you).<br>
- You must now wait for a timer before you can Charge again.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this ability would not decrease travel times, nor would it allow you to escape a bad fight (since you have to attack an enemy to use it, which would just make the situation worse). What it would do is allow us to charge into the battle quickly in an effort to take out weaker characters and act as shock troops. Optional things you could do is to give a higher Charge at a later level - perhaps one that also grants resistance to mez/stun or allows dodging of arrows while charging to make it easier to get close to casters and archers. But that's just fluff, the main thing we want is what is described above.<br>
<br>
Minor Issues:<br>
<br>
Using Shields in RVR - Since a shield and our secondary weapon both go into the same slot, it is very difficult to quickly switch to a shield for purposes of blocking arrows/spells in RVR. Please consider allowing our secondary weapon or shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield weapon combo.<br>
<br>
Prey escapes too easily - Once we actually do get close enough to attack an archer or caster in RVR, they usually just run away and there's nothing we can do about it. Can we please get a no-opening Dual Wield style that has a Snare affect to counter this? Or implement Charge as described above and we can use that.<br>
<br>
Balance:<br>
<br>
Although it seems Mercenaries are balanced in which mobs they can kill, they do break a fundamental balance rule - the fact that Armsmen are superior to them in every way - defense, offense, long range attacks, and mobility, the Armsmen is as good or better in every category. This fact alone makes the Mercenary a pointless class for all but the hardcore roleplayer who cares nothing for balance, the desperately hopeful that the class will get fixed later, or the player who loves to play a class just because no one else does. If our really crappy style list was fixed and we got some more unique things like Charge, this would no longer be the case...<br>
<br>
Questions:<br>
<br>
Dual Wield chance affected by enemy level? - Does the level of the mob you are fighting affect your chance to do a double-hit? If so, this could be the factor that's messing up the math - I don't think mob level affects the 15% bonus damage that 2-handed users get, or the damage bonus from using Left Axe, but if it affects the chance to double-hit with Dual Wield then that would explain a lot of the damage output complaints I am getting and the reason our percentages in tests are very often lower than what they are supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Quick Breakdown<br>
<br>
Here is a summary of the most important points in this report:<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Please take a closer look at our special ability Dirty Tricks, and consider replacing it or fixing the problems with it as listed above.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Dual Wield styles do very little damage compared to other style lists, even base style lists like Slashing. Please bump up our style damages to be more inline with large weapon users.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Make the Dual Wield style Eclipse (spec 12) to be a no opening style. Then change Dark Tendrils (spec 34) to chain off of the new Eclipse. This will give us a no-opening 2-style chain, something which Dual Wield currently does not have and desperately needs, unlike every other style list.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; When we do a double-hit while using a style, have the bonus damage from the style applied to BOTH weapons, otherwise we are getting only half the bonus damage out of our styles than 2-handed users are. If this can't be done, further increase our style damage to make up for this problem.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Give Merc's, BM's, and Zerker's the Charge ability as outlined above, with the restritions outlined to prevent it from giving any mobility advantages other than charging toward an enemy.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Allow us to train in Shortbows like Armsmen can train in Crossbows.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; Allow shields to be put in the 2-handed slot so that we can hotkey a switch between two weapons and a shield/weapon combo for RVR purposes. Besides, a Merc wearing a shield on his back would look pretty cool.<br>
<br>
&lt;*&gt; If the chance to do a double-hit while using Dual Wield is affected by the enemy's level, please remove this factor. It is unfair considering that the 15% 2-handed bonus and the Left Axe bonus damage are unaffected in this way (other then the normal damage reduction from a high level mob that we all have to deal with). This could be the reason that DW/CD still seems to do less damage then expected.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
Currently Mercenaries are a gimmick class overshadowed in every way by Armsmen, due to a vastly inferior style list that prevents them from doing as much damage; worse armor, less hitpoints, and the weakest Evade in the game making them have lower defensive ability; worse long range attack because they cannot place spec points in their bow ability like Armsmen can; and they do not even have the advantage of mobility that the class description indicates they should have - an Armsmen is just as agile and mobile as a Mercenary is.<br>
<br>
As long as this remains true, Mercenaries are an unfinished class. Since our class is fairly simple, fix the issues I've listed in my quick breakdown and you'll be pretty much done with the class - and it shouldn't even take long to do it. We don't have a lot of complicated spells, etc. to deal with, all we want is what makes sense for us to have - higher damage output and mobility to make up for lower hit points and defense, an equal ability to Armsmen in long range attacks, and something unique (and USEFUL) to make people say &quot;oooh, neat, I wanna be a Merc!&quot; when they see it.<br>

I would also like to add that the Mercenary community is very thankful for the new drops found in recent additions that give us items we lacked before. We now have discovered melee-oriented chain drops, some even with Mercenary-specific bonuses on them. Thanks guys! <p>Angabliss - Cieix - Angha - Blademaster Team Lead<BR>
