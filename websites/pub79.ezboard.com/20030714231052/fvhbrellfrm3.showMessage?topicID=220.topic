<br>
<br>
Sabratha ran all the way from the commonlands to Neriak as fast as her little legs would carry her.  The Pale Man Rohwin had really upset her, and she wasn't even sure why.  He had been pressing her for answers concerning her parentage.  NO one had ever asked her outright about these things and well... she was just tired.  The Dreaming had been particularly intense last night.  The One who ran the castle had been in it, but this time it was she he was torturing and not Daiunus.  This was the first time she had dreamed she was in actual contact with the inhabitants of the castle, and she had not felt well all day, as a result.  <br>
Rohwin had upset her so much, she had lost control of her magical energies, and that had not happened for a very long time.  She had to find her mother.<br>
Sabratha tore into the flat calling for her, but she wasn't home.  She raced on to the Grange, out of breath, still dangerously fluctuating with wild magical energy.  <br>
She had not been to the Grange in a while, and very few people were there now, mostly servants.  There was a sickly sweet odor lingering here... it smelled like the castle... it smelled overwhelmingly of blood.<br>
Those congregated in the main hall stared wildly at her, fearfully even.<br>
&quot;Where is my mother?&quot;  The child glanced anxiously about for someone to help her.  Something was happening to her, something she did not understand.  Her hair blew about, fueled by the still unsettled magics in her.<br>
No one answered, perhaps no one knew.<br>
&quot;WHERE is my mother?  Where is Payle?&quot;  She was practically screaming now.  A lesser child would have wept, but Sabratha had never given in to tears.<br>
From a side room, the young enchantress Kehle entered, perhaps drawn by the commotion.  Only a few years older than Sabratha, she approached to try and calm the child.  She stopped short when she realized, how dangerously out of control the child was at them moment.<br>
&quot;Calm down, little one... your mother is not here.  She is away on a task for now.  Perhaps, I can help you.&quot;  She smiled, hoping to comfort the young one.<br>
Sabratha shook with frustration and confusion.<br>
&quot;She is ALWAYS away,&quot; she screamed at anyone unlucky enough to still be in the room.  And with that, she turned and fled the Grange, leaving a trail of fiery sparks in her wake.<br>
The young one Kehle remained calm.  &quot;Someone had better go fetch Payle&quot;, she said and indicated to one of the servants.<br>
<br>
Sabratha kept running through Third Gate until she came to the underground river.  Finally having spent her emotional havoc, she dropped herself onto a large rock by the water.  This was her favorite secret spot.  The rock walls formed a small grotto, and she liked to sit here and watch the fish swim.  <br>
A terrible feeling of reckoning overwhelmed the tiny, confused child right before she noticed a large, organic object lodged on the rocks, its long white, soggy locks still submerged.<br>
Zombie-like, she moved to fetch it out of the water, pulling it up by its hair.  She turned the head over to face her.  Shock would have caused her to drop it, were it not for the fact that she was strangely compelled to hang onto it.<br>
Sabratha stared into the inanimate eyes of the One who ran the castle.  A unexpected sense of calm enveloped her; all traces of her former confusion fled.  Knowing her mother would not approve of her new trophy, she carefully concealed it by rolling it in her satin cloak, and began to make her way back home.<br>

<br>
<br>
Payle had been in the Forest when she felt the vengeful blood red orb ascend past the horizon.  She froze for a few moments, confused.  She quickly counted days in her mind... it couldn't be.  But yet somehow, it was.  It seemed that with all the tribulations within her family as of late, she had lost track of the days, weeks even.  And it was with a very sick heart that she realized the moon that the people to whom she had been born called the Blood Moon, was making its annual ascent into the evening sky.  <br>
But something far more dreadful than the usual emotions she felt on this night were gripping her now.  She was assaulted by a very real terror, and somehow instinctively she knew her daughter Sabratha was in terrible danger.  She did not even take the time to gather her herb hunting supplies.  She called on the spirit of the dark wolf, the wolf as hunter, to aid her, and fled toward the city at the fastest speed possible.  <br>
She bounded the steps up to their flat two at a time, calling for Sabratha.  She found her child lying upon her bed, fully clothed, her eyes open wide and staring at the ceiling.  The room was unbearably warm.  Payle drew near to her.  The heat seemed to be emanating from her.  She touched her hand to Sabratha's forehead, and it practically burned her.  <br>
&quot;Sabratha, you are ill... what has happened to you?&quot;  Payle tried to remain calm.<br>
&quot;Mother?&quot;  Sabratha's voice was barely a whisper.  Her eyes remained focused on the ceiling.  &quot;What's wrong with me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Nothing Sab,&quot; she tried to make her voice sound believable.  She knew in her heart that the time had come, and what terrible timing it was.  &quot;Just tell me what you can.&quot;<br>
&quot;I... I was in the commonlands.  That man Rohwin...&quot;  Sabratha's voice trailed off, a renewed surge of heat poured from her tiny body.  <br>
Payle bit back the swell of anger that threatened to overtake her senses.  &quot;Rohwin?  What of him?&quot;<br>
She listened through clenched teeth as Sabratha explained the exchange the two had had earlier in the day, and how she had lost control of her magical energy destroying a stray kitten unlucky enough to chance near her.  The terrible heat of the room fluctuated with her emotions, as she spoke.  <br>
&quot;What then, Sab?&quot;  <br>
&quot;I... I don't remember exactly... I ended up here.&quot;  A spike of heat nearly sent Payle from the room.  <br>
&quot;Make me some tea please Mother, with Feverfew.&quot;<br>
Payle blinked slowly.  &quot;Of course, Sab.&quot;<br>
She felt a terrible pang of guilt, realizing her daughter had been learning the art of herb lore and it had not come from her.  Gambel had been teaching her, she supposed.<br>
Payle went to make the tea, feeling as helpless as a mother ever had.  Moreso, perhaps, because she could feel the restless spirits around them, throughout the city, and she wasn't sure she had the power to protect those dear to her.  She could feel that awful moon out there, waiting for its chance.  Tonight, it was coming for Sabratha, but it would have a terrible fight for that prize.<br>
Payle helped Sabratha sip some of the tea.  She had added some Valerian to help her sleep.  Then she bagan to pray intensely to Innoruuk.  She called forth every ward and protection on them and thier flat that she knew, and summoned every guardian spirit that she could control.  By the time Sabratha was slipping into a restless slumber, their flat was as fortified as any castle.  <br>
<br>
That was when the screams began to reverberate throughout the city.<br>

She dreamed instead that she lay before the Dragon of Hate, staring up into its wizened eyes.  She wore only a simple white gown, and seemed unable to move anything but her eyes.  The smell of blood was thick upon the air, and the screams of people suffering echoed from every corner of the city.  Yet she was calm, and not frightened, for she felt a power far greater than that which assaulted the city, surrounding her.  Its source, channeled through the Dragon, and enclosing her in a secure bubble of protection.  <br>
Sabratha lay sleeping, dreaming, wrapped in the arms of Innoruuk, as the Plague of Blood descended upon the streets of Neriak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=220.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=220.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=220.topic&index=2><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.threadControl?topicID=220.topic><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/harvest/skull.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=220.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vhbrellfrm1">The Dungeon<option value="vhbrellfrm2">Seeds of Innoruuk<option value="vhbrellfrm3">Chronicles<option value="vhbrellfrm4">The Inner Sanctum<option value="vhbrellfrm5">The Voting Booth<option value="vhbrellfrm6">The War Room<option value="vhbrellfrm7">Whispers and Shadows<option value="vhbrellfrm8">Merchants' Corner<option value="vhbrellfrm9">Tribunal Chambers<option value="vhbrellfrm10">The Archives<option value="vhbrellfrm11">Central Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm12">Eastern Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm13">Western Dread Domain<option value="vhbrellfrm14">The Catacombs<option value="vhbrellfrm15">The Kunark Territories<option value="vhbrellfrm16">Pillage and Plunder<option value="vhbrellfrm17">Tomes of the Grange<option value="vhbrellfrm18">Pursuits of Hate<option value="vhbrellfrm19">Hate's Culling Guild</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell>VH Brell</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3>Chronicles</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.violentharvest.com">Violent Harvest Grange</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
