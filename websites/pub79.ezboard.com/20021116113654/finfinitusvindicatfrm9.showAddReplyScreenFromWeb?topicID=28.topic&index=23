I haven't said ANYTHING about monetary cost or savings - that is Dandy's arguement.  <br>
<br>
My arguement is that if society has the right to deprive people of freedom for committing crimes (a fact I doubt ANYONE would dispute), then they have the right to deprive people of their lives if the crime warrants it.  It is both a deterrent and a punishment system.  (before you try and argue it doesn't deter, let me just point out that I can 100% guarentee that someone that is executed will not repeat their crime).<br>
<br>
Note that Del made an error - the defendant doesn't have to prove beyond a doubt his innocence - he just has to cast doubt on the proof of his guilt.  The burden of proof lies with the prosecution, ALWAYS. <p></br>

<br>
1) It does not deter others from commiting the same crime.  If you kill the &quot;criminal&quot; or put them in jail for life... has the same effect.  They are not able to harm anyone else.<br>
The difference being that if the judicial system made a mistake... the one locked away can be released.. but the one put to death...?<br>
<br>
2)  While on paper  &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; in reality we both know that its just a matter of perception.  That factors like race, gender, class, financial status and many others factors beyond those directly related tot he offense end up taking precedence at times.<br>
<br>
<br>
Explain to me how 4 white cops empty their guns into an innocent men for a total of 41 shots... and still go free?<br>
<br>
As for the DNA test.. guess what.. those in favor of the death penalty are the ones against DNA testing...<br>
<br>
More than one prosecutor is opposed to having their cases examined using DNA evience.. if you want.. i can post a few examples...  BUT if i do.. you will have to post examples of where defendants didn't want dna tests.<br>
<br>
So if it doesn't matter if an innocent person is put to death.. why bother with trial and other fanfare? why not execute everyone that gets arrested and safe the money of the trial?<br>
<br>
How would you feel being in jail and being innocent?<br>

<br>
Yes, but you are confusing arguements.  Try separating them out some, and answering them separately.<br>
<br>
1.  I said capital punishment acts as a deterrent, in 2 ways: first, someone executed will NOT be a repeat offender, and second, it WILL make people think twice about the consequences of their actions.  Note that the second isn't all inclusive, and its nature makes it impossible to prove, other than as a basic principle of negative reinforcement.  If you want to argue the second isn't true, realize that you are also arguing that knowing you would be punished never prevents people from doing things - which I KNOW to be false, because I know that the only reason I haven't already killed a few people is because I don't want to be imprisoned, and they never passed the threshhold of being worth taking the risk and effort of disposing of the bodies.<br>
<br>
2.  People are biased, yes.  But it takes 12 people to agree, beyond any reasonable doubt, in someones guilt.  Perfect?  Not all all.  You have something better in mind?<br>
<br>
&quot;Explain to me how 4 white cops empty their guns into an innocent men for a total of 41 shots... and still go free?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know the situation you're referring to at all.  Without specifics, I'll treat it as a hypothetical.  A guy is on drugs, causing a disturbance.  Police are called, he gets violent.  He pulls a weapon (say, a large knife).  They shoot him, he keeps coming.  They shoot again, he keeps coming, and is very close now.  You're damn straight they would all unload on him.  I'd prolly drop several magazines in the guy myself.  There are some drugs that give people adrenaline and lack of feeling - they really don't stop until they are put down, and hard.  As for innocent?  If that were so, there would be publicity and riots . . . you're not giving the full story, if you say this really happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for the DNA test.. guess what.. those in favor of the death penalty are the ones against DNA testing...&quot;<br>
<br>
There you go, making gross (and false) generalizations.  I'm in favor of both.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As for the DNA test.. guess what.. those in favor of the death penalty are the ones against DNA testing...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More than one prosecutor is opposed to having their cases examined using DNA evience . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
So, someone that is making an arguement wants to ignore evidence for the arguement of the other side?  DUH.  Thats always true of any arguement, debate, trial.  Defense attorneys get all sorts of evidence thrown out all the time.  Thats why we have an objective party (aka a judge) decide what is permissible - just like debates have moderators.<br>
<br>
&quot;So if it doesn't matter if an innocent person is put to death.. why bother with trial and other fanfare? why not execute everyone that gets arrested and safe the money of the trial?&quot;<br>
<br>
Who here said it doesn't matter?  Who said we should kill them before a trial?  Don't put words in peoples mouths, and then attack things they didn't say; it doesn't help your position at all.<br>
<br>
Since you brought a specific up, so will I: Charlie Manson.  NO ONE would question his guilt, or the extent of his crimes . . . so why not execute him?<br>

<br>
1) Who would be deterred by death penalty.. but not by life sentence? Want to detter people... make them realize they won't get away with it. The actual punishement won't detter them.  The getting caught will.<br>
<br>
2) It's not the 12 jury I have a problem with.. it's the peple who present the evidence to those 12 that i have issues with.<br>
District attorneys who hold back exculpatory evidence.  Police officers who taint crime scenes to get &quot;stronger&quot; cases. And btw... do you really need me to show you cases in which the jury was biased and innocent people went to jail? Less likely.. but still very possible even in our times.<br>
<br>
4 white cops in NYC shot an african immigrant 41 times.. hitting him 19 times.. and then claimed they did it cause they were afraid for their lives...  The guy was unarmed.. and if you bother to go to the link will see he was no where enar being a physical threat to anyone.<br>

3) As to the DNA testing thing... was not referting to you was referign to how the District attorneys who advocate the death penalty are against DNA testing in all cases.<br>

4)  Mork.. i'm a little confused here...<br>
<br>
&quot;So, someone that is making an arguement wants to ignore evidence for the arguement of the other side? DUH. Thats always true of any arguement, debate, trial. Defense attorneys get all sorts of evidence thrown out all the time. Thats why we have an objective party (aka a judge) decide what is permissible - just like debates have moderators.&quot;<br>
<br>
What exactly is the job f the District attorneys?<br>
To convict someone no matter they be innocent or not?<br>
Or to actually find out the guilty person?  Explain how a district attorney not doing DNA testing helps them find the guilty person? The only reason they would not want DNA testing done.. is if they knew that person was innocent and didn't want the case being thrown out.  BTW.. show me the first case in which legally obtained DNA evidence was thrown out.<br>
<br>

<br>
I didn't bring this guy up.  But lets talk about him since you brought it up. <br>
<br>
a) Do you think he would have not done what he did if he thought he would get death penalty?<br>
oh... wait.. he was crazy... that woudn't have stopped him anyway... He was crazy and thought he would never get caught.<br>
<br>
b) He has been in jail for how long? Has he hurt anyone else? Has he been dettered while in jail?<br>
yes.. and at same time.. pretty sure that psychologist and other social scientist have been learning about human mental diseases from him while he has been in jail.  And trying to look at it in a possibve way.. he has generated how many jobs while in jail?<br>
<br>
c) what would society have gotten from executing him?<br>
Nothing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am all for the death penalty even though there may be some innocent people that may be killed. &quot; - Delara<br>
<br>
Which is why I said the why not execute people without a trial and save the money.<br>
<br>
Want actual cases?  here...<br>
<br>
Clifford Henry Bowen - Convicted 1981 - Released 1986 - Charges dropped 1987<br>
<br>
Bowen was incarcerated in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary under three death sentences for over five years when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit finally overturned his conviction in 1986. The Court held that prosecutors in the case failed to disclose information about another suspect, Lee Crowe, and that had the defense known of the Crowe materials, the result of the trial would probably have been different. Crowe resembled Bowen, had greater motive, no alibi, and habitually carried the same gun and unusual ammunition as the murder weapon. Bowen, on the other hand, maintained his innocence, provided twelve alibi witnesses to confirm that he was 300 miles from the crime scene just one hour prior to the crime, and could not be linked by any physical evidence to the crime. (Bowen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593 (10th Cir. 1986)) The charges against Bowen were dismissed in 1987.<br>
<br>
Robert Lee Miller, Jr. - Conviction 1988 - Released January, 1998<br>
<br>
Miller was convicted of the rape and murder of two elderly women in 1988. However, recent DNA evidence pointed to another defendant who was already incarcerated on similar charges. Oklahoma County Special Judge Larry Jones dismissed the charges against Miller in February, 1997 and said that there was not enough evidence to justify his continued imprisonment. Miller's original conviction was overturned in 1995 and he was granted a new trial. The prosecution finally decided to drop charges and Miller was freed. <br>
<br>
Ronald Williamson - Conviction 1987 and 1995 - Released April, 1999<br>
<br>
Williamson and co-defendant Dennis Fritz were convicted of the 1982 rape and murder of Debra Sue Carter.  Williamson received a sentence of death and spent nine of his 12 years in prison on death row, once coming within five days of being executed.  Fritz received a life sentence.  After DNA tests on the hair and semen samples originally used to convict them did not match either man, Oklahoma District Judge Tom Landrith dismissed the charges against them.  District Attorney Bill Peterson said there were moral, ethical and legal reasons to dismiss the case.<br>
<br>
<br>
In those the DA was forced to release innocent people...<br>
<br>
Want some in which the DA is withholding DNA testing from clearing suspects or convicts?<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
&quot;As the fight over the request for the DNA test was going on in court, Virginia Gov. James Gilmore announced that he will ask the state Legislature to impose a three-year cap on the time that inmates have to use DNA evidence to appeal their conviction.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/columnists/wickham/2001-03-30-wickham.htm">www.usatoday.com/news/com...ickham.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

&quot;At least 23 innocent people were executed in the United States during the 20th Century. There were more than 400 cases of wrongful conviction for capital offenses in the U.S. between 1900-91, according to Amnesty International. Most of the convictions were upheld on appeal, and evidence proving the defendant's innocence emerged years after sentencing. But at least 23 individuals were executed before exonerating evidence surfaced. &quot;<br>

<br>
So.. US society commited 23 murders BEFORE evidence could be brought out to prove their innocence. Want me to show you those 23 cases? and how DA and other government officials  conspired to keep the truth from judicial process so as to not &quot;look&quot; bad or have some one they felt was guilty go innocent...<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
&quot;The U.S. Justice Department reported last year that 60 convictions in death penalty and other cases had been overturned on the basis of DNA testing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One vindication for every seven executions is not a criminal justice system that is working right,&quot; Leahy said. &quot;It is a case of Russian roulette.&quot; <br>

These sites give information that may help one understand what the state of mind of the police officers might be. There is not any information that I have found that shows how many officers are injured but not killed in the line of duty.<br>
<br>
Please understand I do not want to see innocent people die. What I want is for all possible evidence to be presented, evaluated, and a decision made. If that decision is guilty I do not see why I should support a convicted criminal to live the remander of his life in prison when the money could be better spent on education and programs to support America's youth to help prevent them from ending up on death row.<br>

I am just currious those that are participating in this debate, has anyone in your family or one of your close friends ever been the victim of a violent crime?<br>
<br>
My grandmother, (Mom's mother) was murdered when my mother was 4 months old.<br>
<br>
My cousin was shot at point blank range in the head by a woman with whom he had broken up with.<br>
<br>
Other violent crimes against my friends and family of a personal nature I will leave out for what should be obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
We can debate back and forth siting cases of injustice, but what it boils down to is this is all we have. Until a better system is found then what measures we can take to protect society should be taken. Prove yourself a menace to society then expect society to defend itself.<br>
<br>
I have reasons for believing the way I do. Am I bitter, no. Do I want to see justice served? Hell yes!<br>

<br>
The shot the guy 41 times.. hitting him 19 times.. on a forensic sketch.. they show how one of the 19 bullets entered thrut he bottomg og the guys foot and trvelle dup his leg...  they shot him even while he was laying down....<br>
<br>
And they claimed self defense....<br>
<br>
Murphy shot four of the 41 bullets fired that night<br>
Boss fired five times at Diallo. <br>
so 9 shots... out of 41... leaving 32 shots to other 2 officers...<br>
<br>
Can you tell me what police side arm can hold 16 shots a piece... oh wait.. i don't... does that mean one of borth had to reload?<br>
<br>
Sean Carroll  how many bullets?<br>
Edward McMellon how many bullets?<br>
<br>
They reload and shoot him again... explain that.<br>
<br>
Explain the plunger up the guys asz? that was also due to the crime statistics?<br>
<br>
I live in NYC, i know what the crime rates are... I also see police behaviour every day.. least when i am outside and not on EQ.<br>
<br>
Cops can make mistakes for multiple reaosns.<br>
From racism, or any other prejudices... to just plain over zealousness.<br>
<br>
Think about it... they shot an unarmed man 41 times... and got away with it...  how many other things you think they get away with?<br>
<br>
And you are still not addressing the point.. innocent people have been on detah row.. some  have been executed.<br>
<br>
1 out of every 7 person on death row ha been freed.<br>
<br>
More than one organization has claimed that the USA ha executed 23 innocent people.  a governor is fighting investigations to show that an executed person was innocent.. and in doing so allows the guilty to get away with murder...  <br>
<br>
What is worse...  Innocent person goes to death  and guilty person remains free to do crime again... or innocent goes free and if commits a crime gets caught?<br>

Using prison as a deterrent doesn't work for all people.  For some, its an improvement on their lives, so its not a deterrent, but an incentive.<br>
<br>
2.  Falsifying evidence is a crime.  <br>
<br>
3.  Like I said, overgeneralized statement.<br>
<br>
4.  Good point . . . trials are not just debates, but a search for the full truth.  I stand corrected on this note.<br>
<br>
5.  Manson wouldn't have been deterred by anything.  He is, as you say, crazy.  I have to bring up, though, since you talk about hypotheticals, the possibility of his escape.  How many would he kill?  I suppose you could be utilitarian, and debate the benefits of studying his disorder vs the risk of his escape and repeating his crimes . . . personally, I think society would be better off making an example of people like him, to deter the people that ARE borderline in making a decision of the life/death nature.  Which WOULD be a benefit to society for killing him.<br>
<br>
As for the innocent man case you cite - people DO get shot accidentally.  Move too fast, act threatening, or continue advancing on a cop when told not to(or anyone with a weapon for that matter) WILL get you shot.  Hell, I'd shoot someone that advancing on me after being told not to.  If they KNOW you have a weapon, the only logical reason to continue advancing is because they mean you harm.<br>
<br>
As for the reloading . . . 9 mm can hold up to 18 (17 in the magazine, 1 in the chamber), depending on the specific gun and magazine (/rude magazine capacity laws).  And you know what?  If I empty a gun on someone, before I move, I'm going to drop another magazine in there - its just a reasonable precaution.  And if they are still moving after I've emptied a magazine at them already - they're prolly gonna get the second magazine as well.  (note that these cops did NOT reload and fire, according to the info posted)<br>

1) And dying isn't better for some people?  You think those guys in the planes that crashed into NYC didn't think that death was better for them?  How about those kids in Columbine High school? I could post a whole list of people who did things because to them deathw as better than their lives... hell theres a very common situation called &quot;Suicide by cop&quot; in which people purposely confront cops to get killed.<br>
So lets not talk about the extremes...  We are supposed to be covering the mayority of criminals... And i believe most of them would rather not be in jail.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) A crime is not a crime when you commit it... but when you get caught... Until you get caught... and THATS the mayor problem.  That many people don't think they are going to get caught.... including the District attorneys and law enforcement agents.  And since they  hold the power to enforece the laws... It's that much harder to prove they comitted a crime and even when you prove it.. they can get away with most of it due to &quot;immunity&quot;.<br>
<br>
3) Over generalization? I am actually giving you 1  case in wich the DA was opposed to it and got away with it.. person was executed and now the governor is opposed to the testing of the DNA evidence.<br>
<br>
4) ok so we agree that law enforcement should not withhold evidence to make their cases stronger.<br>
<br>
5) Killing manson would detter no one... Hell more people remember him cause he is still around and alive in jail than those who rememebr anyone else who was executed that same year.<br>

U.S. cult leader. Born in Cincinnati, he was a criminal from an early age. In 1967 he formed a communal cult, the Manson Family. He tried to become a pop musician in Los Angeles, but when the producer Terry Melcher failed to help him, Manson decided to launch a racial war by murdering prominent white people, for which he believed blacks would be blamed. In 1969 he sent cult members to Melcher's house, which was rented to the actress Sharon Tate and R. Polanski; they murdered Tate and five friends and elsewhere killed three others. In 1971 Manson and his followers were sentenced to death; when California abolished the death penalty (1972), the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Now.. can you tell me  who was put to death back in 1971?  But you can remember him right?  Mostly because of the type of crime he commited.. but i am sure alot of people don;t remember other crimes that were worse... People forget.. unless there is somethign to remind them.  anyone rmeember Bundy?<br>

Who was the one who said that death penalty would be a deterrant? Was it me?<br>
<br>
As to different factors.. ok.. lets look at the two most extreme examples of conditions in the USA<br>
NY vs Texas.<br>
<br>
NY:     Extremely harsh gun control laws.<br>
Texas: If you have the money you can buy it...<br>
<br>
NY: Last time someone was executed was like  so long ago even the grandkids of that personw ould have died of old age.<br>
Texas: Check the TV guide for the next one.<br>
<br>
NY: Population density by the foot..<br>
Texas: Population density by the  mile...<br>
<br>
Last time I checked.. for the year 2000...<br>
<br>
Number of murders:<br>
Washington DC: 239<br>
Texas: 1,238<br>
California 2,079<br>
New York 952<br>
Florida 903<br>
<br>
Rate of murders per 100,000 in each state.<br>
<br>
New York 3,099.6 <br>
Texas 4,955.5<br>
<br>
So what factors account for texas having more murders than New York?<br>
