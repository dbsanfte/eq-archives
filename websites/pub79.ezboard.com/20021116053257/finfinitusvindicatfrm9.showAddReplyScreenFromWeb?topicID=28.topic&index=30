Using prison as a deterrent doesn't work for all people.  For some, its an improvement on their lives, so its not a deterrent, but an incentive.<br>
<br>
2.  Falsifying evidence is a crime.  <br>
<br>
3.  Like I said, overgeneralized statement.<br>
<br>
4.  Good point . . . trials are not just debates, but a search for the full truth.  I stand corrected on this note.<br>
<br>
5.  Manson wouldn't have been deterred by anything.  He is, as you say, crazy.  I have to bring up, though, since you talk about hypotheticals, the possibility of his escape.  How many would he kill?  I suppose you could be utilitarian, and debate the benefits of studying his disorder vs the risk of his escape and repeating his crimes . . . personally, I think society would be better off making an example of people like him, to deter the people that ARE borderline in making a decision of the life/death nature.  Which WOULD be a benefit to society for killing him.<br>
<br>
As for the innocent man case you cite - people DO get shot accidentally.  Move too fast, act threatening, or continue advancing on a cop when told not to(or anyone with a weapon for that matter) WILL get you shot.  Hell, I'd shoot someone that advancing on me after being told not to.  If they KNOW you have a weapon, the only logical reason to continue advancing is because they mean you harm.<br>
<br>
As for the reloading . . . 9 mm can hold up to 18 (17 in the magazine, 1 in the chamber), depending on the specific gun and magazine (/rude magazine capacity laws).  And you know what?  If I empty a gun on someone, before I move, I'm going to drop another magazine in there - its just a reasonable precaution.  And if they are still moving after I've emptied a magazine at them already - they're prolly gonna get the second magazine as well.  (note that these cops did NOT reload and fire, according to the info posted)<br>

1) And dying isn't better for some people?  You think those guys in the planes that crashed into NYC didn't think that death was better for them?  How about those kids in Columbine High school? I could post a whole list of people who did things because to them deathw as better than their lives... hell theres a very common situation called &quot;Suicide by cop&quot; in which people purposely confront cops to get killed.<br>
So lets not talk about the extremes...  We are supposed to be covering the mayority of criminals... And i believe most of them would rather not be in jail.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) A crime is not a crime when you commit it... but when you get caught... Until you get caught... and THATS the mayor problem.  That many people don't think they are going to get caught.... including the District attorneys and law enforcement agents.  And since they  hold the power to enforece the laws... It's that much harder to prove they comitted a crime and even when you prove it.. they can get away with most of it due to &quot;immunity&quot;.<br>
<br>
3) Over generalization? I am actually giving you 1  case in wich the DA was opposed to it and got away with it.. person was executed and now the governor is opposed to the testing of the DNA evidence.<br>
<br>
4) ok so we agree that law enforcement should not withhold evidence to make their cases stronger.<br>
<br>
5) Killing manson would detter no one... Hell more people remember him cause he is still around and alive in jail than those who rememebr anyone else who was executed that same year.<br>

U.S. cult leader. Born in Cincinnati, he was a criminal from an early age. In 1967 he formed a communal cult, the Manson Family. He tried to become a pop musician in Los Angeles, but when the producer Terry Melcher failed to help him, Manson decided to launch a racial war by murdering prominent white people, for which he believed blacks would be blamed. In 1969 he sent cult members to Melcher's house, which was rented to the actress Sharon Tate and R. Polanski; they murdered Tate and five friends and elsewhere killed three others. In 1971 Manson and his followers were sentenced to death; when California abolished the death penalty (1972), the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Now.. can you tell me  who was put to death back in 1971?  But you can remember him right?  Mostly because of the type of crime he commited.. but i am sure alot of people don;t remember other crimes that were worse... People forget.. unless there is somethign to remind them.  anyone rmeember Bundy?<br>

Who was the one who said that death penalty would be a deterrant? Was it me?<br>
<br>
As to different factors.. ok.. lets look at the two most extreme examples of conditions in the USA<br>
NY vs Texas.<br>
<br>
NY:     Extremely harsh gun control laws.<br>
Texas: If you have the money you can buy it...<br>
<br>
NY: Last time someone was executed was like  so long ago even the grandkids of that personw ould have died of old age.<br>
Texas: Check the TV guide for the next one.<br>
<br>
NY: Population density by the foot..<br>
Texas: Population density by the  mile...<br>
<br>
Last time I checked.. for the year 2000...<br>
<br>
Number of murders:<br>
Washington DC: 239<br>
Texas: 1,238<br>
California 2,079<br>
New York 952<br>
Florida 903<br>
<br>
Rate of murders per 100,000 in each state.<br>
<br>
New York 3,099.6 <br>
Texas 4,955.5<br>
<br>
So what factors account for texas having more murders than New York?<br>

For instance, Florida (where I live, btw) has less than NY, concealed carry laws, and the death penalty, just like Texas.  OBVIOUSLY there are other factors involved. <p></br>
