<br>
Overview <br>
<br>
Prior to 1.62, berserkers were viewed, perhaps, as the greatest melee threat on the battlefield, due to their incredible, straightforward damage. Now, after the significant reduction to said damage, Berserkers are largely regarded (by those who play them, at the very least) as a role-less melee class that is ambiguously defined as a “positional and reactionary” fighter, while only having limited reactionary options and two rear positional styles. Lacking the defense of a heavy tank while being rewarded with an insignificant offensive advantage has many Berserkers wishing they played another class, or, in fact, creating and sticking with alternate characters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Concerns <br>
<br>
<br>
Berserkers Not Fitting Into the Definition of a Light Tank<br>
<br>
The primary concern is our class fitting into its new definition of being a Light Tank (as per “The Light Tank Explained” in the 1.62B patch notes). For nearly two years, the Berserker has symbolized ultimate melee offense at the cost of defense. Every guide, from Prima’s to the latest that came with DAoC Gold, has described the Berserker as a highly offensive class with poor defense. Therefore, every player who creates a Berserker is expecting a class that fits this description, and so redefining the Berserker entirely, especially this late in the game, makes little, if any, sense. The patch notes assured players that the spirit of the class would remain, but this absolutely not the case. The Berserker now fills no role, and none of its players wish to be put into this positional/reactionary definition of the Light Tank, which the Savage already performs very well for Midgard.<br>
<br>
1.62 Damage Reduction<br>
<br>
The next, most obvious concern, therefore, is Left Axe’s damage after the 1.62 reduction. My personal tests showed a 30% or more reduction in common styles, such as Ravager, Doublefrost, and Snowsquall. While a decrease to this damage was undoubtedly necessary, it is incredibly unjust to take something players have put so much into and remove 1/3 of its ability to be effective. The definition of the Light Tank in Dark Age is unique, and players of Berserkers respect that idea, but the Savage already has wonderful positional and reactionary potential. We find ourselves asking, then: why is our class supposed to do the same thing? For these reasons, and because the Berserker community as a whole is against this redefinition, I strongly urge you to reconsider the large reduction to LA damage. Ideally, the reduction would have started lower (10-15%) and been raised over time, if it weren’t enough.<br>
<br>
Frenzy<br>
<br>
A former concern with Berserkers was their occasional massive hits, which were the result of a solid hit accompanied by a 90%+ critical hit while in a Frenzy. Many players felt such hits were unbalanced. Therefore, please consider the following adjustment: <br>
<br>
Tighten the critical hit range to 25-75%, down from 1-99%. This maintains the average (50%), while allowing more consistent damage at the cost of lower maximum critical hits.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Realm Ability “Tundra”<br>
<br>
Our class-specific realm ability “Tundra” has a penalty associated with it when used with Left Axe. As the class-defining specline of the Berserker is Left Axe, this penalty is irrational and should be removed. Furthermore, spending 10 Realm Skill Points on a combat style that can be used once every 10 minutes is unbalanced. Please consider reducing the Realm Skill Point cost of this RA, as well as the other combat style RAs for other classes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Specline Issues<br>
<br>
In addition to a moderate increase in our damage to revive the spirit of our class, there is a redundancy in rear positional styles in the Left Axe line. Also, many berserkers are upset with the change to Aurora Borealis in 1.62. Please consider the following changes:<br>
<br>
<br>
Left Axe<br>
<br>
Doubler<br>
<br>
This is currently one of two rear positionals. Please change this to a Side positional, as we don’t currently have one.<br>
<br>
Decaying Rage<br>
<br>
This style is our only detaunt and is the third part in the Ravager chain (Ravager-&gt;Atrophy-&gt;Decaying Rage). Please consider making this detaunt have no prerequisite so that Berserkers, who tend to take a lot of damage in PvE, can remove the aggression from themselves more easily.<br>
<br>
Aurora Borealis<br>
<br>
This 50 spec style formerly had the prerequisite of “target parries.” Currently, it’s the third style in a Rear positional chain, and is, therefore, incredibly difficult to use in Realm vs. Realm combat. A 50 spec style should be both useful and very effective, so please consider this alteration:<br>
<br>
<br>
Make Aurora Borealis chain off of the proposed Doubler (side positional).<br>
<br>
Change Aurora Borealis’ effect from a Cold DD to a medium duration stun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New Issues<br>
<br>
1.62 Damage Reduction Reiterated<br>
<br>
In an effort to keep the Berserker a fun and worthwhile class, please reconsider the massive reduction to our damage that was implemented in 1.62. My personal tests showed a 30%+ reduction to the damage of all styles, so I ask that this be reduced to 10-15%. The 1.62 patch notes said Light Tanks should not be able to defeat Heavy Tanks in head-on combat, but with a 10-15% reduction to our pre-1.62 damage, we would, in fact, be incredibly hard pressed to defeat Heavy Tanks 1 on 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other Issues<br>
<br>
-On a killing blow, Left Axe attacks have no animation.<br>
-The cost of combat style RAs is high. Please re-evaluate.<br>
<br>
Item Issues<br>
<br>
- Hammer spec'd Berserkers would like the ability to wield the Viking targetted Hammer drops from Tuscaren Glacier (such as Nokkvi's Mauler and Agmundr's Foe Slayer)<br>
<br>
<br>
On behalf of the berserker community and myself, I thank you for reading this report. <br>
