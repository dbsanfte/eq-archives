Manifestation of Hate<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
For one so young I feel as though I have known the power of Innoruuk for some time...I write to you my New Family of my battle with myself and with the lightborn infidels that plague our world...It was not long ago that I discovered my niche in this world...My calling as a child was to that of my fathers profession...Assassin..I was taught the subtle ways of the silent killer and excelled at an early age..It was only later in my adolescence that I stumbled upon a tomb of my ancestors that I realized my true calling...Let me tell you of this revelation...<br>
<br>
When I was nearing my age of manhood I could feel a great fire burning inside me...This troubled me for I knew not where it came...I began searching through out Neriak for answers...One night I wondered into the Dark Forest outside our beloved City and stumbled upon a small graveyard...The names on the headstones where hard to read but I could make out the name on one...Tynelas A'Ranar..My great Grand Mother...I had heard stories of her from my aunt...It was said that she was once a great Necromancer and that she commanded great power over the dead...I was intrigued by my discovery...I probed further into the graveyard in search of more knowledge...While walking past another stone suddenly a small gust of wind swept through the yard...blowing back a pile of fallen leaves and exposing a small metal grate rusted by the passage of hundreds of years...I looked closer at the grate and noticed that it was fastened with a small lock...I withdrew a small knife from my boot and began working at it...After some effort the lock snapped and the grate fell inward on a squeaky hinge...The grate smashed against the inner wall of a passage way that extended downward for some length...Peering into the darkness I notices a few metal ringlets attached to the wall..Using makeshift ladder I descended into the tomb...Upon entering the catacomb I instantly felt a sense of dread....This is place of great Darkness I thought to myself...Looking around the crypt I noticed two large stone coffins in the far corner...covered by beetles and centipedes...As I moved closer to the coffins I noticed that the floor too was covered by a multitude of insects that scurried out of the way as I drew closer...I approached caskets with a giddy sense of anticipation..The floor and walls were alive with a billion crawling creatures all singing the high pitched song of death....I reached out my hand towards the first of the two coffins and as my hand neared the insects instantly scattered in all directions leaving the polished stone surface bare..I touched it and immediately I was consumed by a vast flux of energy flowing through the sarcophagus with this great energy came a vision...I saw a great darkness embodied..I knew this was Innoruuk...I saw him sweeping his hand across the hills and valleys of Norrath layinf waste to all that crossed his path...Then I saw myself standing atop a pile of skulls holding a great sword and clad in a dark metallic armor...Whoa the sight...This was my calling!!! And in this vision with a stroke of my armored hand an army of skeletons rose from the pile of bones at my feet...I would use my fallen enemies corpses to destroy their living counterparts...Then my vision went black...I awoke in my bed in my aunts home with a nasty bump on my head...My aunt told me that I been found by one of the guards wondering through the forest with a dazed look on my face..I remembered not my adventure or the visions I had seen until now..I know the source of my Hate now...It is me!!!!!<br>

Beware the visions of Innoruuk, Darkehn, they can leave marks on your mind that tend to surface at the most inopportune times. Truly you have been blessed by the lightest touch of his shodwy presence - he chose you to walk in the West, to stand as a Guardian of Eternity, the keepers of teh Frost Gate. So long as you live, Innoruuk will feed your hate, and it will grow as you consume it. All around you will fall, as long as you remain true to yourself, and true to Hate. I am pleased that our Master allowed you to remember your rebirth, and that you in turn shared the tale with us.<br>

Thank you for hearing my story Nospiratus and I long to venture to the Frozen gate and take my post as guardian...This vision is one of remembrance...I have only recently discovered my direction and I believe that it is true to the will of Innoruuk...You are by far the most touched of all the Harvesters and I believe in your words...Please seek me out on the feild of battle for I have a few words to speak to you as well...I believe my ambition fuels the fire burning within me...I do not know exactly what Innoruuk holds for me but I see a glimpse of it now and again...I always see my self standing atop a mountain of bones and decaying flesh holding a great sword stained with blood...I can almost smell the rotting corpses as I speak...Ahhhh to be at one with them is a great calling...My confusing seems to subside a small amount with every life I take...Soon I believe I Innoruuk will reveal his plans for me...<br>
<br>
May the Shadows of Our Father fall over all and enshroud the land in a permenant Twighlight...<br>

Aye, Darkehn,<br>

You are one of the blessed of Innoruuk. May he pull that veil back for you soon...and may you emerge from the shadows fully equipped and knowledgeable of the tasks that Innoruuk has for you.<br>
