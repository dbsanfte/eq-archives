Prodigal Son<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The night air grew colder as he pressed on...The cold chill of the wind bit into his skin...This night was not unlike the others he had spent in these wretched mountains ... searching... His honor had been tested and yes it had been some time ... Completion of this task was vital ... Reach the Summit ... Claim his prize and return to his beloved sanctuary ... The Dark forest he envisioned in the back of his mind ... Too long had he struggled to gain understanding of his ways ... Too long had he neglected the one thing that made him feel whole ... His Family ... The Violent Harvest ... His journey of enlightenment had brought him to lands far away ... With out so much as a good bye he left them all ... He knows not if they noticed his passing for the time was ideal ... The uprising of Innoruuks children was at hand ... His heart longed to be at the side of his comrades ... Shedding blood ... Drinking from the very skulls of his enemies ... With all this in mind the young Shadow Knight plunged headlong into the darkness ... Still searching for his elusive prey ... He must return to Neriak soon ... Soon or he could perish in this frozen wasteland...<br>
<br>
Darkehn climbed to the very top of the world in search of his prize ... With only his meager cloth pants and tunic as protection ... A sudden gust of wind brought him to his knees ... The snow had begun to turn to frozen rain some time ago and was beginning to cut his flesh ... Through the haze of frost he spied his goal ... perched ...u..p...o..n... Then it all went black .... He had succomed to the elements ... Surely he would die he thought as his vision blurred and his strength wained ... He fell to his side and sank into a snow drift ... he was quickly covered by the icey deposits ... Not how he thought he would die ... Not by any stretch of the imagination ... Battle was where he was supposed to die ... Slaughtering the Lightborn at the Frost Gate ... He had witnessed it in his very dreams ... The cold quickly numbed his extremeties and soon even his brain ... With his last breathes he muttered a prayer to Innoruuk ...<br>
Warmth spread around him .... He wakes in a familiar but Unknown place ... He is lying in front of a warm fire wrapped in Bear skins ... His vision is still blurred but he can barely make out the face looking down upon him...<br>
<br>
&quot;Selilya?&quot; he can barely issue forth the name .... Then Darkness takes him again... <br>

<br>
&quot;He's stirring again,&quot; Lenaesha informed the monk. &quot;Poor creature...he just keeps muttering that name. She must be someone very important to him.&quot; Lanashae pulled the bear skins back over Darkehn's prone form and stroked his silver hair much as she would have done for a sick child.<br>
<br>
Lynxe pulled the stool next to the makeshift bed and sat down heavily. He was weary now but glad he had found Darkehn before it was too late. He'd achieved his prize...and Lynxe would not let him be cheated of the victory. Lynxe knew it was time for Darkehn to return to his people. There wasn't much more this monk could teach him... He knew that sometimes, life is a far better instructor.<br>
<br>
Lynxe looked over at his hostess. Lenaesha was married to Prumathon Jaxallion. It was quite mind-boggling to find their cabin out here in the frozen northern wastelands. What he found even more remarkable was that she was a dark elf, like Darkehn, and he was a barbarian. Lynxe just shook his head. He was not one given to understand the secrets of love between two people. He'd not had time for such nonsense. He knew that Darkehn had mistaken her for Selilya. In his current physical state, he could have just as easily confused the barbarian for his...his what?<br>
<br>
After Darkehn had come to train with him, Selilya had come looking for him. No wonder Darkehn was so taken...Lynxe had to admit, she seemed to have some magic about her. There was something else Lynxe noticed, however, and he couldn't quite put his finger on it at their first encounter. She had been fiercely protective of Darkehn, and he knew that she would have dispatched him right then and there if he couldn't convince her of his intentions for his new pupil. They continued a conversation for hours...until the night air chilled the both of them. She had headed on to the Frontier Mountain fortress, and Lynxe watched her vanish into the trees before he headed back to the tent that he shared with Darkehn.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll be better soon, friend,&quot; he whispered to Darkehn. The months had flown by for them he mused. Darkehn had been quite stubborn at first. It cost his quite a few bumps and bruises. He had lacked real discipline. His way back then was to attempt to &quot;brute force&quot; his way through every situation. Yet, Lynxe, the Monk, had persisted...and had been very patient. These last few weeks had seen a changed Shadow Knight emerge... The final step...ascending the highest peak in the frozen land...was all that kept him from passing on to the ranks of &quot;graduate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Darkehn, had become his favorite pupil, and perhaps even worthy of learning many of the secrets Lynxe held close. So, when the day came to conquer the last phase, he sighed. Darkehn had seemed to be battling a slight case of sniffles, but that was common in the higher plateaus. Yet, Lynxe, decided to keep an eye on his prized pupil's progress. When Darkehn had laid his fingers around the handle of the covered box, he collapsed...and Lynxe watched and waited for<br>
him to get up...to yell &quot;Victory is Mine&quot;...but there was no movement.<br>
<br>
Lynxe had been most fortunate in stumbling into the barbarian. Prumathon didn't hesitate at all when he saw the two rather &quot;frozen&quot; individuals stumbling down the face of the peak. He scooped Darkehn up from the shoulders of the<br>
monk and within a brief lapse of time, they had made their way to the barbarian's cottage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prumathon?&quot; the monk began. &quot;I must get word to his friends. It is time for this young one to go home...to his destiny. I leave him here in your capable care. Your kindness to the both of us has been....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shhh,&quot; Lanaesha raised her hand to silence him. &quot;It is our pleasure to help. It's been so long since I have seen one from my homeland. Go...go...he will be just fine here until you return.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lynxe patted his pupil on the head once more...picked up his traveling pack...and headed out the door to secure Darkehn's future.<br>

It did seem that the night air had chilled just slightly upon his leaving the young Shadow Knight to recuperate under the care of the the strange couple. Lynxe pushed forward into the darkness made even darker by the absence of moonlight. The last few months had been quite an eye opener for the monk. He learned just as much from Darkehn as the dark elf learned from him. The brash youth did indeed have a certain quality about him. He wondered why Selilya cared so much for his well being. Maybe his student did indeed have a destiny greater than just a valaint warrior. Could his return to his people spark some unknown flame? Lynxe pondered all of this as he jogged through the frozen land toward the Frost Gate. He had spent much time in these hills and mountains as he was born in the nearby city of Qeynos. This is where he built his extreme tolerance to the elements. He could easily withstand many a night at sub zero temperatures and not suffer from even the slightest cold. That is why he sent Darkehn here. He knew that this would test the very core of darkehns being. Lynxe only wished he had given the young Shadow Knight more time. But lifes lessons are only learned through experience. Lynxes strove onward in search of Darkehns self procclaimed guardian. Selilya...That name haunted him. She was indeed a sight to behold. Power and grace neatly wrapped into the slight frame of a beautiful dark elf female. He had met with her a few times in the past. They had even shared a lengthy conversation around a small camp fire in the Over There. Her thoughts were hard to read but years of study had made Lynxe a very capable empath. He knew the ways of the Dark Elf more now than before, but even then he could see here selfless devotion to her cause. <br>
<br>
Lynxe only had one goal now....To find her. he had recieved word of a blood bath ensuing in the Eastern Common Lands. He would start his search there. The blood and carnage would surely bring forth the Mistress of the Dead. This he was sure of...  <br>
