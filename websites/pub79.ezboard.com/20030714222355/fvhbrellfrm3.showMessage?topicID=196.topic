She stares into the fire with a distant look on her face. <br>
<br>
She has brief flashes of being roughly handed to a Teir'dal female. She can vaguely remember the strange smell on the female as she is briefly brought close to her. She remembers a terrible fear, begins kicking her small feet and the scream wellowing up in her soul. The sound is never uttered as the just as soon as the fear begins so to does it end. The woman seems less threatening and smiles. &quot;She will do nicely&quot; Kiaran's feet are once again touch on the floor. <br>
<br>
<br>
She jerks up right with a shiver , and comes back to herself. She sees the fire has died. Her muscles protest as she rises and slowlys stretches working each one. Her pulse quiets and she begins to breathe easily. Shortly her small curveous body is got a soft sheen of sweat from the work out. She padds down the hall to her room and puts things away. She listens to the night sounds of the Grange with a small smile. She cleans herself up and pokes her nose to the hallway, seeing nothing she strips, climbs into bed and shortly dozes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udaiunusdarkenvalor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daiunus Darkenvalor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/18/02 5:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beginging of the Lost Child</span><hr size=1> Daiunus watched the young warrioress from the shadows, wondering what inner demons Kiaran struggled with in her dreams.  After she had finished practicing and left the training hall, Daiunus emerged from the shadows, with a new enigma to solve.  &quot; So many Chosen, so many different secrets...&quot;<br>
Daiunus returned to the warroom, looking to his new mantle piece, he grinned evilly.  The war lance on the wall was old and rusty, but it held a glow that could not be denied.<br>

She frowned, slid into leggings and a tunic.  There she heard it again, she followed the sound to the petitions room.  There curled up in the middle of the floor was a child.  Kia looked around and saw no one else.  &quot;What ails you child?&quot;  Two bright eyes stared at her.  &quot;I canna found my way back and I'm gonna get in trouble.&quot;  it sniffed.  Kia frowned before nodding.  &quot;You must be one of the Thresher's.&quot;  The child nodded.  &quot;Well come along then before he wakes.&quot;  Kia held out a hand.  &quot;Now mind you I am unfamiliar also so we will do this by memory, which Faeolin says a warrior I should improve.  Warriors are not made by body alone.&quot;  The pair wandered down the halls and although a few wrong turns found there way.   Kiaran watched the child settle in with the others.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ulosturchin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LostUrchin</A> at: 1/25/02 1:18:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/ufaeolin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faeolin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Overlord</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/24/02 5:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beginging of the Lost Child</span><hr size=1> The sound of footsteps outside her office made her start.  Knowing the hour was late, her hands slipped to the daggers sheathed below the top of her desk.  It was never safe in Neriak, not even for a Dread Overlord of the Violent Harvest.  Hearing a murmer that sounded remarkably like two children, she allowed herself to relax.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Let one of the Threshers wandering wretches misstep around me,&quot; she muttered to herself.  &quot;They will know what Hatred is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once the words had crossed her lips, she smiled.  This was not the smile that she often carried around those who knew her best.  The drawing of her cheeks, and the baring of teeth was that of one maliciously intent upon bringing pain and suffering to others.  This was the smile of conquerors, the smile of certainty of deed.  This was a smile she had mastered well.<br>

She passed Faeolin's quarters and saw the light. She smiled to herself. She went back to bed her thoughts of Faeolin stopping her from her usual tossing and turning.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     In her dreams she was running, and then was a child again in the training hall.  She was on her pallate on the floor.  She heard the others around her.  She heard the heavy boot steps of the warriors.  She screamed as the hand grabbed her and held her aloft by the tunic. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kiaran sat up in bed with a scream gulping air into her lungs, her heart hammering in her chest.  She waited hoping she heard no running of feet.  She sighed, she should be over those silly dreams by now.  It was probably just her mind working in her sleep.  She had thought she'd given up finding out who she was or where she had come from.  She accepted she had no house, the Harvest had become her family.  She washed, dressed and went to the room and again.  She began to work out in front of the fire.  She lost her mind to the balance of weapons, movement and the training.  As she worked she emptied her mind, slowly wiping all emotion from her.  Her violet eyes turned cold and blank, her fine features lost the softness.  Once again she pushed all but her warrior from her.  She worked until every muscle screamed in protest and her limbs refused to fight.  She pushed until her weapons became to heavy to bear, her breaths were labored and she dripped sweat.  When she could move no longer she fell to her knees before the fire.  Violet eyes stared blankly into the flames.  She finally moved back to her room, washed and fell into bed, she was asleep before her head hit the pillow and long after the first rays of light shown.<br>
<br>
Several nights later, when all the Grange is quiet Kiaran slips back out into the dark of the city.  She has changed her armor for street clothes and tucked her sword out of sight.  She quietly navigates the streets to The Cauldron of Hate.  Her memory serves her well and she finds her old tutor's rooms.  The old warrior looks up from his desk and smiles.  &quot;Come in, Child.  I hear you have a new home.&quot;  Kiaran enters and slides into a chair.  &quot;Aye I have a new home for a moment in the Grange til I am judged.  Then it becomes perment. But I have come on a more personal errand.&quot;  The old warrior nodded.  &quot;What is it Child that you seek?&quot;  Kiaran sighes and whispers &quot;I seek my begining, Sir.  Not that you did not train me well or that I am not grateful for my new home.  But I have visions or dreams that make no sense.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The warrior nodded.  &quot;Then the time has come Child.  But you must choose.  Do you wish to know or can you let it go?&quot;  Kiaran frowned.  &quot;I may not wish to know it all.  Can you tell me how I came to be here.&quot;  The old warrior nodded.  &quot;You were given to me when you were but a babe.  But I had known you long before then.  I had known your father.  Your father was a good man and good fighter, but a warrior he was not.  Your father, Dakkan, was a shadowknight. &quot; Kiaran said &quot;So I am a orphan then?&quot;  The old warrior sighed. &quot;Child before we go any further you need to decide what you want to know.&quot; <br>
<br>
It did not take Kiaran very long to decide that she at least wanted to know.  Several days later she again snuck out at dark to visit the old warrior.  This time he simply handed her a book with worn pages.  <br>
<br>
The following is the begining to her story.<br>
