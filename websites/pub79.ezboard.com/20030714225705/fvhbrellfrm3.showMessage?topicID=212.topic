That’s what it boiled down to.  Three words that were the guiding principal in Vresk’s life.  What Circle of Tails had Vresk been when he had first petitioned to join the Violent Harvest?  15?  20?  No, not so seasoned, he thought to himself.  What had happened?<br>
<br>
Ah yes.  Master Niska, his sensei in the Court of Pain.  Calling him a Whiff.  No matter how hard he tried.  No matter how many he defeated, or how well his duties were performed, he was always the Whiff, the sound that a tail makes striking the air.  And then, when he’d reached the tender season of the 10th Circle, he’d had enough.  Inside, for the first time, his Fear gave way to Hate.<br>
<br>
He had been sparring for sport with another in his training clutch.  The fight had been going on for quite some time, perhaps 20 minutes, with neither side gaining the edge.  Despite the superior regenerative powers of his people, both combatants were tiring.  Vresk, wanting to try a maneuver he’d seen by others in the advanced clutches, spun his body, his tail leading the way.  He overbalanced, however, forgetting that the tail was the prime center of the Iksar.  The blow went wild, and his opponent didn’t even need to dodge it.  Whiff.  The sound of a tail striking air.  In the background, he heard chuckling.  As he got up, nursing a broken arm, there was Master Niska.  “Whiff,” was the only word out of the sensei’s mouth.<br>
<br>
The rage had overcome him.  Forgetting his wounds for the moment, he resumed his fighting stance and motioned for his opponent to advance.  Honor bound to accept the continued challenge, his clutch-mate advanced.  Vresk’s tail connecting with his head was the last sight that Iksar ever saw.  There was the sickening grinding noise of bone grinding on bone and then snapping.<br>
<br>
As his opponent fell lifeless, Vresk landed gracefully, turned to the sensei and bowed deeply.  “That,” he said, his voice dripping with Hate, “is the sound of a tail striking my opponent.  Remember it well, Master Niska.”<br>
<br>
There was scandal immediately.  The sensei had rushed the young monk and struck quickly and cleanly.  Vresk didn’t even know he’d been knocked out until he woke up, chained to the slimy walls of some forgotten dungeon.  It was Grandmaster Glox, the most powerful monk of the Court of Pain that greeted Vresk when he came to.  “Are you afraid?” he had asked simply.<br>
<br>
Vresk’s reply was equally as simple.  “Nay, Grandmaster.”<br>
<br>
They talked for days, literally, neither of them taking food or water.  Of course, once the old monk had determined Vresk was not a murderous animal, he was let down from the chains, and even allowed to sit at the Grandmaster’s feet.  They spoke of the past.  They spoke of current times.  And they spoke of the future of the Iksar.  It was grim and serious business.<br>
<br>
The Grandmaster believed that the Iksar had come a long way from their ruin at the claws of Trakanon the Despised.  That Fear had guided them along this path.  But looking around Cabilis, things were obvious.  So obvious in fact, that the entire city, including the Emperor himself refused to speak of it.  Their society had stagnated.  Daily the offerings were made to The Faceless.  And daily they were ignored by their Patron Deity.  Fear would only take them so far.  So had Cazic Thule brought the Iksar unto Norrath, so would he remove them.  Unless there was another way.<br>
<br>
Vresk, apparently was that other way.  At least that’s what the old monk had told him.  Something needed to fuel the passions of the Iksar once more.  Perhaps, Hate would be the embodiment of what they needed.<br>
<br>
Arrangements were made, secret meetings passed.  Within a week’s time Vresk had been summoned before the Emperor and given his mission.  To leave Cabilis and learn of the Teir’Dal, the lesser evil of all that plagued Kunark at the time.  Perhaps the young monk could forge the path for some sort of alliance.<br>
<br>
His first concern upon contacting Dread Lord Faeolin (her title had changed since then) was that of honor.  Her warm response was reassuring, “Indeed, that is our motto, ‘Hate with Honor’.”  Vresk had finally found a place.<br>
<br>
Now here he was, years later, in his own chambers within the Grange of the Violent Harvest.  He had forged no such path for an alliance.  He was the living embodiment of that alliance.  And what only he, the Harvest, and the Grandmaster himself knew was that his interests served not Cabilis, but the Harvest itself.  So useful had the Queen of Neriak found his counsel that she had conspired with the Emperor of Cabilis to grant him lands and a provisional title (Baron) within Neriak.<br>
<br>
Okay, perhaps the term “within Neriak” was a misnomer.  His “lands” consisted of tunnels and passages determined to be unusable by the Teir’Dal because of an unfortunate abundance of sulphuric acid in the air.  However, Vresk found it tolerable, and almost pleasant.  He visited it from time to time, on the rare occasion that duty did not call his attention elsewhere.<br>
<br>
So here it was.  The Violent Harvest being torn apart with inner strife, and its own members too absorbed within their own schemes to either notice or summon the power to put a stop to it.<br>
<br>
Vresk walked the halls of the Grange with directed purpose, his tongue constantly flicking in and out.  Blood.  It was everywhere in the air.  This, coupled with the strange vision The Faceless had tormented him with made Vresk certain that Mythral was somehow behind all the strife he’d seen.<br>
<br>
When the Reaper had unleashed the Power within the vampire, he had assumed the flash of light was his death.  However, it was becoming painfully obvious that his plans were still unfolding.  If only the Prophet were around to speak to.  Together he was certain they would be able to find the proper path.<br>
<br>
However, the Prophet was missing.  And Shaede, already suspected of blasphemy, was the prime suspect in his disappearance.  Events were spinning out of control, and he was being sucked into the Teir’Dal’s mad power games.<br>
<br>
Vresk stopped as the obvious thought hit him.  That was it.  That was it precisely.<br>
<br>
Hate.<br>
<br>
Honor.<br>
<br>
There was nothing else.  Although the Harvest was dear to him, if it meant to tear itself apart, he need not be drawn into that himself.  He would not compromise his own sense of honor.<br>
<br>
Certainly what the Reaper had done was wrong, and perhaps even dishonorable.  Yet what Mythral was doing was worse.  Far worse.  It wasn’t a matter of who was “more right” or who was “more wrong.”  He had sworn to serve the Harvest’s best interests.  Not because he was their slave.  Not because he was a servant.  “Lesser being” though they considered him, that was their issue, not his.  He served the Harvest’s best interests because the Harvest’s goals and direction were identical to his own.<br>
<br>
If Faeolin wished to heed his advice, wonderful.  If not, so be it.  They remained allies until she proved herself to be compromised by the infectious lips (literal and otherwise) of the undead Mythral.<br>
<br>
If Shaede wished to blaspheme and then kidnap the Prophet.  Let her.  He would see to it that she paid for her indiscretions at the time proof came forth in the matter.  If she later proved innocent, even better, the Harvest needed its allies.<br>
<br>
If the Reaper wished to allow his Hate to overcome him, Vresk would see to it to remind him about the delicate control Hate requires.  If he refused to listen, so be it.  If he then compromised the Harvest itself, that would be dealt with.  However, he had spoken to Khasirath, and it was very obvious that he was duped into a reaction by the manipulative enchanter.  Sometimes Hate runs away with us.  The events leading Vresk to this point were proof enough of that.<br>
<br>
His Oaths demanded that he Hate with Honor, nothing more.<br>
<br>
Quickly the Iksar changed his course and headed out of the Grange.  He needed to find and speak with Shintenshi immediately before more harm came of this.<br>
