Part 5.</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel ran across the Faydark forests this time, using speed rather than stealth to avoid the guards.  In the larger of the Faydarks she loped parallel to the narrow paths until she came to the Combine Spires.  The Scion passed her a fragment without question.  The Combine refused to become involved in the various politics of Norrath, and they kept their Spires open to everyone who wanted to use them.<br>
<br>
Settling in the shadow of one of the immense spires of stone, Tzann tried to contact Tevesh again, closing her eyes as she sent out her thoughts towards him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tevesh?&quot; she sent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea', 'im h're,&quot; came his annoyed reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, good.  Bring him to the Nexus, quickly.  I will meet you there.  I'm waiting on the Spires right now,&quot; Tzann told him, careful even in this form of communication to leave as many details sketchy as she could.<br>
<br>
&quot;Al'ight,&quot; Tevesh growled.<br>
<br>
It wasn't much longer before Luclin came into alignment with the Spires of Faydwer, and their magic enfolded Tzanntiel, carrying her away to the Nexus, deep within Luclin.  There she had to wait, knowing Tevesh would have to carry Khasirath out of Thurgadin through the snow fields to the Spires of Velious where he too would be transported.  She wandered around the platform, losing herself in the busy crowds that always passed through the Nexus, in a hurry to get to this place or that.<br>
<br>
After a time, people began appearing on the platform, surrounded by the cold smell of snow.  Tzann pressed forward, and found Tevesh carrying Khasirath in his arms.  She tossed a spare cloak over her brother's body, letting out a sigh of relief that Tevesh had done what she wanted.<br>
<br>
The bald warrior looked down at her, glowering, but Tzann just smiled back.  &quot;I can never thank you enough, cousin.  Follow me, it won't take long.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tevesh grumbled, but nodded, and followed her to Shadow Haven, to a small house which Tzanntiel had been renting.  She unlocked the door, and had Tevesh put Khasirath's cold body on the bed.<br>
<br>
As he turned back around, Tzanntiel slid her arms around him, ignoring the chill of his armour.  Leaning up she nuzzled his chin.  &quot;Thank you, Tev.  You're wonderful.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tevesh chuckled deeply, slipping his arms around her, squeezing her tight.  &quot;I be s're ye w'll f'nd a w'y te m'ke it upta me,&quot; he growled, one of his hands sliding over her rump as he bent his head down to run his lips across her throat.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel purred deeply as she pressed into her cousin.  He didn't notice the whispering voice from a shadowed corner near the bed.  His arms went limp around Tzann as magic tendrils snaked lazily around him.<br>
<br>
Tzann looked up into Tevesh's blank eyes, a wry smirk on her lips.  She reached up and traced his lip with a fingertip.  &quot;Sorry, cousin.  It's best this way,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
A Teir`Dal woman wearing elegant sapphire robes stepped out of the shadows behind Tevesh, watching Tzanntiel with an unreadable gaze.  An ornate scimitar was sheathed at her belt and in her hand was a staff topped with the black head of a cobra.  Its tongue flicked out now and again, its hood twisting as it looked around the room.  The woman stroked a fingertip across its scaled brow as if to soothe it.<br>
<br>
Stiffly Tevesh turned to face the woman.  Her sapphire eyes looked into his with a touch of distaste.  &quot;You did not see Tzanntiel or Khasirath today.  Nor did you see me, and you did not come to this building.  You did not go anywhere out of the ordinary, or see anyone unusual.  You decided to go out for a night of drinking, which you will do once you leave this place.  You will thoroughly enjoy yourself, but remember very little.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tevesh blinked slowly, his face slack, his whole body limp as he swayed slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you understand me, Tevesh S`Therik?&quot; the woman asked sharply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he muttered, as if asleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good.  Now go and do what I told you, and remember nothing,&quot; the woman pointed towards the door, and Tevesh wandered out slowly without looking at Tzanntiel or anything else.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel turned to the woman, letting out a soft sigh.  &quot;Thank you, Kassy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kassy turned away from Tzanntiel, and walked to the bed.  She pulled the cloak away to look down into Khasirath's face.  Gently she ran her fingertips along his cold cheek.  &quot;Just take good care of him, Tzanntiel.  That will be thanks enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann nodded, watching Kassy's back.  &quot;I have to ask you not to try and follow us.  It will be dangerous until I have freed him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Frowning, Kassy turned around, her eyes dark.  &quot;I could help you find a way, though.  I know quite a bit more about magic than you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, Tzann nodded, &quot;I know you do, but it is far too dangerous.  I have much better chances of keeping him alive alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kassy turned her back on Tzanntiel again, looking back at Khasirath.  &quot;Fine.  But if you fail, pray to your dark god that I never see you again.&quot;  With a whispered incantation, the Enchantress vanished.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel closed her eyes for a long moment, steadying herself.  Then she went and locked and trapped her doors and windows, double checking that all the windows were well covered.  Somehow she felt the worst was yet to come. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A> at: 1/22/03 2:01:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kassylightborn>Kassy Lightborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Na`Verdis</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/23/03 12:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Summoned by Darkness</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Several days before Shadowhaven</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Kassy yawned as she walked through the dark streets of the human city. In the time that had passed since the day when the Violent Harvest had set the land ablaze with the flames of Hate the city had rebuilt what was destroyed, reinforced what was not. The Tier'Dal had never fully forgiven herself for being away from her home when the axe had fallen, but she'd had little choice in the matter.<br>
<br>
Silently she passed closed stalls in the merchant district, darkened tents, and quieted homes.  Luclin was reaching her zenith when she arrived at the simple wooden door of her two story home.  With a word and a gesture she released the wizard lock that held the door fast. Though there were none in the city of Qeynos who would dare to enter the home of a powerful magic user, let alone a dark elf, there were reasons for keeping it secure.  More than once she'd overheard young boys daring eachother to sneak in and return with some trophy of the Tier'Dal's. She'd chuckled, but started using the magical seal anyway, more for the safty of the local children than that of her things.<br>
<br>
As she pushed the door inward, the bottom caught on something. Parchment scraped against the stone floor with a quiet crackling.  Kass bent, yawning again, and lifted the folded letter, closing the door with a soft nudge from her foot as she rose.  The parchment was unaddressed, in fact entirely unmarked, which was odd.  With less than a thought globes of light appeared in the four corners of the room, soft blues and pale yellows illuminating the room fully but without the harshness of daylight or the flicker of candles.  Studying the exterior in light proved no more useful than in darkness.  She cracked the wax seal and unfolded the letter.<br>
<br>
For an instant time stood still. Kassy didnt blink, didnt breath.  She only stared at the image drawn upon the parchment.  After a moment she noticed the writing below the precise drawing. Her silver brows furrowed slightly as she read the note again.  Then she nodded and dropped the parchment to her work table.<br>
<br>
When the sun rose the enchantress' house was once again wizard locked and empty. On the table in the living room lay a single piece of parchment, a sword of thorns emblazened upon it in red ink.<br>
