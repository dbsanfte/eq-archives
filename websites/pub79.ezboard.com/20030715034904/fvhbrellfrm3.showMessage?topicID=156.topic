<br>
The Dark Father provided for his children similar skills if they had the motivation, and the patience to utilise <br>
them.  Though as with all gifts of the Father, they were given in Hate to serve Hate - and his purposes. Crieth <br>
lay prone amongst the low grasses and shrubs of the western commonlands and willed herself still. &quot;Given with hate indeed&quot; she thought, mentally gritting her teeth as muscles more used to the cut and thrust of melee combat protested in painful cramps their enforced immobility.<br>
<br>
A kodiak bear lumbered slowly past, close enough for her to smell it scent, bestial and earthen. Better than the rotten putrescence of the undead tower where she had lain earlier she mused wryly.  The smell of decaying flesh still lingered in her nostrils, bringing back darker memories than she would like. The beast paused briefly some feet off to her left, it's nose catching some interesting scent adrift on the slight breeze, then moved on,<br>
intent upon business of its own.<br>
 <br>
Not for the first time, she wished that she could act in a more direct way to be the implement of the Fathers will, but she knew inside that was not her calling. No, the warrior's way of frontal combat delivered with unflinching violence would never suit her own peculiar temperaments.  Leave that to the elite bands of shock troops her old friend General Zirrix was at this very moment training in Nektulos with his usual brand of brutal discipline and cold logic.  Her way was the one less trodden, the way of the Shadows.  Yet still she had her part to play in other more global affairs.<br>
<br>
It was this that had brought her to this most unnatural position.  The troops that were in training were being prepared for another assault on the cursed isle of Faydwyer, against the very fastness of Felwithe itself. She knew herself than the assault would come soon - that was clear enough - though she did not know the date. And, more to the point, she was fairly sure that the enemies had a deal more knowledge of it than they should have. The spies that were a perennial nuisance to her homelands had grown more common of late, their skills and equipment better than was normal, and they seemed more focussed in their snooping.<br>
<br>
The long standing observation of the East Freeport docks by the assassins of the Ebon hand however had shown no change in the composition of the usual bands of riff raff that crossed the Ocean of Tears, and the on-again off-again relationship with elements of the Freeport Milita was providing no useful intelligence at the moment.  Anyway, Crieth was fairly sure from her own limited tactical knowledge that using a choke point such as the boats to Freeport was hardly a very likely way to get forces into Antonica.  No, any skilled oponent would use a different location entirely, or more exactly a different class of location.  One that was totally under it's control.  And the opponents of the Respected Race, cowardly and warped as they were, were not unskilled.<br>
<br>
As if to reinforce her thoughts, another group materialised amongst the dull olive stones, standing in conference for a moment, before setting off towards Freeport in loose formation. To the average eye, they were just another group of casual adventurers, in from who knows where, busy on businees of their <br>
own.  But to Crieth's eyes, something in their manner made them stand out, alike yet unalike the others.  Whether is be their dress, the almost too casual way in which they conferred before setting off, or the seemingly coordinated movement eastwards, Crieth knew there was more to this band than met the eye.<br>
<br>
Standing as quickly as her stiffened muscles allowed, she set off at a carefull pace behind them, activating the Circlet of Shadows as she stepped off. Disappearing from the sight of all but the most skilled in a soft rain of white sparkles, she followed them accross the grasslands like the shadow of hate that she was.<br>
