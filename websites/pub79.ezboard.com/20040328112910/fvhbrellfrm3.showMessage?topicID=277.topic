Trolls migrated from Innothule swamp by the thousands, and of course, the Leaders of Neriak would never turn away the formidable warriors.  With their regeneration and massive size, the Tier’dal would no doubt use the Homeless race as a standing army against their enemies.  This thought made Daiunus scowl openly, sending a younger Troll scampering away towards its mother, misunderstanding his disdain as one towards them, when instead it was for them, knowing his people would only use them for their purposes, giving the Homeless no pure cause to fight, such as he would given time.  He looked at the expressions of the Migrants, and saw only one emotion, that of hopelessness.  This did not discourage him however, for he knew, given time, the Homeless Race would soon learn to Hate those who stole their homes and killed their brothers.<br>
<br>
        He would send one of his Disciples down to the gates to hire some of these formidable Creatures as guards for the Grange.  He would pay, house and arm the warriors, as well as giving their families housing somewhere in the old servants’ quarters of the Grange.  Daiunus nodded and smiled to himself, he knew Innoruuk’s new calling would allow for this, for this treatment of non Tier’dal within the walls of Neriak.  He had been told, not by a voice, but by a dream.   He had been standing in the large antechamber of War within the Grange, no table to be seen, and the raised dais removed, leaving the room at one level.  Around him, standing in a circle had been many people, some he recognized and others he didn’t.  Some were Tier’dal, but not all, as was the case in the old days of the Violent Harvest.  To his left was Lyri, the druidess of the Harvest, who had forsaken Tunare to join the cause of Hate; to his right, an Iksar he did not recognize, he believed it to be one of the necromancers of the race.  Others in the circle were new to him as well, a female Barbarian, a shamaness, he knew from experience, although her hair was darker than that of Payle, one of the old members of the Harvest, although lost, Daiunus still felt a devotion to her as well.  He even had thought he had seen one of the foul Frogloks in the court, one of the race that had so recently dispelled the Trolls from their swamp.<br>
<br>
        The one thing he did understand from this vision, was that in the new Court of Hate, there would be no ruling race.  All who were touched by Innoruuk’s Might would be welcome for the Culling as equals to the once Chosen race.  That left many things to be done before he could face the man he betrayed.  The Thresher, for he wished to be called that once more, had betrayed his liege, Khasirath, and knew that a time of reckoning would be coming for the once-leader of the Violent Harvest.  Before Daiunus could lay down his arms and accept the Reaper’s judgement, he had to complete the calling to arms of the Grange.  Only then, would he sit and wait for the Reaper’s judgement, until that time, he would continue to avoid the city guard.<br>
<br>
        The Thresher knew his next step was to recall those he could find, he began setting letters to those who had served Innoruuk in the past.   Zirrix and Tzlar, the brothers who held more sway in Neriak than any two others he could think of;  Taelea and Vladire, both priestesses of great power to Innoruuk’s cause; Xareth and Faeolin, both whom were Dread Overlords within the Grange’s hierarchy; Nospiratus, the mad Prophet, who was known to be lost to Norrath’s world; Vresk, the once Ambassador to Hate from Cabalis; Pravdameer, the Prophet of Innoruuk; Katarinia, a chantress of no small power.  There were so many he would have to try to contact, and he knew most would not answer the call, but he would try.  <br>
<br>
        Daiunus continued drafting letters well into the night, he had remembered so many more since first sitting down to write.  Crieth, Natori, Vkos, Cynr, Sithmar, Safyran, Vinar, all of whom were essential to the growth and stability of the Harvest of old.  Some of whom had places of power within Neriak or the Grange, others who were more loyal than any other he could think of.  Soon, he would have them together, in one room, to speak of the coming glories of the Chosen.  The ones in his dreams would have to reach him another way, for he had no names to go with the faces shown to him by Innoruuk’s power.<br>
<br>
By morning, finished his letters to his closest friends and allies, he began the walk from his War room to his bedchamber.  As he was walking the hallways to his room, he saw down a staircase, four large Trolls being outfitted by Espion, who looked frazzled from trying to outfit the oversized warriors into gear that mostly were made for the comparably diminutive Tier’dal.  He smiled as he continued on towards his much deserved sleep, knowing that everything was going to work out in Innoruuk’s Favor.<br>
<br>
<br>
*** The letter sent to the former members of the Harvest***<br>
<br>
Dear ,<br>

He removed his helm and scratched his head, trying to recall things that where blured beyond what it is normal for him.  Unbridled rage welled in his throat as he struggled through the muddled memories and the like.  A halfling ran past him in a hurry to get information back to the group that had taken up an outpost in the forest.  <br>
<br>
The unfortunate creature never new what hit him as Tevesh grabbed him and crushed his skull with his forhead.  Licking the blood as it flowed over his lips, he tossed the lifeless body down to the ground as he made his way back into Neriak.<br>
<br>
He quickly moved past the Trolls in the foreign quarter, wondering through the muck in his mind...&quot;When where there so many of them here?&quot;  Shrugging he continued down, rushing to the third gate to check on his family, something told him it was necessary to check on things, to make sure no one screwed anything up worse then Khasirath did by leaving.  &quot;The house's Golden Boy my arse&quot; he muttered under his breath as he turned down a side passage that would lead in through the servents quarters into the compound.<br>
<br>
Movement in the shadows caught his eye, without thinking (not that anyone would be surprised) he brought a mailed fist down on the back of the Tier'Dal's head.  Reaching down he looked over the Tier'Dal's belongings. The only thing that seemed to interest him was the wound up scroll.  Opening it he sat down on the still breathing body of the unnamed Tier'Dal and started trying to read the scroll.<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later he finished the scroll.  Casually he looked down at the body and wondered if he would wake up.  He took the scroll and threw it back down onto the Tier'Dal.  &quot;Obviously he was going to deliver it to me.  Oh well, this saves him the trip.&quot; he thought to himself.  Kicking the body over so it could breathe he continued into the compound.<br>

<br>
Natori accepted the rolled parchment with a deep bow.  When Nilvenia made no move to leave the warrior's private chambers, Natori took it to be a sign that the house leader wished to know what the letter said.<br>
<br>
After reading the letter, Natori closed her eyes.  Memories of the last time she has seen any of them came flooding back to her.  She was so young then  The harvest was her family, her home.  They had essentially raised her from a whimsical teenager to a hardened warrior in the height of hate-filled battle.  Memories of Faeolin, the powerful but aging warrioress that had taken her under her wing, guiding her heart and her sword.  And now it was she, in Faeolin's shoes.  <br>
<br>
She opened her eyes and looked out of the window onto the courtyard below.  Several of the young of the house were practicing with their swords.  She noted with pride as they adjusted their hold on the weapons according to her teachings.  Turning away from the window, she again faced Nilvenia.  &quot;The Harvest reforms.  It requests the presense of all those that have served before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you answer that calling?&quot; Nilvenia asked, leaving warrior with the choice to leave, or to stay.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Harvest will always be my family, my brethren in arms.   My sword is theres whenever there is a battle to be faught, but this is my home now.   I stay with the House, m'lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I leave you then to form your response.&quot; the priestess turned and walked out.<br>
<br>
Natori sat to the spartan desk, and cleared aside a few training documents.  Staring at the blank parchment before her she sighed.  It was much more difficult to refuse the calling of the Harvest than she had indicated to Lady Nilvenia.  The Harvest was her family, it’s members her brothers, her sisters, and in a way, her parents.  She thought fondly back to days fighting beside her old companions.   They were the ones that helped make her the warrior she was.  They were the ones that stood beside her as she honed her skills.  How could she say no to Daiunus?<br>
<br>
She stared again out onto the courtyard, though her mind was elsewhere.   She recalled that with the Harvest, she was one of the few young ones amongst them.  The Harvest was aging.  There weren’t many young ones in that day ready to step up and take there place amongst the Harvest, none to continue the traditions once battle claimed the elder members.<br>
<br>
But here, in the House, the youth were many.  They needed guidance, they needed one that could help them to rise to the Hate of the Father.  Maybe one day, when they were ready, they would take their place in the Harvest, if there was one here to guide them. <br>
<br>
Daiunus would have to contend himself that in her own way, she to still served the Harvest, assuring that once the old died, or set aside their blades, there were youth to step up and replace them  Natori picked up the quill, and dipped it into the bottle of ink, firm in her decision to keep to her new calling.  <br>
<br>
An hour later, a long apologetic and explanatory letter sat drying before her, along with the promise that she would watch for any that showed promise that he or she would make a valuable asset to the Harvest.   <br>
<br>
After the letter dried, she sealed it with the wax impression of her new alliance and handed it to a messenger, along with a few gold pieces, to ensure it’s safe delivery to the grange.  Once the delivery girl had left, Natori strode down to the courtyard, and the waiting youth.<br>
<br>

As it often was when Knowledge was imparted on her, the fevered dream had been painful to her.  It was as if the information was burned into her memory, branded into her mind.  In her dream, she had seen a circle of unfamiliar people, united in a single purpose, the furthering of the cause of Innoruuk, the spreading of His Hatred through the lands.<br>
<br>
Her eyes had locked with one individual that she did recognize.   Daiunus, the dark figure that she had met at the Dragon of Hate.  For what seemed to be an eternity, she stared into his eyes.   Before her, his form changed, taking that of Innoruuk, and with a voice that seared painfully into her mind, he whispered, “It’s time.”  <br>
<br>
Before she could blink, before her again stood Daiunus, and the vision was done, leaving the young rogue alone in the vacant room of the inn.  After catching her breath, and restoring her disheveled appearance to something approaching orderly, Cearyn threw a few of her belongings into a travel pack.  With a coin purse visible in her hand, she approached the inkeep.  “I will be leaving today, but I wish to maintain my room here.  6 months of rent, as well as ample compensation to see that it is left untouched.  Soon, a list of those welcome to enter will reach you.  See to it that they are not bothered.”<br>
<br>
She knew the inkeep to be true to his dealings, and to be a man of great discretion.  It was this discretion that earned the man most of his profits, and the reputation for silence that he had earned was his most valuable asset in this business.<br>
<br>
Cearyn set a quick pace back to Neriak.  She knew, from the moment that she had met Daiunus that her fate was somehow to be tied to his.   She knew, when he spoke of the Harvest that her path would be entwined with it.  As soon as the words, “You will know,” left his tongue, she knew.  The dream-vision had only provided her with details for a knowledge that had come to her that day.<br>

Hovering just about the water’s surface she saw a face… a woman’s face, distorted by the shifting surface of the water.  Wrinn swam with determination, sensing that something important waited for her, with that woman.<br>
<br>
As she drew closer the woman reached down.  The distorted face smiled, and she spread her hand in the water, pressing it to Wrinn’s forehead… forcing her down.  Wrinn gasped in surprised, swallowing a mouthful of water, and feeling it burn into her lungs.  Suddenly, she panicked, aware of the air only inches above her head.  She clawed at the woman’s arm, trying to break free of her grasp.  She flailed with her left hand, upward, hoping to reach the woman’s face or throat.  Wishing she wasn’t naked… wishing she were armed.<br>
<br>
Her left arm met resistance, and she turned her head in surprise.  A Teir’dal male stared down at her, holding her left wrist in a grip of steel.  His fingers pressed into the bandages she wore wrapped around her left forearm to cover the spider web of scares that proclaimed her faith.  She stared up at him calmly, crouched, naked, on the floor at his feet within a large hall. She knew that she was somewhere in Neriak.  Around her, she sensed there were others… watching… ready.<br>
<br>
Without averting her eyes, she said calmly, “As the Father wills.”<br>
<br>
The Koada’dal’s eyes shot open, and she stared out of her window at the night sky.  She was filled with an immediate sense of urgency to return to Neriak without delay.  She rose and packed quickly, hurrying down the inn’s hallway.  The night quickly swallowed her as she moved through the streets of Freeport.<br>

Shaking her head, she pulled the lantern closer and read it again.<br>
<br>
The culling was returning?  She was needed.  Taelea couldn't believe it.  The Grange had been reopened.  She had only just ran by on her way to The Bauble a few weeks ago.  She had noticed a few windows open, but didn't have time to investigate.  She had assumed new renters had moved in.<br>

Taelea lifted the globe of the lantern, held the note against the flame and let it fall to a pile of ashes on the table.<br>

She considered her options.  The Harvest had been her home for so long.  There was no question she would be there to help whenever any of them needed her.  While Teir'Dal weren't known for lasting relationships, Taelea had taken for granted that the brotherhood would remain intact.  She had never considered that betrayal and deceit could destroy The Grange as it did.<br>
<br>
Her mouth turned up at the sides as she thought of spreading evil across Norrath again.  She had wandered aimlessly since The Grange had closed its doors.  She had still not established a home, even within Neriak.  The only refuge from the weak was inside the city gates.  Taelea frowned.  It seemed as if the lightbornes had always been a nuisance to her.  Constantly badgering her to fill their needs and desires without regard to her distaste for them.  The idea of slaying them all appealed to her, and she chuckled to herself.<br>
<br>
The Harvest had been her only refuge in days of old.  She had avoided such commitments until she talked with Mythral in Solusek's Eye that day long past.  He had told her of a group of Teir'Dal gathering for the spreading of Innoruuk's will.  The idea had appealed to her, and she had joined them for many seasons of training and battles.  There, she had found a brotherhood, a home in The Grange.  While there had been a slight set-back, pride could hopefully be restored and those of old brought back to glory with the culling continuing as it should.<br>
<br>
Taelea pulled a scroll from her bag and began to write:<br>
<br>
Daiunus,<br>
<br>
Your plea has not fallen unheard.  Innoruuk's word is not to be ignored by my insignificance.  I shall be at the side of those that wish to further the cause.<br>
<br>
Taelea<br>
<br>
She sealed the letter and began to gather her belongings into her packs for the journey home.  She would need to restock provisions and courier the letter to Daiunus.  Hopefully it would reach him before she did.  There was much to do.<br>
<br>
Taelea placed her hand over the globe of the lantern and smothered the flame.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So shall all the light in Norrath be dismissed.&quot;   <p>Taelea Malesano<br>

The only light came from the small crackling fire in the hearth. The figure sprawled in the wide expanse of the chair. The emerald gaze long since gone cold stared unseeing into the warmth of the flames. <br>
The missive fluttered unheeded to the floor from the slim pale fingers of her hand. &quot;So, they rebuild.. &quot; the words whispered softly as she turned from the fire and moved towards the center of the room. <br>
Dust kicked up as she walked. <br>
She had allowed no entrance into the inner sanctum, that had once been his office, since his disappearance so many moons back. As the months had progressed so had the chilling of her emotions. <br>
Daily now she cursed them all. Mortals and Gods alike for this new affliction to the soul. Now they wanted her back. She had no desire to leave the safety of her tower though. Yet curiousity ate at her soul. She would send an emmisary to deduce what was in the wind. <br>
A soft chanting cut through the silence of the room. Drowning out the chattering fire. Then a crack of thunder rent the stillness as a bright flash of light opened the portal. <br>
A tall stately woman stepped from the portal. Silver gaze cutting keenly through the darkness, as it returned to engulf the dying light of the portal. <br>
&quot;What is it now Chantress?&quot; The wizard hissed softly. She had no love for this creature. &quot;I've a task for you Sorceress.&quot; Was all Kat would say as she turned away from Grey. Oh she knew full well that Grey would gladely slice her wide open given the least provocation. She was however just as equally sure that at present she was something Grey needed. Once her usefullness to the Sorceress had passed however... <br>
<br>
Moving to the dust and paper strewn desk, Kat pulled a parchment from the mess and quickly wrote the instructions onto them as well as a brief message to the Thresher that would allow Grey entrance to the meeting. <br>
<br>
She turned and handed it to the Sorceress. &quot;Find out what you can and return to me. Inform Daiunus that though I will not at present leave the sanctity of my towers. I will instead send one in my steed should she prove of use to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
A delicate brow arched at the commands from the Chanteress. Grey rankled slightly at the orders, but nodded, her own curiousity peeked by the unfolding events. &quot;Very well.. &quot;<br>
<br>
She snatched the parchment from Kat and turned away, a brief wave of her hand brought light once more blindingly into the roomm She stepped through the summoned portal and vanished as it collapsed around her... <br>

Nasia looking down upon her <br>
latest victim and snarled in anger. Why was she so angry? Thinking back across her lonely history, she<br>
realizes she has always been angry. Leaving her home of Halas at an early age is not that uncommon. But<br>
the others always seem to come back to see their families and friends. I have no reason for that. No <br>
family, no friends save those select few that peeked my interest in these wilds. Could that be the reason?<br>
 Nay, she thought. If I had those pathetic things, I would just have left earlier if not slayed them. <br>
Forget the past, she thought, there is glory to be had. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp **snap** <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With all her powerful might and hatred, Nasia weaved a web of poisonous gas around her, knowing full<br>
well she can withstand the toxic poison. A crumpled form fell on to the hard rocky ground. A Tier'Dal? Slowly <br>
gasping for air, he spoke. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Nasia of Halas, there is a note for you from the Grange.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Grange, Nasia thought, where has she heard that before? Ahhh, there is a tale of one from her <br>
village named Payle who left for the Grange. From the unfavorable stories told in Halas, Nasia thought she was <br>
the only one worthy of her respect.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Help me!&quot;, cried the Tier'Dal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Don't worry small one, the poison will not last long. If you are strong enough, you will sur-&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Arggg....&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grinning evilly, Nasia chuckled. &quot;Perhaps you are not strong enough tiny Tier'Dal....pity. It must <br>
be why you were given this oh so important task of ~messenger~.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reaching down to the blistered and pox marked corpse of the Tier'Dal, she grasped the crumpled <br>
rolled parchment. <br>
<br>
*** The letter sent to the former members of the Harvest***<br>
Dear Nasia of Halas,<br>
<br>
The culling has returned, Innoruuk's word has reached me. You are being summoned to our mighty service from <br>
the Father. If you remember the visit you had as a child, you will have the answers you seek. Embrace Innoruuk's<br>
might.  Return to Innoruuk at haste, I await your arrival.<br>
<br>

<br>
*** The letter ends***<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A visit? Nasia started to swoon. &quot;Nay, the poison can affect me not.&quot;, thought Nasia. But alas, she slumbered.<br>
A vision of Halas and its cool waters. When crossing on the barge as a child, looking down into the waters. Another child<br>
shoved her deep. Failing to pull herself up from the cool depths, she started to slip further down. A light...burning<br>
in the waters. A dark face of nobility. The light...the fire...it is his eyes flaming with Hatred. Feeling the strength<br>
returning to her small body, Nasia swam for the barge. She exploded from the water surface and crawled to her knees <br>
gasping for breathe. The other barbarian child spoke, &quot;Nice swim, orphan?&quot; Hate fueled her mind. All is aflame.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon waking, Nasia remembered that fateful day as a child. The mood of the village was of sorrow. It was quite <br>
unfortunate the drowning of the barbarian child. Being from noble birth, a tragic day. No one blamed her. &quot;There there child,<br>
you just simply didn't have the strength.&quot; Grinning evilly, Nasia remembered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Let us see what answers this Daiunus Darkenvalor has for me.&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

**********************************************<br>
<br>
Pravdameer walked the catacombs of the Spires - deep within the bowels of the Holy Place. Places where only Regents of the Spires dared tread. Long ago he had been granted the title through much work on his part. Yes, it was with the help of his brothers and sisters within the Harvest that he succeeded in the quest given him. <br>
<br>
The Harvest. There was something he hadn't thought of in…well, in a very long time. He stopped a moment and tried to think of just how long it had been. He remembered well the disbanding of the Harvest - it's purpose having been fulfilled after all. After, he had hunted for a time, but had a feeling of loss within that he could not explain. That was why he had come back to the Spires - to immerse himself in the words of the Father. Days had turned into weeks, weeks became months, and months became years…but how many had it been?<br>
<br>
He began walking again muttering to himself as he went, with each word the flames within seemed to grow. Those he passed could hear not much, but from time to time one or two words could be made out.<br>
<br>
&quot;…Atoxus…&quot;<br>
&quot;…Nospiratus…&quot;<br>
&quot;…Harvest…&quot;<br>
&quot;…visions…&quot;<br>
&quot;…Khasirath…&quot;<br>
&quot;…betrayal…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Talking to yourself again, Pravdameer?&quot;<br>
Now there was a voice he hadn't heard in some time. Slowly he looked about until he saw the outline of the speaker's form. &quot;You.&quot; His eyes burned with the fires of hate. &quot;You have the gall to come to me after what you've put me through?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I put you through? You did it to yourself…child.&quot; The figure smirked as he saw the cleric react to the words. &quot;I see the Father's Gift still burns within you. Good. You will need it in the days to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young priest gritted his teeth and said very softly, &quot;And why is that? Do you really think I would still jump to your beck and call like some trained pup?&quot;<br>
<br>
Atoxus laughed a deep and hearty laugh as the priest spoke. &quot;I'll tell you what I think - I think you know me for what I am, and you know who sent me, so you will do what I tell you to do when I tell you He wants it to be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cleric glared at the messenger. That was all Atoxus needed to continue. &quot;The Father has a new task for me, Pravdameer - I must tend to another soul. I will be visiting from time to time, but not as often as before. Before I leave, however, there is one last gift of the Father I have for you.&quot; With those words, he slowly reached his hand out towards the priest's head. As the hand touched Pravdameer's skin it continued moving in, and Pravdameer began to scream - a bloodcurdling scream that brought all within the spires to a halt. &quot;This is my last gift to you, Pravdameer - may the visions serve you well.&quot; That was the last thing he remembered before it all went black.<br>
<br>
A time later, he awoke. He felt hung over, as if he had been drinking for…for…for a long time. He looked about trying to focus on the things about him and realized he was no longer in the catacombs. He was in the upper levels of the Spires. Then he noticed a letter on the bedstand. He instantly recognized the seal and considered leaving it closed. He knew what was inside - he knew what it meant. He closed his eyes to consider his path, and the vision slammed into him. He fell back to the bed, his whole body twitching as the images washed over him. As the visions finally subsided, he reached over, grabbed a bottle of wine, and drank almost all of it down in one swallow. He looked back at the letter with hate in his eyes, and picked it up breaking the seal. As he read the letter, it confirmed what the visions had told him.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
Dear Pravdameer,<br>
<br>
The culling has returned, Innoruuk's word has reached me, and I am sure you know what I mean by this, for you have no doubt had something of the vision as well. The Grange has opened, and I dwell inside. Return to Innoruuk at haste, I await your arrival.<br>

Indeed, he did now know what Daiunus meant by this. He picked up what belongings he had, and left the Spires to return to his home - the Grange.<br>

Cursing the dampness in the air, she bent her limbs.  First one leg, then the other, her arms next.  Finally satisified that pain would not shoot the length of her body when she made to get up, she arose from her bed.  <br>
<br>
Kicking one of the many empty liquor bottles that were strewn about her bedchamber, she hobbled to her window.  Looking out over the commons of Neriak, she started to once again see the braziers burning in the Grange.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So it was not the liquor, that interrupted my rest.&quot; she mused to herself.  &quot;Some damnable fool has taken it upon themselves to rouse up even denser fools.&quot;<br>
<br>
A fit of laughter, degenerating into a bloody cough shook her for some time.  Finally satisfied that a tottering walk could be maintained, she headed off to the wine celler for another dose of forgetfulness.<br>

OOC: While I would love to be able to join you all again in Norrath, It isn't going to be possible for some time yet....If at all.  I wish you all the best, and I will certainly check in to ensure that things are under control. <br>
<br>
Faeolin on the other hand, is steadily growing more bitter.  Perhaps it's the frustrations of  her mounting age, or the lack of success at finding that mythical &quot;potion of youth.&quot;  Whichever it is, memories can be a painful thing.  Especially if that's all that one has to hold on to.  I think in the coming weeks though, she might not be too opposed to taking a little trip to see what has become of the Grange.  She was always to curious for her own good. <br>
