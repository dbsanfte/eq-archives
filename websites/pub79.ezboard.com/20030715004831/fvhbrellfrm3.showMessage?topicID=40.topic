Winnower of the Harvest<br>

<br>
The Mist ... Pondered<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Selilya sat up with a start. It was dark save for the last glowing embers in the fireplace. The cold sweat seem to chill her body despite the bearskin coverings on the bed .... and .... him ....<br>
<br>
She smiled and bent over to kiss her new husband. His heavy, regular breaths indicated a most peaceful sleep. It had been a long, grueling day, first gathering everything for the Bonding Ceremony, arrival of guests, arranging the drink and food, the nerve-wracking march down the fallen log towards her betrothed, Ernseax, and the waiting Prophet and Priest Nospiratus, the realization that she was being taken against her will, the swirling mists enveloping her, the blackness, then a revival, then the vows and cheers and merriment...followed by the seemingly long trip to Selilya's cottage. He tended to her wounds...the bump on her head she suffered as she lost consciousness when the poison overcame her, the ragged cut on her left arm that had mysteriously appeared during the forced teleportation <br>
from the wedding site to the bowels of her captors' lair, and the raw scrape on her calf that could only have been the results of falling over some loose stones near the jail cells in Najena. For such a brash, rough warrior, he had been so very tender....<br>
<br>
Selilya slipped out from under the covers and made her way to her table, grabbing a tiny piece of kindling from the fireplace to light the lantern. The light illuminated her nude body and she paused as she saw her reflection in the looking glass. She could see the bandage on her arm that Ernseax had so carefully wrapped. It still throbbed. She leaned forward and touched her swollen temple... <br>
<br>
&quot;It is good to be alive,&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;It was very close, though, very close.&quot; She reached over to her sitting chair, picking up her favorite robe, and pulled<br>
it around herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;The questions....Who was behind this? What does he want? Why? They are just too many,&quot; she mused. &quot;Indeed, this is like peering through the mist. I just know this, I cannot let them hurt those I care about. I must...make provision...&quot;<br>
<br>
She walked over to the wooden crate by the bed and lifted out several of the ancient scrolls she had been studying. The works of Miragul fascinated Selilya, especially the memoirs concerning his experiments...the ones right before the end...before he was driven away from everything...even life itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was so close...I know he was,&quot; she told herself. &quot;Life eternal was within his reach... The answer is here...it's here somewhere. What did he miss? I must find out. The experiments...these experiments...&quot;<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes briefly to relieve the pressure that seemed to explode in her forehead. She sat still for minutes until she no longer felt dizzy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that I have the help of the medical arts...perhaps it is time to acquire the first....uh....specimen. The first component...sheer strength he wrote,&quot; she was quietly muttering to herself. She gazed off into the night....<br>
<br>
&quot;McMad.&quot;<br>
<br>
She quietly laughed. She heard Ernseax cough and turned her head to look at him. The feelings of love and desire quickly overtook her thoughts of eternal life....<br>
<br>
She leaned over to the lantern and extinguished that flame. The robe dropped to the floor and she slipped back under the bed covers once again. <br>

Nospiratus<br>
The Mad Prophet<br>

Re: The Mist ... Pondered<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Swirling, flowing like a river, surging like the surf, it surrounded him with its cold, damp touch. A wind smelling of fetid death created eddies in its backlit gloom, and where it drifted apart, he saw the shades of those he had learned to call his family. The Harvest, sucked from its mission of transformation to dwell as wraiths in the embrace of unending fog.<br>
<br>
He ran. He ran not in fear, but in desperation. He sought answers to questions that formed on the lips of his friends. Who has done this to me? Why have they done this to me? What have they done to me? Questions echoed in his mind, but he had no answers. He needed time! he had none. The first strike had fallen against the harvest, and it had not been the Templars that had made it, nor any other Lightborn foe.<br>
<br>
The Priest in the Temple had read the spirit-essence on the coins - blood money from Mistmoore. Neriak's ancient enemies, the heretical following of Mayong - they had struck against the Harvest and opened a war. But to what end? Questions everywhere, yet answers were few.<br>
<br>
Before him a dark figure appeared as a shadow in teh gloom, his form shifting, in and out of focus. A flash of blue, a shimmer of gold metal, then piercing blue eyes. He had seen those eyes before, but where? The figure was not a man, it was wraitlike, yet corporeal. The Mistwraith!<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done to the Harvest?&quot; he shouted. His voice was choked by fog. The Mistwraith stood still, and the shroud thickened into a tentacle of death, gliding toward him. He stepped back, but the fog congealed about him, and he was frozen, unable to act! In horror he watched as the mist moved forward like an animate serpent, slithering through the gray, seeking to enter his body, mind and soul. He felt the hate begin to leech as he watched in horror, he felt his mind begin to numb from the chill. The eyes, the familiar blue eyes, looked on in sorrow.<br>
<br>
*** *** ***<br>
<br>
Nospiratus awoke, chilled to the bone and exhausted from the dream. He was alive, he lay in his own room in the Temple, surrounded by the things that denoted his life. Nothing had changed, there was no mist. He was in Neriak, where no enemy could reach. And yet, the urgency faded not. Quickly tugging on his breeches and tunic, he grabbed the Caddecus and bolted form the room. He ran with such urgency that the guards aseembled at the gates to guard his flank, alert for yet another aborted attempt by the Lightborn to assault the Third Gate. Past the Library he ran, and over the bridge to the Grange of the Harvest. Beyond the Office of the Reaper, the books fo the Dead Arts a final testimony to the faith of Ixtab, and down the hall to the elaborate quarters of the Harvest's Winnower. Finally, he slowed, and summoned the power of Hate to eliminate his fatigue and calm his breath. He must speak to the Winnower - they had to act, the message was clear.<br>
<br>
Captain Vesin J'Axx, master fo teh Guardians of the Grange, stood vigil at the door with three others from his devoted company. As Nospiratus approached, all four stiffened to formal attention and snapped a salute, then dropped to a knee in humility before the Mad Prophet of Hate.<br>
<br>
Nospiratus was in too much of a hurry to argue over such a show of deference that he felt was entirely undeserved. Instead, he raised the Captain by his mailed shoulders and said, &quot;I need to speak to Selilya, let me pass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vesin smiled slowly, a smirk lifting one corner of his mustached lip. &quot;Well Lord Prophet, I, um... I don't think she is ready to see you at the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is urgent Captain,&quot; Nospiratus blundered on, &quot;of the utmost urgency for the Harvest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Prophet, I am certain it is, but I believe the happy groom is learning the price of husanding the Winnower. We should know in a day or so if he is to live or die by the test of the Black Widow.&quot;<br>
<br>
At last it sank in, and Nospiratus sighed. Shaking his head slowly he said, &quot;Priorities of some people.&quot; Two of the guards began to chuckle, while the Captain and the other maintained barely supressed grins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Lord Prophet, as you said.&quot; Vesin replied almost sincerely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess that can't be helped. Just make sure you tell her that we must speak, as soon as she emerges.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Captain saluted once more and replied, &quot;You have my word Prophet. As soon as she emerges, she will be so informed. It may be some time yet.&quot; The Captain's eyes twinkled as he spoke, but Nospiratus was in no mood for frivolity. Nodding once, he worked his way back toward the Temple. Once as he crossed the bridge, he thought he heared the moaning of a cold wind, and he looked about for the fog that was not yet, the Mist that could not be allowed to be. Alone, filled with the warning his Master had placed in his dreams, he returned to study the Prophecies of Hate.  <br>
