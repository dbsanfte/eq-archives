The Wicked Crown</span><hr size=1> This is a details post mostly, Natori, feel free to add in anything I've forgotten, or that you think would make for more interesting roleplay.<br>
<br>
About a score of years ago, a young Teir'Dal named Arturious was walking about Neriak. Arturious, by far one of the most intelligent Mages of his time, had one goal in mind: To Learn Everything possible. Unfortunately during his studies, he learned of the Queen's weakness in her political affairs.<br>
<br>
He was going to change this and so was born &quot;The Wicked Crown&quot; so named for their goal, to remove the queen of her power and to give this power to the people and serfs of Neriak. Everyone that supported his cause was allowed into his ranks. They were originally intended to be a peaceful takeover, however...everything changed when he enlisted the help of Faranor, a Human Druid.<br>
<br>
Faranor surpassed everyone in power and intelligence. His intelligence was rumored to rival even Arturious himself. <br>
He quickly moved through rank and was soon commissioned as Arturious's most trusted confidant. <br>
<br>
Choosing to retire, leaving everything in Faranor's capable hands, Arturious settled down with his lovely wife Daarkangel, knowing that his take over would soon be complete..for he already had almost all the magistrates, viziers and other senators supporting his cause...only a few remained loyal to the Queen...and the biggest supporter of the queen was Ambassador Rylan.<br>
<br>
Rylan was a stubborn man, wise and intelligent as is evident in his daughter Natori. Rylan had but 2 weaknesses, wine..and women. Rylan's first wife (Natori's mother) left him. But, she did one favor, she appointed Rylan as her Ambassador. The Queen was Rylans first wife (Natori to this day is unaware of this) She only has a recollection of her step mother, the one that was murdered. If Arturious was to take over the throne, Rylan would have to be removed (only Rylan knows that Natori is actually the princess) But try as he could, there was no peaceful way to sway Rylan. Arturious left that to Faranor.<br>
<br>
Faranor had a different c hildhood. He was abused in every possible way you could think of. This left his mind in chaos. His only saving grace was his exceptional genius. He found order in the chaos that was his mind. And he put this order to use. Forming the Wicked Crown into a darker faction..one that had many a hand in many assassinations of other political powerhouses. Faranor would take Neriak by force.<br>
Basing his operations in the sub-levels of Neriak, even below the sewers...Faranor used Arturious's great wealth to buy and train troops and equipment.<br>
<br>
Finally the day came for The Wicked Crown to take power to give to the people. Thinking himself the saviour of Neriak, Faranor ordered the assassination of Rylan. One of his members though, a Teir'Dal...did not stand for this. He ran off to warn the Queen of the imminent danger, the queen AND Rylan, but Faranor had his people trained well. And with ease, they caught up to the youth, and ended his life permanently.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the deed had been done, one of the 3 that chased the youth heard a sound...a strange clatter followed by a curse, turning slowly he took note of another Teir'Dal, a priest it seemed, who may or may not have witnessed the slaying, he nodded to the others around him, and they disappeared into the shadows, ready for a double-homicide. Keeping his gaze, he near mezmerized the priest, but the priest's defenses broke free shortly after...too soon, the priest began to run and the knife missed it's mark, striking the priest's side, not his heart. They had no time to waste, and did not chase the priest for long, they moved forward to their rendezvous for the assassination of Rylan, and the queen if she did not step down. There would be no surviving supporters, even the child, the daughter of Rylan, had to be slain, for she was a possible witness and liable to mess things up for Faranor. <br>
<br>
They were to poison Rylan within the hour and slit the girls' throat...both were said to be seen in the Maiden's Fancy....they waited, then made their move..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/udarkrayne2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkrayne2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Harvester</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 6:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detail regarding the Underground A.K.A.
