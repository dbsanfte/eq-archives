It was getting quite late; the Council meeting had gone on much longer than anticipated. Drellan was very vocal about the necessity of assaulting the walls of Freeport. The people liked him and he had a few supporters among the officers, but the bulk of the officers felt that it would be unwise. Neriak was still recovering from civil war and the siege of Castle Mistmoore. Drellan said that they must attack soon, the Humans had learned of their troubles and might perceive them as vulnerable. He believed that a show of force now would keep the Humans in their place. Khasirath and most of the others at the meeting felt that an attack now would incite a response, and in their weakened state it might prove disastrous. <br>
<br>
Drellan was a formidable warrior. He had proved his prowess on the battlefield numerous times. He rose to officer status in record time, and he was expected to continue rising in rank and authority. His comrades were loyal to him and trusted his judgment in combat. Even though he was a young junior officer, he had more influence then many elders, perhaps because he was in the public eye so often. Drellan was born to a House of middling power, and the Reaper could only imagine how Matron K`Riev must be pinning the future conquests of her House on the young officers shoulders. <br>
<br>
Khasirath felt that what Drellan possessed on the battlefield was offset by a lack of foresight. He was an asset to short term tactics, but he should not be allowed to participate in long-term strategy. When the meeting continued the next morning, the Reaper expected to see General Zirrix transferring Drellan to a distant assignment until he grew in wisdom. It may lead to a minor scandal, but the people would soon forget. <br>
<br>
Obsessed with his planned assault, and frustrated at the cool response from his superiors, Drellan sought the support of the Noble Houses to force the Army to act. This is why he had followed the Reaper from the Council meeting, to try to get the vote of House S`Therik behind the march on Freeport. Again, a show of Drellans lack of foresight, thought Khasirath. House S`Therik was very old and powerful among the Noble Houses. But it was a grim and silent power. Khasirath's House rarely voted on the Council, except in matters of great import. Had he thought it through, the young Lieutenant would have saved his breath and spent his short time in garnering favor with the younger, more vocal Houses. <br>
<br>
Drellan continued to repeat his opinions to Khasirath as the pair of them approached the bone gates of the Reaper's estate. The skeletal warriors guarding the gates acknowledged Khasirath's approach with a mechanical salute. Khasirath was about to forcibly dismiss Drellan when something caught his eye. A cloaked figure pulling a handcart was slowly squeaking towards them. Drellan finally shut his mouth when he noticed that Khasirath was fixated on the figure, and then they both watched silently as it approached. The figure wheeled its cart right up to Khasirath and stopped. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dark tidings, Reaper,&quot; said an old, coarse, woman's voice. Khasirath could not see her face beneath her hood, except for her discolored, crooked smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it you want, crone?&quot; demanded Drellan, but the old woman continued to address Khasirath. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have brought something for you...&quot; She tipped the cart back until a naked Human male came tumbling out from beneath a blanket. The Human moved slowly and groaned quietly as he curled into a ball on the street. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is the meaning of this? Who is this Human?&quot; said Khasirath while Drellan nodded his head beside him. <br>
<br>
&quot;You may call him Artillius... and you are to train him as a ShadowKnight,&quot; said the woman matter-of-factly. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard quite enough already,&quot; said Drellan, &quot;We shall see what the Magistrate thinks of your jokes.&quot; He roughly grabbed the woman by her shoulders to carry her off, but it was at that instant that the Human's eyes popped open and he sprang to his feet. The Human clutched Drellan's helm with both hands, and a dark aura encompassed the Lieutenant's head, followed by a brief flash of light and crack of thunder. Drellan screamed in agony before collapsing to the ground. Blood streamed from his eyes, ears, and nose. Wisps of smoke drifted from his hair. Drellan's face was permanently twisted in a grotesque expression of pain. <br>
<br>
The sudden death of the Lieutenant was surprising enough, but Khasirath was even more intrigued by the fact that his Houses guards made no motion at all to attack the Human. They stood on guard as if nothing had happened. Instinctively Khasirath could feel that his conduit to the Father's Hatred, that place from which he drew the Father's Touch, was closed. He could not draw from that gift at that moment, a clear and chilling message from Innoruuk. The Reaper studied the Human more closely, wondering what the Will had in store for this one. The Human crouched down next to the old woman. and drew in his arms and shuddered slightly as if chilled, despite the warmth from the geothermal heated lake that House S`Therik crouched on the shore of. <br>
<br>
Khasirath looked up at the robed woman. &quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked. <br>
<br>
A wind blew through the street billowing her cloak. The old woman grinned and lifted her chin up. Shadows still filled her hood, but Khasirath could see that her eyes were twin globes of fire. &quot;We have met before, and we will meet again.&quot; The commanding tone of her voice was clear. &quot;Train Artillius as a Shadow Knight. If he is disobedient then you may punish him, but do not kill him. I have plans for him later.&quot; She looked down at the Human and told him, &quot;This is your new master, do as he says.&quot; Artillius glanced at Khasirath then looked up at the old woman. After a short pause the woman spoke again, &quot;No Artillius, you will not be punished for killing Drellan.He was a fool and he could have ruined everything.&quot; Then the old woman turned away and began dragging her cart into the darkness. Khasirath was perplexed over the events he just witnessed, and yet keenly interested. Why a Human? Why must he do the training? He watched the crone's silhouette blend in with the shadows in the distance. <br>
<br>
The pounding of mailed boots from the courtyard of Khasirath's estate echoed in the caverns of Neriak. Several soldiers and servants came rushing up to the gates from within. They saw the crouching human, the body of Drellan, and the First Son of the House standing over them calmly. They asked if he was alright and what had happened. Khasirath instructed them to take Drellan's body inside and to take the Human into a chamber in the sub-basement and shackle him; he would decide what to do in the morning. The servants and soldiers did his bidding without further question. <br>
<br>
Khasirath was awakened unusually early the following morning by one of his servants with an urgent missive. Frowning as he stood there in his dressing robe, he broke the seal on the letter and read it while Dythos waited for his response quietly in the corner. The message was from Captain T`Vek of the Imperial Guard. It called for the immediate arrest of Drellan. The Imperial Guard had been seeking him out since very early this morning. Since he was last seen leaving the meeting with Khasirath they thought he might know his whereabouts. It seemed that evidence had been discovered that showed Drellan to be a traitor. He was planning to lead the Teir'Dal into an ambush arranged by Humans. Khasirath set down the letter and sighed. He looked towards his servant and spoke, &quot;Have the traitors body delivered to Captain T`Vek. Tell him that House S`Therik is pleased to present him with this gift, for the security and glory of the Empire.&quot; The servant nodded and was about to leave when Khasirath stopped him with a gesture. &quot;Also, have the Human, Artillius, brought to the courtyard. Issue him a wooden sword. I wish to observe his fighting skills.&quot; Dythos bowed deeply and dashed out the door. Khasirath crossed his room to stand before his personal altar and wondered what the Father had in store for him. <br>
<br>

Well met Harvest,<br>
<br>
Artillius is currently a level 29 Human Shadow Knight of Innoruuk. He is willing to serve his Teir'Dal masters faithfully. I look forward to speaking with you further.<br>
