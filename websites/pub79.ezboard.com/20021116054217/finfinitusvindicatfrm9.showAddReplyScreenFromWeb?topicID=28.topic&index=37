<br>
The Death Penalty is no more a deterrent to future crimes than life sentences.  The punishment in a crime of this severity is not going to affect the statistics.  Someone who has made a conscious decision to kill someone is beyond worrying about what may happen to him if he's caught.  If he's concerned about it, he simply will not commit the crime.  In the case of an 'accidental' shooting (ie, someone robbing a store and shooting the clerk) isn't given time to make a decision about a killing, they simply react to whatever happens which causes them to pull the trigger.  In one case you have someone beyond caring what happens if he gets caught (as he's convinced he won't be) and in the other, you have someone who never truly intended to shoot someone, and therefore never considered the consequences.  (side note- this obiviously assumes in both cases the individual is monumentally stupid- which murdering someone and robbing a store with a loaded gun without intending to use it, makes you)  In short, the consequences never enter the planning stage, therefore, will not deter the person from commiting the act.  The person who does NOT act on their desire isn't afraid of the punishment, they're afraid of being caught (as has been stated already).<br>
<br>
Now...  to the system itself.  We all know the system is flawed, but it's a question of if it's chronically flawed or simply imperfect.  It's all well and good saying there's something wrong, but unless you can actively offer a suggestion for change, pointing at something and yelling 'it's broke' doesn't repair it.  The legal system should be revamped in some way, but I won't pretend to have the answers.  For now we must support the system in place until we have the technology or the moral ability to remove the possibility of deciet.  So long as man CAN lie, he will lie, is my opinion.  And so long as we have a system of determining guilt which involves people getting paid, everyone involved will do whatever they must to win.  If a defense attorney makes more money by the more people he is able to get a jury to say 'innocent' to, you can rest assured that attorney will skirt the law and moralily for as long as he can to the Nth degree.  <br>
<br>
Now, that's a buncha paragraphs stating the blindingly obvious.  Here's my opinion- Until and unless the system can be made flawless, we must trust percentages.  There will always be a chance someone who is innocent will be convicted of a crime, and this is simply part of the statistics in my opinion.  People who commit violent crimes deserve to be removed from society, and from the standpoint of expense, death will always be cheaper.  (And I've seen statistics which claim killing someone is more expensive than keeping them in prison for life...  and I beg of you, don't spout them back at me- there is nothing you'll ever show me which makes me believe that)  Killing someone for murder is punishment, plain and simple, and nothing more.  It will not stop someone else from commiting a similar crime.  So, for now, if we have no way to remove the possibility of an innocent person being put to death for a crime he didn't commit, then I say that's a risk we're all going to have to take.  Better that than to suggest a serial killer or murderer of children should be fed, clothed, and housed on my hard earned tax dollar.<br>

Hopefully, you look up here, cause I can't seem to reply anymore...  Anyway, yes, essentially that's what I'm saying- it's not the fear of death which stops someone from commiting Murder.  Look at the numbers, Murders happen more frequently in states with death penalties as in states which have no death penalty.  It's not the fear of the punishment, it's the fear of getting caught.  <br>
<br>
Once you have made a conscious decision to kill another human being, you're beyond consequences, and likely fully convinced you're going to get away with it.  The punishment is not the deterrent, it's the possibility of not getting away with it.  Honestly, is there any difference between Death and Life in Prison?  Personally, I'd see a life sentence as a FAR worse punishment, but that is neither here nor there.  My point here is I support the death penalty insofar as a solution to prison overcrowding, but do not agree with it as a deterrent to future crimes (unless of course, you're talking about the condemned, he certainly won't be commiting any more).  <br>

<br>
So your arguement is that the type punishment is not a deterrent, only the &quot;getting caught&quot; is?  Assuming I understand correctly what you are saying . . . <br>
<br>
We should give all criminals a slap on the wrist, and not jail time.  After all, the punishment doesn't act as a deterrent, right?  Imagine how much money we would save in prisons!<br>
<br>
Are you really willing to say that NO ONE(that is, ZERO people) chose not to commit murder due to the additional penalty?  There was never any violent criminal, that stopped short of killing and only beat someone, because they were afraid of the death penalty?  I find that almost impossible to believe.<br>

totally arbitrary, made up statistics:<br>
people that drink milk from cartons average lifespan: 52 years.<br>
people that drink milk from a glass average lifespan: 66 years.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: drinking from a glass is more healthy than drinking from the carton.<br>
<br>
Things not taken into account:<br>
Other dietery concerns (this should have an obvious effect)<br>
sex (females live longer on average; men prolly drink straight from the carton more often)<br>
reason for death (maybe people had car accidents, or died in a plane crash)<br>
economic factors<br>
general health (did they exercise, etc) <p></br>

100 people get murdered in state A..<br>
200 people get murdered in state B..<br>
<br>
No matter how you twist and turn the numbers... the fact remains... 100 more people died in State B than in A.<br>

This is the problem with using statistics - you can't account for all variables in anything resembling a simple model.<br>
<br>
For instance, 100% of the population that ate carrots in 1739 are now dead.<br>
<br>
What does this mean?  Not a damn thing.  Because it focuses on one factor, that, in this case, is immaterial.  Eating carrots isn't material at all. <p></br>

I don't see the death penalty as a deterent, it's punishment.  I assure you that Ted Bundy didn't consider the laws of various states when he commited his crimes (and Ted was a law school student, and at one time seen as a protege) <br>
<br>
Charles Manson comes up for parole every so often, it's scary that he could actually get out, if the circumstances were right.<br>

We have executed innocents, as we have jailed innocents as well.  That's a sad reality, that we will never be able to correct.  <br>

I agree with the death penalty, but like our legal system in general, the process is the problem. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18533>Sister Maddie Faye</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/usapiens1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sapiens1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/7/02 11:27:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/finfinitusvindicatfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Capital Punishment</span><hr size=1> So... how many people here claim that executing an innocent man is acceptable?<br>
<br>
And don't tell me that it doesn;t happen cause it has happened, It does happend and it will happen.<br>
<br>
What would you say to the kids of a man that was innocent yet executed?  &quot;Oh we killed him to save money cause keeping him in jail for the past 20 years would have cost more than killing him...&quot;?<br>
<br>
Pick a state and i bet i can find at least 1 case of an innocent men that was executed.  The problem is that once executed the interest in proving his innocence wanes, and the resources and efforts move towards tryingt o save someone else.<br>

A direct comparison, if you will.<br>
<br>
So... how many people here claim that imprisoning an innocent man is acceptable?  No one, right?  Well, lets do away with prisons then!<br>
<br>
The system is NOT perfect.  Mistakes DO happen, regretably.  I challenge you to propose something better, though.<br>

<br>
Innocent person in jail for life... can be released...<br>
Innocent person put to deah... Is worm food.<br>
<br>
<br>
And while being in jail while innocent is bad and to some might be worse than death.. I'm pretty sure that most would prefer to live with chance of saome day being pardone or evidence showing they were innocent all along.<br>
<br>
If you are innocent and you have kids.. you prefer to be able to se ethem once a year growing up.. talking to them, maybe livign vicariously thru them... and the kids, while they migth prefer to have their parent int heir life everyday... probably would prefer to be able to talk to him on the phone and visiting every so often.. rather than not at all...<br>

<br>
a.  innocent man imprisoned for life<br>
b.  innocent man executed<br>
<br>
By that standard, A is ok, but B is not.  imo, neither is ok.<br>
