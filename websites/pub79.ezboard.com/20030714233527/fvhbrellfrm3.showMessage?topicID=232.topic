Faeolin tells the guild, 'Truthfully, I do not know if I am worthy to join you all on your hunt.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'What?? What have you done with the real Faeolin?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '....I was......'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I was found lacking yestereve, when facing the Father'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*lowers her head in shame*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*calms down*  That'ss funny, Overlord.  Now come join uss.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'To face the Father's greatest test is not easy, Dread Overlord. You were returned to us, so ye are worthy enough.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*levels a gaze directly into the Iksars eyes*  There is no humor in that, Ambassador'<br>
<br>

<br>
Shintenshi tells the guild, '*from the shadows jade sparks illuminate the form of a dark knight whose steps are firm, steady, and strong*'<br>
Shintenshi tells the guild, 'Hail....'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, '*nods in greeting to Shintenshi*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Dark tidingss, Shintenshi.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*tastes the wind*  No, not him either. *ponders*'<br>
<br>

<br>
Vresk says, 'Thank you, Matron.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Honorable memberss of the Harvesst should not act in ssuch an embarasssing manner.'<br>
Shaede says, 'Some of us are not welcome in the Grange or Neriak...'<br>
Vresk says, 'How doess thiss conccern me?  Or your Housse, which you've sseen fit to desstroy for that matter?'<br>
Shaede says, 'Since you seem to have expectations of how a condemned woman should behave.'<br>
Shaede says, 'And Vresk...'<br>
Shaede says, 'If my actions did not please the Father, how then did I survive the ritual?'<br>
Vresk says, 'Shaede, I'm going to be honesst with you.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I know nothing of which you sspeak.'<br>
Vresk says, 'I know not the exsact reasson the Prophet feelss you have doomed your Housse.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Thesse thingss are, Neriak bussinesss only, and ssincce they do not involve Cabiliss, I really don't care.'<br>
Shaede says, 'And yet you accept me as condemned?'<br>
Shaede says, 'And blame me for the 'Dooming' of my house?'<br>
Vresk says, 'I trusst the Prophet'ss assssesssment on the ssituation.'<br>
Shaede says, 'He is a drunkard.'<br>
Vresk says, 'My actionss derive from thingss I do know, Shaede.'<br>
Vresk says, 'And you are not acting like a Chossen should.'<br>
Shaede says, 'I can do nothing to counteract the words of the Mad One'<br>
Vresk says, 'Rather, you are acting like Na`Verdiss did, back when she wass sstill pretending she wass sstill a Chossen.'<br>
Shaede says, 'If he decides I should die the Harvest will follow through with it.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Yet even Kasssy hass deccided that sslinking around, crying and moping all the time iss no way to act.'<br>
Shaede says, 'Forgive me for not acting as 'I should''<br>
Vresk says, 'Again, thiss issn't a Harvesst issue.  You have been accussed of breaking the law.  Lasst I ssaw the Harvesst wass not the Queen'ss policce forcce.'<br>
Khasirath says, 'It is not the Prophet who makes such decisions, Matron. Ye should know that.'<br>
Vresk says, 'Act as you wish, Matron.  I jusst don't have to watch or resspect you for it.'<br>
Shaede says, 'You are correct...He does not make such political decisions.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Vresk, as ambassador to Cabilis I request sanctuary from Neriak and the agents of the King and Queen'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*blinks*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'On what groundss do you claim thiss?'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, 'hrm...'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'On the grounds of religious persecution'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*nearly chokes*  Religiouss perssecution?!'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Do ye intend to run from your problems yet again, Shaede? I thought ye had left that part of yourself far in the past.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*blinks* You are claiming ssanctuary for believing in the power of Lord Cazic Thule?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'The attempted purification of Neriak from the followers of Cazic Thule...The Religion of Cabilis'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, '*forms into a swirl of shadows and blends in with the background*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*begins to say no*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*thinks about it*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*sigh*'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Lowers a threatening gaze to the Reaper*'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, '*watches Shaede in stony silence, dispassionately*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*frowns*'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Khasirath I am not running, nor will I allow myself and my house to be burned by a witch hunt brought upon by a drunkard who claims visions.'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, '*chokes dagger up on hilt*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'The politicss of Neriak are not my conccern, Matron, you put me in a very delicate ssituation.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*turns and walks away from the scene, her eyes still downcast*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'By law, I am required to exstend you ssanctuary until I can ssend word to Cabiliss for direction...'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye have sworn oaths, Matron. Oaths which bind your body and soul and blood and House to the father. Innoruuk Himself shall punish such a betrayal, should ye carry it out.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Reaper, I musst requesst you cceasse your threatening Shaede.  She iss now under the Protection of Cabiliss until further noticce.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*looks guilty a moment*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I am ssorry, my Reaper.'<br>
Shintenshi tells the guild, '*watches.*'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, '*narrows his eyes* Pray the Father is more forgiving, Ambassador.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Shaede, you DO realize that thiss meanss banishment.  PERMANENT banishment for you and your Housse?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'You throw away your last chance for redemption, Dread Lord.'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'you are being premature Shaede'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*stops and says over her shoulder* The punishment for this act is death'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And ssuch would be war, Faeolin.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Permanent extinction of house and name'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*frowns*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I know well, the consequences of the Matrons actions'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'She belongss to Cabiliss until I can conssult with the Emperor.'<br>
Shintenshi tells the guild, '*draws a cool, silken hood over his head, jade eyes dancing wildly in the shadow*'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*spits on the ground* Redemption?  I am being brought up on charges of treason and blasphemy because of one man's interpretation on my actions!'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'However, Shaede, I will warn you now...the Emperor will mosst assuredly NOT sside with you in thiss matter.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'She is already sworn to Innoruuk. She and her entire House. Ye witnessed the binding Ambassador. No mortal government can belay that.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*turns and begins to stride back* No, her house belongs to Neriak'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'She requessted political ssanctuary.  She will have it until the Emperor'ss ressponsse.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'One man who speaks the Father's Will. One man who is divinely guided. And his word will not be the last word on the matter unless you walk away.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'WHat Innoruuk deccidess to do directly iss Hiss bussinesss, and I will not even wish to interfere.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The arm of the Emperor does not reach into Neriak, nor her politics'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'There is no political sanctuary from the Will of a God Vresk.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You are an ambassador, yes'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Glowers dangerously, her eyes rimmed with hate and fury* The Prince of Hate allowed me to survive, yet the Drunkard accuses me of acting against the Father's will!  Yet he himself claims to know it so well?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'but also a guest'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Shaede, you *DO* realize that if thiss doess deteriorate further, and war doess break out, I will be quick to sslay you mysself?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'You are led by one whose visions are found in the bottom of a bottle of Kalish.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I have been appointed BY YOUR QUEEN, who sspeakss for INNORUUK to be the Ambasssador.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Trusst me to do my job as I trusst you to do your own.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye do not know him well. The Kalish stops his visions. The visions come when he does NOT drink.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Are ye so sure Reaper?  It would be hard to disprove?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I trust the Father's Will. I trust the Father's Voice. It is what has led us this far, and shall lead us on to the Harvest itself.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'He accuses me of speaking and acting for the Father and then, despite my continued survival!'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'If you wish to intervene, Reaper, Overlord Faeolin, then I ssuggesst you sspeak not to the Queen, but to (*ooc* GAH!  I forgot the High Priest of Innoruuk's name!).'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Again, I shall not intervene in a religiouss issue.  But I *can* give her political ssanctuary.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'This is not a political issue. It is a GUILD issue and a religious one.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'As a member of the Harvest ye overstep your bounds.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Thiss iss mosst ccertainly NOT a guild issue.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'The Queen of Neriak would ssee her Housse desstroyed.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'However, I agree with you, it iss mosst assuredly alsso a religiouss issue.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And if the clericss will claim her, she iss theirss to have.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'If the Queen became involved. I do not know who ever started that rumor.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'To the best of my knowledge this entire matter was to be kept within the Guild.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'The moment ssomebody ssaid it wass the &quot;law&quot; of the Teir'Dal to act in the manner you do.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'It is the law of the Harvest as well, Vresk.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I have looked into the Consstitution, Reaper.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Forgive me, I do not ssee thiss sspeccific insstancce addresssed.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'This concerns the Harvest only in that there are members of the House here'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye were there at her binding, ye know the oaths she has sworn. If her actions break those oaths it is a matter of the Harvest'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'This matters more, concerning the Houses of Neriak'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Again, Reaper, that iss a religiouss issue.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Khasirath, if I had wronged the Prince of Hate would I have been destroyed?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'The wordss of the binding indicate that Innoruuk Himsself will desstroy her.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'As long as he hass yet to do sso, I will grant her POLITICAL ssanctuary.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Is not Neriak and the Harvest a tool of our Father, Vresk?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'In the end this is Shaede's decision if she is to damn herself and her family. I will say no more until she stands before me in judgment or she stands before my blade at the time of the Harvest.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*wince* As you wish, Reaper.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*rises up* NO, this matter is not closed'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'It iss not your deccision to make it sso, Dread Overlord.'<br>
Shintenshi tells the guild, '*continues to watch silently, making his way for Neriak...*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I assk that you be patient.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I have a job to do here.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'This is truly not your concern, Vresk'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And as Ambasssador, I take that job sserioussly.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'She made it my concsern.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I assk only that you trusst me.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I withdraw my request'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*frowns darkly*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'You would toy with me, like a pet, Matron?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*turns her face ashen*  No Vresk...Nor will I see the Harvest torn apart by me.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Again I say, Vresk'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'This is not your concern'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*turns to Shaede* If these accusations are true, Shaede'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'If she withdrawss her requesst, I agree.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'However, if she doess not, I will NOT have you barreling over me merely with your rank.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You will reap what you have sown'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Looks around to the guild* I give my self to Innoruuk.  Let him judge me once again.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*smiles momentarily in the irony of her statement*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The Mad One has given a week, to come to a conclusion'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Incidentally, where is the rest of your House?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I have not seen the Mad One lately'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'has he returned to his seclusion?'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'nor anyone Faeolin... I begin to worry'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Shaede places all her gear at feet of the hunting companions, her guild pin on top of her robe*  Let Him judge me, I will not stand before a witch hunt... *She walks off toward The Grey*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*wraps up her gear and places it back into her hands*  You have been given a week'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I would suggest you use it well'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I will not allow Xareth to suffer for my sins...Real or imagined...'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You are the Matron of your House'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Your decisions and actions affect all who wear your insignia'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Whether you will it or not'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'If you are found guilty to the charge of blasphemy, is there any doubt what the outcome will be?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The death and destruction of your house'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The name K`Thalion stripped from the book of nobles'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'it shall be the same as another House I once knew'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'If I am dead then the accusations die with me, The Prince is satisfied'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*chuckles* Is our Father ever satisfied?'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, 'no, champion'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'And your House remains bound, though with besmirched honor. All I offer you is a chance to fight for and redeem that honor, Shaede. Do not turn your back on them.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*looks to Nowell*  I no longer bear the title Champion'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I have earned the right of Myrmidon'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, 'I am a bit lost in the past, it seems'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'A simple mind as yourself could hardly be expected to understand'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, 'true'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Perhaps you should spend less time at the Maidens Fancy?'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, 'well, I am a star patron there, I even have a table, I seem to be getting known in FV from my recent streaking episode'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The honor of simpletons is very flexible it seems'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*mumbles to herself*'<br>
Nowell tells the guild, 'I make the leave for tonight *steps into shadows and nothing more*'<br>
<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'so what is everyone up to?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I am listening for the next round of anger to come about'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'anger?'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'what do you mean?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'High emotion, rather'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'from who?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Everyone, concerning the fate of House K`Thalion'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I am not angry regarding it.'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'ahh, I am sorry I missed the parlay earlier'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Daiunus, would you come slay me?'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'slay you?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '* nods*'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'what is it about Harvesters wanting me to kill them?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Nay, Thresher.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'No, you cannot take that way out, Shaede'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'You are not to do sso.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*ahem* If I may be sso bold that iss.'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'I will not of course'<br>
Daiunus tells the guild, 'Aye Vresk, good advice I always welcome'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'She iss to wait the week that she wass given.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Formal charges of blasphemy are going to be made concerning her'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Does Nospiratus speak on behalf of the Father?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Aye.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'At timess.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Aye, the Prophets do speak the word of the Father.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Then there can be no trial.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'He is and always was, the voice of the Father'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Though the Reaper iss the one who sspeakss for the Father through the Harvesst.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Besides that, he is a Priest of Innoruuk'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I believe ye oversimplify things, Shaede. And I have yet to hear the charges formally.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'In 4 days time'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Oversimplifying?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'He may bring a charge against ye, but it will take the Tribunal to decide the verdict and your fate.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'If he came to you and said that the Father demand we strike against the Fier`Dal How many of you would not go?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I would look to the Thresher to guide uss in battle.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Hiss mere word iss not enough to accomplish all thingss.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'It is a different matter entirely. And as I said I have yet to hear the charges in detail. If they are based on divine vision it will be different than if they are one man's opinion. Not every word from a Prophet's lips is a word of Prophecy.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'They are charges of Blasphemy'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'from what little I know'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'But...But he is our guidance in matters of religion?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'And they will be seen in court, Dread Overlord. We do not judge one another in the street or by our own opinion. We are the Chosen, and we will treat one another by Honor above all.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Not the only, Shaede.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*ponders* did I not work to keep things as they should be, Reaper?'<br>

Faeolin tells the guild, 'I also laid out the consequences if they are to be found true'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'This matter has not come before the Tribunal. I see no reason we should be turning our backs on Shaede as if she has already been tried. Do you, Dread Overlord Faeolin?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Where did I err?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I will not get into the details of the incidents leading to this...The Mad One accuses me of making a sacrifice to Cazic-Thule on the most holy of Alters to Innoruuk during a ceremony to Innoruuk.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Never did I say that she was guilty, Reaper'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Why are we disscusssing thiss now?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I little appreciate words being placed into my mouth'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I have only heard that chargess will be brought in 4 day'ss time.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Until then, I believe the matter iss clossed until formally opened.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'And it will be discussed before the Tribunal, as it should be. And if guilt is determined, we will seek the Father's guidance on the possibility of redemption. Ye were the one saying first how ye knew what the penalty to Shaede's House would be.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Please..All of you.  Stop railing against the Reaper.  Stop railing against one another.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'This matter comes before the Tribunal of the Harvest, not the Imperial Judges.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Take it out on the condemned.  Please.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I do indeed, and I spoke it openly for those whose grasp of the brevity of the charges was not so strong'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Actually, I believe, in the end, that it iss the Prophet'ss deccision on whom to bring it up to.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye are not condemned, Shaede. And that is my point entirely. Ye may be the accused, but not the condemned.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You are not condemned, Shaede'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Why?  Why then do I have members of the Harvest explaining to me what they will have to do if I am found guilty?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The Prophet has already stated what he will do'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'So that you know the consequences of your actions'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I did not see if he specified which court. But I assumed he would keep it an internal matter.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'So that perhaps it will spur you to prove the charges false'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'No, this cannot be an internal matter'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Again, that iss not your deccision, Overlord Faeolin.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Charges of blasphemy, to be hidden?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I speak only what the prophet has sworn to do'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Yet, funny enough, you proved my earlier point...*glances at the Reaper*...that I will not again bring up.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Stop..Please.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I know not why you wish for a end to this, Shaede'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You are the cause of this'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Overlord, that iss a grosssly unfair sstatement.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Is it not the truth?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Holds up her hand to Vresk* No Ambassador'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'When, have I spoken something untrue?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'She is correct.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'If she iss indeed proven innoccent, then it would hardly be her fault, neh?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'No, she hassn't.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Innocent or guilty, she is still the cause'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'If she iss innoccent, then she hass done no wrong.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I am still the cause'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And she then hass sstarted nothing.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I am the cause of the bickering and conflict now'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'If innoccent, the causse of what?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I am the cause of the arguments'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Nonssensse.  WE bicker and argue becausse we choosse to.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do you see this as nothing, Vresk?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'You are the SSUBJECT of the argumentss, nothing more.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I see that we perhaps have a traitor within our ranks'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Do not missplacce your own actionss.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Reaper...'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'worse yet, a Blasphemer'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I believe the cause of this particular strife is not one person. I believe it is many people jumping ahead of themselves and the facts they have. And forgetting to HONOR the bonds we have all sworn to.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'A blassphemer you mean.'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'cause and effect can sometimes be difficult to trace'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Agreed, Reaper.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Reaper...'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Moreover, she makes the House Blasphemous'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, '*meets Shaede's eyes with a crisp nod*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Allegedly.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'What would happen to someone if they admitted giving one of our own over to the enemy?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'If she is guilty of course'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'You eassily forget to add that part, Overlord.  The Reaper hass requessted that Shaede not be treated as a criminal.  Perhapss we should lissten to him.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Shaede, I wish to discuss nothing more of trials and the like until this comes before the Tribunal. The constitution is very clear on the process of Trials.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I treat no one unjustly'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'That is not what I am asking.  What if Shintenshi came and admitted to handing Kehle over to the Koada`Dal?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*looks to shin* Not that you would.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'We would be forced to kill him, if it were true.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Or perhapss ssomething worsse.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Shintenshi is a Seed, and not a Teir'Dal. He is nowhere near as proven or as bonded as a Dread Lord.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I would mosst enjoy ssomething worsse.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'A Dread Lord twicce in the making even.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Looks to Faeolin* You are right Fae'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*glares* Speak not of such things'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Concerning?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'i want this to be over.  I want this to be over because I am the one to start it all.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '4 days, then'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I would sooner end my own life then see the harvest torn by it.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Prove the charges true, or prove them false'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Either way, 4 days'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'you must meet with these consequences Shaede'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Consequences for what?'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'you chose a path... you must follow it now'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Speaking of the Mad One, I never got an answer, Shaede'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Has he returned to his seclusion?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'He iss misssing, I had heard.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Consequences for making choices that in my mind...Where not what the Mad One makes them out to be'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I have not seen him of late'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Faeolin...To be honest I have not stepped foot in Neriak since his accusations'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'consequences remain... does not matter that they were unforeseen by you'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*is quiet a moment*'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'That is true Payle.'<br>

Khasirath tells the guild, '*nods to Faeolin*'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Four days time Faeolin'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'You will see him then'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'And until such time'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'You can live with the same doubts and guilt that I do.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'No, Shaede'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do not bring my failures into comparison with yourself'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Say what you will Faeolin.  I saw that look in your eye when you entered.  You doubt yourself.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'So I am guilty?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*crosses her arms*  There is no doubt, only confusion for myself'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'That will be judged'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Shakes her head* Thank you Fae.  Your words convey that you feel I am lost.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'That you would not allow yourself to be compared to me.'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'until such time as the Prophet returns to us... I make myself available for spiritual guidance'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'My feelings on this matter are not of consequence'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*nearly chokes at Payle's words*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*ahem* Forgive me.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You are the Matron of a house of Neriak, why would you wish to compare yourself to me'<br>
Payle tells the guild, '*eyes Vresk'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Because you are my sister in the Harvest.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I bear no insignia, save that of a Dread Overlord of the Violent Harvest'<br>

Vresk tells the guild, 'It wass an unexspected image.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Before Nospiratus I was a houseless rogue.  Who ran from her life within a house.'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'why would she be at my feet'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'With all due respect *sneer* you were worse'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'No reasson.  It'ss jusst what popped into my head.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Allegedly worsse.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'You are failing to make the disstinction, Dread Overlord.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I will not bring up the past'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*nods* Yet you will judge me by my past.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Know that she was much worse than a houseless rogue, Vresk'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I will speak no more of that'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'No please Faeolin do..'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'i am curious of what you have heard of my soiled past'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You forget that we met long ago, Shaede'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I know how you had forsaken the Father'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Perhapss she wass, Overlord, but ssincce you do not wish to disscusss it, and it iss forgotten, and she iss SSTILL currently a Matron, she should be accorded that resspect.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'and sought to serve those pitiful wretches that are the Knights Templar'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Yes I did.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The Father would not let her go, no matter what she willed'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'brought her back to her rightful place'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'In my eyes, she has redeemed herself for it'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And you bring thiss up now becausse....?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Then drop it.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I went to them seeking solace and was punished for my misgivings.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I know her past as well as any, Faeolin. And I know the price she paid, and the redemption she has found. That Shaede is dead.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You seek to command me, Ambassador?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Again with the fighting...'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'No, I sseek to assk you to treat your guildmate with HONOR, Overlord.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Have I condemned her for that?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'How have I dishonored her?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'No, but you treat her now like a dog.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Aye, you have.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Your wordss are very humbling.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I speak only what has been proven'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye sneer at one who has paid beyond any I have seen for their crimes, and been accepted back by the Father.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'The sneer on your face was enough to show your feelings on the matter and that they are not forgiven'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I sneer at the thought of her past, I will not lie'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'You sspeak what iss irrelevant, to jusstify your Hate.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'When does my hatred need justification?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Is it not a gift from the Father'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'When it iss directed at the Harvesst, Overlord.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'It is a gift from the Father. a weapon to be used against the enemies of Hate, not against the Chosen.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Note that I usse the Reaper'ss own wordss here.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'So now, we are not to Hate certain things?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'My Hate, however pitiful it has been judged'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Is unwavering'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'My disdain and contempt and therefore my wrath'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Exactly, Faeolin. To Hate those who serve the Father is to walk the path of madness, and to be lost to your hate, consumed by it.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I am sure we have all seen it happen before. I know well how ye yourself destroyed and removed a Seed who walked that Path.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Then Faeolin, strike me down for my crimes, real or imagined.  Speak for the Father as Nospiratus does.'<br>

Vresk tells the guild, '*notes Mythral's entrance*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'As to the limits of Hatred, so we now have them, is that the case, Reaper?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*absently tastes the air*  *frowns, but says nothing*'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye are not the judge, Faeolin. The Tribunal and Innoruuk Himself will make the decision, and determine what must be done if guilt is determined.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'There are limits to it?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Moves around Vresk, holding the dagger toward Faeolin, the handle out*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Again, you accuse me of judging'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'This has always been the case, Faeolin. Hate does not turn within lest it destroy us.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Show me you still have the _guts_ to do what you desire, what you have desired.'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Ye are the one who told Shaede not to tempt you.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Nay, in that you are wrong Reaper'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Again Shaede, do not tempt me'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'The gift of Hatred from our Father is not to be limited'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'It is not to be accepted with abandon'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*throws the dagger at Faeolin, purposefully broadcasting her move*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'That leads to destruction'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'If hatred is turned within, all of Neriak and all of the Chosen would be destroyed. Do ye think that is Innoruuk's Will?'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, '*summons a pet*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*easily knocks it out of the air*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do you think that he would be displeased at that?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Seeing his creation Hate so mightily that they would destroy themselves?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Aye. For if we destroy ourselves we destroy our ability to serve His Will.'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, '*slowly moves closer to his Captain's side, remains silent*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'So now our Father is incapable of more creation?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'To waste what He has given us in bickering and destruction of ourselves would surely displease Him.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Mythral...what are you doing?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*tastes the air again*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*frowns darkly*'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'He gave us Hate, and He gave us Honor to guide it. Never let the two be separated.'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, 'I need answer to no foreigner'<br>

Vresk tells the guild, 'I have not sseen him in the lasst few dayss, Traitor.'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, '*levels an accusing gaze, spreads it toward Shaede and Khasirath*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'It is only that I am bound by duty, that keeps me from slaying you'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And Honor.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*looks pointedly at Faeolin*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do not again question my honor Iksar'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I have yet to do sso.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I can see that you have had issues with your Hatred yourself'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I trusst you will not give me causse to do sso.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Ahh, Mythral'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*looks to the inflamed brand upon the Iksar’s arm*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'My Hate sseemss much more in control than your own of late, Overlord.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'I could not be more pleased to see another'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Aye, it iss there every day, Overlord?  Care to feel the burn it givess me every day?  You need merely touch it.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'My hatred has been found lacking, not unchecked'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Then you are indeed in no possition to ssay anything, are you?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Your Hate iss unfocussed.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Even you know better than thiss.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Mythral, would you slay me if that is what I asked'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*angrily* Do not tell me what I do or do not do with my gift'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'A shame you are too blinded with Hate to ssee it now.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'It is not your place'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I make the obsservation that you are wassting it.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'And that you know better.'<br>
Payle tells the guild, '*speaks very quietly* it is imperative that we cease to point fingers at one another'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*is quite calm*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Indeed Payle.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I wish not to point any fingerss.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do not again make implications concerning me, Vresk'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'If I wish to do sso, I will sspeak them plainly, my friend.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Pleasse do not sstrike out in anger at me.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You say that you know of hatred, Vresk'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'and yet you call me &quot;friend&quot;'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Aye.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I do not see friendship in abundance amongst children of Hate'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'or their allies'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'That would be the Teir'Dal'ss issue, not mine own.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I’ll call whom I choosse what I choosse.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'An alliance of convenience is all that it is'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'As is the Harvest itself'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Call it wwhat you will, OVerlord.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Teir'Dal working to achieve the same ends'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'It has never been other'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Call it what you will. *shrug*'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, '*raises an eyebrow coolly at Faeolin, but says nothing*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do you think me wrong, Khasir.....Reaper?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'I do.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Do you think that children of Hate would find a way to stay true to their supposed &quot;hatred&quot; and yet claim friendship?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I have never questioned that Hatred of any of you'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'And I am up on Blasphemy charges?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Friendship... I might not use that word. Brotherhood I would. The bindings and oaths we have sworn too are deeper than far more permanent than any 'convenience''<br>
Mythral tells the guild, '*whispers something to his Captain, to Faeolin*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You did not allow me to finish, Shaede'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Odd that you lissten sso intently to Mythral now, Overlord.  Esspecially ssincce you have claimed to Hate him sso much.'<br>

Faeolin tells the guild, 'It has ever been so'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I know better.'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, 'Loyalty is something we do not expect you to understand Ambassador of foreign realms'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'As do you.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Ssave your bold wordss for when you are alone and in need of them Overlord.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Nor you, apparently, Traitor.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Looks to Mythral* Why do we allow this leech amongst us?'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, '*narrows his eyes at Mythral* The Ambassador knows much of loyalty and has proven such much more deeply than one who has openly admitted that he does not follow the Father's Ways.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Has Mythral come back to us?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I wonder if he hass, Overlord.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Or shall I refer to Shaede in turn as Traitor'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Both are guilty of past crimes'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'Please do.  I have never said I do not worship the Father'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I am not convincced that Mythral iss over hiss.'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, 'And at least I have paid for mine - I wonder how many Shaede and her accomplices have yet to be redeemed of'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*narrows her eyes*  Accomplices?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'I am not convincced you have learned anything from yourss, Mythral.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'so now, in spite of everything I have said'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'We have come to judging each other?'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Now issn't that the pot calling the kettle black?'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'Who has been judged this eve?'<br>

Shaede tells the guild, 'I will stand here and listen to all the others, but if you DARE accuse me of something vermin, I will skin you personally and watch you bake in the light of the sun.'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Issn't that the halfling calling the gnome short?'<br>

Vresk tells the guild, '*bows before the Reaper*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Forgive me Reaper.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'You have come very close to crossing lines with me, that should never be done'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, 'Perhapss I should be quiet.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'I have done naught but speak the truth this eve'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'As I have always done'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'But ye have often spoken also in the past of the brotherhood of the Harvest Dread Overlord. Were those words then lies?'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, '*Quietly watches the assembled crowd, noting who is present, and who is not*'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Walks over to Mythral her hand flashes and brings the point of it's runed blade to his throat.* You have something to do with this all...'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*disarms Shaede*  No.'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'You!  You are the reason that Nospiratus as left'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*hands Shaede her weapon back*'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, '*calmly glances at her, no emotion in his cold eyes*  Am I?'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, 'What have you done with him.  *Her hands begin to drip with magic.*'<br>
Payle tells the guild, 'Shaede really... '<br>
Mythral tells the guild, 'Your defensiveness gives the truth of it I think'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'There is indeed a brotherhood'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*glances to the Reaper*'<br>
Mythral tells the guild, 'and others defense of you shows the rest'<br>
Khasirath tells the guild, 'Shaede.'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, 'That would never mean that we refuse to Hate'<br>
Shaede tells the guild, '*Reaches back and slams Mythral in the face with her bare fist, wincing at the pain of it*'<br>
Vresk tells the guild, '*tastes the air again* *mutters something*'<br>
Faeolin tells the guild, '*draws her swords* There will be no combat this eve'<br>
