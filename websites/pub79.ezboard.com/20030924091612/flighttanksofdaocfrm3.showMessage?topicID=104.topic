<br>
First will be the hard part.  Where will we stand?<br>
<br>
My opinion is that we will be in worse shape the both Blademasters and Mercenaries after the patch.  We got none of the light tank changes for the better (enhanced bleed effect and increased side positional as we have no left axe side positional and all our main styles are behind which just got its area reduced).  We have no access to the fluff enhancements such as flurry.  No shield spec to get engage to help us vs. archers who will be very beefed up with this patch and Bladeturn will be of much less help to us.  We may still do slightly more damage then our light tank counterparts, but a lot of that is from our 100% haste effect vs. theres whenever both weapons swing and that we normally use a slow right hand to increase damage.  But does that balance out losing even the 150-200pt once a battle flurry?  It remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
Our class defining ability, frenzy, now has a nullification in the blademaster abiliy and the mercenary ability.  They are on longer durations with no backdraws.  Where as we lose parry, evade and half our AF to get criticals on every swing for 20 seconds from 1 to 99%.  If the range had even been shortened it may have helped some there.<br>
<br>
So what do we need then?<br>
<br>
1) Access to all the current changes they gave BMs and Mercs: Bleed enhancements, flurry, etc<br>
<br>
2) Shorten the range of criticals from 1 to 99 to 35 - 70 making it a viable ability vs. increased parry/block in RvR, BM/Merc abilities cancel it out, BOF makes it pointless, etc.<br>
<br>
3) Remove penalties from Frenzy or give us an additional boost outside the criticals.  We have no defense during that time and the entire ability can be nullified by too many things while still leaving us with no defense.<br>
<br>
4) Increase Left Axe skill line to enhance another ability such as evade inreases by a small amount for every spec pt in left axe.  At the moment, its in the same boat as both Cd/Dw where main weapon skills do equal or better damage which is wrong for any of the advanced specs but Zerks have no other way to spec and Left Axe is much less viable at low spec then Cd/Dw. <br>
(Example for the above statement: A BM or Merc CAN spec shield, weapon and leave DW low to be a more defensive tank.  If they are not the one holding aggro during a fight, there shield does them no good, so even a 1 in DW/CD allows them a chance to swing for 100% damage. A 1 left axe leaves a zerk doing less damage over time then if they had just used a 2hander.)<br>
<br>
5) Lack of utility or role of a berserker needs to be addressed.  With the current level of there damage abilities, they bring nothing to a group other then a chance to do semi-decent damage every 7 minutes at a substantial cost to themselves and then there group.  A warrior, the most vanilla of all classes, brings more to the group with higher base damage (patch increase), high shield skill for defense and anytime stun not effected by resists or determination, access to 2handers for damage equal to or greater then zerks and with mastery of pain can do crits nearly as often as zerks without the penalties. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gorsteir>Gorsteir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#000000>(6/4/03 2:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where do we go from 1.62?</span><hr size=1> I was a little mad at first that DFrost was nerfed but Mythics explanation was ok i think, what we must do is utilize our positional styles.

<br>
Aurora Borealis no longer has any effect other then the lame cold proc.<br>
<br>
And<br>
<br>
Our bleed damages did not get the same adjustment as the other light tanks.  So oh joy, for the 7! bleed damage.<br>
<br>
Also,<br>
<br>
they changed the snared effects (hinder on atrophy) to break with damage so if you run the chain you break it anyway.<br>
<br>
We have no direct effect styles.  Everyone requires a chain or in many instances a positional/reactionary off of a chain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noltmier>Noltmier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#000000>(6/4/03 6:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where do we go from 1.62?</span><hr size=1> You sure we didn't get the adjustment for bleed?

<br>
1.  An increase in base damage by 5% - this would be particularly useful in light of the major nerf to Endurance Regen.<br>
<br>
2.  The endurance consumption rate on Doublefrost needs to be brought into line now with the damage it deals.  There's no way we should be limited to 6 anytime Doublefrost styles given the damage it deals (not that it was especially awesome to begin with.).  I would also recommend that we request an improved to hit bonus on this style.<br>
<br>
3.  Aurora Borealis.  I know many won't agree, but I favor seeing this style converted into a side positional (to take advantage of the enhanced arc of these styles introduced with 1.62).  I would also demand that it deal a dual effect:  heavy bleed equal to what Mercs/BM's got and a snare.<br>
<br>
4.  Berserk Ability.  Heh, in light of what our rival light tanks got, the defensive penalty to Berserk should be completely dropped.  I would also argue for a change to the crits with a floor of not less than 20% and maybe a cap of 80% or 30/70 as Kethryn proposed.  We would be sacrificing high end damage for more consistent damage.<br>
<br>
5.  I think we need to pay some attention to the style bonus on both our Parry chain and Evade chain.  These styles should deal nice damage.  I'm not convinced that they still do.  If they don't, we should major bone to pick with Mythic imo.<br>
<br>
6.  Cosmetic Issues:<br>
<br>
a.  Eliminate the stupid Vendo model and replace it with the Fenrir model.<br>
<br>
b.  Could we get some halfway decent style graphics?  <br>
<br>
Neither of these things are much to ask.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts out of the box. <p>Jund Bloodaxe - 50th RR 5.7 Berserker - Palo<br>

[quote]This is why the primary combat style chains for these light tanks are positional in nature - they assume that someone else is holding a monster or enemy player's aggression.[/quote]<br>
and I look at at style and I only see one positional chain ( from behind) no side no front not even a style for those position, we only have chain on evade and evade. if we are not to be the main tank ( pve or rvr) how are we supposed to do those chains and do the damages we are supposed to do? for this  I totally agree with you points number 3 and 5<br>
<br>
My understanding for our short timer on rage was that we had limitation if every one else is on a 7 min timer, I  don't see  the point for this beside mythological references.  as for crits  I would prefer 30-70 ( I really hate when I crit for 10% and people hates when we crit for 90% so that should makes every one happy and makes it easier to pass the vendo without defense loss)<br>
<br>
for the cosmetic changes I would like to see a vendo ( or  other model) proportional to the size of the toon ( as a dwarf i hate becoming bigger than troll) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#c0c0c0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowzerkers>shadowzerkers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Initiate</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#000000>(6/10/03 5:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where do we go from 1.62?</span><hr size=1>  You can post all the damage numbers you want but you dont know how badly it is till you have seen it for yourself. I play a lvl 50 zerker on iseuld and knowing that this patch was going to be bad I set up some tests. Before patch I dueled a lv 50 warrior 5 times, a lvl 50 savage 5 times, a lvl 50 thane 5 times and a lvl 50 skald 5 times everyone of these guys was in my guild and no RAs were used like IP or purge. These were the results.<br>
(AXE)Warrior beat me 3 times.<br>
(Hammer)Thane beat me 3 times.<br>
(H2H)Savage beat me once.<br>
(AXE)Skald beat me 2 times.<br>
<br>
Now before you guys fly off the handle about RR and armor and such we were all RR3L2 - RR3L6 and each one of us had fully SCed armor with max resists across the board. <br>
Now here is after the patch came out live.<br>
Warrior beat me 5 times<br>
Thane beat me 4 times<br>
Savage beat me twice<br>
Skald beat me 4 times<br>
<br>
before patch DBLFST was hitting for about + 100-170<br>
after patch DBLFST was hitting for +45-89<br>
After playing some PVE also I was ready to park my fat troll ass at the forge and just craft......... but wait I have a free respecc and I had a respec stone also. So i figured what the hell I might as well have some fun. so I did the unthinkable I respecced 50 sword 50 parry 28 left axe.<br>
Now why do you ask sword??? how does a 3 pary parry chain sound and a lvl 50 rear style. I will swear to this right now my damage wasnt what it was with a MP DS and a MP wba but it is damn close. so I called up my guildes again and we tried the duels again.<br>
Warrior beat me 4 times ( one of the battles was down to about 15 hps each)<br>
Thane beat me 3 times (parried about 15 attacks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Savage beat me twice.<br>
Skald beat me twice( cant hurt what u cant hit)<br>
To sum all this rambling up I am very happy with mt 50 sword 50 parry spec now we can actually do some decent damage and parry a crap load now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=104.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=104.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.threadControl?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub79.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm9">Mercenary Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm1">Blademaster General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm2">Mercenary General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm3">Berserker General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm4">Ask the Blademaster TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm6">Blademaster Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm7">Team Lead Reports<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm8">Patch Notes<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm11">Ask the Mercenary TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm12">Berserker Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm14">Ask the Berserker TL<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm15">Suggestions/Feedback<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm16">Announcements<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm18">General Light Tank Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm19">Logs<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm20">Savage General Discussion<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm21">Savage Equipment<option value="lighttanksofdaocfrm23">Ask the Savage TL</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/blighttanksofdaoc>Light Tanks of DAoC</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/flighttanksofdaocfrm3>Berserker General Discussion</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
