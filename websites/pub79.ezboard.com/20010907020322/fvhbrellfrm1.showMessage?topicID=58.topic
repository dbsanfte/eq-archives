Curiousities<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 The young elf sits silently, sipping the dark blood-colored wine favored by those of his race and obvious wealth. A light smile plays across his lips as he gazes out the inn window, watching a stately couple exchange pleasantries only lovers can share. Curiosity flashes through the handsome elf’s violet eyes as he turns his face slightly towards the bar, “Innkeep?” He queries, a mischievous grin crossing his face as he tilts an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
The darkly beautiful Teir'Dal behind the bar turns and studies the young elf. “He is much too cocky to live much longer.” She thinks to herself, “More’s the pity, he would have grown into quite a looker.” She allows her gaze to drift slowly over him, watching his grin turn more seductive as he allows his own eyes to drift down her body. He is dressed much too finely for one of such tender years, it is apparent he is from a wealthy family. He wears dark green robes, obviously of a magical nature, tied in the latest fashion. At his belt is a gilded dagger of sacrifice, normally held by casters of much more experience. On his right hand he wears a rare ring obviously purchased from some adventurer that had more of a use for platinum than brains and on his left, a ring crafted by only the finest of jewel crafters. He is handsome, she has to admit it. “Innkeep? Come now, we know each other much too well for such terms now, do we not lover?” She allows the hint of a smile to cross her face as she strolls to his table, bringing with her more of the dark, elvish wine.<br>
<br>
The young elf chuckles. “Do we now? I would say that we are strangers yet sister, after all, we met but yesterday and you have not even told me your proper name. Speaking of proper names, I am known as Tilarian.” <br>
<br>
“Well, then it is nice to make your acquaintance young Tilarian, more formally at least…” the young innkeeper laughs lightly as she fills Tilarian’s goblet, “Was there anything else young Lord, or is the wine all that you desire?”<br>
<br>
Tilarian grins, “Oh..a young enterprising Teir’Dal such as myself has many desires, but for now I was wondering,” Tilarian motions towards the couple outside of the inn window, “Is that not the Winnower of the Violent Harvest, Selilya, and her chosen?”<br>
<br>
“You are an enterprising young elf to be asking about the Winnower, it’s too bad your career will be cut short should you choose your words about that one poorly. Yes, that is Selilya.” <br>
<br>
Tilarian turns his head back to face the beautiful female, “Ahh…thank you. I have been hoping to cross paths with her. I have many questions about the Harvest.” Tilarian stands, finishing his wine and dropping the fine goblet into its pouch. “Forgive me if I leave in a rush, oh most beautiful of all Inn Keepers, but I do not wish to miss the opportunity at hand.” Tialrian stands and begins walking towards the exit. “I shall revisit your fine establishment soon, the wine is delicious…and the company… even more so.” Tilarian smiles his most winning smile.<br>
<br>
“My you are quite the charmer, aren’t you young Tilarian?” The hostess asks coyly.<br>
<br>
“Well, that is my profession sister, I should hope I do it well.” A mischievous spark marks Tilarian’s words, “As you excel in your profession…for you have stolen my heart…along with my platinum.”<br>
<br>
The Innkeep laughs, “So you have found me out! Leave my bar at once!” the Teir’Dal rogue smiles, “but return soon.”<br>
<br>
Tilarian bows and with a sweep of his cloak he disappears into the darkness of the streets of Neriak.<br>

I was not sure where to post, as this is not really a desire to join, but more of an introduction as I search for direction. I hope you enjoy the read and I will see you in game!<br>

Perhaps sharing some food and wine might be in order in the near future.<br>
