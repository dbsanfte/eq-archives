A Harvester's Tale -- Part I<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I also posted this on the VN Boards...more to come...<br>
<br>
<br>
Selilya had found her place. The Violent Harvest was now family. There was a new spring in her step and an added viciousness to her attacks on the creatures in the Nektulos Forest. She didn't wander far from home, as she was still trying to train in the basics of the trade skills she loved. She wanted to honor her mother's memory and had taken up the craft of tailoring. It wasn't enough, she decided, so despite some chuckles from her close friends, she donned the accoutrements of the blacksmith and began to forge ore into useful products. She even enjoyed trying her hand at baking and brewing, knowing how fond her new mentor, Nospiratus, was of spirits. Of course, he was already a noted brewmaster. He was also one of the Triad, the ruling council, of the guild. <br>
<br>
She was particularly excited on this day, because she was attending her very first guild function. Her friend, Merryk T'Kal, Shadow Knight, was being inducted as the new Dread Lord of the Eastern Domain, the home guard. She couldn't wait to celebrate with him and the other new members of the family. Moreover, this would be a chance to see the ruling council all in one place at one time. She had only seen the other two members of the Triad once or twice…and only in passing. Selilya, herself, was already dubbed a Dread Harvester; a title, which she cherished it, was her own. <br>
<br>
When the hour approached, she made her way to 3rd Gate…to the designated location at the foot of the Golden Dragon. There stood the Triad…Nospiratus L`Crit, Valtarien D`Archon, and Ixtab C`Boath. Her skin practically tingled as she bowed in their presence…the hatred emanating that strongly from them. She made her way to the other young Harvesters and fixed her eyes on the Reaper of the Harvest, Ixtab. <br>
<br>
The Reaper conducted the business of the day quickly. Selilya peered at the faces of those around her and could tell the others were just as captivated by his words as she. She felt the glare of Nospiratus on her…so she quickly turned her attention back to the Triad, blushing for getting caught in a momentary distraction. <br>
<br>
&quot;Merryk T`Kal, step forth,&quot; the Reaper bellowed. It was time. The other two Dread Lords were standing close by. Creapiing, a Shadow Knight, was already gaining a reputation as being a most vicious combatant against the lightborn. Uvatha, a Necromancer, looked on with a cool poise. Merryk marched forward and saluted the Triad, standing at attention…waiting for what was next. Ixtab began to speak of the responsibilities of the position…asking Merryk if he was, indeed, worthy. Merryk acknowledged them. <br>
<br>
Then the dagger was plunged into Merryk's neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;We shall see if Innoruuk finds you worthy, Merryk,&quot; Ixtab proclaimed. Then and there, Merryk took his oath of service to Innoruuk and to the Harvest. Selilya was fascinated by the trickle of blood oozing from the dagger's hilt and point where they pierced Merryk's neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now…does Innoruuk accept you?&quot; queried the Reaper. With that, Ixtab reached over and swiftly withdrew the blade. Merryk seemed to stumble momentarily, then stood straight and tall, his eyes transfixed on the Reaper. &quot;It would seem so,&quot; Ixtab declared. Selilya and the others cheered for the new Dread Lord…and the celebrating began. <br>

Ahh, Selilya, those times were filled with such hope, and ended in seeming tragedy, ony to be reborn with new hope of Hate grown ever stronger. Those times seem so simple now, compared to the demands that are before the Harvest, but I know it was theen that we all stood to prove the Harvest more than the fiction of an insane dreamer.<br>
<br>
Our faith has indeed been rewarded, but it is well to return in our minds, to recall those first, few simple days of teh Violet Harvest, and the transformation we have made to beomce the Violent Harvest. Thank you, dear friend.<br>

<br>
My Winnower,<br>
<br>
You write of times past, times of pride and ambition in my life. Your words recall times when the name &quot;Merryk the Wrathful&quot; was well known and feared. They recall times when I was a rising star in the night sky. Sadly, these times have been behind me these last few months. My wrath has been blunted and my ambition turned inward. I have been more of a burden on my Harvest family than a boon. Innorruk has punished me for these faults, slowing my advancment in His mysteries and rewards until I have almost faded away.<br>
<br>
Know now, my Harvest family, that these times of lax behavior and ambition draw to a close. Merryk T'Kal, The Wrathful has RETURNED! I have seen the depradations of the Lightblind on the sands of Southern Ro, heard tell of their rising powers in the Arena, and seen their prideful, boasting words in the Grange Itself! No more I say! NO MORE! This very week I will gain my Family Name or die in the trying! I will then unleash the Wrath that you knew of old! I will find my father's sword and use it to slay the Lightblind in droves! This I swear in Innorruk's name and on my Family Name T'Kal. This I swear by my oath to the Violent Harvest!<br>
<br>
Ware Lightblind, for Merryk T'Kal comes for you! Rejoice Chosen of Innorruk for your brother has returned!<br>
<br>
I Have Spoken!<br>
<br>
Merryk T'Kal  <br>
called the Wrathful<br>
Dread Lord of the Harvest<br>
Knight of Shadow<br>
Pawn of Innorruk <br>
