A Note to the Harvest<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
To the Violent Harvest:<br>
<br>
Greetings. My name is Kassy Lightborn, though you may have heard me called Kassy Na'Verdis, as this is what Nospiratus has seen fit to call me. Kassy who knows no truth. This is far from accurate.<br>
<br>
Never before did I look for trouble with the Harvest, yet trouble, it would seem, has found me. More and more often as I walk through the area surrounding my home do I see your young brethren and I cannot help but wonder at the increasing activity around my beloved Qeynos. <br>
<br>
I am not violent by nature, and I hold within my heart no Hate for the individual members of the Harvest, for in my present state I fear what Hate might lead me to. I do not judge on the color of one's skin or the profession they choose to follow as I myself ask not to be judged by such. The Harvest, itself, however, is another matter. My understanding, and do correct me if I am mistaken, is that you seek to bring about dread Innoruuk's rule of Norrath. You are mad to desire such a thing! Do not mistake my kindness or Lightborn ways for weakness. Though I would rather talk over mugs of wine than do battle, I will fight to protect myself, my friends, and my home. I will not be hurt by Innoruuk again, nor will I allow my friends to be.<br>
<br>
Hear me, Harvest, keep to your dark forest, your deep city. Do not seek to extend the range of that darkness for the world cannot survive without the life-giving light and without Norrath you yourselves will surely perish.<br>
<br>
You call me Kassy Na'Verdis, yet I know much. I have felt the very touch of your Dark Innoruuk and it is not something I would wish upon my most despised enemy. I will not allow you to bring his touch, his Hate, to others if it is at all within my power.<br>
<br>
Be well then, Harvest. I pray you come to see the truth of the Light that we might meet on friendly terms. It is truly a day I hope to see and, Tunare willing, one day I shall.<br>
<br>

Creapiing read the scroll signed by the pale one. Kassy was as blind and prejudiced as the rest of them. She particularly liked the part about....In my present state I fear what hate might bring me to...<br>
<br>
The Mad One had aptly named this one. She had the stirrings of hate but not the knowledge to grasp that hate for her own strength.<br>
<br>
Smiling a bit, Creapiing went to the guild hall and posted the note that all might read.<br>

Raveneye read the letter from the one called Kassy Lightborn that the Reaper had included in his dispatches and shrugged. Nothing contained within it held any interest for him. In all his years among the light races Raveneye still could not understand why they all seemed to think the world revolved around them. When would they come to understand that we are all mearly cogs in the machine of fate, that time and circumstance stop for no one, what will be will be. That The Harvest was inevitable.<br>
<br>
Raveneye's last thought as he discarded the letter was that someday he would be ordered into battle against this woman, or others like her, and he would surly slay them or die trying. Not because of the Hate she seemed so sure he possesed, but because he was a soldier, and that is what soldiers do..... <br>

You say that you will not allow his touch to fall upon others <br>
if it is withing your power. Yet you are too blind to see that it is, in fact, NOT within your power.<br>
<br>
I have warned you in the past, and I warn you again now. Do not cross the Harvest. You are but chaff in the wind of Hatred.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that you have felt the touch of the Dread Innoruuk. Were I you, I would cherish this touch. For it is the one thing that may save you from eternal torture when the Triad come to plow the fields... <br>

Stops to visit with a few friends as she is in town on business with a god and takes a moment to read the letter. She remembers Kassy from when she was amoung the knights and smirks as she finishes reading the letter, wondering when they will stop fighiting and argueing amoungst eachother and see that we are all pawns in this game of these power hungry gods. <br>

Kassy chuckles softly from within the shadow of a thin black traveling cloak, not a laugh of humor, but of bitter irony. The cloak hangs about her slight form, swaying softly in the light breeze revealing the dark leather she wears beneath.<br>
<br>
As she watches the rising moon she speaks softly to the winds, &quot;'Save you from eternal torture'...those were the Harvester's words I believe.&quot; Again the chuckle that holds only irony comes fourth as she slips the hood of her cloak back and runs a hand through her thick hair, delicate ebon fingers contrasting harshly with her silvery mane. &quot;The cause, not the salvation, Harvester. Hate is never the answer...&quot;<br>

Numadar reflects back upon the first time he meet this Kassy that he is reading about now. Standing in the entrance of the East Commons tunnel awaiting a trader whom he had a business deal arranged with, he heard a soft spoken insult masked by a smile whisper it's way into his ear. &quot;I just can't escape all of you VIOLENT HARVEST. You are everywhere.&quot; was the way Kassy introduced herself to me. I turned slightly to direct my eyes upon a beautiful Teir'dal girl who wore the sign of Tunare around her neck. I thought to myself, &quot;Now isn't this the most peculiar thing I have seen in a long time.&quot; Surveying this young darkelf girl I gathered that she was an enchantress by trade. Never had I seen someone with such a lost look in their eyes before than what I saw before me now. &quot;Do I know you?&quot; I asked. &quot;No you do not and that is how I wish it to be evil one. I would not wish to know the dark and misguided followers of Innoruuk who have nothing but Hate in their hearts such as you.&quot; was her response. With my hand extended I took a step toward her to introduce myself, &quot;Hello I am Numadar.&quot; She shrank back against the wall of the tunnel and said, &quot;My name is Kassy Lightborn, but your mad prophet calls by another.&quot; Laughter erupted from my lungs so loud that all trading ceased for a moment to see what was so funny. Even a dueling set of warriors took notice for a second to look at me. The barbarion swiftly took the humans head off for paying attention a little too long. How hilarious is this? A Teir'dal girl by the name of Lightborn. Oh what a misguided soul this must be. And the name that the prophet had given her, I still laugh to myself everytime I think about it. At this moment Kassy began chanting and Invoked an Illusion upon herself of the woodelf form. Her eyes held no Illusion though. In them I could see the lost soul inside of her that was reaching out for her identity that she so greatly missed in her life. The denial of who she was. Standing there looking like a fare skinned druid girl her Teir'Dal eyes betrayed her true self to me. &quot;Why do you hide yourself young Teir'dal girl? Why do you wish to be a &quot;Faker&quot; as I like to call it?&quot; Kassy shouted at me, &quot;I'm not a Teir'dal!&quot; At that moment a gnome walked up to her and said, &quot;Kind druid, might you cast the spirit of the wolf on me for a long trip I am about to embark upon?&quot; Kassy dropped the Illusion immediatly and told the small one he was mistaken about her trade. He walked away mumbling about damn enchanters or something like that. So this was my first encounter with the young lost soul that sends messages to us about how wrong we are. We spoke for several hours after this about the merits of each others beliefs. All the details of our conversation would require a month to put into writing, but I did learn some very important things about her that night that do need to be said. Kassy was gifted by Innoruuk early in her life, sculpting her into the darkelf woman that she is now. Saving her from a life of false hopes as the woodelf that she would have been. Kassy mistakes this as a curse upon her life though. She fights so hard to deny her true self that she sought out the Knights Templar to make her feel that she truely is a Lightborn. The Knights toyed with her and gave false promises and hopes that she would one day be one of them. In the end they crushed her and sent her away, stating to her that she should perish with her Teir'dal bretheran in Hate. What an evil situation. Hated by the ones she wanted to be, and hating the ones who would welcome her with open arms. But Kassy can't accept what she is doing now. I see her cries of help to us everytime she screams words of hate at us. She doesn't seek out the harvest and the Teir'dal brothers because she wants us to fail. She seeks us out because we are the only ones that will ever truely accept her into the family. Kassy is just lost and in need of guidance. She is a lost soul that is wondering Norrath looking for an identity. I say seek her out and show her the pride of being a Teir'dal. She can mask herself in Illusions but the blood that flows through her is that of our own blood. Kassy needs to understand what a GIFT she has been given and relish in it.<br>

I have not yet had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of meeting you executioner. Your words are obviously tainted by your false beliefs, and I will not try to persuade you otherwise. Such blind devotion is rather amusing to me, you are like a newborn blind kitten suckling on the teats of its mother, too scared to venture forth and discover the truth about the world.<br>
<br>
At least however, you should get the facts right or you hold no respect from your enemies whatsoever. Kassy was never lied to by the Knights Templar, she was promised nothing but a fair hearing. She remains one of our closest allies and is under our protection. She is also one of my closest friends.<br>
<br>
If you, or any of your hate-blinded kin threaten her I will rain down my vengeance upon you without a second thought. Do not mistake my actions for Hate, which is the standard response of your kind, who are unwilling to understand. I do not hate you, but if you hurt Kassy I will destroy you.<br>
<br>
I am prepared to leave it there, but if you want to take it further then be my guest. The Harvest will then be looking for a new executioner. <br>

*Scanning again the message from Merecraft, Faeolin cannot help but chuckle. The longer she reads, the closer she comes to laughter. Finally, when she can take it no longer a deep belly laugh erupts from her.*<br>
<br>
Merecraft:<br>
<br>
Kassy is under the protection of the Knights Templar you say? How delightfully ineffective and unimposing that statement is. Are you aware that I crushed her skull and spit on her corpse just days ago! Are you aware that I rejoiced at the sound of her death rattle? True, I took no honor away with my victory, but to expose the Knights for what they are was reward enough. I almost pity the rest of the wretches under your protection. It seems to me that they might be safer if they distanced themselves from you and your false promises. Or perhaps you have deluded them into thinking that the Knights were something other than the butt of jokes at the local tavern. <br>
<br>
Pompously you strut around, speaking of vengeance and destruction. If you would only look through eyes not blinded by pride and foolish notions of grandeur. You would know that the time of the Harvest comes. The future has been foretold. There are two choices for you, to be cast to the winds of misfortune, or to understand the truth in our words. Surely even you must see the world with a bit of clarity from time to time. There are two choices for you, each with their own consequences. Come before me with cries of mercy and forgiveness, and you may yet be vindicated of your crimes. Come before me with idle threats and broken promises..... and you will get yourself killed. Choose wisely, you are running out of time.<br>

Crushed my skull and spit upon my corpse, Faeolin? And yet here I stand, ever blessed by Tunare. As I told you, no spawn of Innoruuk can end my life just as the Prince of Hate could not himself end my days. ::shrugs slighty, flashing a crooked grin:: At least none who have tried thus far have had any success.<br>
<br>
No, Numadar, I was never lied to by the Knights. I never claimed that I had been. In seeking acceptance I took the same risk as any other potential squire. I did not pass the test and yet I walk beside the Knights if not among them. Does the color of my skin hinder my friendship with the noble Templars? Nay, for they see the truth of me where you Harvest do not. It is now you who see only the surface.<br>
<br>
You call me lost, confused, ignorant. You call me Na'Verdis, truthless. Yet I am not truthless, you simply cannot see the truth for what it is. That, or you simply refuse to accept it.<br>
<br>
Well tis time you accept it, Harvest. My name is Kassy Lightborn, not Kassy Na'Verids. I know who and what I am. Who I will always be. I am Fier'Dal no matter the color of my skin. You cannot change that. Hunt me as you will, it makes no difference in who I am. I will not be changed, not driven from the path I choose to walk.<br>
<br>
I choose the Light.<br>

&lt;OOC sorry I havent been round in a while Creapiing, there's this little thing called work which means I cant play that much now. Boohoo!  Still, I'll try and make a pain of myself as much as I can  Right, onto the pompous and arrigant bit :P &gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;IC&gt;<br>
I will come before you Faeolin at any time. I will not be crying for mercy however, I will rather be there to rid Norrath of the maggot Overseer of the West. Think yourself lucky that Kassy posted here before I wandered back. If you had truly slain her soul and used her bones to raise spirits, as your kin did to Nostramis, you would already be dead. As it is consider yourself simply marked for death. My brother Knights may not have the nerve to do what must be done, but I will become their blade. My purpose will allow no other outcome than your death. I will not weep and I will not feel joy, it is simply how things will be.<br>

&quot;Na'Verdis,&quot; she snarles, &quot;Innoruuk has given you so much and yet you turn your back on him in favor of the Light that will never accept you. How foolish can you be? You are Tier'Dal, Norrath's greatest blessing. You are one of the Chosen and you would throw that honor away.<br>
<br>
&quot;You go to those filthy Knights and beg acceptance when you should know they will never let you among them. They are blinded by their precious Light, as you are. You would have been welcome within the warm darkness that the Harvest embraces had you come to us. You would have a family rather than walking the world alone, an easy targed for enemies.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Father speaks to me, Na'Verdis. He bids me find you and bring you home. You will come to see the truth of the Darkness, the truth of Hate. Or I will slay you and raise your bones to serve me in Darkness. The choice is yours...sister.&quot;<br>

If you think I would ever leave the Light simply because your dark Father bids it then it is you who are the fool and not I. You may say whatever you wish to try to convince me but never will I walk in Darkness.<br>
<br>
Why must you, and the vast majority of the Harvest, try to change me to fit your views? Cannot you accept that I am not like you? Or do you fear me for my differences? I know that humans fear what they do not understand and try to destroy that which they fear, but are not the long-lived elves, even Tier'Dal, above that? I suppose not...<br>
<br>
I want no quarrel with you, Feareth, but if you manage to gather the courage and resources to find me I will fight to protect myself. I have heard tell of you, of your threats against the Templar Drallien. I may not be on the best of terms with that particular Knight, but he is a Templar and I will stand by his side should you cause him trouble. You would do well to remember that.<br>

<br>
I have, however, had the opportunity to obsserve thiss one unsseen. I would like to note that however sstrong her wordss appear to be, they are jusst that, wordss, and nothing more. When all iss ssaid and done, and the voiccess die down, thiss one iss sstill haunted by visionss of Hate.<br>
<br>
One may run and hide from the accussationss of otherss, but we never truly esscape what we truly are. I ssuggesst we may take comfort from the fact that although she may sstruggle to sserve the lighter raccess of Norrath, she iss truly misserable by going againsst her true nature.<br>
<br>
In the end, we never can hide from oursselvess.<br>
<br>
Pleasse, forgive the intrusion, but I merely wanted to offer a persspective.<br>

*Faeolin watches the changing of the guard from the window of her office. The only sign that she hears the Iksar is a slight nod of her head. When Vresk finishes speaking, she allows silence to fill the room for a moment and the turns and says:<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe there is wisdom in your words, Vresk. I once asked Kassy if you could blame an animal for being itself. She does eke out an existance torn within herself. My words were to show that the Templars have no sway here in Neriak, or anywhere within the Harvest. In and of herself, she is no threat to my plans or the coming of the Harvest. I took her life on a whim, and there was no honor in it. <br>
<br>
Enough talk of this one, ambassador. Please, take a seat and tell me more about your Native city.&quot;<br>

How many names must you give to me, Harvest? You call me Lost One, Traitor, Kassy who knows no truth. Na'Verdis...truthless. You would do better to call me 'Kassy who knows not our truth' as that would be more accurate. But I care not. Refer to me as you will.<br>
<br>
You are wrong, Sria, and in your heart of hearts I think you know it. Only listen to your own words, &quot;It matters not who you serve, just how long you survive.&quot; Is then a shadow knight who brings death and suffering to the innocent equal to the goodly cleric who spends his life healing the ill assuming they live to the same age?<br>
<br>
Nay, I say it does matter whom we serve. We all live, every one of us, for the future. The past is no more, the present unending. Yet the future is what we fight for, what we live for, what we die for. Who we serve reflects our desires for that future. I serve Tunare with all my heart, I work toward a future filled with Light and Life. And that matters. Even if I do not live to see that future my children, or the children of my friends, will. They deserve a future where they can prosper and find happiness. And the future is determined by whom we serve and how faithfully we serve them. You have walked both in lightness and in dark and should know the truth. It matters, Sria.<br>

My dear Merecraft I did not flee. As I would never do such a thing. I had no intention from the begining of staying among Templar. When I left, i returned to my family who had been awaiting me for quite some time.<br>
<br>
I live for the well being of my friends and dear ones and that will mean at times I must do things I would rather not. I told Templar I would let no harm come to them by my actions and I held to that. <br>
<br>
The choice of my actions were not a choice at all my dear. I first saught aid from the templar family and was met with hostility and when none would help I turned to those I knew would aid. <br>
<br>
Kassy pause and listen a moment to yourself. How could you begin to compare a shadow knight to a cleric of good. In sted my dear young one, compare a cleric of good to one of hate, least then you shall be on an equal level to compare. <br>
<br>
Compare a shadow knight to a palidin they are both on the same level of comparison. Comparing a shadow knight to a good cleric would be like comparing a horse to a fish. So in the sense that you compare on an equal level my dear, then yes they are equal. <br>
<br>
And aye, my dear young one, I have walked both dark and light and to this day that still changes frequently. Good and evil will always exist and I shall serve who I must each day for the good of my dear ones. <br>

Do not forget Kassy, that I also call you whelpling! As to your ignorant claims of who is &quot;good,&quot; and who is &quot;evil.&quot; I ask you this... How would you judge those who would invade our lands and murder our sentries? How would you judge that Dark Knight who rushes to the defense of her people then? Who would be that which you call evil? <br>
<br>
This is merely a philosophical question, since I care little about the dead. They are dead only because they were weak. As a self-proclaimed follower of Tunare, you must understand this principle, that the weak are consumed by the strong? Does it not make you and your &quot;protectors,&quot; hypocrites? Does it not mean that you go against the laws of Nature? Hmmmm, I can see why you war within yourself. You war against not just who you are, but against the will of the harlot god you choose to forsake your father with. <br>
<br>
I await the answer to these questions, since I suspect that many are not so different from I as they would like to think.<br>

ooc: <br>
Im such a good little instigator, arent I? ::smiles innocently::<br>
<br>
ic:<br>
How would I judge those who enteryour lands, murdering your guards? I believe they are wrong to do so, of course. To go out of their way to kill dark elven guards is of course not right. Cold-blooded murder is never acceptable and I would never join a party intent on doing so. Those who wish to pass through your dark forest peacably, though, who are attacked have every right to fight for their lives. I myself have killed one such guard of Nektulos when he attacked the Knights I traveled with. Do I take pride in his death? Nay, of course not, but neither was it cold-blooded murder.<br>
<br>
But when you go out into the light and slay the druids whose crime is nothing more than standing guard at their rings, welcoming those who arrive by the magics of the gods, is that not the same thing? To leave one's own home with no intent other than murder?<br>
<br>
The difference is that you kill for Hate. Those who hunt you do so out of fear, for themselves and their families. That does not make it right, but it makes it understandable. Who among the lightborn does not fear the name of Tier'Dal, and with good reason. No, it does not make the murder of your sentries acceptable. It does not justify it, but it does make it understandable.<br>
<br>
As to your second point, Faeolin, there is a difference between only the strong surviving, and the strong hunting down the weak. In nature the stronger, faster, and healthier survive because they are best able to adapt. They do not proclaim themselves the strong, the Chosen, and go about culling those they decide are weak. The lioness hunting upon the plains of Karana does not claim she is chosen among the gods' creataions when she slays the lame elephant calf, she only follows the course that most easily provides her cubs with meat. <br>
<br>
But strength is a fickle thing. If that lioness is hit with a blow from the elephant's tusk and herself made lame, she will then be hunted by the wolves who are in full health. It is an unending cycle where one is never on top indefenantly. That is the beauty of nature. In the end, looked at from afar, all are equal, all have their day on the top. Their is balance.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, though, those who cannot protect themselves need to be guarded. Does that make followers of nature hypocrites? Nay, for in offering protection they are helping to keep the balance. The mighty bear has no natural enemies to speak of. With tooth and claw she protects herself and her family from preditors. But what of the hunter who stalks with blade and bow rather than tallon and tooth? How is the she-bear to guard her cubs from that danger? For that enemy she needs the help of those who would see that nature go undesturbed.<br>
<br>
The war within myself is my own concern and that of my closest friends only, Faeolin. But rest assured that not only is it a battle I will win, but that it is in no way against the will of Tunare. It is the Mother who guides me and gives me strength, filling me with the love she offers to all of her children.<br>
<br>
Perhaps many are not different from you, Dread Lord, but I am, as are those I call my closest friends. Ever will I walk a different path from you and those who follow the same beliefs, and I suspect that ever will there be strife between us. Truely I grieve that, for I wish that the harmony and balance of nature could apply to all. I pray for that future...<br>

you admit yourself you never had any intention of staying with the Knights when you joined. YOU TOOK AN OATH!!! You swore to uphold the three tenets of the Knights. You have admitted yourself therefore to be a liar. When you spoke the oath without meaning the words you were doomed. Even the maggots of the Harvest are true to their word and know loyalty, even if it is misguided, and they therefore have my respect if not my love. For you I now feel nothing.<br>

Fear chuckles darkly as the argument between the Lightblind Merecraft and the Darkhearted Sria brews, becoming ever more deeply steeped in Hate. Thinking upon their words she laughs out loud when her thoughts wander to the misguided Na'Verdis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Na'Verdis, it is ironic, is it not? You who are so &quot;good&quot;, who would give your foolish life for these pitiful Knights are turned away because your skin is black like mine. Yet the fair-skinned Sria is taken in even when she walks in sweet Darkness. How can you not see what fools these Templars are? They judge on beauty, not heart, when picking and choosing for their petty family, lest they tarnish their prescious appearance. Those who do not meet their standards of beauty are cast away and left to perish. Such is the way of the Lightwalkers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, but come home to the Darkness, Na'Verdis. See the lie of the Light for what it is and turn away from it. Come to me and repent your ways, for the Father is forgiving to His children. I am destined to help you return to your rightful home, Lost One. Come willingly and show the Father that you have seen the truth. Come willingly...or I begin my hunt.&quot;<br>

Shaede walked through the hall of the Harvest, still trying to find her way around. Stoping here, in this hall of Chronicles, she saw the numerous notes brought upon by Kassy.<br>
<br>
A look of abject hatred crosses her features as she grabs parchment and quill to add her own words to the others found here.<br>

Merecraft,<br>

I simply cannot believe the audacity you have coming here, spreading more of your lies. I encountered Kassy less then a moon's cycle ago in the Desert of Ro. She spat words of hatred toward me, it was good to hear those words coming from someone claiming to be lightborne, yet the color of her skin confused me. <br>
<br>
You see, after we talked for a while it became clear why she hated me. Kassy hates me because of the Knights. She was told through venemous lies that it was MY fault she was not accepted. Do the Knights Templar hide their own prejudices through lies? During the time I was blinded by internal conflict I attempted to join the Knights...<br>
<br>
I do hope the harvest understands that when Innorruk destroyed what I was, he also destroyed the creature that poisoned my mind.<br>
<br>
During the time I was attempting this, I was told in no uncertain terms, that no matter what the circumstances the Knight's would never allow a dark race to join them. The words that exist on their very own charter explain that their purpose...their function...Is to destroy the dark races.<br>
<br>
Yet Merecraft here explains to us that she is under their protection...<br>
<br>
Further proof that the Knights are far more corrupt and vile then the darkest of our brethern. The poison and bile that pours from their venemous holes in their face soils all of Norrath.<br>
<br>
I name all of the Knights my enemy. I name all of them liars and dogs. I would sooner spit on them then let the pureness of my hatred be soiled by the honorless prejudice and lies that make up their auras.<br>
<br>
You are a mockery to call yourselves Knights. You are a joke. A sad tale told by drunken bards when their material runs dry.<br>

Vresk gazes idly as the Teir'Dal stormed out of the hall, his red eyes revealing nothing. He had been sent to the Teir'Dal by Grand Master Glox himself to learn more about them. To, if at all possible, *become* them. Yet the way they let their emotions run rampant disturbed the monk. Emotion, even the all-powering emotion of Hate, was merely a tool to harness energy and lend one's blows strength...or sap such strength. The Iksar shrugged. All things, even this, would be revealed to him in time.<br>
<br>
Of late, the monk's demeanor had changed slightly. He had taken to seeding his words with little &quot;barbs.&quot; He found that by using them correctly, he could incite the Hate within his guildmates. He found that by issuing them at the correct time, he could cause them to bottle this Hatred (for decorum at certain times would not allow visible displays of conflict). He hoped that by doing this, he could help teach some of the more wild Teir'Dal to channel their energy more effectively to constructive causes. Like the elves and humans. Time would only tell.<br>
<br>
The monk also briefly reflected on those the Teir'Dal called &quot;Lightborn.&quot; He noted a majority of these claimed to denounce Innoruuk's teachings. Yet it was quite obvious by their behavior that they fed the Dread God with their own Hate. To judge one by the color of their skin and not their actions was second nature to these. And the actions of others of &quot;dark skin&quot; seemed to justify wholesale murder of those they knew little, if anything, about. He reflected on the concepts of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;.<br>
<br>
Many had called the Iksar &quot;evil.&quot; Vresk accepted this without much thought. &quot;Evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; was a state of mind. He'd learned long ago that &quot;evil&quot; merely seemed to mean that his values were different than their own. His own people, if they knew the true nature of his actions, would bill him as &quot;evil.&quot; The &quot;Lightborn&quot; called him &quot;evil.&quot; Very well. If that made them feel better. Because of their blind Hate (or whatever they chose to call it), they would never realize that to him, they were the evil ones. <br>

I do not know nor care what you were told. In my experience 95% gossip is made of only half-truths and lies. Unless you see something with your own dark eyes do not think that it is so. Kassy's petition was turned down for reasons I will not go into here, but it had nothing to do with you or the Harvest, do not think so much of yourself!<br>

As for your comments regarding the Knights, well just watch this space is all I will say for now. You will be seeing a lot more of me, as will all the Harvest.<br>

I would say that I applaud your bravado, Merecraft. Unfortunately, you come across as a blathering idiot, to think you could threaten one of the Harvest within our own guild hall. I had known that most knights were foolish, but outright insanity I would have thought to be beyond you. I look forward to seeing alot more of you, I think your hide would look good right beneath my chamberpot. That is where you will end up if you continue upon this course you have set for yourself.<br>
