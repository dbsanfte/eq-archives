Part 24.</span><hr size=1> Consciousness returned slowly, the blood red haze of meaningless dreams fading into the bone deep ache that life had become.  Without opening his eyes, Khasirath slowly stretched each of his limbs, feeling the familiar burning through every muscle.  Slowly he moved more, arching his back until he could feel that burn throughout his back and his chest and his stomach.  Reawakening every fiber of his body with the pain of rebuilding.  Then he lay back again, stilling himself as he focused on his breath, deepening his chest as he focused on the air moving in and out of his body.  And as he breathed, he meditated, reciting the litanies of Hate within his mind.<br>
<br>
Once the litanies were done, he opened his eyes.  The chamber was almost pitch black; the lantern Tzanntiel had left in the corner was unlit.  But he could still see well enough, his eyes translating the heat of the stones around him into sensible images.  Even this form of sight caused an ache deep behind his eyes.  He resisted the urge to rub them, knowing it would only bring greater pain.<br>
<br>
Rolling over onto his side, Khasirath steeled himself and pushed himself up onto his elbow.  After a moment’s rest, he sat up more, until finally he was sitting cross-legged on the bedroll.  A water skin and a bowl of roasted meat waited for him next to the bed, and he picked up the skin, ignoring the food for the moment.<br>
<br>
As he drank, he thought about the progress he had made in the past few days.  With the life force of the creatures Tzanntiel brought him, he had healed all of the wounds he had sustained in his torpor.  But the magics could not rebuild his strength and muscle for him.  He was working out as much as he could in his pathetic state, but he tired quickly.  The more he thought of his infirmity, the more the rage filled him.<br>
<br>
Even as a boy he had always felt strong.  He had mastered and trained his body, molding himself into a perfect Knight of Hate.  His body had never betrayed him like this before.  The weakness that followed resurrection was a dull throb when compared to the pain that every waking moment was now.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel had offered him herbs that she said would dull the pain, but he refused them.  Without the pain he feared he would have nothing to drive him on.  In ten years he had lost so much.  But whenever he thought on that, he pushed it away by remembering his purpose.  He must regain the strength he had lost so that he may properly serve the Father.  He had ten years to atone for.<br>
<br>
After he finished his water, Khasirath drew himself up into a kneeling position.  Though the pain drew a hiss from his lips he reached forward, and picked up the weights he had fashioned by filling some small sacks with remnants of his gear.  Each day he added a bit more weight to them, keeping them as even as possible.  Slowly and methodically he began to exercise his arms, lifting the weights at different angles, working each set of muscles in his arms, shoulders, chest and back carefully.<br>
<br>
As he exercised, he focused his mind, drawing the pain deeper into himself, melding it into the hate at the core of his being.  The hate and pain became one, so that he was better able to master it.  He concentrated on his breathing as he moved, drawing in deep full breaths.<br>
<br>
Once his arms had had enough, he knelt forward and carefully stood.  His balance was returning swiftly, but he still hadn’t recovered full trust in it.  He walked around the room, pausing now and again to stretch out the tendons of his legs, leaning against the walls of the small chamber to squat and crouch.  He stopped at the entrance of the room, looking down the sloping passage.  Tzanntiel had warned him of the traps she had set, and he knew that for now that he was in effect a prisoner here.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel had left him sometime earlier to go to the meeting of Hate’s Culling.  He did not know how long ago that was, for he had fallen into a deep sleep yet again.  He also had no idea when she would return, but he had no doubt that she would.  No matter how much Tzann followed her own pleasures in life, he knew that she was devoted to him, and to their House.  Let the others believe the half-truths she showed them, he knew her better.<br>
<br>
After walking the length of the room twenty times up and back, Khas knelt to pick up the short sword that Tzann had given him.  He unsheathed it and tossed the scabbard onto the bedroll.  Standing once more in the center of the room he began to go through the steps of the katas he had learned as a boy.  He practiced the motions slowly, moving as smoothly and evenly as he was able.  Though weak, his body remembered the routines.  And he admitted that his hand was steadier than it had been the day before.<br>
<br>
After the fourth kata, Khasirath returned to the bedroll and resheathed the sword. Picking up a fresh water skin he drank more slowly.  Finally he picked up the bowl and began to eat.  His mind wandered as he sat, remembering the distant past.  Before the Violent Harvest, before the Flame of Hate, back to the time before he had been accepted as a Knight of the Lodge of the Dead.  The memories of his schooling at the Spires of Innoruuk filled him.  From when he was little more than a toddler until he was a young man, he’d lived at the school.  The lessons, the training, the discipline and the truths of Hatred that he had been shown all came back to him.  The faces of the Priests who had been his teachers stared back from within his mind’s eye.  He couldn’t help but imagine the way they would react to seeing his weakness now.  He grit his teeth as he pushed that thoughts away.<br>
<br>
Settling back down on the bedroll, Khas pulled a blanket over himself.  It disgusted him to admit how tired the effort of exercising made him.  He settled the short sword at his side in easy reach, and sighed deeply.  Listing his left arm, he pushed back his sleeve.  In the darkness her ran his fingers over the multitude of scars across his wrist.  The memory of each ceremony flowed back to him, the rich sensations of drinking from the Bloodstone Chalice, the preternatural bond it formed between himself and the other members of the Harvest.  He wondered if somewhere, some of them yet sensed him, if his awakening might have registered somehow on their senses through those bonds of blood and hate.<br>
<br>
Feeling the tiny puncture scars from the vampires’ fangs, Khasirath frowned deeply.  The scars from those bites covered and distorted the scars he bore for the Harvest, for the Father.  They were his badges of honor and dedication, and the fact they had been marred, defiled, by such beasts angered him greatly.  Soon, he would have to see that they paid for their actions.<br>
<br>
Closing his eyes, Khasirath grew still.  He let all the hatred and frustration he felt flow down deeply into him, banking it all for when he would require the strength.  As the calm of that focused hate filled him, he slipped into meditative prayer.  If sleep was to embrace him again, he wanted to have his communions properly completed.<br>
