Fearsome Sucess (RP)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
General Zirrix stood, in the storeroom area of the crypts of T’Rhennic Keep, and looked around for the portrait. He remembered seeing it in his early childhood, but until just today, had completely forgotten it even existed. But, the day’s events had sparked the flames of memory within his soul. He had just returned from the raid into the Plane of Fear, the home of the God Cazic-Thule. It was a brilliant victory for all who attended. The leader of his guild of the Violent Harvest, Creapiing V’Etch, and the Winnower of the Harvest Selilya Ka’Trael, had organized the raid. Zirrix had been on many campaigns in his almost 47 seasons, and this one was exemplary. From the initial preparations of the raid, through it’s actual implementation, it was an outstanding affair. The groups were well balanced, they all performed their functions without fail, and the progress was steady and efficient. Many of the Harvest were there, as well as several allies. Most notably the Warrior Subati had come to hunt with the other Children of Neriak this day. Zirrix marveled at how many, and how fast, their enemies fell to their swords and spells. Magical treasure, almost more then could be believed, flowed from the defeated enemies. By the time all was done, the Plane itself lie silent and still, all denizens vanquished from its frightening realm. Zirrix wondered that it was a pity the Deathmistress had not chosen the path of a Warrior, she seemed to have a natural talent for command and strategy. The raid was profitable as well, even Zirrix himself came away with a particular item.<br>
<br>
That is what led him into the crypts of his Family’s Keep this night. He was a Warrior, and a Warrior always fought with a sword. Be it a massive two handed one, or two of whistling sharpness, the sword was the mark of a Warrior. Zirrix however, had come away with a very different type of weapon, one for which he had no intent to acquire. In fact, he had almost declined to take possession of it, but then something deep inside him made him accept it anyway. It was the shadow of an old memory, of a thing from the past, that commanded his hand to grasp the weapon. Instantly, and inexplicably, he felt comfortable with it. It seemed he wielded it naturally, and with great skill and ease. Odd, because he had never used such a weapon before. But, there was something tugging at his consciences, that carried him into the storerooms of the crypts, to find out why. After a short time, he came upon the answer to the mystery. He found why the new weapon seemed to recognize him and serve him so well. Zirrix stood and looked at the answer for a long time, then he turned and left the crypts. He would return to the Dreadlands to continue his campaign against the Drachnid menace. As he left the Keep, far below in the crypts, darkness and silence once again engulfed the past. In that storeroom was a portrait, done almost 3000 years ago. <br>
<br>
It was of the founder of House T’Rhennic, Zirrix’s Great Grandsire, and showed him in full military apparel. It was one of the earlier portraits of him, when the Empire had just formed and his Line was just made a member of the fledgling nobility. It was dusty, ripped and did not stand the years so very well. It had become faded, and was thus not deemed suitable for hanging for all to see. Besides, there were more then enough portraits of the founder throughout the Keep anyway. The Great Grandsire looked more like Zirrix then his brother Tzlar, including the dark green eyes. There was now yet another similarity that the raid on the Plane of Fear had provided. For in the portrait did the founder of House T’Rhennic hold in his hand a whip. Unusual for a Warrior, but now three millennia later, the same weapon wielded by his Great Grandson. The weapon, a symbol of dominance and control, was one that a General of the Teir’dal Empire would use well in the coming battles… <br>
