Xareth told her more stories, and took her out into the Nektulos forest to show here many hidden places that the outsiders did not know about.  Knowing the area was a distinct advantage when facing an enemy, he'd told her. Many of the lightborne would have been lost in moments, but Xareth moved about the forest as if he'd lived in it all his life.<br>
<br>
Xilau enjoyed the lessons he did give on the first few days. He explained that these days were designed to allow her to get comfortable with his teaching her, allow him to learn more about the things she knew, and those she didn't. He showed her how to track a wolf through the forest. She learned various footprints of the creatures of the forest, and the various kinds of footprints people and monsters left in passing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here. Tell me what this one is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau bent down to inspect the print. &quot;It's an orc print. A large orc, headed west.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. And how do you know it's an orc?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at the edges of the print,&quot; she explained. &quot;An orc's feet are wider than humans or elves. And the boot must have been in need of repair. Look at the fray marks it left here. And the depth of the print indicates it's size.&quot; She looked up. &quot;A legionairre.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xareth nodded in approval. &quot;Very good. Not many of our people use this skill, but it's very useful in learning about your enemy before you meet it. Did you know what those High Elves were when you attacked them?&quot;<br>
<br>
She shook her head. They'd been mages, and would have roasted her had Xareth not interfered. &quot;How can you tell the prints of a light elf from one of our own?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xareth smirked. &quot;Usually, you can't. But you can tell several things about them from their print. Casters tend to wear soft boots, and many times those boots are enchanted. The edge around the print is much softer than a print that a metal boot a warrior would make is.&quot; He stood and planted a foot next to the orc print, leaving a light, but visible, footprint. &quot;See? My boot leaves a firm edge around the sides. And where the ball of the foot meets the arch, you can see the change in the print when I remove the foot.&quot;<br>
<br>
He returned to his crouching position and looked pointedly at Xilau. Plate boots, on the bottom, must always be jointed, and the soles bendable. Otherwise, they are nearly impossible to walk in. this mark,&quot; he indicated the print with a finger, &quot;is how you tell what sort of metal boot the wearer has on. Enchanted metal boots, like those shadowknights and paladins wear, have tough leather soles lined with the metal on them. Warriors, especially if they have specially crafted armor, will have metal soles, that are lined on the inside with leather. That keeps the boot from pinching your foot as you walk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xilau blinked slowly. That was a lot to absorb. &quot;You can tell all of this by looking at a print? How did you learn to do that? I thought only rangers and druids knew such things.&quot; He chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You haven't met Lyri, have you? She is a member of the guild, though she's Fier'dal. She has forsaken her people to serve the Father, as is right. I travel with her a great deal, and I picked up some things during those travels.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have... a wood elf?? In the guild?&quot; she tried to not look outright disgusted.<br>
<br>
Xareth shook his head. &quot;Another lesson. It's usually a good idea to distrust all lightborn, especially considering how they treat the Tier'dal. However, there are a few lightborn that have proven themselves to Innoruuk, and thus, to us. Lyri is such a one. Payle is another,though she is a barbarian, and there are several more. These would not have lasted long at all had they not been accepted in the eyes of the Triad, and in the eyes of the Father himself. Once your training is finished, you'll be able to look at a lightborn, and tell from his actions and mannerisms, what is in his heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many other lessons followed that over the days, and Xilau took them all to heart. Xareth was very patient, and taught her many things, including fletching, stringing a bow without snapping the string, various practices on all sorts of weapons, and showed her an extensive map of the forest and the surrounding areas. There were even secret passages beneath the human cities she had not known about. He also gave her lessons in showing proper respect for those higher in rank, though she didn't need much actual teaching. The guildmaster of the Indigo Brotherhood had constantly drilled that into her head in her first days there.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're learning quickly,&quot; Xareth remarked one day. &quot;If you keep going at this pace, there will be nothing left to teach in no time at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you rather I learned slower then, sir?&quot; Xilau gave him a mischevious grin.<br>
<br>
He laughed. &quot;Not at all! You're doing very well, considering how hard I've pushed you this last week. It's about time to begin showing you what you'll be doing for the Harvest. Come with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
They returned to the office she'd seen on her first visit here. It still looked somewhat dusty, but she'd suspected it had seen more use in the last three weeks than it had the entire duration of Xareth's having the room.  She sat in the visitor's chair, as she knew he expected her to do as he settled in his own spot across the desk.<br>
<br>
Xareth spoke for a long time, beginning with the history of the Harvest that he knew, of the battles and trials the guild had faced as a whole. He spoke of Nospiratus and his many prophecies, visions that were warnings directly from the Father. He went through the guild hiearchy, noting the ranks of the various guildmates and how to deal with new Seeds, or those who petitioned to join the guild. He even explained the paperwork involved in the task of new petitioners. She contemplated all of this, wondering why she had not been required to go the same route as others.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a great deal to my job than there often seems,&quot; he said at one point. &quot;It's not as simple as handing a tag to just anyone who wishes to join the guild. If we did that, there would be havoc, and far too many problems. You have to listen and watch the new petitioner carefully, and you have to make a judgement call on each on. Will they fit within our ranks, or might trouble be caused? You have to find out before you decide. It's very difficult at times, but necessary.<br>
<br>
Also,&quot; he continued, &quot;you will be required to keep the peace between guildmates should there be any problems. This is not your job alone, however. It's the responsibility of every officer, including the Triad. I find it wise to report to them on the problem. The Reaper is very good at solving problems, and if you have one yourself, do not hesitate to go to the Triad for aid. Allowing a problem to brew within a guild is a very bad idea.&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded. That sounded like a big job, but she should be able to handle it.<br>
<br>
He continued on to explain that she could travel as she wished, and warned her to keep her head about her at all times. Duty always came before the pleasures of hunting, and she should remember that at all times.<br>
<br>
Finally, Xareth stopped explaining. &quot;Do you have any questions?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I beleive you covered my questions. I'll ask you later if I think of something.&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded. &quot;Very well. Now, for one week, I want you to go out into the world and use what I have taught you. Consider it a field test. You will be approached by ally and enemy alike; use your judgement on how to handle things. And return here to me on the 8th day. Got it?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded slowly. <br>
