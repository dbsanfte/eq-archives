Taste of Nothing in Between/*Rp*<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I sat before the sacred urn of Innoruuk at the Spires in Neriaks Third Gate. Sweat flowed freely down my dark lithe form. I was dressed in but a light tunic and my loin cloth. Here I had sat for days fasting, alternating between kneeling, standing and sitting, perpetually in introspection and prayer. <br>
<br>
I had to be purified, purged of the infect of Daydwellers on my heart and mind. At times I practiced my battle dance, fighting the lies and light that sought to corrupt my soul. Images and sounds of past battles filled my mind at various times. Spraying crimson blood, cracking of skulls, the hopeless wailing of my foes as they fell to my ever reporting twin Blades. <br>
<br>
Kneeling and praying to Innoruuk, I reflected on the name I had chosen when bound to the Harvest by the Reaper in that sacred black ceremony. I imagined, remembered the thick taste of blood from the chalice. In this meditation a soft voice fell to my ear. &quot;Do you mock the old way? The ancient mantle of service? My masters are not yet undone. Go to them, they would have word with you..&quot; My eyes snapped open, I whirled seeking the speaker but all I witnessed was a rapidly fading shadow. <br>
<br>
I began to walk from the spires, towards the Lodge of the Dead. My movements were compeled by a force I could not readily understand, but obeyed. I passed easily through a wall of illusion behind this sacred guild, and found myself decending a narrow corrider. At the corriders end was a shimmering door, appearing as ebon deep waters, mystical and foreboding. I stepped through without hesistation. <br>
<br>
Down an obsidian corrider set with runes carved on every inch of blackstone I proceeded. Suddenly the hall was a vast chamber with pillars of alien stone and candelabras mounted with soft errie glowing violet gems. Two cloaked figures stood at the end of this immense chamber. I approached them. <br>
<br>
From under one hood, the ancient voice of a Teir'Dal hissed in Elder speak. &quot;You refer to us, We are alive yet dead, You seek to revive that which has past?&quot; The other woman spoke soft and sibiliant as well. <br>
&quot;Perhaps the time is right... the time..&quot; <br>
The other waved her quickly to silence. <br>
<br>
I knew in an instant, they referred to my annointed name, I had chosen after the Z'Auviirian Order, also sometimes called the Brimestone Cabal. They were an ancient fanatical religous Order of days past, a myth, if not a legend. Now I had to account for my assuming their name. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Zressoth...&quot; One interupted me with a wave of a dark hand, nails that looked as talons. <br>
&quot;You are Zressoth, Of T'Rhennic blood, one of the oldest and most noble lines of Neriak...We know who you are.&quot; I raised an eyebrow then bowed. <br>
&quot;Then perhaps you also know I serve the Prophet of the Violent Harvest.&quot; <br>
The two shot each other a glance. <br>
&quot;Why have you taken this name&gt;? Why have you released the name of your House?&quot; <br>
&quot;When the Reaper of the Harvest called me within their ranks, I assumed the name of this order, I suppose in a romantic fashion, to represent my annoiting and rebirth.&quot; <br>
<br>
One robe ancient caught her breath and was again reprimanded to silence by the other. <br>
&quot;I have felt the depths of darkness from the Mad Prophet of the Harvest, Innoruuk, is with him, He resides in the most sacred and unhallowed grace..&quot; <br>
I nodded to the ancient. <br>
&quot;You will keep this name, you will practice our ways and you will protect him. The Harvest and its triad shall become the very sword and will of Innoruuk. Thier power is growing. You will guard the life of the Prophet, you will serve forever. You are bound now and for all eternity by you rash choices.&quot; <br>
<br>
My vision spun, blackness enveloped me, and I dropped to my knees. As my wits returned to me, I heard one say. &quot;Repeat the vow.&quot; <br>
&quot;Dreadful Father, reach me with the vastness of your gifts. Ridged Father, teach me how to comprehend, I'll convince myself to understand,for I am Thee accomplice. I shall taste of nothing in between, for I am Thee accomplice.&quot; I had only read the words, once or twice in old books of myth and legend, but they came readily to my mind. I prayed I did not error. <br>
<br>
One reached forward with a crystalline dagger and cut a piece of my hair, pocketing it deep in her dark velvety robe. <br>
&quot;And the warriors creed.&quot; <br>
&quot;My Raging Commander, My constant shade, I suffer your duty, Eternal Divinity.Honored I am to mission Thy cause, Unholy awakening of which I intend to bear.&quot; <br>
I felt as if one of them was smiling, it was an odd and unnerving feeling. Finally the one who had ordered vows produced a small vial and handed it to me. <br>
&quot;Drink&quot; she drawled. I balked, I had heard of this herbal concoction. It was deadly, and if one did survive they would be quite mad. <br>
<br>
I set my jaw, narrowing my eyes I drank the entire contents of the vial. It burned violently going down. I was suddenly struck with wracking pain and a shrieking force tearing through my soul and mind. It was unbearable............... <br>
