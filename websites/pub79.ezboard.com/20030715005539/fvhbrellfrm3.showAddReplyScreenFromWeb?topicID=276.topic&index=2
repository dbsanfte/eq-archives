Part 3.</span><hr size=1> Weeks stretched into months as Tzanntiel searched for answers, following the riddle of her sister's vision.  She had not left Neriak much since Khasirath's disappearance, but now she traveled across the whole of Norrath, looking for clues, gathering information, and laying her plans.  Many of her guesses proved wrong as she explored old ruins and cities for signs of her brother.<br>
<br>
Finally she came to Faydwer, the one land on Norrath where she was least welcome.  There was almost nowhere in this mystic land for a Teir`Dal to find shelter or assistance.  But Tzanntiel had a few contacts; informants of looser morals than most, and those rare few who had come to owe her favors whether they wished to or not.  She crossed the dark forests in secrecy, careful to avoid the many light elves who patrolled these lands to destroy those such as herself.<br>
<br>
Passing through the eldest parts of the Faydark, she came to a pass in the hills, and crossed through into a narrow valley that housed an ancient castle.  She moved slowly through the dark graveyard and secret passages into the castle itself.  The smell of death was heavy in this place, and even heavier was the musky scent of the undead.  The lesser vampires and other creatures out in the grounds did not frighten her; but here, within the castle walls, she knew that if she was discovered, she would be quickly overwhelmed by their numbers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father guide my hate,&quot; she prayed deep within her thoughts as she wandered the dusty catacombs.  The shrill piping of gypsy flutes and the dull thump of drums carried through the stone ceiling above her, and she slowed her step again, placing each foot cautiously on the dry and broken flagstones.<br>
<br>
The passages twisted on and on, and she concentrated hard to be sure she checked every inch of them.  Turning down into a short dead end she suddenly smelled something odd.  Something alive, but only barely so.  Crouching down she closed her eyes, drawing in a deeper breath.  Her head turned this way and that as she tried to discern where the faint odor was coming from.  Turning to the left she opened her eyes, and saw that some stones at the base of the wall were disturbed.<br>
<br>
Looking back down the corridors she made sure that none of the castle's creatures were nearby, then she went to the stones and searched them.  They loosely covered a burial niche, a commoner's crypt that housed a body that clearly was not dead.  Tzanntiel touched the pale and greyed indigo wrist that she glimpsed through the stones.  A jolt went through her as she recognized the thin parallel scars across the wrist, and the bracer that lay on the ground nearby, obviously clawed away by the beasts so that they could feed.  A number of their bites marred his skin, unhealed, but bloodless.<br>
<br>
With surprising strength, Tzanntiel pushed away more of the stones, and looked in at her brother.  He looked like he was sleeping, but he was so still that she feared she was too late after all.  She saw the strange wide collar around his neck, and slid her fingers along it.  She felt no hinges, no clasps, only the smooth metal and the strange bumps and carvings of symbols and runes.  His lance lay across his chest, his other hand resting over it.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel stepped back into the shadows at the end of the corridor.  She slipped the emblem of House S`Therik from her pouch and held it tight in her palm, concentrating on her cousin Tevesh.  Focussing on her memory of the baldheaded Teir`Dal warrior, imagining the sound of his voice, willing him to hear her.  She felt a slight dizziness as her thoughts reached him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tzann?&quot; came his confused thought.<br>
<br>
Frowning in concentration, Tzanntiel replied in thought alone, &quot;Tevesh, if our House means anything to you, you must do as I ask, now and without speaking to anyone.  Go to the great ice bridge in Thurgadin and wait for me, you will understand very soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Th'rg'din?&quot; her cousin asked in his usual broken speech.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's no time for questions.  Go now, and contact me when you are there!&quot; she thought fiercely, focussing all of the urgency she felt into the words.  Carefully she returned her House sigil to her pouch and settled back into hiding to wait, her emerald eyes focussed on Khasirath's deathly still form.<br>
<br>
How long will it take him, she wondered.  An hour, maybe two, depending on where he was, maybe less if she was lucky and he had been in Shadow Haven, or somewhere else near to the Nexus of Luclin.  Trying not to worry about it, Tzann found a comfortable place to rest in hiding, and watched the lesser vampires who occasionally wandered the crypts.  Bent and twisted, they were more beast than man, unlike the true vampires, who possessed a keen intellect and were far more dangerous.<br>
<br>
Usually the creatures would walk down the larger main passage, hardly even looking down into the little dead end where Khasirath was buried and Tzanntiel was hidden.  She tried to time their crossings, to see if there was an actual patrol.  Knowing when to expect them would be helpful for what she had planned.  But she could discern no pattern.  Apparently the vampires wandered freely, searching for prey and intruders in a haphazard fashion.<br>
<br>
She had been watching for perhaps forty minutes when another vampire crawled down the main corridor.  But this one paused, swinging its head to look down the dead end with blazing red, bestial eyes.  On its hands and feet it scuttled closer, sniffing at the air.  Tzanntiel shifted her grip on her weapons and waited, still as the wall behind her.  The vampire stopped at the pile of stones, lowering its head to smell them.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel narrowed her eyes as she watched, wondering if it could smell her on the stones, or if it realized that they had been moved.  She crouched a bit as she prepared to fight the thing, if it should discover her.<br>
<br>
The vampire crawled in closer to the niche, turning its back to Tzanntiel as it snatched at Khasirath's wrist, lifting it up to its fearsome mouth.  Tzann's stomach turned at the growling and sucking noises as the thing fed on her brother's slowly moving blood.  In silence she ground her teeth, fighting to control the building rage, wanting nothing more than to destroy the thing for laying its filthy claws on her brother.  But she couldn't be certain of a silent death, and the danger of a fight drawing more of the creatures was too great.<br>
<br>
So she hid and she watched, and she banked her rage, feeling it burn and twist inside her.  Someday she would return, and repay them.  Every disgusting sound of the creature's feeding she absorbed, committing it to memory, stoking the hate within.  It seemed to go on for a very long time before the vampire finally dropped Khasirath's arm to the stones and wandered back into the dark crypts.<br>
<br>
Two more times a vampire walked down the main corridor before Tzanntiel heard Tevesh's thoughts again, saying that he was at the bridge.  She crept back to Khasirath's side, ignoring the fresh holes in his flesh as she picked up his bracer and strapped it loosely onto his wrist, then she looked through his pouches.  It didn't take long for her to find what she needed, a small vial that was made not of clay, or even glass, it looked like it was made entirely of ice, and inside it was a liquid the deep blue of a glacier's heart. <br>
<br>
Carefully she lifted Khas' head, and cracked open the vial.  Through her gloves she could feel the cold of the liquid as she poured it into her brother's mouth, careful not to spill a single drop.  His lips went white as the potion pooled inside his mouth.  She dropped the vial and gripped the little bit of his neck that she could reach above the collar, massaging and squeezing it carefully.  He did not react at all.  &quot;By Hate you must swallow,&quot; she hissed angrily, squeezing harder.  Slowly the cold draught slipped past his throat and suddenly Khasirath disappeared in a sparkling swirl of frost.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel quickly slipped back into hiding, looking through the small niche to be sure none of her brother's things had been left behind.  Once she was certain, she walked back out of the catacombs, hurrying as fast as stealth would allow towards the pass to the forest. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A> at: 1/22/03 2:00:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/22/03 1:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 4.</span><hr size=1> Tevesh paced along the ice bridge in Thurgadin, cursing under his breath at the cold, and the ugly Coldain, and his crazy cousin for dragging him halfway across the world for no good reason.  She hadn't even answered when he told her he was here.  Maybe it was just a joke at his expense.  His armour clanked quietly as he turned again, back towards the gates out of the city.<br>
<br>
Suddenly an odd wind picked up, whistling under the bridge and around Tevesh.  He narrowed his eyes, hissing another venomous curse.  But as the wind died he saw something in front of him on the bridge.  A body.  Stepping closer he recognized it.  Khasirath, first son of his House, the golden boy who was supposedly 'destined' to be his ruler one day.  He looked dead, and there was no sign of Tzanntiel anywhere.<br>
<br>
Tevesh crouched down beside Khasirath's still form and picked him up, surprised at how light he felt.  Standing straight Tevesh looked up and down the bridge.  No Tzanntiel, in fact, no one at all in sight.  He shrugged to himself and walked to the edge of the bridge, leaning over to look down into the frozen jagged caverns far below, where it was rumored the Dain kept all manner of deadly creatures to dispose of captured enemies.<br>
<br>
Looking back at Khasirath's stony grey face, Tevesh raised an eyebrow.  No one would ever find a body down there.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A> at: 1/22/03 2:00:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seed</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/22/03 1:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Visions of Darkness Rising. Part 5.</span><hr size=1> Tzanntiel ran across the Faydark forests this time, using speed rather than stealth to avoid the guards.  In the larger of the Faydarks she loped parallel to the narrow paths until she came to the Combine Spires.  The Scion passed her a fragment without question.  The Combine refused to become involved in the various politics of Norrath, and they kept their Spires open to everyone who wanted to use them.<br>
<br>
Settling in the shadow of one of the immense spires of stone, Tzann tried to contact Tevesh again, closing her eyes as she sent out her thoughts towards him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tevesh?&quot; she sent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea', 'im h're,&quot; came his annoyed reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, good.  Bring him to the Nexus, quickly.  I will meet you there.  I'm waiting on the Spires right now,&quot; Tzann told him, careful even in this form of communication to leave as many details sketchy as she could.<br>
<br>
&quot;Al'ight,&quot; Tevesh growled.<br>
<br>
It wasn't much longer before Luclin came into alignment with the Spires of Faydwer, and their magic enfolded Tzanntiel, carrying her away to the Nexus, deep within Luclin.  There she had to wait, knowing Tevesh would have to carry Khasirath out of Thurgadin through the snow fields to the Spires of Velious where he too would be transported.  She wandered around the platform, losing herself in the busy crowds that always passed through the Nexus, in a hurry to get to this place or that.<br>
<br>
After a time, people began appearing on the platform, surrounded by the cold smell of snow.  Tzann pressed forward, and found Tevesh carrying Khasirath in his arms.  She tossed a spare cloak over her brother's body, letting out a sigh of relief that Tevesh had done what she wanted.<br>
<br>
The bald warrior looked down at her, glowering, but Tzann just smiled back.  &quot;I can never thank you enough, cousin.  Follow me, it won't take long.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tevesh grumbled, but nodded, and followed her to Shadow Haven, to a small house which Tzanntiel had been renting.  She unlocked the door, and had Tevesh put Khasirath's cold body on the bed.<br>
<br>
As he turned back around, Tzanntiel slid her arms around him, ignoring the chill of his armour.  Leaning up she nuzzled his chin.  &quot;Thank you, Tev.  You're wonderful.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tevesh chuckled deeply, slipping his arms around her, squeezing her tight.  &quot;I be s're ye w'll f'nd a w'y te m'ke it upta me,&quot; he growled, one of his hands sliding over her rump as he bent his head down to run his lips across her throat.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel purred deeply as she pressed into her cousin.  He didn't notice the whispering voice from a shadowed corner near the bed.  His arms went limp around Tzann as magic tendrils snaked lazily around him.<br>
<br>
Tzann looked up into Tevesh's blank eyes, a wry smirk on her lips.  She reached up and traced his lip with a fingertip.  &quot;Sorry, cousin.  It's best this way,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
A Teir`Dal woman wearing elegant sapphire robes stepped out of the shadows behind Tevesh, watching Tzanntiel with an unreadable gaze.  An ornate scimitar was sheathed at her belt and in her hand was a staff topped with the black head of a cobra.  Its tongue flicked out now and again, its hood twisting as it looked around the room.  The woman stroked a fingertip across its scaled brow as if to soothe it.<br>
<br>
Stiffly Tevesh turned to face the woman.  Her sapphire eyes looked into his with a touch of distaste.  &quot;You did not see Tzanntiel or Khasirath today.  Nor did you see me, and you did not come to this building.  You did not go anywhere out of the ordinary, or see anyone unusual.  You decided to go out for a night of drinking, which you will do once you leave this place.  You will thoroughly enjoy yourself, but remember very little.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tevesh blinked slowly, his face slack, his whole body limp as he swayed slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you understand me, Tevesh S`Therik?&quot; the woman asked sharply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he muttered, as if asleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good.  Now go and do what I told you, and remember nothing,&quot; the woman pointed towards the door, and Tevesh wandered out slowly without looking at Tzanntiel or anything else.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel turned to the woman, letting out a soft sigh.  &quot;Thank you, Kassy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kassy turned away from Tzanntiel, and walked to the bed.  She pulled the cloak away to look down into Khasirath's face.  Gently she ran her fingertips along his cold cheek.  &quot;Just take good care of him, Tzanntiel.  That will be thanks enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tzann nodded, watching Kassy's back.  &quot;I have to ask you not to try and follow us.  It will be dangerous until I have freed him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Frowning, Kassy turned around, her eyes dark.  &quot;I could help you find a way, though.  I know quite a bit more about magic than you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, Tzann nodded, &quot;I know you do, but it is far too dangerous.  I have much better chances of keeping him alive alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kassy turned her back on Tzanntiel again, looking back at Khasirath.  &quot;Fine.  But if you fail, pray to your dark god that I never see you again.&quot;  With a whispered incantation, the Enchantress vanished.<br>
<br>
Tzanntiel closed her eyes for a long moment, steadying herself.  Then she went and locked and trapped her doors and windows, double checking that all the windows were well covered.  Somehow she felt the worst was yet to come. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzanntiel>Tzanntiel</A> at: 1/22/03 2:01:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8E236B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub79.ezboard.com/bvhbrell.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kassylightborn>Kassy Lightborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Na`Verdis</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/23/03 12:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/fvhbrellfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Summoned by Darkness</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Several days before Shadowhaven</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Kassy yawned as she walked through the dark streets of the human city. In the time that had passed since the day when the Violent Harvest had set the land ablaze with the flames of Hate the city had rebuilt what was destroyed, reinforced what was not. The Tier'Dal had never fully forgiven herself for being away from her home when the axe had fallen, but she'd had little choice in the matter.<br>
<br>
Silently she passed closed stalls in the merchant district, darkened tents, and quieted homes.  Luclin was reaching her zenith when she arrived at the simple wooden door of her two story home.  With a word and a gesture she released the wizard lock that held the door fast. Though there were none in the city of Qeynos who would dare to enter the home of a powerful magic user, let alone a dark elf, there were reasons for keeping it secure.  More than once she'd overheard young boys daring eachother to sneak in and return with some trophy of the Tier'Dal's. She'd chuckled, but started using the magical seal anyway, more for the safty of the local children than that of her things.<br>
<br>
As she pushed the door inward, the bottom caught on something. Parchment scraped against the stone floor with a quiet crackling.  Kass bent, yawning again, and lifted the folded letter, closing the door with a soft nudge from her foot as she rose.  The parchment was unaddressed, in fact entirely unmarked, which was odd.  With less than a thought globes of light appeared in the four corners of the room, soft blues and pale yellows illuminating the room fully but without the harshness of daylight or the flicker of candles.  Studying the exterior in light proved no more useful than in darkness.  She cracked the wax seal and unfolded the letter.<br>
<br>
For an instant time stood still. Kassy didnt blink, didnt breath.  She only stared at the image drawn upon the parchment.  After a moment she noticed the writing below the precise drawing. Her silver brows furrowed slightly as she read the note again.  Then she nodded and dropped the parchment to her work table.<br>
<br>
When the sun rose the enchantress' house was once again wizard locked and empty. On the table in the living room lay a single piece of parchment, a sword of thorns emblazened upon it in red ink.<br>
