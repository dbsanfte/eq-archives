This is also based on what I've read that the different classes of items (I, II, III) correlate to the level of spells they will effect (&lt;=20, &lt;=44, =60).  <br><br>My feelings are somewhat supported by my tests last night.  I have what I'd consider good gear for my level (L55) and have several class II focus items and my concern is the level restriction.  Not one single spell that I played with last night was effected by the focus on my items.<br><br>Why I think the spell level restriction should be removed:<br><br>The only purpose of doing this that I can think of is to encourage 'item levels.'  For example an item with a class I effect would be outgrown by the time you're in your 20's so you would pass it down (sell depending on server) to younger players.<br><br>The problem with this is that if you don't posess an upgraded item you and are forced to keep your class I item, you just became less powerful by leveling up into a new spell range.<br><br>A player with a few nice class II items just lost all their benefits when they got their L49 spells.  It's unreasonable to expect them to upgrade all their items to class III effects or suffer without those effects.  A virtual downgrade in power if you consider that these items are being added to increase caster power.<br><br>Secondly, the effects apparently don't scale in power, they only increase the level of spells that they will effect.  So if I had a class II effect and hit 49, to gain the same benefits I had before I'd be forced to upgrade my equip.  That just doesn't make sense, upgrade my equipment to stay on the same power curve.<br><br>It just doesn't seem right that I would arbitrarily be forced to outgrow my gear.  Some of it might be hard to upgrade and will be used for a long time, yet will have lost its focus benefit long before.  <br><br>As an analogy, you don't see the damage bonus on weapons decrease as you level up, it increases.  Why should the bonus on caster armor decrease as you level up?  The percent doesn't technically decrease, but if it stops working for you that's the same thing.<br><br><br>This isn't a rant, it's just feedback that I had no idea where else to post. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/udygaroftest.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dygar of Test</A> at: 6/4/02 2:42:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uozmandias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ozmandias</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(6/4/02 2:53:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/bigmaxxx/skelstretch.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Focus effects (no spoilers)</span><hr size=1> I'd love to find some format to give feedback on these items =(  I figured there'd at least be a cloaked GM on last night, but petition went unviewed all night.<br><br>There is some definate tuning needed on them still.

Now they do and they are still complaining.  Remember, if a melee class wears level 30 armor when they are level 60 they are no longer as efficient as a level 20 with that same gear.  Sure they still can tank, but they can't tank as well as someone their level in uber gear.  The same should go for casters.  Upgrade or suffer.  This is the nature of loot and the nature of upgrading equipment.  Until now you never had to worry about it, at level 60 I saw casters using gear a level 30 could attain easily.  Well now you have to upgrade or you suffer.  Or you could not upgrade and just go on playing the way you have for the last 3 years, without the new spiffyness that is the focus item.  The level limit was put in place for a reason.  You hit the nail right on the head when you guessed it above, just live with it and upgrade your gear every 20 levels as opposed to every 5-10 a melee has to.  Oh, and I almost forgot, comparing weapons and armor is like comparing apples and oranges.  Comparing the scalability of Melee armor to the scalability of Caster armor is a better idea.  Like I mentioned above Melee's have always had to upgrade or suffer, and I believe that it should have been the same for casters since day 1.  And before you dismiss my arguements as that of a Melee who knows nothing about caster items, my first character was a Wizard, so I do know how caster items have scaled in the past.  After I got my mid level gear with my wizard I stopped rolling in randoms because I really didn't need to upgrade my gear anymore, I had 255 int at level 45, the only possible reason I would have to upgrade equipment was +mana items or if I wanted to be a smartass +AC items. <p>________________________________________________________<BR><a href><font color=#CC90FF><i><b>"I am a Child of the Universe.

We've been suffering, so now you need to too&quot; posts.  Typically they just make me want to rant, but I'm not going to waste the time.<br><br>Bottom line is, the focus items need to be tweeked.  Impskin Gloves, a rare drop from a 26th level rare spawn in SolA have Affliction Efficiency I.  Sounds great, but a group who is able to get these gloves is going to have absolutely no use for the focus effect on them.  To put it in a language a melee can understand, it's like killing a 26th level mob and getting a breastplate with a recommended level of 51.  Sure, you can use it, but you don't the full effect from it.<br><br>There are many other examples of focus effects that don't make sense for the level of critter that drops them.  Grey Flesh gloves drop from a 51st level mob.  They have amazing stats, so I'm damn happy about having them, but the Focus effect (Affliction Efficiency II) is useless since by the time i could hunt this beast I was casting 49th+ level dots.  (on a side note, I never managed to get a pair myself.  Luckily, I know some of the nicest people ever who hooked me up).  <br><br>I agree with Dygar in that the effects should just be upgrades of previous effects.  Affliction Efficiency I could be a 15% reduction of mana, 20% for II, and 25% for III.  It would match up against melee equivilents much better then, IMHO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uaphroditex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aphroditex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(6/10/02 6:02:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Focus effects (no spoilers)</span><hr size=1> Oh, but you don't understand.  That wasn't a &quot;stop your bitching! We've been suffering, so now you need to too&quot; post.  It was a &quot;stop your bitching because you have no right to bitch about being treated fairly&quot; post.  Everyone has hunted down the big mobs and clicked the corpses to find an item with good stats but some crappy effect/proc on it.  Everyone has looted garbage newbie items off a mob that was so hard it took 2 groups to kill.  Live and learn boys, this is nothing new and no reason to bitch because you suddenly have to deal with it like the rest of the classes have.  My level 53 wiz is perfectly happy with her level 1 and 2 items.  Why? Because they still effect spells she uses.  Maybe not everyday spells, but at least it affects something.  Hell improved damage 2 makes the level 44 nuke more mana effecient than the 51 draught of fire.  Add in mana effeciency 2 and it's even better.  Just cause you have a better nuke in your eyes because of it's level doesn't neccesarily mean that your old nuke wouldn't outclass it with the focus effects in place.  Spell haste 2 + mana conserve 2 + improved damage 2 = really fuggin good lvl 44 spell.  Think of it that way instead of thinking that lvl 2 items are a waste to you.  Melees have to upgrade their haste items to stay effective, why shouldn't you have to upgrade your focus items?  Give me one good reason why I should have any simpathy for your whining about a POSITIVE change and I will shut up, but until then don't bash me for pointing out your ungratefulness.  All you succeed in by complaining is making Verant not want to add anymore focus items.  Do you want more, and potentially better focus items or not? <p>________________________________________________________<BR><a href><font color=#CC90FF><i><b>"I am a Child of the Universe.

When they announce that they are done with caster balancing, then you can complain, but until then don't make the programmers pissy listening to your whining.  All that serves in is skewing their choices in favor of less enhancements. <p>________________________________________________________<BR><a href><font color=#CC90FF><i><b>"I am a Child of the Universe.
