Our group managed to do substantial damage (most of our group said we had him to half, but I think 2/3 is probably more realistic, we were pretty pumped up about fighting him by ourselves for a little while, it was exciting) to Naggy before anyone else showed up and it started me thinking.<br>
<br>
With a good buffing and all group members at 100+ MR FR unbuffed:<br>
<br>
1 52 warrior with a high taunt weapon<br>
2 52 + Bard <br>
2 52 cleric both with heal legs<br>
1 rogue 52 <br>
<br>
Bard one plays standard resist tunes<br>
Bard two plays SoS over and over (80 pt or so Rune every 6 seconds) I've used SoS in ToV and it's substantially reduced the damage my group takes when twisted in with resists and the right instruments.<br>
<br>
Would this group have a shot at downing Nagafen?  Would two groups of this makeup stand a chance?<br>
<br>
I've read raid guides for Naggy and Vox and most are written for production servers where you are really just going to zerg the dragon to death anyway.<br>
<br>
I've just now gotten to watch some of the higher level mobs get beat on, and I've been fascinated by the difference coordination and preparation make in accomplishing kills.  I always thought it was just the difference between being level 50 and level 60 but after being allowed to tag along on some raids (Especially this Rhaz guy in Sra, he's the nastiest thing I've ever personally seen in EQ) and watching the organization roll along, I've been trying to figure out a way to apply it to some lower level encounters while developing some high-level coordination for some lower level folks like myself who could use some practice in a situation where we don't kill a whole raid full of uber players and embarass ourselves.<br>

With current gear, 2 groups of 52's (no exceptions) with 80 gear resists should be able to take Nagafen down without buffs from higher levels *if* they know what they're doing and work well as a team.  You'd be surprised what one group (or even a partial group) can do if they work well together and know their class and the abilities of the other classes.<br>

One thing.  SoS, if continually twisted with itself rather than played nonstop, would be an 80 point rune every 3 seconds or so.<br>

<br>
Also with that small of a group at some point Naggy would get pissed enough at your cleric(s) to start smackin them and once that happens its going to be over quick.<br>
<br>
Would be cool to see a 6 man group do it I think its more feasible for the right 12 man group to succeed.<br>
<br>
12 man group:<br>
<br>
2 bard<br>
2 rogue<br>
6 warrior/monk<br>
2 cleric<br>
<br>
The funny thing about the prod zerg rush that I never saw succeed (at least the zerg raids I went on) was that it was a mass of 40+ players that would charge in then run out to get a heal (in the idea of keeping clerics alive longer).  Problem with this is you have the dragon running down people with aggro, missed hits because of it, people not hitting becuase they are trying to get a heal etc...  Every missed hit and non hit is regen'd hitpoints and if you want to overcome that constant damage is the key.  I think the above group could do it fine, main thing also being everyone having some refresh item for the buffs that get stripped (once every 15 seconds).<br>
<br>
I had quit EQ before the raid group Kroak and I set up on Seventh Hammer took down Naggy with 14 people, best I was actually in was a 19 person group.<br>
<br>
But now I'm looking forward to doing the dragons as a shaman (woohoo buff and heal) and seeing how that goes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now that I do know about it I bet Naggy COULD be done with six but it would be tight and require some uncommon clickers to be used (such as prayers of life and bladestopper).  I'm certain after my experiences with him that he could be done with 10 people even without that rune effect.  12 people is pretty safe, we owned him with 14.  <br>
<br>
One thing I would change with your group however is your tanks.  Believe it or not about the best naggy tank you can get at that level are monks with decent HP gear because CH + Warrior still isn't terribly efficient at that level yet.  However monks tend to have great AC at that level and avoid many hits plus they keep agro well and can use stonestance early in the fight to lower damage and therefore force less agro on the healers who won't have to heal him as early.  Basically monks end up being more efficient uses of your mana using smaller heals than warrior are with larger ones and you'll need all the efficiency you can get with this crew.  Your other melees should be rogues with decent haste items.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem your six man is going to have is healing.  Its going to be a long fight so you'll need two mana pools.  They will also need clarity of some sort.  I'd say go to one bard but then you may be screwing yourself on the rune.  Also this won't really end up as a six man group in truth because you'd need buffs from outside this group.  You simply won't do it without chanter buffs for instance.<br>
<br>
Heres the group I'd use and the general strat:<br>
<br>
monk<br>
rogue<br>
rogue<br>
cleric<br>
shaman<br>
bard<br>
<br>
The reason for the shaman is because if you truly want to do this with 6 people, you're going to need SOME kind of haste and you MUST have 2 healers if for no other reason than agro control on healing.  The other option I can see working is:<br>
<br>
monk<br>
rogue<br>
rogue<br>
cleric <br>
cleric/shaman<br>
enchanter<br>
<br>
The upside to this is you will have the best haste which will be critical.  If you use the shaman you'll have more buffs as well at the sacricfice of a bit less healing efficiency.  Also the chanter can rune for extra 'healing' and initial damage absorbtion which gives tanks more time to build agro.  I think this is the group I would use rather than the bard.<br>
<br>
Notes on gear/strategy:<br>
<br>
Everyone with absolutely killer resists and a right click item to absorb breath.  Best haste you can get on each melee.  The monk of all of them needs the best gear as he needs ac/hp/resists.  The other nice thing with a monk is they are better able to maintain ac with resist gear.  Monk would use prayers of life then bladestopper for early fight heals.  Clerics would group heal when melees hit about half and otherwise use smaller heals/celestial.<br>
<br>
You could go through all of that, or you could kill naggy with this group:<br>
<br>
mage<br>
mage<br>
mage<br>
mage<br>
mage<br>
cleric<br>
<br>
Bomb naggy with level 52 fire pets.  Use the cleric to 'pull' naggy to the back of the lair then have the buffed firepets charge Naggy at the back of the lair.  Use a few crap buffs on each pet as well.  Sure the pets would get hit with fear, but likely not all every time and you could have the mage ready to dispel as well.  Have rows of mod rods for each mage and cleric as well.  I'm pretty sure this group would eventually kill him.<br>
<br>
Anyone know five level 52 mages on Test?=)<br>

What if the cleric got feared.  or the warrior?  You'd be @#%$.  Remember, it's not the fact that it doesn't happen often, but that it can.<br>
<br>
I can take the efreeti solo, but that doesn't mean I can always do it.<br>
<br>
Also, AFAIK, Fear is level, not resistance based.  Level 39, Mebon had 100+ magic, and headed for the hills first fear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uh0110w.showPublicProfile?language=EN>h0110w</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(4/15/02 7:44:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raar</span><hr size=1> I totally wasn't disagreeing with you Akay, just pointing out that at 50, 51, and 52, I didn't see much in the way of fear from Nag or Vox. I remember back at 47 I was feared about 6 times in one fight, against Vox, with my dru, and each time I totally left the building. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Hehe. Now, however, I haven't had fear land on him that I remember... in contrast, to agree with Pag, dropping in on WL when Wuo is up (Heh, should fix his Sky faction again) usually results in my dru running pell mell with a merry dragon in tow. Just trying to shed some more light on the subject, not disagree with what you had already stated. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>------------------<br>
