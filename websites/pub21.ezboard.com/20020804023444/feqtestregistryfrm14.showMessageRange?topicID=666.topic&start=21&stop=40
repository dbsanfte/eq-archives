And it was quite public when Velious and Luclin were being tested.  No information was posted on public message boards, but people knew about it.  So why the sudden secrecy if it is indeed PoP?  <br>

I dunno, I'm not going to speculate.  And I'm not holding it against Pantheon that they're following Gallenite's orders and not saying why they're here.

GMs moving folks to test things is fine. Remove the characters when the testing is over though. If the person enjoys Test Server, that is great and welcome to the server. Start over from scratch like so many of the other players on Test<br>
<br>
I attempted to move my characters using the VI character transfer service. I would of been more than happy to pay the $100  dollars and not have equipment.<br>
<br>
VI said &quot;Sorry but we can not do transfers to test server.&quot;<br>

You might find waiting for the information to be posted more rewarding than taking offense for a group of people you don't play with in a game aspect you aren't participating in on this server.<br>
<br>
This is Test Server, and chars can be wiped tomorrow within the disclaimers accepted at login.  Willing to accept this, it would surprise me one playing here this long would take offense at something much less egregious, like test activities occurring and people coming to this server without your being briefed.<br>

Or, maybe you can incite enough trouble to get a fresh breath of air blown back off the server, and we all lose.  Time will tell. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3707>Brujo Cuatlique</a><BR>

I hear they are great people and here for a reason. Let's not freak out if that's the case.  <br>
<br>
I was also told they would not be staying...maybe that is or is not true. Regardless, it is done. <br>
<br>
 The biggest concern I have is the precedent it sets. If when the testing is &quot;done&quot; they are rewarded by being allowed to keep their characters here and on Innoruuk, to play at their leisure, I can see how many many people who were unable to move their production characters here, who test or dont test, might get upset. That's the danger. Everyone knows &quot;really nice people&quot; they would love to move to test.<br>

<br>
Let me start from scratch here, because the last thing I wanted was to turn this into an argument.  I'm stating how I feel, not trying to convince you that I'm right or that your views are wrong.<br>
<br>
The Test Server community as a whole is often treated as second class players.  We put up with the constant server crashes, zone drops, accidental item wipes, and rollbacks.  We have no network of guides and GMs to help us with issues such as being stuck under the world or having an item disappear.  We pay the same money and don't ask for any compensation for the work we do.  And yet we stay, because we are testers and we enjoy helping to make sure the game is as bug free as possible before patches go Live.  (maybe some of you are here because the server population is low.  If so, you should just stop reading now because you'll never understand my feelings).<br>
<br>
Many of us, me included, left thriving characters on production servers to move here and help with testing.  I personally left a 52nd level cleric, and my wife left a 51st level rogue.  We asked if we could have them transfered, naked and bankless, and were told that Test doesn't allow transfers.  <br>
<br>
So after all the struggles, starting over from scratch, earning our way on a new server, we're told we're not good enough to test, and we can't be trusted.  Wha...?  Why do we put up with all of it when we're just going to have a whole guild transfered over in full equipment to test what the server probably already has the resources to test?<br>
<br>
In my eyes, it's just another instance of the Test server community being treated like the red headed stepchild of the production world.  Or worse, it may just be blatant favoritism towards the guild of a developer. <p>Catath Furball - 53rd Shaman<br>

Thing is, majority of themembers of Balance / TSF been here from the get go, and testing stuff is just their thing. They enjoy it, they want to do it, and it makes them happy.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the minority, hell, I may be the only member of Balance / TSF that feels this way, I personally play on test to do just that, PLAY EQ. Testing stuff for developers is not an interest of mine, although I have yet to refuse to do it because that's what all my people want to do, therefore, I go do it with them.<br>
<br>
It's still fun, I love all my peoplezes, and I have a good time.<br>
<br>
But if they copied a hundred top tier players from another server to test all the retuned mobs, new contents, UI, etc.. wouldn't phase me a bit. I could only hope everyone wouldn't get all flustered and feel betrayed and quit the server, which would likely happen.<br>
<br>
I doubt they would be able to find 100 players from other servers willing to sacrifice there own character advancement time for testing tho'.. the ones that are willing, for the most part, are already here. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146689"> Shau Tse </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uthoranis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoranis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(7/18/02 1:32:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Bah, I'd never leave the server over something like this.

Hell, I'm not even offended by it on a personal level.  I'm only 53rd level and could never hope to help test the stuff that they are probably working on right now.  It just feel like a slap to the community as a whole, but if the people getting slapped don't mind, who am I to bitch about it?<br>
<br>
To draw a really bad analogy: it's like leaving a good job and starting over at a better company in an entry level position.  You work your ass off, climb the company ladder, and finally get to the highest position you can reach.  And then the CEO brings in a bunch of consultants to do your job.  <br>
<br>
Sure, some people are happy because they don't need to do the work.  Others though, enjoy the challange and think they earned the right to at least attempt to complete the work.  <br>
<br>
And call it pride if you want, because I guess that's what it is.  I am proud of the community that this server has.  The constant server problems tend to weed out people who aren't committed to the idea of the server.  The people that are left are some of the best, most dedicated testers and players around.  Seeing them left out and replaced in the testing process by an outside group just rubs me the wrong way.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I shouldn't feel the way I do.  Maybe I should be happy that the job is getting done, even though it's not being done by the community.  But I'm not.  I can't help the way I feel about it. <p>Catath Furball - 53rd Shaman<br>

Yes, that is a bad analogy.  Because test server wasn't doing its job.  Stuff just isn't getting tested as it should, particularily at the high end.  Verant needs stuff tested, though.  Heck a lot of the high level people who have complained here have also refused to test things.<br>
<br>
Test isn't your server, it's not my server, it's Verant's server.  And since testing obviously isn't getting done now as it should, I'm not sure why people are upset when production players are temporarily copied here to help fulfill this and meet Test Server's objective of actually... testing things? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uxelenesolyric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xelene Solyric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 367<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(7/18/02 1:50:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> I think a lot of people are upset for one reason: they didn't get moved/copied, and other people did.<br>
<br>
Not that that's not a valid reason to be upset, jealous, or whatever.  If I'd had my pitiful level 35 bard copied over last April when I started here, maybe I'd be 60 by now.  At the very least, I'd know all the languages at Master level.  ;-)  If Rohane's level 50 magician had been copied over, he'd almost certainly be 60.  <br>
<br>
But instead, I have a level 54.7 bard, who doesn't know all the languages but did make the appropriate decision to be agnostic this time around, and he has a level 60 rogue.  /shrug such is life.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, just recognize it for what it is: jealousy.  It's ok to be jealous, and upset because of it.  It's ok to feel, in your heart, that you'd be just as good a tester as anyone for first-tier content, if they'd just moved your high-level character over when you started here.  It's a very human feeling.  But don't get it confused with what's &quot;best for the server;&quot; so far, these folks have been good for it, not bad.<br>

Finally, it's unknown what will happen to The Pantheon, Test Edition when whatever they're here for is done with.  Maybe they'll all be left here, maybe they'll all be deleted.  Maybe they'll be offered a choice; their Test or Innorruk copies can be deleted, but one has to be.  Who knows?  None of us do, they probably don't even know for sure.  Maybe someone at Verant knows and maybe it's still old business on the weekly meeting agenda.  The point is, *we* don't know.  And that's an important thing to keep in mind. <p><a href = http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282419><img src=http://www.boondock.org/images/xelene_ezboard.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#292929><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ucronealus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cronealus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(7/18/02 2:12:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/feqtestregistryfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Welcome &lt;The Pantheon&gt;</span><hr size=1> I swear, sometimes some of the people on this board act like those old people who spend their day on their porches, eavesdropping on all they can see and hear and complaining about what they observed to each other.<br>
<br>
Test is a TEST platform.  Despite the fact that us indigenous Test Players can test many things for Verant, there are plenty of things that single players, whole guilds, or even TSF couldn't test for them.  <br>
<br>
Truth is, high-end guilds on production servers have better gear, and in many cases, better experience with a large number of endgame encounters.  It's no surprise that Verant would want to bring over a production guild with realistic gear/experience to test some high-end encounters for them, quite possibly Planes of Power content.<br>
<br>
The Pantheon's here for the same purpose we all are here on Test for.... to Test.  Whether or not they eventually leave, don't feel threatened or offended by their presence here -- that's just silly.  There's still plenty of loot to go around.  heh.<br>

<br>
Sometimes you have to feel passionate about the way you are treated. We are raised to feel respect for ourselves so can not understand when others don't treat us that way.<br>
<br>
If you honestly believe that the testing could not have been done with the high end people we do have on the server, then what is the point of them even being there at all?<br>
<br>
As for the new guild here testing, I have no issues with you. I do however hate the fact that we were just simply looked over in favor of some developers own guild on a different server.<br>

<br>
My point is, the danger is exactly what is happening. People raging, drawing attention away from the fact that things might actually get tested...towards how they themselves have been treated.  It is usually the flames, emails, and general disgruntlement that explodes causing all kinds of problems.  That is pretty much certain to stretch out of tolerable levels if they do end up staying.  I myself had my 40th level wizard moved here 3 years ago, have buffed levels....albeit pre 50 levels.  All of which took place long before Kunark...But then came the wipe.  So, even if people are just jealous and petty and want what others have, the firestorm itself is what I fear.  After the wipe people came and went from test for a bit. Until a decision was made to stop the moves entirely.  A few exceptions have been made, but even the exceptions were minor.  It is not unreasonable for people to object to the idea.<br>
<br>
I personally sympathize with the folks who might be outraged.  But, I also accept and welcome The Pantheon.  Someone needs them here, and for me Test is first and formost Sony's platform.  They make their decisions to suit their needs and don't need me to second guess it.<br>
<br>
That doesn't make me dread the firestorm any less.<br>

<br>
unfair stuff happens in RL all the time, what seems to distinguish test players (in general) is the ability to handle that maturely.  <br>
<br>
Those in charge and those getting special treament lie in the beds they make.  THere are often negative consequences.  Sometimes I think those in charge don't anticipate these consequences since I've heard of some really stupid actions/policies/communication break downs...and I suspect that brining this new group over to test is an attempt to try to repair / avoid some of those negative consequences.  <br>
<br>
Whether or not their actions now are in their or our long term interests is uncertain.  Personally, I don't mind the fact that some players get special treatment.  It hasn't seemed to hurt the server so far.  For those below uber levels, it seems to barely affect us at all.<br>
<br>
And, I don't really care (except on a philosophical level) whether Verant is acting contrary to long term interests.  If they goof up, hopefully it will help them learn.  So, by all means, people should raise concerns.<br>

<br>
Now that's just silly.  I know for a fact that many of the people in this thread who posted no complaints test stuff all the time.   The fact is, it's foolish to complain that people are brought in for testing unless the complainer already has 60 people he knows who have Vex Thal keys and gear to match ;p  They didn't copy people over to rub your noses in the mud--they copied people over to test some things that few people on test are geared to do.  <br>
<br>
Let's face it, while test has some of the greatest players I've ever played with, it's pretty @#%$ hard to get geared up when the server goes down 4 times a day or your gear disappears a couple times a month.  You may find the fact that they copied these folks over wrong--but I'd bet that you'd find it WAY more offensive if they picked 60 people already here, maxed out their AA skills, gave them Vex Thal keys and gear, and then let them test Super Secret Project X.<br>
<br>
As for me, I regard as an Opportunity to find more people to talk to....muahahahahha <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If they're trying to retune Vex Thal, then yeah, we need a new uber guild here that can do it.  <br>
