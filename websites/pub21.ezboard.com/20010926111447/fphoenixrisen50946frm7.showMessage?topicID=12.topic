Anyway with the last couple of patches I have found that the game has stabillized quite a bit although I am still running into some Lag issues.  Of course I can't really give a good overview of the game because my level 6 opiflex agent isn't very far in game.  But so far I have found the game really enjoyable but the lag in places like Omni one is horrendous (last night my fps dropped to .6fps I'm running a 1.2ghz amd firebird? with a tnt2 on a isdn line) but previous to that it had been going pretty well.  I think that by the time this has stabilized that it will be well worth the money but it probably needs another month or two for it to start working with minimal lag issues.  Also I'm guessing that there will be class balance issues <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but I will add more to this post as I progress. <p>-Deluwen Blackguard

It did cut out some abuses but it also worsened some things.  I tried 3 different missions in Omni-One and of all three I got a Playshift Failed and then some technical stuff.  I tried for well over an hour (probably close to 2 -2 1/2 hours) but had not luck on any of the missions.  But that doesn't mean all of the missions are not working, I got into one with my clan soldier.  Also the lag apears to be significantly better.  But I think the game was better previous to this patch.   <p>-Deluwen Blackguard

Jaelis, 10th level Soldier of Omni, is my char if you stop in and wanna say hi.  I'll put up a few things about it also in the future.  The only complaint I have right now is the lag.  I get dropped &quot;zoning&quot; (although it's not really zoning) from time to time, populated areas are NUTS to try and there are times when you can't do anything for about 2 mins (but I've found that you can still chat through /tells during this time which I thought was strange).  Other than that, for being a newly released game, it's not too bad.  I'm not huge on the futuristic genre, which is why I can't wait for DAoC!!!, but it's pretty cool...if you can look beyond the aggrivating lag. <p><FONT color=0066FF>Reverance Echoblade<BR></FONT color>

I have had several play sessions that have lasted 4 to 5 hours at a time with no discos.  I have also had several days where I just gave up in frustration.<br>
My main concern is the longevity of the game.  The current level cap is 200, and I have seen several in the 50's already.  This game is supposed to have a lifespan of 4 years, and I am betting that there will be some a 200 within 2 maybe 3 months.  The game is supposed to be story driven, but what is the point if you have already gotten to 200?  There has been talk of raising the level cap though.<br>
<br>
As for the game itself, I love it.  I really, really like the whole concept of missions, and being able to equip yourself by choosing what missions you go on.  <br>
The other great thing is you don't have to group.  You can get xp on your own, but if you choose to group, you get somewhere around 75% of the xp for the critter.  So say you kill a critter that is worth 100 xp.  If you kill it solo, you get 100 xp.  If you are in a 6 person group, everyone in the group gets around 75 or so xp.  Unlike eq, where everyone gets around 16 xp.  (this is not exact on my part, and it assumes that everyone is around the same level)<br>
<br>
So if any of you are playing and want to chat or whatever, give me a tell.  I'm either Gosling, a lvl 13 ish neutral Enforcer, or Solarine, lvl 8 Omni Tek Martial Artist (currently stuck somewhere in Omni 1)<br>
<br>
See you all later!<br>

Ok I've gotten Ratdm up to level 26 and participated in my first player run event.  The event was a pvp event run by a level 88 named Magika, it was called Fight Night.  There were several division 1-9, 10-19, 20-29 and some higher devision that i don't know the levels of.  By the time sign up had ended there were around 50-75 people huddled around the areana watching.  There were at least 5 players in every group.  The event lasted around 5 hours with several delays due to people getting in the ring when they weren't supposed to.  <br>
<br>
This was my first experience with pvp in AO and I wise quite nervous when I was called to fight a lvl 23 soldier in my first fight.  After about 30-45 seconds of battle I won.  The match was double disqualification so he still had another chance later on.  For the next 2 hours or so I watched other matches, and generally had a pretty good time.  After a while my next match comes up, and I end up fighting somebody three levels higher than me a level 29 martial artist.  I was nervous and apearently for good reason.  The match starts out and its going fairly evenly i'm at about half health and cast my MK reflect shield (it makes it so i only take 25% damage and the attacker takes 75% for about 15-20 seconds.  Well as I'm casting this he uses his dimach on me.  Dimach is the equivelent of harm touch except maybe a little better.  at my lvl i have around 600 hp and was at about 300 when he used it.  Instant toast, 390 or so points of damage.  Luckily as said before I have two chances.  After getting back to the arena I watched for another hour or so before everybody who had lost in my devision duked it out in battle royale.  I was the winner of that, both me and the soldier took out the beurocrat and then i took out the soldier.  So now its just me and taewandoe (i think thats what his name was) Round two I win with a deflect shield and his not using dimach.  Round three to determine the winner of the 20-29 devision he dimachs my reflect sheild when we were both at half health frying himself for 290 pts of damage.  I won the devision championship and was awarded 30k credits and a pair of ql 129 omni pol elite boots.  It was quite a bit of fun. <p>-Deluwen Blackguard

I had a very good day yesterday I made around 50k credits, went on an invasion of mmd (this is where most of the pvp takes place at the moment) and managed to get a car in a mission chest ( its super low ql but damn it's a car <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  I seriously doubt that I will be returning to eq, I always found the game much to long and boring, I also never had good enough equipment among many other things.  Stability has increase quite a bit but its still not as good as eq.  Pvp is fun but some classes are really really bad at it (meta).  So far I really like what I'm seeing.
