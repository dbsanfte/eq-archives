All I'm pointing out is my thoughts that you are not the same person that I saw in the Qeynos area a while back.

This is the same mysticleesa that we have seen in Qhills a few weeks ago.  I am very forgiving of spelling and grammar mistakes and i think we all are guilty of making them when we are angry or passionate about things, which Mystic is most of the time  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  She is a nice person and a pleasure to talk to when she is not pissed off but when she does get mad then things turn ugly.  She doesnt follow the same rules as us (or didnt, i havent seen her in a while im afraid) and she did TRY to adapt to them at my request.  However, members from her new guild used the &quot;charm bug&quot; on us one day (she was not a member at the time and this may be news to her) and that is how we found out about it.  Yes there were five or six exp deaths from that bug on HR members and we quickly began petitioning it.  Domir used it on someone (was it you Mystic?) and we booted him the next day.  She had a right to be mad about that one and i think we did the best we could to fix it (we kicked him out what else could we do?) yet she will still bring it up to the very end.  Myself and Rheanna attacked her while she was dueling someone at the Qeynos gates.  We had no idea it was a duel and after she respwaned and told me, i apologized to her for a long time because she was VERY upset.  She said she believed it was an honest mistake and accepted my apology yet she brings that up in every conversation i had with her from that day on.  I dont know what her motives are and i dont know why she decided, all of a sudden it seemed, to treat me like crap and call me a liar and otherwise try to make me upset with her.  I found the only way to exist peacefully with her was to ignore her.  I suggest you all do that now as well.<br>
<br>
To Mysticleesa/Misticlisa:<br>
I know that you have some good qualities and i know that you arent totally unreasonable.  However, you do not treat people well when you are angry and you allow things that happen in this game anger you to a point where you are not the same person anymore.  I respect you and hope that you can have fun in this game and not have to be around HR since you hate us so much, but i cannot be expected to hold my tongue while you berate and belittle me to a point of getting angry myself.  That being said, i reiterate my commitment to ignore you and hope that we can avoid each other in the future.  <br>

Yes it is the same person and i have quit coming around looking for a battle.  Fighting with your guild members was fun and i have become quite efficient at pvp now because of those battles.  I am a nice person and have tried to live by the loot and scoot policies, but the was a time frame there that i was being exp killed repeatedly, I was very angry also.  I started letting your guild turn me into a veryu angry and aggressive player, so i quit fighting battles and am now enjoying the game again.  I know that pvp is not a place to go if you want to lvl, it's not really important to get to lvl 50, but you all have reached those lvls and I find it  disheartening that some (NOT A MAGORITY) have used bugs to purposely exp kill me and for what?  You have reached the things that others like me have not.  Yes i chose this server and this is the only server I play on and I dont want to delete my characters because of a few of your members and Platinus have made it almost impossible to log on at times.  I can see a couple of accidental exp kills, but 8 bubs of it is a little hard to swallow.  I didnt follow into the footsteps of doing unto others as they would do unto you in that respect, but if your guild members didnt loot and scoot then i wouldnt.  That non looting and scooting policy applied to your guild when it was being done to me and i have not been doing it since.  I have looted and scooted.  The last time I fought you all I came to HH and was killed.  I let a couple of your guild members know that my lag was bad and that it would take a little longer to pick up gear.  But I would loot and scoot .  Well i get hit a few times to hurry me along.  That was the turning point for me.  If discordant wouldnt have been there i would have been dead, he was telling them to stop.   So i am my old self again.  You all do what you have to do, and if we meet and you attack I will fight to defend myself, but those battles we used to engage in will no longer happen as far as I am concerned.  I can twink myself and I lvl myself so in that respect I cannot lvl as fast as you or have the gear you wear.  As for the exp killing and the lvl I lost, that is something I have to get back on my own.  It's not personal but we bought this game to have fun.  All I ask is that since you were given the chance to fight and lvl give others the same courtesy.  If you cant kill someone on your own dont exp kill them.  Thanks all and good luck!<br>
