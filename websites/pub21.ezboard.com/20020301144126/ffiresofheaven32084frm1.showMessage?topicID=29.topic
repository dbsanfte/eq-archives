I'm not Zamtil, however, I will make you pay for undue flames (though well thought out flames are always welcome).<br><br>Warrior Alternate Experience Enhancements<br><br>First, I would like to flat out state that I am well aware of the feelings of the development and design team towards me, my playstyle, and my philosophy in regards to Everquest. With that being said, amongst my many criticicisms, I have always been firm in my beliefs that you are all competent and well versed in the design and development of EQ. In short, I have stood by your decisions and continued to play this game far longer than 99% of your gaming demographic.<br><br>Now, onto the matters at hand. Warrior class skills in the AA system are 100% useless and do not in any way, shape, or form, represent what a warrior in the game of Everquest embodies. I will not lie to you and tell you that I was not bitter about being snubbed out of yet another beta - Not even given the chance to help make at the very least my class more viable going into Luclin. So now, through a third party, I bring you my proposal.<br><br>1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bodyshield: With this skill a warrior is able to target another player and completely encompass them, taking ALL hits that player may receive during the duration of the discipline. <br>A)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Activatable/Hotkeyed<br>B)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 15-30 Minute Recycle Time<br>C)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once a warrior “latches” on to a player, the warrior cannot do anything but take hits until the discipline wears off or the warrior is slain. He may not attack, he may not taunt, he simply becomes a rather large “rune” of sorts.<br>D)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The skill should have 3 levels. Level 1) Duration of 9 seconds; Level 2) Duration of 15 seconds; Level 3) Duration of 20 seconds. Point costs of 3/6/9 per Class AA guidelines.<br><br>2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shield Mastery: To give the class some diversity and to also make use of the myriad shields available in game, I suggest a skill known as Shield Mastery. Shield Mastery allows a warrior to STUN mobs previously unstunnable, MUCH like the Paladin AA Class Skill. The format is as follows.<br>A)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three tiered system. Level 1 Shield Mastery allows for a warrior to stun HUMANOID sized creatures between levels 55-57. Level 2 Shield Mastery allows for a warrior to stun HUMANOID sized creatures between levels 58-59. Level 3 Shield Mastery allows a warrior to stun HUMANOID sized creatures between levels 60-62. The AA format is again, 3/6/9.<br>B)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To avoid people trying to shortcut shield mastery, the skill will be its own separate hotkey that requires the warrior to have wielded a SHIELD for 1.5 mins before the hotkey becomes active. Thus once a warrior wears a shield and wants to take advantage of Shield Mastery, they will have to actually have a shield equipped for nearly 2 mins before they can begin utilitizing the skill.<br>C)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Additionally, benefits a warrior with shield mastery will receive will be a 2/5/10% bonus to PARRY.<br><br>3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Domination of Will: In short, this is a much needed upgrade to the TAUNT skill. The skills reuse time is 15 seconds. Each use of DoW will add +500 hate to the user, cumulative. Point cost: 5 Class Points.<br><br>4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Glancing Blow: The cornerstone of the warrior class skills. This skill will be innate, it will have a prerequisite of both Combat Mitigation at lvl 3 and Combat Agility at lvl 3. It’s function is as follows: Level 1) The warrior has a 2% chance for any blow landing upon him to do 40% less damage. At Level 2) The warrior has a 5% chance for any blow landing upon him to do 45% less damage. At Level 3) The warrior has a 10% chance for any blow landing upon him to do a full 50% less damage. The Tier Requisites will be 6/9/12 points. Thus, for a warrior to MAX Glancing Blow, he will have to have spent 12+12+6+9+12, (51 Points).<br><br>5)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Frontal Stun Immunity: For 9 class points, a warrior can choose to train to be unstunnable from the front, much like an Ogre. The Prerequisite for this skill is Level 1 Combat Agility. I would like to point out that in beta and in early final, and even in Kunark, frontal stun was never an issue. There were never balance problems with the innate class skill Ogres had, HOWEVER, given the ability of mobs to stun without bash a la Kunark, and the snowball effect throughout expansions with mobs that flurry constantly and rampage, ALL non Ogre warriors are terribly marginalized. Had we known when Everquest first went live that this would have been such an issue, I’m certain many of us would have no doubt gone the route of the Ogre Warrior. Of course, YOU yourselves did not know the imbalance this would cause this late in the game – nevertheless, it exists, it’s not balanced, it needs a remedy. This is a boon for Ogres as they do not have to spend the 11 points necessary to gain this ability and a boon for the thousands of us NON-Ogres who desperately need this ability. Please give this some consideration.<br><br>That is all I have to write for now. I can be reached at furor_foh@yahoo.com if any further questions are required. I am also always willing to help out when asked. I’m not the huge jerk you think I am… thanks for your time.<br><br>Alex<br>Player of Furor Planedefiler<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ugeentrueblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geen Trueblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/14/02 2:11:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warriors in Luclin - Read Up - Commentary/Criticism welc</span><hr size=1> I like the shield one, but maybe it should be a melee arch type ability.

The cost sounds like it's definitely in line with the abilities.<br><br>Except one thing to add is that warriors should have the bard/knight &quot;Physical Enhancement&quot; skill, and should also get a skill that raises our dodge/parry/riposte to slightly exceed that of monks (eg: must have avoidance: 3 costs 3/6/9 to raise dodge/parry/riposte to the equivelant of 5 skill levels higher than monks for each respectively. ie: 3 to raise dodge, then 6 for parry, and 9 for riposte). If monks get rogue damage now, why should they absorb damage better than warriors?<br><br>They could easily scrap that warcry/ae taunt/rampage/bind wound crap to introduce these. <p>Trindade<br>60th level warrior<br><b>Master potion user</b><br><a href=http://www.bladesofwrath.com>Blades of Wrath</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uzoldarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zoldarf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/14/02 3:05:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warriors in Luclin - Read Up - Commentary/Criticism welc</span><hr size=1> Anything that makes shields worthwhile would be a boon.  Stunning would be a good idea.  Maybe have shield mastery give some sort of bonus to the AC from the shield as well.  Or let you swing more often with your primary weapon if you're wielding a shield.  Or lets you bash more often.  All kinds of things can be done here.<br><br>As for frontal stun immunity, I think all warriors should get this automatically after a certain level, without having to invest in any AA points.  Even if it was level 60.  Ogres would have an advantage all the way up to that level, and then things would pare out.  Of course, I play a dwarf, so I'm biased, but it's just bizarre that one race has an ability that makes them inherently better at a class (not counting stat points).  I think kick starts stunning mobs at 54, which helps mitigate the kick/slam disparity between small and large races... I don't see why the same can't be done with the frontal stun issue.<br><br>As for taunt, maybe have the upgraded version put you on top of the hate list by a hundred points or so, instead of just barely on top of the list.<br><br>Another idea would be to have an ability that adds to the AC bonus you get from every point of AC on your gear.  This would have to be expensive in terms of ability points, but tanking is what warriors are all about... may as well have abilities that make warriors more effective at doing their job.<br><br>I see where you're going with the &quot;rune&quot; idea... it would let the warriors not doing the main tanking something to do... ie take the heat for a cleric who just topped the hate list, etc.  That seems like a very overpowering ability though.. unless there was some major downside to using it.  Maybe not let the warrior attack for a minute or so AFTER the effect has run out.<br><br>All good ideas... better than some of the garbage they have now, that's for sure.<br><br>-Zoldarf <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uneoxen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NeoXen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/14/02 3:30:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warriors in Luclin - Read Up - Commentary/Criticism welc</span><hr size=1> Well I remember the &quot;Warriors and Frontal Stun&quot; topic that made quite a stir over on the old noows site, and at the time I thought it was very well thought out and written. <br><br>For the most part there was a resounding agreement to that post.<br><br>That being said, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that VI would step back and see the &quot;big picture&quot; with where the game is now, take into consideration the facts presented, and add this as an AA skill.

Ample pretaunt time and proper aggro control more than make up for stuns, even on flurrying mobs.<br><br>When I read your post, it vaguely reminds me of the &quot;Everquest should get this, this, this&quot; post that pops up on the Safehouse every once in a while.  The post lists several changes that should be made to the game that benefit the player with very little in the way of balance or negative consequences.  I agree with your sentiment, however, the warrior has become less the master of arms and battle, and more the masochistic punching bag.<br><br>Ashes Emberblade<br>Dark Elven Warlord<br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.kabald.org">Kabald</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/15/02 2:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Too overpowering.</span><hr size=1> I think for the most part those ideas you pitched above would be excellent additions, but unfortunately, I doubt VI is going to retool the AA system other than possibly touching up the existing skills...<br><br>I especially like the Shield Mastery... warriors with a reason to use a shield over dual wield would be awesome for those that want to take that route.(although I wouldn't worry about the humanoid only thing)<br><br>And I don't know the exact hate numbers anywhere near as you likely do, but +500 every 12-15 sec seems a little excessive... the same every 20-30 sec would seem a little more on target IMO... especially if this would be an additional taunt button...<br><br>Another to add I just semi-brainstormed(at 5AM in the morning mind you so it might have problems that would make it unusable) would be a 'stance' type ability for an AA choice, which when active would root the player, but reduce their melee damage taken - spell damage would be amplified(since you wouldn't be dodging it at all) and Fear would overwrite the effect(to prevent that obvious exploit) - perhaps instant use/reuse but takes 3-5 sec to get into and out of stance.. <br><br>Honestly, when I first heard of /disc stonestance for monks that was my initial concept of what it did...<br><br>Anywho, hopefully you do get some tuning to the AA skills from VI from your feedback, it seems almost all classes need their choices improved...

Assuming the shield mastery stun % isn't something impossibly rare, you can have a high confidence of stunning the mobs that shield mastery can effect by throwing enough warriors at it.  As I understand, warriors aren't exactly the primary damage output in a raid situation, so what's to stop the non MT warriors switch to a shield 2 minutes before the fight will end to get the stun in at the end?  Like I said, I don't know the high end game well, but presumably you made this suggestion because it'd help dealing with unstunnable mobs that gate/CH/whatever.  But if you've enough people with this skill, then stunning becomes a near certainty, and that'd trivialize the encounter.<br><br>OTOH, if the % to stun is impossibly rare that even with all your warriors with shield mastery you can't guaranteed a stun, then people'd just go back to the ways.  Guilds dealed with unstunnable mobs before there was Luclin, and they'll just go back to those methods.  You'd end up with a skill no one bothers to put point in since I assume stun is supposed to be the biggest part of shield mastery.  <br><br>Likewise, Domination of Will by what you wrote is a taunt that always work (at least that's my understanding of it).  I'm pretty sure EverQuest's hate list works in a deterministic fashion, i.e. what got you on the hate list once will do the same again under the identical conditions.  I understand MT is the primary way to take down uber mobs, and it seems unlikely Verant will give Warriors a nearly guaranteed way to stay on the top of the hatelist.  If someone found out how to stay on top of the hatelist using DoW, then it will always work as long as others remember what they did, and you're back to a scripted encounter, which I think Verant is trying to avoid.<br><br>If you meant for DoW to have a chance of adding 500 aggro, then I stand corrected.  However, I think it's more likely that Verant will add a taunt that does random aggro seeing how the AA has a lot of similar things.  Critical heal/mend clearly increase a class's power, but you just can't count on having a critical heal or mend to save someone from dying.  I suspect if a new taunt is given via AA, it'd be along the same lines as the critical stuff from AA.<br><br>The other suggestions sounds good though, but I think Bodyshield may have balance implications.  Balance is a tough thing to achieve.  I understand you want to have things that improve the warrior class without making encounters trivial, but just because an exploit using the changes isn't readily obvious doesn't mean it isn't there.  And all it takes is one person to figure out how to use a seeming innocent balance change to exploit/trivialize encounters to ruin the game for everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/utindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tindel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/15/02 6:14:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warriors in Luclin - Read Up - Commentary/Criticism welc</span><hr size=1> &quot;, I will make you pay for undue flames (though well thought out flames are always welcome).&quot;<br><br>hahaha <br><br><br>Oh and nice skills there, especially the shield mastery. <br><br> <p><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22658>Tindel</A>Dark Templars - Xegony</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Razinelius</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/15/02 6:49:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Good ideas</span><hr size=1> These are good ideas.

We are big, fat ugly, cant climb cliffs or fit thru doors.  To merely give this ability to all warriors would not be fair.  You want to not get stunned from the front play an ogre.  You make it sound like ogres are &quot;given&quot; this ability over other classes.  Thats simply not true.   We have other disabilities to make up for it.  Playing an ogre is more difficult by far than playing a barb.<br><br>Bodyshield:<br>I HATE how mobs can hit you thru the floor or ceiling.<br>I have always felt that a mob should NOT be able to hit a person standing behind a warrior.  Perhaps a &quot;safe zone&quot; directly behind the warrior where a caster could &quot;hide&quot; behind the warrior?  To lose your taunt and atk abilities while shielding someone would only lower tank aggro and make him need to shield someone even more, while doing less damage and generating no aggro.  Thereby making the tank &quot;need&quot; to shield someone.  The whole idea is NOT to take aggro off the MA.  Perhaps Mr. Nukey should die a few times to learn this, rather than have the tank stop fighting and taunting to shield Mr. Nukey from an aggroed attack he never should have caused.  Nukers must realize that even thought their single 1k nuke gets aggro, its only a small percentage of the damage melee puts out, just not all in one pop.<br><br>Glancing Blow:<br>Nice idea here.  I like it.<br><br>Shield:<br>OK, &quot;IF&quot;, and I do mean &quot;IF&quot; I, as an ogre warrior, I ever used a shield this would have some appeal.  As I do not, it doesn't.  I dont think any warrior should use a shield, are you a warrior or a paladin?  LOL  You get dual wield for a reason...use it.<br><br>Domination of Will:<br>Sounds more like a chanter buff than a warrior skill.  How bout a super taunt that is unresistable and lasts for 30 seconds?  Make it so the warrior  holds aggro if he already has it  for 30 seconds or something?<br><br><br>Just my 2cp, and thats all it is. <p><p><img src=http://www.kerinakreation.com/images/sigs/blewssig.jpg WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=250 border=0></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/uzabookrusher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaboo Krusher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/15/02 12:26:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/ffiresofheaven32084frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warriors in Luclin - Read Up - Commentary/Criticism welc</span><hr size=1> Very good post.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don't think Verant is going to be receptive.
