Fri/Sat nights are really the only time I get to exp now that vacation is over due to Raids and work on weekdays so leveling is alot slower. <br>
<br>
Right now my Beastlord is using:<br>
16/22 +100DD fire based lure proc + stats HTH as my primary<br>
14/19 +ensnare +stats 1hblunt as my secondary weapon.<br>
<br>
My melee skills are all maxed for my level, spells skills are pretty low in some area's. I haven't parsed my damage output at 57 on exping mobs but I did at 56.<br>
<br>
At 56 using the 16/22 above in primary and a 12/18 1hblunt (SoD) in offhand I had the following DPS while doing Possessed corpses in Acrylia:<br>
(using RBG 21% haste and VoG 58% haste == 79% haste, no where near cap for a 60th)<br>
Min DPS: 30 DPS<br>
Average DPS: 36 DPS<br>
Max DPS: 41.5 DPS<br>
<br>
This is while parsing for an hour worth of the skeletons and does not include pet's damage nor proc damage and besides VoG it's with only self only buffs (176str). <br>
<br>
On tormax I averaged 21dps not including procs and 30DPS including procs the one time I parsed it while at level 56. This really means nothing though since I was only 56 with 199buffed str. My ATK value is way too low for that type of encounter (~1100 then with group focus and VoG). At 60 with 252 HTH and 250 offense and 255 str I expect my DPS to be significantly higher on Tormax quality mobs than it was at that period of time.<br>
<br>
The 100pt lure DD proc has never been resisted by anything except Tunare who resisted 3/5  when I was 56 meleeing her.<br>
At 60 I expect most will get through.<br>
<br>
I typically proc with that one weapon for approximately 1000 total damage (10x) on typical Tormax/Statue length fights.<br>
<br>
I haven't parsed pet on any raids and don't plan to till I get the 60th pet. As a level 43rd pet will not compare to a 47th pet in ability to hit mobs of that level. Also our level 59 pet haste that gives 85% haste 100Str 60AC 60ATK will significantly effect the pets damage as that's 85% haste and +160ATK. Also assuming we could use our savagry spell on it for another +100ATK and +50 resist all that could make the pet actually be able to contribute decent damage on raid quality mobs.<br>
<br>
The 3 biggest problems with Beastlords that need to be addressed in my opinion are ranked in order of importance below:<br>
1. 50+ disciplines. We get nothing but resistant/fearless. This is a severe handicap on high end raids and really needs to be addressed quickly.<br>
2. No unique Class AA skills. We got all the generic hybrid AA skills with the addition of the /pet hold skill. That makes us the only class that got zero unique skills. The hybrid skills are very nice IMO, but there really needs to be a couple unique class skills given to us. I'd like to see all pet classes get a skill that makes the pet placed on beta-neutral faction so that it is non-aggro to mobs like the wizard's familiars. Mobs would still fight back if attacked and assist other mobs on their faction, but a lost pet would not aggro a huge ass train like they can now.<br>
3. This might have higher priority after I get 60 and get to do some parsings and tests but we don't appear to really have a niche on raids. We really don't contribute anything but the 3hp/3mana regen buff that rumour has it has some stacking issues with some other buffs and then our sub par melee. Though our melee isn't as bad as it seems after seeing no double attack for the class, but I won't go in or argue this point until I can get 60 and max my STR and do some parsings as it'd be a baseless argument and pointless. For me i'm reserving judgment on this one till I get 60 and another offhand HTH weapon of comparable ratio to my primary. 1hblunt weapons are nice but we cap at 225 in that skill which effects it's performance significantly compared to our HTH which caps at 252.<br>
<br>
<br>
Defensively we have the same skill caps as other hybrids except we get Block instead of Parry. So in essence our tanking will be equivalent with gear that brings our AC up in comparison to another hybrid, which is much much harder for us. Essentially we need the all/all monk gear from NToV to get our AC up to comparable levels as other hybrids. I don't know how I compare with hybrids in hps. I have Approximately ~4100 hps with full raid buffs at level 57, but I also don't have the 10 +100hp gear items most of our melee have so it's impossible to compare unless we do it naked, which I don't remember what my hps are naked offhand though probably around 1800 or so right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as useful on a raid I can't answer that right now, I need 60 all my spells and better equipment and then do alot of parsings before I can accurately answer that one.<br>
<br>
Are pets useful on raids? I can't really answer that either. On some raids we will never use summoned pets due to the 4 pet limit on npc's and charmed pets being infinitely better. Also some encounters pets just aren't a good idea. However there are some encounters like Rhags, Creator, Arch lich etc that theoretically there is no reason to not use pets. But I can't tell if pets will be useful till I do parsings.<br>
<br>
As far as a little bit about our pets. Our pets seem to have a decent hps/ac, though nothing spectacular. I'm not sure if it's a bug, or intentional but our pets are capped at 55 damage. Our 54 pet maxes for 55damage, our 56 pet maxes at 55damage, our 58pet maxes for 55 damage and our 60 pet maxes for 55damage. The only thing that increases post 54 for our pets is hps/ac/ATK/Level. I can add a ~87DD proc to my pet that is based on any resist type I choose: fire, magic, poison, disease, cold and even add a proc that interrupts casting. Magic based 80DD + stun. Though it's resisted alot, essentially the same as the druid Wind based spells. Also I can buff my pets dex, stamina, str and give him some really nice haste +AC +Str+ATK based pet buffs. I can chloro him, and heal him for 1250damage for 300 mana. Right now due to a pet buff bug I can CH my pet for 450mana at level 60 with a ~16sec cast time, and CH him at lower levels for even lower mana costs and faster cast times. Also all our pet procs include a + aggro modifier that makes them ungodly in taunting ability relative to mage/necro pets. If a PC is not in melee range our pet can easily hold aggro in most situations.<br>
<br>
Our pets are also fairly intelligent, though it can be kind of annoying at times also. Our pet will actually switch targets when we engage multiple mobs in an effort to gain aggro on all mobs. We can then backout and all mobs will be stuck on the pet. This can be really annoying at times, or really useful at times. <br>
<br>
Our slow spells are so so in groups until level 60 then their not too bad. Also considering we actually get block/riposte and a higher dodge cap than shamans we could be useful for a earlier 50% slow on uber mobs so that shamans don't have to get ass beat getting in slow quite so early. I'm not sure about this application but it sounds intriguing to me. Our shamans are uber and highly skilled though so not sure if it'll apply in our situation.<br>

Also lower level/hp &quot;Pc/NPC&quot; have an innate taunt by mearly being near a mob since they &quot;look like an easier target&quot; to the mob. HPS don't effect it as much as level, and it's not a huge taunt but it is noticeable.<br>

Spirit of Wind: 0 taunt modifier but includes a stun/knockback effect like the druids wind based spells.<br>

I use spirit of storm mainly because it's huge taunt addition.<br>

Our pet's standard &quot;taunt&quot; is not anything special, you have to use the proc buffs if you want the pet to taunt well.<br>

Just for comparison sake the rangers Jolt spell is -200 Taunt, the reverse of our spirit of Storm.<br>

Exact opposite of mage epic pet. Which would make a great tank if it didn't try to melee from 2 counties over. <p><B><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6122>Grimmlokk</a>, Forlorn</B> <BR>

<br>
This is Eugene's friend that groups with him.  He is right when he says that his pet always out agro's me.  As of what proc I use, it kind of depends on where we are hunting.  I mainly use the poison based one, but if the mob has high poison resist I usually use the fire one or something else.  At my level all of my pet procs have the same amount of Taunt modifier so I don't think that matters much.  Now, if everyone is away from the mob, then my pet will hold agro, but as soon as Eugene sends her pet in, it goes straight to it.  Not really sure what is up with it. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

I like to be in control of myself. I dislike crowds, especially crowds containing people trying to kill me. Even though I always win, I prefer to avoid fights if possible. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>
