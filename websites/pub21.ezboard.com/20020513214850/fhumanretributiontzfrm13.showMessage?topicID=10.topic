Location</span><hr size=1> <br><br>I say unto you, location is everything.  If you choose to build you fortifacation in the wrong place, you will surely be defeated.<br><br>Many have built great castles, only to watch as an invader makes use of a single flaw.  I hope that you, the reader, will gain some insight from this small work I am making.<br><br>Location.  I have seen mighty cities built.  Oft the merchant will claim that a city on the trade routes is the way to proceed.  At this I scoff.  Cities that are built on trade routes gain wealth at an incredible rate.  Peoples from all points of the compass will come and sell in your city, and taxes will flow into your coffers.<br>  And the barbarians and Hostile Hordes will be at your gates in a matter of years.  They will see your riches, and wish them also.  The same trade routes that allowed the fat merchants easy access become paths for armies to tread.<br>  They will thank you for keeping your roads well repaired by removing your head.<br><br>   The elves have a quiant Habit of building their homes in the trees.  The trees are beautiful, and well hidden.  Their archers will rain arrows at you from above.  Your own swords men will never be able to get up the trees to gain access.  You will watch in horror as your men die by arrow, and hear the laughter of the elves in thier treetops.<br>    Alas, though, I am your servent.  Your horror will turn to glee even as the elves laughter turns to screams of panic.  <br>    For you see, Trees have a nasty habit of burning when one applies oil to their trunks, and alighting them on fire.<br><br>    Some brave humans, whose industry is unmatched, will build islands in the middle of a large lake.  They will sit in there houses, and watch with ammusement as you attempt to build boats to cross and get at them.  But I say unto you, you can not build enough boats to float enough men, for as they reach the isle, weights will be dropped on the boats, sinking them.  Or your men will attempt to gain access to the isle in dozens, and be met with hundreds. <br>    But, if the isle is made of wood, again, oil will spread flickering fingers of fire, roasting them alive.  If it is of earth, then they are trapped, unable to leave the island, just as you are unable to get on it.  Starvation is a nasty way to die.<br><br>    Ahhh, the dwarves, though, they have a strong since of mind when it comes to building a stronghold.  With great halls built beneath the mountains, and large store rooms of food.  But this too has its weakness, since they can only leave their strong hold from a few defined places, your only trick needs be locate these boltholes.  And siege machines can cause anvalances, if aimed precisely, blocking all but the largest of bolt holes.<br>   The fight will be a long and bloody one, I assure you.  But with patience, even the dwarven hold will crumble.<br><br>   Do not build your castle on the open plains, thinking that no enemy will be allowed to sneak up on you.  For this will only allow you t o see them encircle your home, preventing you from gaining aid, and giving them clear access with machines.<br>   Trees will burn, and caves closed.  You say then, Khonshu, what are we to do?<br><br><br>    The best location is an island.  Small enough to cross in three days, but large enough that one can not walk AROUND it in a week.  Islands of this size are large enough to stand a siege from sea for some time, but small enough that no enemy can hide a force upon it.  Islands are a nightmare to invade, for your enemy will see you coming, but you will not know how many they will meet you with.  You also can not come at them with more then a token force, unorganized, at any one time.<br><br>    However, the ideal place to defend, is a mountainous archipeligo.  With the sea on three sides, you still have many of the advantages of the island.  With a small strip of land, it is easy to fortify so that no army can overrun you.  The enemy will never be able to bring a large land army to bare on you at once.<br>    Try to ensure that this area has natural springs, and you need not worry about water.  With the ocean, you need not worry about starvation.<br>    Build not only on top of the mountain, but down in it, as well, taking lessons fromt he dwarves.  The enemy will not be able to block holes facing the sea easily, for machines on boats are notoriously unstable.<br>    If the gods are kind, your archipeligo will have small out islands around it.  If they do, you can fortify these areas so that you never need worry about a sea borne invasion.<br><br>    If you find yourself facing this situation as an attacker, then my best advice is to block them in, and not allow them free access to the land.  You will not conquer them this way, but you can turn their advantages against them, and not allow them to leave, also.<br><br>   My friend, if the worst case must happen, and you must conquer such a fortification, then pray to the gods.  You will need their help.<br>   The first thing you must do is deny them the sea.  This means are large navel prescence.  You will need to take the out lying isles from them, and then turn these machines against them.  This will be the bloodiest battle, and I would suggest 10 men to their one, if you can manage it.<br>    Once you have the islands, then prepare your army at the archipeligo.  The only way to win this battle is to overwhelm the invaders.  This means both invasion from sea and invasion from land.  At the same time.  The hope is to force them to protect everywhere, and in doing so, making them weak.<br>     The weakness, if it can be found, will be on the sea side.  This will have the lightest fortification.  Once you have managed a beach head, other vessels must come in close, and disgorge their soldiers.  As the enemy tries to meet you, other places in the sea forts will become weak.<br>    A t this point, the land force must become an anvil, and stand no matter what, as the sea force pushes their way into the center of the fort.<br><br>    Let this be a lesson.  There is no perfect fortification.  There is no such thing as impregnable.  If the attacker is willing to win at any cost to himself, you WILL lose.  The only hope is to sell yourself dearly enough that your allies can gain vengence.<br><br><br>Khonshu <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/bhumanretributiontz.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=magistra>Magistra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/30/01 10:30:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/fhumanretributiontzfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anchient Art of Warfare....

Location</span><hr size=1> I disagree, true with an island comes fortification and almost no army could tear down those walls. Though what you have yet to realize is that we are not building a barracks here we are building a city one that will be used as a home to you and your allies. A city will be where you buy cell and train yourself, would like it if you had to swim across a lake everytime you wanted to get into your house. But still there are some things that can destroy your city even faster then an invading army and that is taxes. Every building requires money to maintain and to improve if your city brings in no profits you are doomed to lose all your buildings. If you are going to build an island base you need to first build one of those rich city's you spoke of and then use that wealth to support your island fortress. <br><br><br>P.S. I can understand how you would think that was a good idea since  I am sure when you made this post there was not much info out on the stucture of the game <p><center><PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="honoron.swf"><PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high><PARAM NAME=scale VALUE=exactfit><PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#000000> <embed  width="288" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" swliveconnect="FALSE" src="http://a1960.g.akamaitech.net/7/1960/25/a112ae567ee0d5/www.batmanbeyond.com/batcomputer/honor/honoron.swf" scale="exactfit" bgcolor="#000000" height="73" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED></center> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub21.ezboard.com/urallasironfists.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rallas Ironfists</A> at: 8/20/01 9:45:31 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/fhumanretributiontzfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/fhumanretributiontzfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/fhumanretributiontzfrm13.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/fhumanretributiontzfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/fhumanretributiontzfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub21.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="humanretributiontzpublicaudience">Public Audience<option value="humanretributiontzlibraryofhumanretribution">Library of Human Retribution<option value="humanretributiontztheinnercircle">The Inner Circle<option value="humanretributiontzhallofchampions">Hall of Champions<option value="humanretributiontzmarketplace">Gahad's Armory<option value="humanretributiontzfrm15">Officer's Forum<option value="humanretributiontztherecruitingwindow">The Recruiting Window<option value="humanretributiontzfrm8">Guildwars and Duels<option value="humanretributiontzfrm16">Human Alliance<option value="humanretributiontzfrm11">Most Wanted<option value="humanretributiontzfrm13">Shadowbane<option value="humanretributiontzfrm14">No Holds Barred<option value="humanretributiontzfrm12">Dabercubb Kegmiester chat<option value="humanretributiontzfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/bhumanretributiontz>Human RetributionTZ</a><font color=#FFFF00> -
