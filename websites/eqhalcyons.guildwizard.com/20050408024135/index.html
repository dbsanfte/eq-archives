									<b>Congratulations, Halcyon! Sweet week!</b> - 
									3/14/2005 11:16:43 AM
								</p>
								<div class="newsBody">
									<font face="Arial" size="3">Well... where to begin?<br /><br />Halcyon's been incredibly busy (as usual) lately, downing one target after another in such a manner that updating the frontpage has seemed like an exercise in futility... and I hate exercise! Everytime something noteworthy is killed, Halcyon has immediately followed that kill with something even more exciting! <br /><br />Our latest and newest kills? Zun'Muram Votal, Packmaster Skoiat Pizak, Pixtt Suir Mindrider, Velitorkin, Pyrique Redwing, Primal Arachnid, Primal Insect, Primal Reptile, Ikkinz 1, Time Phase , Time Phase 2, Time Phase 3, Time's Saryrn, Time's Terris Thule, Time's Tallon Zek, Time's Vallon Zek, Time's Cazic Thule, Time's Bertoxxulous, Time's Rallos Zek, and Time's Innoruuk! <br /><br />We even got to see this big guy:<br /><br /></font> <div align="center"><img src="/pics/2423/TimeQuarm.jpg" /><font face="Arial" size="3"><br /><font size="2">See! They are laughing! They know what's in store!<br /></div></font><br />However, I'm getting ahead of myself! <br /><br />First of all, Halcyon would like to thank <a href="http://www.ghguild.com/">Grey Hawke</a> for pushing their schedule back a few days and allowing us the opportunity to experience our first venture in Time over this previous weekend. Having the luxury of a leisurely Saturday and Sunday for our first visit was very much appreciated! <br /><br />Our&nbsp;initiation into Time actually started with an impromptu midnight rally on Friday. Halcyon, elated from having successfully completed an Ikk1 raid and (as usual) unwilling to retire to our beds, made the spontaneous decision to gather for "Time Trials 101: An Introduction". After buffing and instructions, Halcyon collectively wiped the spittle from our keyboards and pulled ourselves from our late night stupor to gather around the portals and begin clicking in.<br /><br />Or at least we <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Live&amp;message.id=3885&amp;page=1&amp;no_redir=true">tried</a> to. No matter! Despite being foiled by the dials, we still managed to pull off 4 of the 5 trials, the remaining trial having suffered the most casualities from the comedy of errors that was getting into the trial in the first place! A little research and ingenuity warranted success the following day, as we managed to zone in to trials with very little difficulty.<br /><br />Our first real attempt at Time yielded two dead gods! Saryrn and Terris Thule had given up sweet loots before we called it a night. The following day, Halcyon got an early start and managed a victory over Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek (Barely! So intense as the timer began to wind down!), Cazic Thule, Bertoxxulous, Rallos Zek, and Innoruuk. It's at this point where things began to get interesting!<br /><br />We should have known we were going to encounter issues when, upon Innoruuk's death, the time machine (I guess? Whatever that bubble thing is!) normally behind Quarm spawned in the middle of the table in P5. Odd? Sure! Alarming? We've seen worse! <br /><br />Upon zoning into Quarm's lair, we rejoiced! There, in it's awesome, multi-headed glory before us, stood what we've been working so hard towards for the last few months! Quarm stands between us and farm status for the Planes of Power,&nbsp;the beast's inevitable defeat&nbsp;moving Halcyon one step closer to closing the gap between our progress and the expansion curve. It was time to win the game!<br /><br />Buffs! Instructions! Engage! And then ... <b>Poof!&nbsp; <br /><br /></b>&lt; insert swearing here &gt;<br /><br />It was our first Votal attempt all over again! Spell gems greyed out, the mob was nowhere in sight, and there we were standing&nbsp;about seemingly frozen in &lt; insert witty pun &gt; Time! How infuriating to be able to communicate in chats (my virgin ears!) and watch the whole encounter go to Hades! It only takes a google search to increase frustration tenfold, as it's a known issue; they are "working on it", etc.<br /><br />What's a guild to do besides shake a fist and blame Canada?<br /><br />Halcyon's <strike>vocabulary</strike> positive attitude always amazes me! We rezzed, rebuffed and were&nbsp;unable to (once&nbsp;again)&nbsp;contain our&nbsp;enthusiam&nbsp;at the prospect of hanging a head (or two or three or...) in our guild hall as a trophy! Incoming [[ Victory! ]]? Hardly! It was only a matter of&nbsp;moments after Pumak's&nbsp; "When &lt;&lt;&nbsp; Quarm &gt;&gt; Gets An Attitude Drop It Like It's Hot Drop It Like It's Hot'"&nbsp;that&nbsp;we found our second attempt prey to the same uncanny lag. Once again, Quarm disappeared and so did we... to our beds! <br /><br />Sweet dreams, Quarm! Until we meet again... &nbsp; </font>
