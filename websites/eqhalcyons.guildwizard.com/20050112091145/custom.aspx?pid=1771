							<font size="3"><br /> <b>Vision</b><br /> <br /> Halcyon seeks to create and maintain close personal relationships between players while simultaneously building the caliber of the players, encouraging character development through grouping and raiding.&nbsp; Members of Halcyon carry the responsibility of playing well and playing with integrity.<br /> <br /> <b>Conduct</b><br /> <br /> Everquest is a game, a fantasy realm in which players thrill at the opportunity to immerse themselves, leaving real life obligations and responsibilities behind. In an effort to create an atmosphere which optimizes our fellow players' pleasure, it's only logical that members are still obligated to use the same common sense and courtesy as one would give to peers we are exposed to outside of game. It is <i>every</i> member's responsibility to conduct themselves in such a manner that will reflect the guild favorably within our Everquest community. Behavior otherwise is grounds for reprimand.<br /> <br /> <b>Rules and Regulations</b><br /> <br /> It is understood there is no way to address every possible variable that may occur in such a dynamic environment, no set of rules could possibly circumvent all potential problems and conflicts. Knowing such, it is also insisted that any and all guild members conduct themselves with honor and respect for others at ALL times (see Conduct). We assume that members of Halcyon are mature players and we refuse to insult your intelligence by listing possible offenses and possible reprimands. Unacceptable behavior will be dealt with at the discretion of the High Council. <br /> <br /> <b>Guild Heirarchy</b><br /> <br /> The guild is directed by the wisdom of the High Council.&nbsp; The high council votes on policies for the guild, handles disciplinary issues, handles loot decisions (guided by DKP), approves/disapproves issues brought up by the Advisory Council, approves applicants via vote and approves probationary members after review.&nbsp; The High Council is made of seven people: six officers and the tactical leader.<br /> <br /> The officers work with the tactical leader to fulfill all the duties of the High Council.&nbsp; They are responsible for staying up-to-date with guild issues (usually brought up by the advisory council) and thinking deeply and effectively about decisions regarding guild actions and policies.<br /> <br /> The Advisory Council, the High Council's eyes and ears, is comprised of the leadership throughout the guild, with the additions of leadership including&nbsp;&nbsp; class leaders and raid leaders. The Advisory Council actively participates in contributing ideas and member feedback, but not directly involved in policy making. <br /> <br /> Class leaders are responsible for the micromanagement of their classes.&nbsp; They are elected by the members of their class and must be approved by the high council.&nbsp; The class leader is responsible for holding and organizing spells or songs for their classes.&nbsp; The class leader will help new recruits become oriented with guild procedures.&nbsp; Each class leader should have a thorough knowledge of their class (including, but not limited to, needed statistics, focus effects and alternate advancement abilities) but maintain humility in order to edify the classmates whom they serve..<br /> <br /> The Treasurer must be an officer from the High Council.&nbsp; They are responsible for holding all monies, droppable loot and tradeskill items collected on raid encounters. The Treasurer is also responsible for frequently updating a list of available items, as well as dealing with fufilling request for said items per member written request.<br /> <br /> In closing, above we have taken the time to define our leadership, clearly outlining the responsibilities of those who are in charge of our forward collective progression. Leadership is put in place for the sake of the membership. It is imperative that the membership realize that no leadership is infallible, and likewise, that disagreeable short-term decisions are often the result of a more agreeable long-term goals. We support our leaders.<br /> <br /> <b>Raiding</b><br /> <br /> We are a CST/PST raiding guild, intent on exploring new and exciting content while celebrating teamwork. In order to progress, a level of participation is expected from our members. However, raiding attendance is not mandatory. We want our members to participate because they <i>want</i> to, not because they have to. It is your responsibility to aquaint yourself with Halcyon's raiding rules and regulations which are documented in our guild forums. <br /> <br /> The High Council may direct us to raid more or less based on the feelings generated by the members of Halcyon.&nbsp; We believe that raiding an average of four nights a week is a solid pace for building up the gear and flags of the guild.&nbsp; Raids will most often be scheduled.&nbsp; Raids may be added or removed from the schedule at the High Council's discretion.<br /> <br /> <b>Epic Raids</b><br /> <br /> Once a player has achieved level seventy, they may request epic raids in the appropriate forum.&nbsp; These will be scheduled and official raids. After accepting a member's request, the guild will then schedule and provide a raid in order for that member to complete the requested event. If successful, the member then donates the chest loot to the guild in gratitude for their time and efforts. The item that falls in the chest after an epic raid will then be auctioned to the raiders present at a minimum starting bid.&nbsp; The amount of DKP spent on the item auctioned is then divided evenly among the raiders present (rounded to the nearest 0.5).&nbsp; <br /> <b><br /> Loot</b><br /> <br /> Every official raid (official raids must be called by tactical leader or a raid leader and posted on the boards) is worth a set amount of DKP (Dragon Kill Points).&nbsp; Items that drop during raid encounters are worth a set amount of DKP.&nbsp; Players must spend DKP they have earned to acquire a new piece of loot.<br /> <br /> After tells are received from players interested in a piece of loot, the High Council will decide which player most deserves/needs the item.&nbsp; In the case that it cannot be easily decided, High Council may call for the most deserving/benefitting players to roll.&nbsp; Do NOT loot any "no drop" item without the High Council's approval (this approving will often be given through some type of /rsay congratulations member on item).<br /> <br /> Please remember to use the proper format when sending a tell expressing interest in loot. In a tell to the council concerning loot it is best to include a few pieces of detail.&nbsp; First, we need to know if you are a full member or probationary member.&nbsp; Second, we need to know your current DKP.&nbsp; Third, we want to know what you're upgrading.&nbsp; Finally, we need to know if you need any special consideration.&nbsp; That is, if the item has an effect on it, we need to know if you are in need of that effect.&nbsp; For instance "/tell High_Council Member.&nbsp; 423 dkp.&nbsp; Upgrading (link).&nbsp; Do not have haste item." or "/tell High_Council Probationary.&nbsp; 26 dkp.&nbsp; Upgrading (link).&nbsp; Already have ID4 item."<br /> <br /> <br /> </font>
