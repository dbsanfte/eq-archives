As a noun, halcyon refers to a fabled ocean bird with the power to calm the wind and waves while it nested at sea.&nbsp; As an adjective, halcyon means everything we strive to be.&nbsp; Halcyon is a guild emerged from the ruins of many devastated by the hurricanes of change recently plaguing the Everquest World.&nbsp; Formed by people who are dedicated to the game and their friends, Halcyon began with the vision of creating and maintaining close personal relationships between players while simultaneously building the caliber of those players through grouping and raiding. <br /> <br /> </font></td></tr></tbody></table></center> <br /> </div>
