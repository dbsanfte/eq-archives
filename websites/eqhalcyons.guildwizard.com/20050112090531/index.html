								<div class="newsBody">
									<font face="Arial" size="3">After enjoying another evening in Air before the new year, a fun night which the Avatar of Smoke and a few lesser named were added to our downed target list, we made the decision to do the inevitable: <em>backflag</em>.<strong> <br /></strong><br />&lt;Insert collective groan here!&gt;<br /><br />It's a new year and we can think of no better time to start! <br /><br />With the schedule leaning towards targets which will focus our new members on getting up-to-date with flags, the decision was also made to temporarily freeze applications. Applicants who currently are under review for membership are encouraged to join our channel and attend these flagging raids, as once backflagging is complete, our requirements will likely be changing to favor those who meet more specific requirements (such as EP flags!) until further notice. <br /><br /> <center><img src="/pics/2423/marr.jpg" /> </center><br /><br />Last night, Halcyon made a clean sweep of quite a few targets on Karana!&nbsp; Targets included Grummus, Behemoth, and all three HoH trials (Rydda`Dar, Women, Villagers). Before allowing our tired troops to savor sweet sleep, we crowned our evening with a Mithaniel Marr kill. Congratulations to those who attended these flagging raids and are now that much closer to joining us in the Elementals!<br /><br />A big thank you to our leader, Ignatiuss, from all those who were flagged! Three cheers for Shydenn, who did an awesome job trying out that new epic on Marr! And a job well done, healers! Halcyon, you are&nbsp;going places ... &nbsp;<br /></font>

								<div class="newsBody">
									<font face="Arial" size="3"><b><font size="4">Merry Christmas, friends! </font><br /><br /></b>Indeed, Christmas came early last night as Halcyon rallied together outside of Eryslai, The Kingdom of Wind. Giddy, we began buffing up for a little adventure and excitement in the Plane of Air, hoping that our first excursion into the Elementals would be an memorable one. We couldnt have asked for anything more...<br /><br />Our excitement could simply not be contained as we zoned in. A few of us held back smiles amidst the exclaimations of those who had never set eyes upon Xegony's kindgom. It was impossible not to puff out our chests in pride, practically aglow with a sense of accomplishment and good fortune. What a home we've made in Halcyon!<br /><br />In turn, we made ourselves at home in the Plane of Air last night, rejoicing upon the demise of a few of it's residents. Cautious to not expect too much, we explored our way through the zone, leaving Baltaldor the Cursed, Gakamenial Fir`Disralsi, and Queen Silandra in our wake. The end of our night growing near, we decided to press on and try our luck with an Avatar attempt. With only 21 in raid, it would take more than luck to survive such a task.<br /><br />With Pherlondien Clawpike out of the way, it was time. The Avatar of Wind put up a good fight, but soon found himself the bearer of good tidings and joy as those 21 friends stood in awe as they surveyed their fallen foe. We did it!<br /><br /></font> <center><font face="Arial" size="3"><img src="/pics/2423/elefirst.jpg" /><br />Victory! Ignatiuss, our leader, announcing the spoils of war.<br /><br /></font> <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Congrats to all the night's winners! Many great upgrades rewarded to our guild last night! It was fabulous to see the generosity of individuals who passed items won down to those who really had a need. That, my friends, is what makes us Halcyon. And this little beauty?
