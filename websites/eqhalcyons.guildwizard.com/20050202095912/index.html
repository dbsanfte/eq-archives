								</p>
								<div class="newsBody">
									<font face="Arial" size="3">Our members, most just recently Fire flagged from our Solusek Ro kill about 4 days or so ago, were anxious for a tour of of the Plane of Fire! However, finding something to kill anywhere, much less Fire, was challenging! The patches and patches that followed patches toyed with us this week, resetting mobs and generally leaving us with little to do. <br /><br />Never fear! Trust Halcyon to find mischief! <br /><br />Wednesday, now known as the Patch Day 'O Death, we waved the white flag after scouting, acknowledging that we were owned by the server. With little to do, we decided that it was once again time for the Halcyon Hit Squad to make our membership happy with a few epic kills. Congratualations to&nbsp;Kelkay who walked away with the following: <br /><br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32741">Harmony of the Soul</a><br />MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />Slot: SECONDARY AC: 80 <br />STR: +20 STA: +30 CHA: +20 WIS: +30 HP: +195 MANA: +195<br />SV DISEASE: +20 SV MAGIC: +20 SV POISON: +20 <br />DoT Shielding: +2% <br />Required level of 65. <br />Effect: Harmonic Balance (Any Slot/Can Equip, Casting Time: 0.8) Recast Delay: 360 seconds, Recast Type: 6 <br />Focus: Spiritual Blessing <br />WT: 3.0 <br />Size: MEDIUM <br />Class: CLR Race: HUM ERU HIE DEF DWF HFL GNM FRG<br />Slot 1, Type 4 Slot 2, Type 8 <br /><br />Thursday, following an emergency patch, we were graced with General Reparm's presence and decided to be polite and pay him a visit, as he was lonely in Fire all by his little self! Knowing he was one of the tougher minis, we anticipated the fight and were pleased when he was forced to hand over his Fiery Staff of Zha (congrats, Wraithan!) and an elemental mold to add to our ever growing stash. <br /><br />We had assumed that Fire would come alive and begin spawning while we were in the zone and we werent disappointed. After Reparm's death, a Guardian of Doomfire was beckoning to us&nbsp;at the picnic tables! Despite it being our first Halcyon adventure in Fire, we decided to go for it. Why not, eh?&nbsp;The result? </font><br /><br /> <center><img src="/pics/2423/fennin.jpg" />&nbsp;<br /><font size="2">Congrats, Halcyon! Your first god kill! <br /></font><br /></center> <center><img src="/pics/2423/halcyonfennin.jpg" /><br /><font size="2">Where's Waldo?</font> </center><br /><br /><font face="Arial" size="3">Pfft... and Iggy had&nbsp;thought to wait until our 2 month anniversary!

								<div class="newsBody">
									<br /><font face="Arial" size="3">After the headache that is getting folks into Solusek Ro's chamber, you'd better believe that someone was going to die... and thankfully, it wasnt us! Halcyon successfully downed the Burning Prince and completed Fire flags for many an excited individual. Congrats to those newly flagged!&nbsp; <br /><br />While we delighted at the thought of being the bearer of bad news to Solusek Ro's father, Fennin Ro the Tyrant of Fire, our journey into the Burning Lands would have to wait. Instead, we decided to head to the Plane of Water to cool off a bit! After a little exploring, pooka haters convened to take out their TIpt/Vxed angst on poor, unsuspecting Grioihin the Wise. <br /><br /></font> <center><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="/gallery.aspx"><img src="/pics/2423/waterpooka.jpg" /></a><br />We hate Pookas!</font> <center><font face="Arial" size="3"><br /><br /></font> <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Other targets for the night? Hydrotha, Krziik the Mighty, and Ofossaa the Enlightened! All contributed to our elemental mold/pattern stash, which after last night's romp through Air, totals 22. Not too shabby in under 2 months!</font><br /><br /><font face="Arial" size="3">Congrats again, newly Fire flagged! Looks like a visit to Fennin's throne for a 2 month birthday present? <br /><br />Another RZ kill! Sol Ro dead! All Earth rings down! All Water minis down! Three out of four Air rings on farm status! Ding raid 100! How exciting! Awesome job, Halcyon. </font><br /><br /><font face="Arial" size="3">Until next time....</font><br /></div><br /></center></center>

								<div class="newsBody">
									<br /><font face="Arial" size="3">Well, let me catch my breath! When Halcyon declares they are getting backflagging over with ... they certainly mean it!<br /><br />In just a week and a half, the god kills (and then some!) needed for planar progression have been checked off one by one from a very long list of encounters needed by thrilled members looking to complete their EP access. Terris Thule, Grummus, Manaetic Behemoth, Carprin and then Bertoxxulous, the HoH trials, Aerrin`Dar, Marr and Marr again, Tallon and Vallon Zek, Agnarr, Saryrn ... and finally Rallos Zek! All have fallen before Halcyon!<br /><br /></font> <div align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="/pics/2423/rz.jpg" /><br />Have a screenie of our RZ encounter? Send it to me! <br />But for now, Iggy and Dany scoffing at RZ's corpse will have to do!<br /></font></div><br /><font face="Arial" size="3">With the defeat of Rallos Zek, which admittedly is still a challenging encounter 2 expansions later, a large core of our members are ready (and as of last night's massacre in Air... already have!) to join us in the Elementals! A big "Congrats!" to those newly flagged! A Rallos Zek kill marks a huge milestone in Halcyon history, solidifying us as a forced to be reckoned with in the EPs. With a Solusek Ro encounter already being discussed, I sense Fennin Ro starting to perspire! <br /><br />What progression! And in order to continue progressing, we are announcing the following requirements needed to be considered as a Halcyon applicant:<br /></font> <ul> <li><font face="Arial">Level 65+ </font> <li><font face="Arial">Up-to-date Magelo profile </font> <li><font face="Arial">Elemental Flags (Air, Earth,Water)</font></li></ul><font face="Arial" size="3">These requirements will be in place until further notice. Applications pending at the time the freeze is lifted will not be subject to these new requirements. And that freeze? <b>We will be lifting the application freeze today, Saturday, January 15th.</b>&nbsp;<br /><br />As well as flagging requirements, we have taken the time to review our roster and prioritize our needs on a class level. Please note the following chart which outlines Halcyon's current needs. Any individuals meeting the above requirements are welcome to apply regardless;&nbsp; however, priority will be given to applicants who fall within classes listed as needed by demand.

To that, we answer with a resounding "Definitely!". Halcyon endeavors to allow it's members means to progress without defining them by an attendance percentage. Halcyon holds the following vision in high regard:<br /><br />"Halcyon seeks to create and maintain close personal relationships between players while simultaneously building the caliber of the players, encouraging character development through grouping and raiding.&nbsp; Members of Halcyon carry the responsibility of playing well and playing with integrity."<br /><br />... and I think we do just that. Awesome job this week, Halcyon!<br /><br /></p></font>

								</p>
								<div class="newsBody">
									<font face="Arial" size="3">After enjoying another evening in Air before the new year, a fun night which the Avatar of Smoke and a few lesser named were added to our downed target list, we made the decision to do the inevitable: <em>backflag</em>.<strong> <br /></strong><br />&lt;Insert collective groan here!&gt;<br /><br />It's a new year and we can think of no better time to start! <br /><br />With the schedule leaning towards targets which will focus our new members on getting up-to-date with flags, the decision was also made to temporarily freeze applications. Applicants who currently are under review for membership are encouraged to join our channel and attend these flagging raids, as once backflagging is complete, our requirements will likely be changing to favor those who meet more specific requirements (such as EP flags!) until further notice. <br /><br /> <center><img src="/pics/2423/marr.jpg" /> </center><br /><br />Last night, Halcyon made a clean sweep of quite a few targets on Karana!&nbsp; Targets included Grummus, Behemoth, and all three HoH trials (Rydda`Dar, Women, Villagers). Before allowing our tired troops to savor sweet sleep, we crowned our evening with a Mithaniel Marr kill. Congratulations to those who attended these flagging raids and are now that much closer to joining us in the Elementals!<br /><br />A big thank you to our leader, Ignatiuss, from all those who were flagged! Three cheers for Shydenn, who did an awesome job trying out that new epic on Marr! And a job well done, healers! Halcyon, you are&nbsp;going places ... &nbsp;<br /></font>
