      <tr> 
        <td height="665"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The old man once again sat in his rocker, 
            on the old wooden porch and stared off into the distance. I awaited 
            his words: The continuation of the story of Gilgadet. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">But the words did not come.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Instead, he handed me a book. It was Gilgadets 
            journal, and other pieces of paper, written by others. The old man 
            got up and walked away, leaving the story of Gilgadet to me. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I began to read:</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">It was not long ago that 
            I stumbled upon a great man named Aldarin. It was simply by chance 
            that we met at all. I was in Qeynos hills, looking for wolves, when 
            I was suddenly attacked by three Gnoll Watchers. Aldarin came to my 
            rescue with a few arrows planted in the right spots, and a few quick 
            strikes by his axe. It was obvious that with my magic, and his blade, 
            we could make a little money together, not to mention share some good 
            times.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">After a bit of rest, Alderin 
            asked if I wanted to go to the ruins and fight some skeletons. We 
            had heard rumors of the vile beasts attacking any who went to see 
            the beauty of the ruins.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">I had not been to see them 
            myself, for I have spent far too much time studying magic, to prepare 
            myself for the coming attack of my father. To finally be able to see 
            these places that I have heard about brings me great joy!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Our first few fights with 
            these skeletons brought us nothing. They were quite weak, and the 
            time was unspectacular. However, it was not at all long before we 
            had a battle with a fearsome beast known as a dread skeleton. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">It was quite a bit more powerful 
            than it's cousins, and we came upon it battling a noble warrior. We 
            stood in fascination for a few moments, even after the warrior shouted 
            for help. We joined in the fight, and got in a few good hits, too. 
            It was not long, however, that my mental powers were too drained to 
            do battle with it.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">I almost collapsed with exhaustion 
            just as the warrior whom we were helping fell to the ground, dead. 
            Knowing that my new found friend would be getting attacked next, I 
            sprang after it, and attack with my feeble dagger.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">It did no good. The skeleton 
            slashed Aldarin one final time before he too, fell to his death. Knowing 
            that I was next, I ran towards the tunnel to the Glade. With the feared 
            skeleton at my back, I dodged his blows, and made it to the tunnel, 
            just as two of the posted guards attacked and killed it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Turns out this was my lucky 
            day. I sat and waited while Aldarin was restored. It is said that 
            cats have nine lives....I wonder how many we get.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">At any rate, after the incident, 
            we went our separate ways, knowing that one day we will travel together 
            again. I also learned a lesson....Always have a Fade spell memorized.</font></p>
