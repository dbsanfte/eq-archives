          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It was a nice day out, the 
            day that I met Kiedatar. I was hunting lion's in the Western Plains, 
            and I saw him.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He was a large specimen, 
            even for a barbarian, and I heard his laughter ringing out over the 
            plains, even as he slaid yet another lioness. I was a bit injured, 
            and my mind was very weak from the casting of spells. So, I ran over 
            to where he was, and asked if he knew where the nearest tower was, 
            so that I could rest. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He, thankfully, said he knew 
            where one was, and told me to follow him. We were almost to the second 
            tower, or T2, as the locals call it, when we were ambushed by a lion, 
            and his mate. Kiedater valiantly fought the lion, even though he was 
            severely weakened from his past battles.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, the lioness 
            took advantage of my weaknesses, and she slayed me with but a few 
            slashes of her claws. I appeared-yes, yet again, in front of Qeynos, 
            the city to which I am bound.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I ran back to the plains 
            as fast as I could, but still, it took almost an entire day, and I 
            wondered about the fate of my barbaric friend. It was not long that 
            I found out.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He too, was slaid by the 
            lion, and we bonded in a way that can only be found in mutual death. 
            He and I decided at that point to travel together, and, as he put 
            it, &quot;get back at some of this wildlife.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">What happened next surprised 
            even me. As we hunted lions and lioness', we began to speak of our 
            past. Not mine nearly as much as his. Nay, I did not tell him of my 
            father, or his campaign against me, but I did speak a bit about my 
            guild. But, as sad as my story is, his was just as sad.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">His beloved teacher, apparently 
            a great Barbarian warrior, disappeared several years prior to our 
            adventure. He went into some hills west of Halas called the Everfrost 
            Peaks, to do battle with a great Ice Drake, that was threatening the 
            town. Everyone was awed by his courage, and his willingness to help 
            his people. However, no one ever saw him, or the Ice Drake again.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Inspired by his master, Kiedater 
            decided to become much like him. Brave, honorable, and strong. He 
            gained a great distrust in magic, and shunned most magic users. I 
            was honored that he even kept company with me. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">By the end of our adventure, 
            I discovered that he eventually wants to assemble a party of great 
            warriors, and go find his master. I can only hope that when the time 
            comes, he views me as honorable and strong enough to go with them. 
            This would make my Guildmaster proud.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">At any rate, our conversation 
            soon went to different things. We spoke much on religion. I think 
            that all the gods of Norrath are the same...or at least use the same 
            source of power. It seems that Karana and his Great Spirit have much 
            in common, although there are enough subtle differences to make the 
            justification that they are two completely separate entities. This, 
            however, was not as important as our discussion of the &quot;evil&quot; 
            in our land.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I did not recount my travels 
            with the Order of Oblivion, rather, I played the devil's advocate, 
            and told him that the evil of man is much more frightening than the 
            evil of the gods, or the evil of nature. Such atrocities as the Scarecrow, 
            or the Treant is apparently the work of man--or madmen. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Ahh. I digress. Our evening 
            ended after making about five gold apiece on high quality cat skins. 
            I went to T2 to rest with him, and when I woke up in the morning, 
            he was gone. I can only hope I see him again...Indeed, for a barbarian, 
            he has much knowledge.</font></p>
