      <tr> 
        <td height="1103"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">My guildmaster has always 
            told me that there are many different powergroups in our world, and 
            that they all deserve respect...even if the said powergroup is &quot;evil&quot;. 
            I suppose my guildmaster believes in balance, and as such, evil is 
            a nessasary part of life. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">There was a time that I might 
            have scoffed at such a remark. Until I met Helgrim, of the Order of 
            Oblivion. They want chaos to spread around the world, reguardless 
            of the fact that it says &quot;order&quot; in their name. Maybe they 
            should call themselves the Chaos of Oblivion...hmmm. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">At any rate, I was approached 
            by Helgrim, and he asked me to join his party, as they wanted to hunt 
            giant spiders, and were in need of a wizard.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I had to think long and hard 
            about this, as I knew I would be helping them improve themselves, 
            however, I needed a party to gain better insight into my art, so I 
            accepted.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">During the course of our 
            adventure, we cam across a ranger named Rhinno, and a bard named Persecutis. 
            I did not get along well with Persecutis, with all his singing and 
            shouting while we were fighting, but I can not deny the fact that 
            it inspired us somehow.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Our adventure was short lived. 
            We began by slaying spiders, and grizzley bears without much trouble. 
            After one close encounter with a grizzley bear, I turned and saw the 
            biggest creature I have ever seen. A hill giant.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It was huge, towering well 
            above the trees, and swinging a hammar, made from an ancient oak, 
            and a large boulder. Everywhere he went, destruction was wrought. 
            You might think that they would be easy to outrun...on the contrary, 
            they are extreamly quick, as two of my comrades soon found out.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I backed up, and hid behind 
            a tree, hoping the stupid giant didn't notice. Helgrim, who also saw 
            the beast shouted, &quot;Rhinno, Pers...RUN!!!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The two took heed to the 
            warning, however it came a bit too late. I watched in horror as the 
            giant swung once with his hammer, and took the lives of both of my 
            friends. Although Rhinno came back to join us, I fear we may have 
            lost Persecutis forever.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After a bit more hunting, 
            Helgrim said he needed to go to Qeynos for supplies. Rhinno and I 
            decided to travel together a bit more, and hope for better luck. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Upon seeing a giant spider, 
            we attacked, and prevailed with little difficulty. However, as I bent 
            down to see what was in the belly of the beast, I saw some strange 
            colored hair creeping up on us. A Scarecrow!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I tried to back up, but the 
            creature was much too fast, and it slayed me with one swipe. Rhinno 
            valiently tried to heal me before I fell, but a brown bear kept him 
            from accomplishing his goal. It was not long that I appeared-yet again-in 
            front of Qeynos.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">What did I learn from this 
            journey? I suppose that the world really is a balanced place, for 
            Helgrim was not much different than I, a humble follower of the Karana. 
            I also learned that caution is much advisible, even when traveling 
            in a party. Each time we were careless, someone died. Therefore, I 
            will always watch my back.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Rhinno and I decided after 
            the last incident to part ways, however, we will join up again some 
            other time.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I traveled back to Qeynos 
            in reletive safety, and went back to my Innroom, only to find a letter 
            from my good friend, Aldarin. He told me he found a little known spot 
            in which to hunt Gnolls. I suppose I'll try to contact him, and see 
            what this is all about.</font></p>
