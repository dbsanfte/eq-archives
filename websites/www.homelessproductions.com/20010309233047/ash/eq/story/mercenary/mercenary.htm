        <td> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">It spread out before him, the emense, dark 
            Kithicor Woods, through which he must pass in order to meet his friends 
            in the Commonlands. Scytalix Atreides knew the woods were well know 
            for the number of travelers who spent days trying to find their way 
            through. Some had never emerged from the other side. It was not because 
            dangerous creatures lived admist the huge trees. The Kithicor Woods, 
            in fact were known to be quite peaceful. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The canopy of dense leaves overhead blocked 
            out most of the sun's light from the twisting trails below. Some of 
            the trails had no final destination, they just gradually faded away, 
            leaving whoever had followed them in a dark sea of identical trees. 
            During the daytime, if one knew their way, a person could follow the 
            correct trails and find their way out to the westernmost part of the 
            Commonlands. At night, however, a thick, wet mist settled, making 
            it almost too dark for even one with elven sight. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Scytalix did not have elven sight. He was 
            a Barbarian from the frozen Northlands of Halas. It was dusk, and 
            as he wandered into the woods, he began to realize that he could barely 
            make out the faint path he was following. Maybe he should camp for 
            the night and navigate the woods in the daytime. But his friends were 
            counting on his help and time was running out. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">He was big and little stood in his way, but 
            he was slow, and was almost a day overdue for the meeting. As he squinted 
            through the fading light, he thought he saw a figure on the road ahead. 
            Or was it just a small tree? The mist ahead parted some and he realized 
            that there was indeed somone approaching. He lifted a huge battle 
            axe from the strappings on his back and held it where it was more 
            visable. He didn't want to seem threatening to the other, but wanted 
            it well known that he would not be a victim to a highway robbery.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> Whoever it was, they were headed with a 
            deliberate stride right towards him. A few paces in front of him, 
            the figure halted. It was tall for a human, but slight of build, and 
            covered from head to ankle by a heavy black cloak. The face was shrouded 
            with a deep hood.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Lay down your weapon, Traveler," a firm 
            but definitely female voice commanded. "I bring you no harm. I am 
            a Mercenary, charged with the duty of seeing all through these Woods." 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Scytalix put up his axe on his back again. 
            This was a Mercenary? He glanced down at her feet and saw that sure 
            enough, she wore the gilded black boots that the Mercenaries wore. 
            But charged with guiding travellers, he doubted. She was probably 
            empolyed by one of the Lords at HighPass to spy out whoever had bussiness 
            passing through the woods that boardered that notorious town. But 
            if she could get him through these woods in a timely matter, he would 
            allow her to guide him. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"How long will it take to reach the Commonlands?" 
            He demanded.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"No more than this night and all of tomorrow, 
            if you stop babbling and follow me." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I MUST be in the Commons by noon tomorrow!" 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I strongly suggest that you lower your voice, 
            Traveler," she said through a clenched jaw. "Your harsh manners may 
            make me cut out your tongue!" </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Well then, shall we go?" He whispered. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">It sounded loud in the silvery mist. She 
            turned sharply on her heel and briskly began back the way she had 
            come. Scytalix silently followed, peering intently ahead of him so 
            as not to loose his guide in the darkness. Hours later, after what 
            seemed to Scytalix as walking circles around the same trees, the Mercenary 
            came to a halt in front of a small log building. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"We will rest here until dawn comes," his 
            guide annouced. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The windowless shack was small and crude, 
            but the wood pile was full and Scytalix proceeded to build a fire 
            to drive of the dampness from the mist. He dropped his backpack and 
            axe in the corner and removed his heavy, horned helm. He knelt in 
            front of the fire, trying to dry away the damp chill that had settled 
            into his fingers. His back was turned to the Mercenary, but he could 
            heat her rustling though her packs behind him. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I will share some mead with you, Traveler, 
            if you have any meat to spare." She offered in a soft voice. "It is 
            hard to find big game in these woods." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Scytalix turned around to face her, a bit 
            startled by her friendly offer. He froze and stared, rather impolitely, 
            as Barbarians often do. Standing before him, dressed startling in 
            black, was a tall, lithely slender woman. Her long, well-formed legs 
            were encased in a blackened iron chain mail, and she wore a black 
            silk man's shirt and vest. Her gold-heeled Mercenary boots were the 
            only brightly colored thing she wore. She was removing a black mailed 
            veil from her head, hiding her face from his sight. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">When she was done, she looked up at him with 
            questioning eyebrows, and large brilliant black eyes. Her hair, now 
            free from the armor, he could see was a long braid of shiny golden 
            brown. It draped serpent-like down her breast, a bright contrast to 
            the black silk. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I asked if you would like some mead, Traveler!" 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She harshly brought him out of his daydreams. 
            How long would her hair be if he untwisted that braid? Would it cover 
            her breasts? Her black eyes flashed with anger at being stared at. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Uhhh...yes, I do have some meat I could 
            share. A hunk of dried snow bear from home. Do you have a hunting 
            knife to cut it with? Mine is a litte dirty for sharing." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She stood still for a moment, her arched 
            eyebrows drawn in thought. Then she reached down below her black leather 
            belt, down the front of her leggings. She pulled out a knife with 
            a blade half the length of Scytalix's hand. She held it out to him 
            with a sly smile. When he held out his hand to accept it, she slapped 
            it into his palm, blade-first. It was plain steel, unadorned accept 
            for the initials V.L. engraved on the handle. The letters were surounded 
            by an etched vine pattern. He could feel the heat from her belly burning 
            into his palm from the flat steel blade. The fire felt a little too 
            warm. He thought about where the little knife had been until he noticed 
            her pulling more blades out from hidden places on her person. One 
            from each boot, one strapped on the inside of a firm thigh, one from 
            a forearm, and the last, a long narrow spike from between her breasts. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"As you can see, Traveler," she warned, "I 
            am well armed, and you can be assured that my years in training at 
            the academy have taught me how to use these. I have others too, that 
            you cannot see." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Scytalix wondered where these might be hidden.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"I suggest that you stay on your side of 
            the cabin. And do not think that your size can overpower me. I will 
            have a blade sticking out of your belly before you could get both 
            hands on me." She seated herself in front of the fire and began twisting 
            the cork off a small jug. Scytalix joined her a good distance away, 
            but so that he could still watch her face. If she'd only smile again. 
            He thought there may a hint of girlish dimples in her cheeks. He divided 
            his bear meat in two halves and handed one to her on the point of 
            her knife. She took a man-sized swig from the jug of mead and passed 
            it over, wiping the back of her hand accross her mouth. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"How long did you study at the academy," 
            he asked, trying to draw her into conversation. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"For ten years." She answered. "I have killed 
            many men, so do not underestimate my strength and abilities."</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Look, Mercenary, why don't you drop the 
            formalities and just enjoy peaceful human company! I am not going 
            to attack you in your sleep! I am Scytalix Atreides of Halas, and 
            I am going to the Commonlands to meet some old friends. Why don't 
            just tell me your name and we can be friends for one night?" </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">He passed the jug back to her, and smiled. 
            She studied his strong face for a moment, her eyebrows dipping into 
            a thoughtful frown. Then she leaned over and reached a small, slender 
            hand towards his face. She brushed his short coarse beard with a knuckle, 
            and mumbled something about crumbs. Her eyes rose to meet his. In 
            the firelight, her hair had a coppery glow and he could now see that 
            her eyes weren't black at all. They were a deep, dark brown. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"It's been a long time since I can say I've 
            had a friend," she spoke softly with a small smile. There were almost 
            dimples. She looked sincerly into his blue eyes, noting that that 
            they were honest and gentle, depsite his harsh voice and brute size. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"You learn not to get to close to anyone, 
            being a Mercenary. Anyone who pays you is your friend. When the job 
            is done, they may try to put a knife in your back. But you, you are 
            not paying me are you, Scytalix? So maybe just for this one night, 
            I will have a friend. My name is Vathelle. I gave up my family name 
            for the anonymity of being a Mercenary, but I can tell you, my family 
            was from the Qeynos Hills, not too far from where you came from." 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She rose up and stretched like a feline, 
            nearly letting out a cat-like growl. She walked over to her cloak 
            and spead it out near the fire. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"We had best be getting some sleep, My Friend, 
            Scytalix. We must rise with the dawn to get you to the Commons and 
            your friends. It is a short, and easy trail we follow come day. The 
            path outside this door leads south to the edge of the Kithicor Woods" 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Scytalix likewise lay down on his cloak, 
            using his pack for a pillow.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Vathelle, friend to friend, why do you 
            do it? Be a Mercenary, I mean. A beautiful woman like you shouldn't 
            have to sell herself to the highest bidder. Why don't you have a husband 
            or something?"</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;Scytalix, I am beginning to like you. 
            Don't ask me questions like that, or I may change my mind. The life 
            of a Mercenary is not so bad. Sure, I slave from employer to employer, 
            doing jobs that are sometimes against my own ethics, but there is 
            money there! You could join me sometime, when I'm done my duties in 
            these woods, and after you have met your friends. You may find the 
            life to be favorable to your purse, and your sense of adventure!" 
            With that, she rolled over, pulling her cloak over her shoulders, 
            ending their conversation. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Sctytalix watched her for a bit, wondering 
            about the life she led. He soon dozed off himself, to enjoy dreams 
            of seeking out where she hid those knives. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">In the morning, when he awoke, the fire had 
            burned out. He rose and looked around the room. It was empty except 
            for his own belongings. No sign of the Mercenary. He did remeber her 
            instructions on which way would lead him to his destination, and realized 
            that she never had any intention on leading him in the morning. He 
            gathered his things and headed to the door. His hand on the latch, 
            and a glint of metal caught his eye. There, stuck in the wood of the 
            door, was the Mercenary's little steel knife, the one which she kept 
            sheathed against he warm belly. It impaled a small scrap of parchment, 
            with the words "HighPass" and the signature "Vathelle" surrounded 
            by a vine pattern. He headed out in to the daylight, still darkened 
            by the trees of the Kithicor Woods and followed the trail south.</font></p>
