      <tr> 
        <td height="1415"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The rain came down harder 
            than it had earlier in the morning. The wizard Carlion grumbled, and 
            shoved his sleeping bag into his backpack.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> &quot;Does Karana not keep 
            his servants dry, even as the rest of us suffer in this blasted rain?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Nay, friend. The power 
            of the storms are quieted by His might,&quot; said Kelethan, a cleric 
            of Karana. Indeed, he felt empowered by the wind and the rain.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Do not fret, friends, 
            I know of a cave not far from here where Karana will not touch us,&quot; 
            I said, hoping silently that my chain mail would not become rusted.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After a quick packing session, 
            our camp was clean, and we left in the dark of night towards the cave 
            that I knew of.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Our adventures had begun 
            after we met at a place called Crow's in Qeynos. The wizard had spoken 
            of the sac of a Giant spider, needed for spell research, and he said 
            he would pay me greatly for helping him quire some. I knew Kelethan 
            from previous adventures, and knew that one who could cure poison 
            would be valuable against such beasts.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Just after we arrived the 
            the Western Plains, it became dark, and we decided to set camp, as 
            opposed to hunting in the twilight. Unfortunately, it began to rain, 
            lest our leaving camp, and looking for our cave.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We trudged through the mud 
            that the plains had become, wishing for a bit of shelter--except for 
            our Cleric, who worshiped the bringer of storms: Karana.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It was not long, however 
            that the mountains became visible--even for a human, like myself. 
            I knew our cave was not far.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It is in those mountains,&quot;I 
            said.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Kelethan seemed less than 
            enthusiastic. &quot;Might we dawdle a bit, and play in the rain?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Ye gads, cleric!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The mage seemed more than 
            mildly irritated. And perhaps that's why he didn't notice the young 
            kodiak bear sneaking up on him.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The bear swiped twice with 
            his claws, and the wizard fell to the ground. I could not tell if 
            he was alive or dead, and at that time, I didn't care.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Fall back!&quot; I 
            shouted to the cleric, even as the bear swiped at him.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I stepped into the bear, 
            knowing that it had a huge advantage over me. I swiped with my longsword, 
            and slashed it's face. It roared and stepped into me, raking it's 
            claws. I thought he was going to hit me in my face, but I threw my 
            shield arm over my head, and the claw impacted there.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The force of the blow knocked 
            me to the ground, even as our wizard friend was standing. Out of the 
            corner of my eye, I noticed Kelethan beating the huge bear with his 
            mace. The bear let out a roar, and that instant, I was able to stand.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I began to slash the bear 
            again, a bit bruised, but not seriously injured. Time after time I 
            stabbed the beast, but still, it fought. I was hit several times, 
            and I thought it would get the best of us, yet. Suddenly the air around 
            us got extremely cold, and my sword knocked ice off the bears skin. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">A loud shout ended with the 
            bear exploding into fire. I knew our mage was alive and well at this 
            point. It was not long that the bear decided he had enough, and he 
            tured to run, only to get hit by Kelethans mace once again. The bear 
            did not stand a chance.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After we killed the beast, 
            we skinned it, and once again set out for our cave.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Be a bit more cautious,&quot; 
            the wizard told me.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye. But remember that 
            I can not see as well as you, half-elf.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The words visibly hurt the 
            wizard, but I assume, since he needed our help, he did not speak out 
            against me.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We finally came to the cave 
            that I spoke of, and went inside to set camp once again.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Ahh,&quot; said Carlion,&quot; 
            This is much better. Tis warm, and the rains can not touch us!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye. It is better,&quot; 
            I said, watching Kelethin, and knowing that he would much rather be 
            outside in the weather.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Kelethin looked about. &quot;What 
            is in here, anyway?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I shook my head, &quot;Not 
            sure. This is as far as I have ever been.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;WHAT?!&quot; shouted 
            our wizard, &quot;How do you know its safe?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Shhhhh! Do not yell, 
            for if it's not safe, you've surely alerted whatever might be in here.&quot; 
            I said. Concerned, I stood, and held my lantern high, to better light 
            the dark cave. I saw nothing, so I sat back down.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;How could you have 
            led us here?&quot; whispered Carlion.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I calmly wiped water off 
            my longsword, &quot;I have camped here many times, without any trouble, 
            wizard. I doubt that we will have any now.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">My words were followed by 
            the sound of footsteps, and a loud voice shouting something in a different 
            language. I looked up and saw a magic user (I know not what type) 
            in the process of casting a spell.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Duck!&quot; I shouted, 
            even as I dove behind some rocks.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Kelethan also saw the wizard 
            and ran towards the wall on his left, where big boulders stood, to 
            shield whatever spell the wizard might cast.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Carlion, the slow, irritable 
            wizard, had no chance to do anything. He turned just as a bolt of 
            fire engulfed his body, sending him to an early grave.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I realized at that point 
            that even though the wizard yelled, drawing attention to us, that 
            I had made the mistake of not researching the cave enough. His death 
            was upon my hands.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Angered, I jumped over my 
            shielding rock and attacked the wizard ferociously. Kelethin followed 
            my lead.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">For ever slash of my blade, 
            the wizard lost a spell. He got off a couple, but they had little 
            effect on me. He finally resorted to trying to stab me with his dagger, 
            but if you've ever seen a fight between a dagger, and a sword, you 
            know who has the clear advantage.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">With a mighty thump with 
            his mace to the back of the wizards head, Kelethin slayed yet another 
            beast this day. Upon search of the wizards body, we found some strange 
            rings, which glowed in the darkness of our cave.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Bandits!&quot; said 
            Kelethin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye. Where there's 
            one, there's two or three. We should get out of here while we can.&quot; 
            I said.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Agreed.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We left the cave the way 
            we came in, knowing full well that we were lucky this day. And ever 
            since, I have lead a party with much more organization, and caution. 
            Indeed, a great lesson was learned that day.</font></p>
