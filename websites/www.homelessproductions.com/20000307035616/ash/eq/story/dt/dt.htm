          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Herein lies the story of how Drog Trollsbane 
            became a warrior and a man. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Even since he was a wee lad barely able to 
            hold a sword, he felt a longing for the road. He would travel to his 
            family's woods and act as if he was his hero, Shamus of the sparkling 
            robes, fending of dragons and giants or rescuing princesses and kings 
            from their doom. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Then one day , his 16th birthday to be exact, 
            he met a young man who would change his life. The boy, perhaps no 
            more than 14 himself, came with his father who was a merchant Drog's 
            father traded with on his trips to town. The youths name was Bastion, 
            and to his amazement the boy wore chain armor and carried a gleaming 
            sword at his side. But the most mesmerizing thing was his helm which 
            was glowing a light green! As soon as he could he approached this 
            brightly adorned boy and began to fire many questions at him.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Whoa there sir! One at a time, please.", 
            Bastion said as a slight smile broke his perfect complexion. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Where....the helm?", was all Drog could 
            get out. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"It was a gift from my father and his father 
            before him.They tell me that it is magical and its power shall one 
            day make me a hero. I hope that I can live up to their expectations 
            of me.", Bastion spoke.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"A hero? I have always dreamed of such a 
            life! If only I had such a gift I would become one as well. But unfortunately 
            my father is just a farmer.",Drog spoke as he began to dream of quests 
            and dragons and treasures. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Well......it is your birthday and I have 
            yet to give you a gift....here you go.", Bastion said as he unsheathed 
            his sword and handed it to him. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Are you sure you want to give ME such a 
            gift?", Drog began as his eyes widened on the perfect edge of the 
            swords blade. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I see the look in your eye and feel the 
            passion in your heart sir....you deserve to fulfill your destiny and 
            become the hero you always wanted to be.", Bastion said with a smile 
            as wide as a boat. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"How can I ever thank you?", Drog questioned.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Come with me on a quest for adventure. 
            Long have a wanted to fulfill my fathers hopes but he has never let 
            me journey without him. If you come along I will feel safer having 
            someone with me.",Bastion replied. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Drog turned to look at his father sitting 
            around a table with other adults more than likely talking of crops 
            and rain and other things that would bore him to death.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I'll do it! I will need but a hour to get 
            my things and leave my father a note. Together we shall both go down 
            in history as the greatest heroes since Shamus himself!", Drog spoke 
            with a fire in his eyes. And so true to their words the two young 
            adventurers set forth on what would become the defining moment of 
            their lives. </font></p>
