          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In the course 
            of the last two months, I have participated in one of today's phenomenon's: 
            EverQuest. Oh...I played Ultima Online as well, but I wouldn't really 
            consider it a phenomenon...It was more a test run I suppose since 
            this genre of games is so new...but it was lacking (at least for me) 
            any real potential for roleplay, or even more importantly (again for 
            me) fun. In fact, one of the biggest problems I saw with UO, I also 
            see with EverQuest. It seems the designers of these games want the 
            players to write their own story, and create their own adventures....The 
            problem is most people are not used to such freedom, and they don't 
            know what to do with it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This, if read 
            wrong, might make me sound like a dungeon master who controls his 
            players...controlling your player base is a horrid idea. Indeed, Everquest 
            has done a wonderful job in creating a world in which we can create 
            our own fantasy lives....but do they not seem pointless? How often 
            have you just stood around, and wondered what to do? Sometimes, as 
            humans, we need a goal set for us, and if we never have goals, we 
            feel like we aren't getting anywhere...much is the same in EverQuest.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What could fix 
            this? How about a basic story-line...Faction ratings are wonderful...but 
            WHO are some of the factions that are listed. Why don't we ever hear 
            of these factions doing anything. Why do armies never attack Freeport, 
            and what are all these monoliths and ruins? Why can't we go to the 
            libraries in the world and discover the origins of these? Why are 
            there no NPC's in taverns or anywhere that could clue us in on grand 
            quests...perhaps even quests that could only be completed once, and 
            which might even be failed?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">And thus, it brings 
            me to the Quest Counter. If a PC approaches an NPC and ACCEPTS a quest 
            (perhaps it would bring up a window with a YES box and a NO box) the 
            PC gets a flag, and can no longer accept any quests until the one 
            he accepted is completed. If there is a set amount of time for him 
            to get the quest completed, and he fails, maybe he would set off a 
            chain of events...If he did complete the quest, since it could only 
            be done once, he might even get a good reward. And in the same way 
            that completed quests raise faction, perhaps failed ones lower it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Another problem 
            with EQ (as seen on the newsgroup) is the economic system. Verant 
            wants players to rely on each other. This is a great concept, and 
            since there is a PVP switch, I think players would be much more inclined 
            to work together than in UO. Buying and selling merchandise from players 
            can be very tedious at times, but still it is a good system. What 
            is not good, however, is the fact that low level characters are becoming 
            more and more able to buy higher level equipment. This is due to the 
            extremely low prices that vendor's will give for a particular item. 
            Case in point, the Minotaur Axe. It's not a really high level item, 
            but initially the selling price (to PC's) was around 15 - 20 platinum. 
            Now it is down to 4 platinum (on Cazic-Thule, at least). If you try 
            to sell the same item to a vendor, it will sell for 3 platinum, 8 
            gold.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">So, it looks like 
            the PC market has fallen to vendor prices. You can check with other 
            items, as well...such as a Greater Lightstone. They also sell for 
            4 platinum pieces, and a vendor will buy them for around the same. 
            What this means for our market in EverQuest, is that eventually all 
            prices will fall to vendor prices. Verant should increase the buying 
            cost of the vendors to whatever they want an items base price to be. 
            And another thing they should have realized, is that the lower the 
            price, the earlier the levels will be for an item.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I only bring this 
            up because Verant has designed the game to take a year for the average 
            player to reach level 50. In doing so, they designed the game with 
            the concept that there would always be something new to buy, try, 
            or find. If the market gets saturated with high level items for little 
            cost, this goal will not be met. In fact, if they don't invent new 
            items, they will lose accounts of high level players who have nothing 
            left to do. (Or even mid-level characters who can just buy anything 
            they want).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Another problem 
            that is there is a never ending supply of items and money. This has 
            been touched upon heavily in the newsgroups. The obvious solution 
            would be to begin making items wear out. This would make the blacksmith 
            skill useful as well. Most people would complain about this, in the 
            same way that they complain about getting a &quot;bind&quot; in a 
            city. So, the way around this would be to make NPC blacksmiths who 
            will fix items for a set price. The price should be a little above 
            what a normal PC blacksmith would charge. Eventually, an item would 
            not be able to be repaired (unless it is magical), and thus, would 
            have to be replaced. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Along with all 
            this equipment we've been talking about comes the dreaded word: Camping. 
            The new Lore item tag is a great start. In fact, it's a really nice 
            addition. BUT, it only helps the problem a little. And it encourages 
            having mule characters to hold these valuable items. One thing they 
            could add would be a random equipment generator. It would make alternate 
            equipment (which spawns on appropriate creatures, of course) with 
            similar stats. So you can't dual wield PGT's anymore? Fine. Now you 
            found a Pristine Longsword with X delay, and Y damage. Something comparable 
            to a really good sword, but perhaps, not magical. If enough variables 
            were thrown in, there could be an infinite amount of different weapons 
            in the game. Maybe even some better than a PGT or a BLW, or demon 
            claw...you get the picture. You could have an extra tough Orc Warrior 
            who wields this weapon...perhaps he is only tougher because he is 
            wielding a better weapon than the others...</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Camping is also 
            caused by another factor. I just noticed this last night when I was 
            in Befallen. If they don't want campers in their game, why do you 
            have to wait 15 minutes for the creature to spawn that holds the key 
            to get to the next section of a dungeon? If you're a higher level 
            character, you don't want to run around on the top level. Everything 
            there is green, and is the same on the second level. They are sending 
            our some mixed signals, to say the least. I do like the fact that 
            the doors are locked....but maybe it would be a good idea to spread 
            locked doors and containers around, so that, perhaps, we might have 
            a rogue (of appropriate level) around to crack the door for us. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I have a lot of 
            gripes about the rogue class...and I haven't even played one before. 
            I realize that their skills are broken and that Verant is fixing them. 
            But, typically, no game does this class justice. They should be able 
            to sneak and hide at the same time, and disguise themselves to the 
            point of assuming a new identity...perhaps a human rogue might walk 
            into Neriak, and the people not even think twice about it. The strength 
            of this class is their cunning, and stealth: Why not let the class 
            live up to what it is?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">About the only 
            other real problem that I am going to address in this essay, are Enchanters. 
            These poor people can't enchant anything. Perhaps the people at Verant 
            didn't have time to do everything that they wanted. I don't know. 
            If I was an enchanter, I would want to make magical weapons and magical 
            armor. Enchanting metal is only part of it. Here is a neat system 
            that could be used for this (AND it makes players work together, in 
            the way that Verant wanted).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">An enchanter must 
            enchant a piece of armor or a weapon, so that the metal can take a 
            spell (either offensive or defensive from a select set of spells). 
            . A wizard (or cleric) would cast a spell upon the piece. Different 
            spells might make different effects, as Haste on a sword might make 
            the delay a bit faster. At any rate, with each enchantment, the armor/weapon 
            would undergo a check to see if the spell holds or not. Failure destroys 
            the piece. As a final step, a magician must come and cast a spell 
            to make the enchantment permanate. And this would require a check 
            as well. So, in this way, magic weapons would still be rare, hard 
            to get, and would be expensive, but it would give high level players 
            a lot to do. It might also diminish camping somewhat, if they could 
            get a PC made sword. You might even add that different quality metals 
            react different to spells. Even better might be a random element that 
            might make swords react better to certain creatures, or maybe not 
            even have the correct spells place upon it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This system would 
            require extremely high level characters. In this way you keep them 
            from being too common (until further on in the games development). 
            The system could be balanced in such a way that no weapon gets too 
            powerful.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Lastly, I would 
            like to address gained experience. I have seen a lot of suggestions 
            on ways to gain experience, both good and bad. Killing monsters should 
            defiantly not be the only way to gain it, but neither should walking 
            a long distance give you any. How about experience for discovering 
            locations people have not been? Just like in pen and paper RPG's you 
            can gain experience for stumbling upon some treasure hidden away. 
            Why not in EQ? The world is big enough to hide many items, bags, loot, 
            etc. These would encourage exploration.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Another way to 
            gain exp besides monsters, and exploration, would be a little for 
            increasing skills. Perhaps every five or ten points a skill goes up, 
            you receive a bit of experience. If items wore out, and a blacksmith 
            had to repair it, he would get experience for every several pieces 
            he fixed. In this way, he does not feel like he's wasting his time, 
            and his character even grows from it...and all he's doing is helping 
            the player run economy. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Success needs 
            to be rewarded, and although I feel that EQ is one of the greatest 
            games I have ever played, I find myself inventing my own reasons to 
            play. I love the graphics, and the atmosphere that I and my friends 
            put into the game, but the NPC's, factions, and even the gods do very 
            little. It is very easy to break the game down into levels, exp, and 
            the next camp to....well, camp...but a level based game does not need 
            to be this way--especailly as close as EQ comes to creating a wonderful 
            deep world.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">These are some 
            of the things that would help to make EQ a better place to play. I 
            think these ideas would help the world in general, from the roleplayers 
            to the DoOdz. I can't see where any of this would actually hurt anybody.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Not to be misunderstood, 
            I think Verant and all involved have done a wonderful job with EverQuest. 
            It's highly addictive, and it's fun to play. But since it's really 
            only the second game of it's type, it still needs to be critiqued. 
            Things need to be adjusted. It's a new animal to say the least, but 
            it's a great improvement overall than the first one, and as long as 
            they keep taking these kinds of steps, perhaps the game we all seek 
            is on the horizon.</font></p>
