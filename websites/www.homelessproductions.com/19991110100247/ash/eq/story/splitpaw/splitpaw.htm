        <td height="1415"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;Are you sure we can trust him," the 
            warrior monk Adar asked Kiedatar as he pulled the barbarian aside. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar glanced over his shoulder to where 
            the dark-elf wizard Auman sat silently meditating. He had met a couple 
            of dark elves before, and neither of them had lived up to their race's 
            dark reputation, so he was inclined to believe that Auman was indeed 
            as he stated: an agnostic who had foresworn the dark gods of his people. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The barbarian shrugged. "I believe him. Besides, 
            without his aid, we will never be able to destroy Shaman Lenrel, for 
            the high shaman's spells are formidable."</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Don't you think it is suspicious that he 
            stumbled upon our camp just when we were about to go on this raid? 
            What if the inky betrays us and runs? Or worse, aids the gnoll shaman?" 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar shook his head. "He won't. While 
            he may not be actively pursuing the same ends that we are, the means 
            to both our ends happens to coincide at the moment, so I say we work 
            with him." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Adar scowled. "All right, but if we are betrayed, 
            I'm holding you responsible, barbarian." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Okay," Kiedatar said, not mentioning that 
            if they were betrayed they would be unlikely to survive the experience.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Tell Fonan and Tiedan to prepare themselves. 
            Remember, follow me in closely and hopefully we'll overwhelm them 
            before they can counter-attack." </font></p>
          <p align="center"><font color="#FFFF66" face="Calisto MT">***********</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Akdrada the Terrible looked 
            at his cards, his canine features carefully set to betray nothing 
            of his hand to his brother Judriya. </font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"I'll raise your bet by ten 
            silvers ... and I'll throw in that halfling prisoner I caught yesterday." 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Ak, don't tell me you're down 
            to betting your prisoners again," Judriya barked in a tone that sounded 
            suspiciously like a whine. "I've already got more than I can eat in 
            a week from our game two days ago." </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">The gnoll noble looked at his 
            brother. "In any case, I'll see your ten silver and throw in that 
            case of ivory we captured from that caravan last week. That should 
            cover the halfing, agreed?"</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT"> Akdrada opened his mouth to 
            protest, but was interrupted when the door to the room shattered open.</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"For the North!!!" A deep voice 
            cried as a giant specimen of a human came charging in, axe held high. 
            Behind the huge human, three smaller humans dressed in the simple 
            clothing of fighting monks piled in behind him. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Akdrada responded quickly, grabbing 
            the table and flinging it toward the charging barbarian. His swift 
            response saved his brother's life. For the axe that would have clove 
            into Judriya's head was driven deeply into the table's edge instead. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">The big man tried to pull back 
            his axe for another swing, but it was stuck in the table. Judriya, 
            having recovered from the surprise of the attack, saw his opportunity 
            and swung his morning star at the human. The giant man jerked to the 
            side, taking only a grazing blow along his shoulder. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Quicker than Judriya would have 
            though possible, one of the smaller men darted forward and chopped 
            a hand into his throat. The gnoll gasped as he felt his supply of 
            oxygen cut off. He dropped his morningstar and began clawing at his 
            throat. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Nice work, Fonan," the big 
            man shouted as he cleared his axe from the table and drove it into 
            the chest of the choking Judriya. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Akdrada knew he was doomed as 
            he watched his brother's lifeblood splatter across the room when the 
            big man withdrew his axe. He was barely managing to hold the other 
            two men off with his sword for the fools seemed to disdain the use 
            of weapons and fought with hands and feet only. Still, now that his 
            brother was down, it was only a matter of time before the other two 
            joined in and he was slain. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">There was only thing that could 
            save him now. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">The other door in the room opened 
            and three more gnolls poured in. Akdrada's heart leaped in triumph. 
            If he could only keep the humans at bay for a few moments longer, 
            they would be destroyed. Captain Skedrik and High Shaman Lenrel had 
            joined the battle along with his cousin Lharp. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Shaman Lenrel barked out a few 
            words of power, and fire flew forth from his hands burning the two 
            humans that had slain his brother. The smaller of the two screamed 
            and dropped to the ground writhing in pain. Akdrada barked a triumphant 
            battle cry and renewed his efforts agains the two men fighting him. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">His triumph was shortlived, 
            however, for mere seconds after the high shaman had cast his spell 
            on the two humans, another voice began to speak. The dark sibilant 
            words were in a language that Akdrada knew to be dark elven for the 
            gnolls of Splitpaw had sold slaves to the elves for many years. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">At first, Akdrada thought one 
            of the dark elves had come just in time to aid them, but upon completion 
            of the spell, Captain Skedrick's head blew up splattering brains and 
            gore across the room soaking all of the occupants. They were doomed. 
            Akdrada turned to run but a fist hit him in the back of the skull 
            knocking him to the ground. The last thing he saw was High Shaman 
            Lenrel making a desperate attempt to shield himself from the dark 
            elf's magicks. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Then the world came crashing 
            down on him in the form of a steel shod boot. Akdrada's body twitched 
            once and lay still. </font></p>
          <p align="center"><font color="#FFFF66" face="Calisto MT">***********</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"He'll live," Tiedan said as 
            he finished wrapping a soft guaze bandage around Fonan's fire blistered 
            scalp. "He'll be in pain until we can find a cleric to heal him, but 
            he will live." </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Just kill me now," Fonan groaned. 
            "Especially if you're going to talk about me as if I were not here." 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">The dark elf ,Auman , came striding 
            out of the shaman's room. He looked suspiciously at Kiedatar and the 
            three monks. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Did any of you see a staff? 
            About so long with a light blue crystal on the top?" </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"A staff?" Adar asked. "What 
            staff?" "The staff of...," Auman stopped. "It is no matter. I doubt 
            these gnolls even have it. Or perhaps one of the other Splitpaw shamans 
            possesses it. Or maybe one of their necromancers." </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">The dark elf went back into 
            the shaman's room muttering to himself. From the sounds of it, he 
            was tossing the room again in search of the staff.</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"Kie," Adar said, "I don't 
            suppose you could use your axe to remove the head of this shaman like 
            you did that last gnoll? This will prove to the elders that we are 
            worthy enough to achieve the next headband." </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar shrugged and did what 
            the monk had asked. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">These monks seemed a little 
            too pre-occupied with status, or so he judged from their obsession 
            with these headbands. The dark elf also appeared to have his own agenda. 
            Kiedatar could hear him in the shaman's room, tapping on the walls 
            looking for secret passages. The northman was discouraged. He had 
            hoped to find something to indicate that the gnolls of Splitpaw were 
            in league with those of Black Burrow and what the purpose of that 
            union was, but they had unearthed nothing of the sort. They would 
            have to plan a raid on one of the other leaders of the Paw, but that 
            would have to await another day. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Time," the voice of Mogok whispered 
            in his head. Mogok was a shaman of the People, whom the tribal leaders 
            had sent south with Kiedatar to investigate the Black Burrow-Splitpaw 
            connection. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">They had left him outside the 
            lair to watch for possible gnoll reinforcements and to cover their 
            escape if things went sour. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"It seems your little raid did 
            not go unnoticed," Mogok continued, using the power of Farspeak to 
            communicate with his countryman.</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"A company of gnolls just ran 
            by armed to the teeth." "Time to go," Kiedatar said to the others. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Just one moment," Auman's voice 
            came from the other room. "There is something funny about this rock, 
            I think it might open a secret passage or something." </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Now, elf!" Kiedatar snapped 
            as he walked into the room. The dark elf whirled his eyes blazing 
            with fury. For a moment, Kiedatar thought the wizard would cast a 
            spell, but the elf grimaced and stopped himself. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"All right, everyone gather 
            here." The three monks joined Kiedatar and Auman. The elf cast one 
            more dark look at Kiedatar then spoke a few words. The air grew hazy 
            for a moment and when it cleared, Kiedatar found it quite difficult 
            to see his comrades. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Now, let us get out of here 
            before their comrades arrive," Aemon's voice suggested. </font></p>
