          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It has been quite some time 
            since I have put anything down on paper. The reasoning fo</font><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">r 
            this is simple: I have been hard at work for the guild.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It seems that, although there 
            is more than enough to kill, Qeynos Hills was not challenging enough 
            for me anymore. I brought this up to my guildmaster, and thus: I was 
            sent on a mission to RiverVale.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> Part of the challenge of 
            attaining the Ninth Circle, he says, is getting to a far away city 
            alive, and being rebound, so the soul will travel there upon the minor 
            nap. It was at this time that I decided to call upon an old friend: 
            Levarne.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It was perhaps two years 
            ago that I met Levarne. Oddly enough it had been in the city of Qeynos, 
            and not, like most adventurers you meet, on the field of battle. I 
            was sitting near the pond by Crows thinking about fishing, when I 
            heard a scratchy voice attempt to sing. I quickly looked around and 
            saw very little of interest.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Indeed, he was perhaps five 
            foot four, and was very frail--even more brittle than I, and wizards 
            are not known for their stature. And, while I was not impressed with 
            the mans voice, what he said was intriguing.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Burning pain, red and 
            slashing, I wash you away with song and dancing...&quot; I cannot 
            remember the next verse, however it was not long before his hands 
            began to glow, and he was surrounded by a shimmering blue aura.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Shocked, I decided to speak 
            with him so I shouted over his voice, &quot;Hail!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">A look of slight irritation 
            formed on his face as he stopped singing. &quot;Ahhh. You have spoiled 
            my song, friend,&quot; he said, placing his loot on the ground, so 
            he could extend his hand to me. &quot;Well met, my name is Levarne.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I grasped his forearm and 
            said, &quot;Well met. That was a lovely song you were singing, though 
            . Where did you learn it?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Levarne chuckled, &quot;From 
            some very interesting people...Unfortunatly, I have had a sore throat, 
            and I was trying to cure it. I can't get the note out the way that 
            I need to.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">And so, we went into Crows 
            for a drink to soothe the bards throat, and to speak of the current 
            events in greater Qeynos. We had a good time together that night, 
            and spent several subsequent nights in the Plains of Karana hunting 
            giant spiders, although I can not remember any extraordinary tales 
            of these times. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After one particular night, 
            the last one in fact, for reasons which are going to become apparent 
            to you in a moment, I would not see him again. After killing a particularly 
            nasty spider, he said, &quot;Friend, I have enjoyed traveling with 
            you, but the time for me to depart is at hand.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Why do you want to 
            go? The gold is good, and the times are great...&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Levarne just shook his head, 
            and said, &quot;Unfortunately, you can not understand. It's time for 
            me to go. Farewell, and good luck.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I watched as he walked in 
            the direction of North Karana, thinking of all the great times we 
            shared. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Ahh. I digress. My guild 
            wanted me to travel to RiverVale, which was a somewhat daunting task, 
            since I did not know how to get there, and I knew that the northern 
            plains of Karana was a very rough place. I was contemplating different 
            ways of getting there as I walked by Crows, and I heard a strong, 
            smooth voice sing, &quot;Fist of fright has given me the power to 
            be a man of might&quot;. I looked and saw a rather strong wood elf 
            singing with dull yellow balls of light flowing around him.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Upon closer inspection, I 
            realized that this was in fact my old friend, Levarne! It seemed that 
            Karana was looking upon me in a favorable light. The trip to Rivervale 
            would be simple now, for I heard that bards posses a song that will 
            make you run faster than the wind blows and not even a giant could 
            keep up!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Levarne! Hail once 
            again!&quot; I shouted above his voice.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He stopped his song, and 
            looked a bit perturbed. &quot;You have interrupted m-&quot; He paused 
            for a moment. &quot;Gilgadet. It has been a long time.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye, friend. Two years 
            it has been. Much has changed.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Yes, I see that you 
            have grown a beard. Looks nice. How are your studies coming?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I smiled as he just led me 
            right where I wanted this conversation to go. &quot;My studies are 
            at a standstill, until I get to a place called the Misty Thicket in 
            Rivervale. My guildmaster says the city is under attack by orcs and 
            goblins, and that another wizard would be a big help.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He looked at me with sad 
            eyes. &quot;Aye, the city is under constant attack on both sides of 
            the city. Luckily, it is protected by the Deputy Guard, and the city 
            is in a valley between mountains that makes it easily defensible. 
            But the Goblins are winning on sheer numbers alone.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He paused for another moment. 
            &quot;How do you plan on getting through the gorge?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I gave him a blank stare, 
            which, although blank, seemed to provide him with ample information 
            to make a deduction. &quot;You don't know what the gorge is, do you?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot; I don't have time 
            to study geography, Levarne! It takes time to learn how to freeze 
            your opponent with but a few thoughts!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Levarne sighed. &quot;Aye. 
            I suppose, I will escort you to the Gorge. I have friends who will 
            help get us through. You need me, if your guild is going to make a 
            habit of sending its people to dangerous lands, without informing 
            them of the details. It is a much more dangerous place than North 
            Karana....&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;More dangerous that 
            that?! I have a hard time believing it.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;You will see soon enough, 
            Gilgadet. Tis dangerous. OK. Although I would like to spin tales with 
            you all evening, we need to get ready to leave. Tomorrow night, we 
            meet at the second tower in the Western Plains of Karana. Around 1am, 
            so it is light when we get to the gorge.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I spent the next part of 
            the day preparing for the trip. Afterwards, I went to the Inn, and 
            as I entered, Gatha spoke, &quot;Gilgadet, Aldarin left you another 
            letter!&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I happily tore into it, &quot;Hail, 
            friend! I have just decided to try my luck on the continate of Faydwer. 
            It seems that they have some problems that need to be dealt with. 
            I would like you to come, as well. You need a fresh view on Norrath, 
            and some travel would do you well. If you want to come, meet me at 
            the docks in the morning. The boat leaves at nine.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Sadly, I had no way to relay 
            the message to him that I was on a guild quest to Rivervale, so he 
            would just have to travel alone. I silently prayed to Karana to let 
            the power of the storms be with him.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Gatha, I am going away.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">She looked at me, quite surprised. 
            &quot;To another inn? What have I done to you!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I chuckled, remembering how 
            often Gatha bent over backwards to help me. &quot;Nay, I have been 
            sent on a Guild quest this day. I am leaving for Rivervale tonight.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">She looked at me somberly. 
            &quot;I have heard drunk adventurers spinning tales of dangerous places 
            between here and Rivervale. You have a message sent to me as soon 
            as you get there, so I know your OK.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Although I would miss her, 
            I knew that I needed a change of scenery. I was having a hard time 
            believing the fact that there were more powerful creatures than hill 
            giants, and that the world expanded much farther than the Western 
            Plains. Aye, for being a learned man, it seemed I had much to learn.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Time passed slowly for us, 
            as we ran across the plains that night. And, aye, it was true what 
            they said about the bard song of running. Sometimes, it seemed we 
            were gliding across the ground, rather than running on it. The trip 
            was uneventful across them, except for the Griffin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I saw the beast from a distance, 
            and it coolly flew toward me. I felt a fright well up inside like 
            no other as I knew my feeble spells would do nothing to it. Levarne 
            told me to keep running, and relax, even as it's claws raked my back. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Agrahhahaa&quot; I 
            yelled in pain. But my feet kept moving, and soon we left the feared 
            beast behind. We traveled over several dead bodies, no doubt a result 
            of confronting the Griffin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">At last, we reached the place 
            known as the Gorge. It was was a narrow valley between two mountains. 
            Although I did not see any creatures here, I could see why the place 
            was so feared. If something attacked, there would be no place to run 
            and hide, like in the plains. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Levarne....What is 
            our plan now?&quot; I asked, genuinely concerned.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He was silent, and raised 
            a hand to hush me. Then, I heard it. A soft scruffling sound behind 
            me. I spun on my heels to see the source of the sound, but, alas, 
            there was nothing there. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The silence was dreadful. 
            Aye, even the wind blowing and whistling in the gorge had stopped. 
            Then, a hushed but familiar voice said, &quot;Levarne! Glad to see 
            you made it this far.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I turned to the source of 
            the voice, but saw nothing. Levarne stood from his hiding spot, and 
            began a conversation with the voice. I knew that I had heard it before, 
            but I could not place it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye, friend. It was 
            an easy journey, except for the Griffin that attacked Gilgadet.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Gilgadet! Is it really 
            you?&quot; the invisible voice said.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was much suspicious, although 
            I had seen such powers before. &quot;Aye. And who might you be?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly from where nothing 
            but a voice was heard, a halfling appeared. Muley!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was overcome by joy in 
            seeing him again, for it had been a long time.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It is good to see you, 
            lad! I like the beard,&quot;he said, stroking his own.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;My thanks. How have 
            you been? It's been what, three years or so?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye. Three years, and 
            it's been going well. I have been delivering skins to Duca.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Ahhh! Duca! I haven't 
            seen him around in many months. He is doing well?&quot; I asked stroking 
            the giant snake fang he gave me.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Muley said, &quot;Aye he 
            is doing well, however he doesn't get out as much as he used to. He 
            is trying to open an armor shop in Freeport, but it is slow going.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Levarne cleared his throat. 
            &quot;I would like to stand here in this evil gorge and talk with 
            you about all this, but we need to go. Halflings are dying this very 
            moment in RiverVale, and if we stand here much longer, we are next.&quot; 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Muley turned to him and said, 
            &quot;Ye gads, lad. For a bard you sure are impatient.&quot; </font><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;The 
            Gorge is a mightily evil place, Gilgadet. I will cast invisibility 
            on you, but it won't last long. Do not attempt to look at the sights, 
            or you are a dead man. Stay to the left, and on the main path, and 
            look for a cave entrance. Enter the cave, and wait for me there.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He wasted no time as he cast 
            the spell upon me. &quot;Run, lad, Run!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I began to run through the 
            Gorge, fully expecting to see some really big spiders, and perhaps 
            a Cyclops or Hill Giant. What I saw almost stopped me in my tracks, 
            for I had never seen such atrocities before.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">A giant eye was floating 
            about eight feet off the ground. It had a leathery look, as opposed 
            to a slimy one, and it smelled of rotten potatoes. It seemed to be 
            looking right at me. Heeding Muley's advice I silently ran passed 
            it, and stuck to the left of the path.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I saw eye after eye, and 
            they terrified me. Aye, I am still having nightmares of these beasts, 
            and, when I gain the power necessary, I will come back and destroy 
            some of these creatures. I vowed to myself to find the creator of 
            these atrocities and give him a stern talking to.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After a long run, I looked 
            down and saw my robe shimmering. Oh no! The spell is wearing off!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I giant eye loomed in the 
            distance behind me, and slowly turned. I knew I was dead if I didn't 
            run right then.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I began running, turning 
            my head every so often to see how far behind it was. Flashes of fire 
            erupted around me, as it was casting it's spells on the fly. A rock 
            beside me exploded, and I was minorly hurt by fragments of rock, and 
            I fell to the ground in a heap. I turned and saw the eye coming for 
            me, and I knew I was a dead man.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly, something invisible 
            grabbed my robe, and thrust me on my feet. Levarne! He too, became 
            visible, and I thought we were both dead men. But as we continued 
            to run, he began beating a drum.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'll be the first to 
            admit that the most irritating thing about bards is that they sing 
            at the most inopportune times, but this time it was welcome. The comfortable 
            flashing blue light surrounded us and we quickly ran away from the 
            beast. It was not long before we found the cave, dubbed Runnyeye.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Muley met us just inside 
            the entrance, &quot;I thought ye lads were history. Good thinking, 
            Levarne.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Aye. You need to practice 
            your spells a bit more, druid. That almost cost us.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Muley mumbled something about 
            how Levarne could function, being so irritable all the time, then 
            turned to me and said, &quot;It was nice to see you Gilgadet, but 
            I must go back to the Gorge, and escort others through.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Levarne threw him a platinum 
            piece. &quot;My thanks again, friend.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Anytime, lad.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Levarne turned to me and 
            said, &quot;We must rest here for a moment, and make sure the way 
            is clear. These caves are dangerous. Do not fight anything, and do 
            not fall in the water around the corner.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We went through a few moments 
            of silence, and I reflected on the evil eyes in the gorge. I don't 
            know how I would have made it without Levarne.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;How did you know Muley?&quot; 
            he asked me.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I met him in Qeynos 
            Hills just after I was accepted by the Guild. Chrom and I...&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;You know Chrom? Tis 
            a small world,&quot; Levarne said. &quot;That Chrom is quite a character.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I laughed, &quot;Aye. Tis 
            a most crafty fellow. I once saw him sneak into the lady chamber in 
            Cr-&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was cut short by Levarne's 
            raised hand. He tilted his head, and listened. &quot;We must go. I 
            hear a shaman chanting in the distance. Just keep up with me, and 
            say nothing.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We ran a short distance, 
            never seeing any monsters, and we made it to the mouth of the cave. 
            It was here, however, that I saw two goblin guards.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The creatures were green 
            skinned and hairy, with big teeth, and small heads. They looked no 
            more fearsome than gray wolves to me, but Levarne whispered, &quot;They 
            are a little tougher than they look, and they will overpower you with 
            numbers. When I say go, run strait out of this cave, until you come 
            to a wall, turn left and run until you come to a gate.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">When he said the word, I 
            ran as fast as I could between the guards. They both attacked me, 
            but missed. It was a short distance to the wall, where I turned left 
            and ran some more. Two small halflings that I would later learn were 
            Deputies, screamed warnings to the goblins, and slew them with but 
            a few slashes of their fine blades.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I sat just inside the gate, 
            and wondered where Levarne had gone. It was mighty warm for the time 
            of year here, and everything was covered in a fine mist. Although 
            it was daylight, the tree cover was so thick, and the air so heavy, 
            everything was cast in shades of green. It was very pretty, and I 
            began to realize just how big Norrath was, and how much I had been 
            missing while studying in Qeynos for so long.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Are you ready? We must 
            go to town.&quot; Levarne said</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">And so it came to pass that 
            I made it to RiverVale. I have since joined the Deputy Guard and have 
            been helping stop the onslaught of Goblins, although it seems the 
            situation is dire, indeed. Levarne and I have grown quite close, and 
            realized that although our past is different, our future seems to 
            be one and the same.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I received a letter from 
            the Guild yesterday stating that they are very proud of me, and have 
            given me access to the eleventh circle. I am proud of my accomplishments, 
            but realize that without the help of friends, it would have been unattainable. 
            Aye, friends are the most important thing in life. I would give my 
            life for the safety of them all.</font></p>
