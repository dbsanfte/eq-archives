          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">I have done it!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The night was dark when it 
            happened, and things looked rather bleak. My newfound friend, and 
            fellow hunter, Rhinno, and I were chasing a grizzley bear near a farm 
            in the Wester Plains of Karana. We should have been afraid of the 
            strong beasts, but we were flowing together, and fear seemed a mile 
            away.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Fear of giant spiders was 
            a thing of the past. We were able to take them anytime we wanted, 
            with Rhinno slashing off legs, and me burning the hair of their backs. 
            We were quite a team.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">But, as I was saying, I did 
            it! After much ado, we finally killed the grizzley bear. It was a 
            sight to see it fall, after all the hard work. My mental powers were 
            drained, and I was fairley injured, but the victory was sweet. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We found an abandoned farmhouse 
            nearby and decided to rest inside of it. I began to meditate, and 
            the world around me went dark, as I entered the soft, comforting blackness.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly, a flash of pain 
            enveloped me, and my darkness turned a glaring red. I felt as though 
            I was flying in the air. My flight ended with a thud, and a huge pain 
            in my back, even as I heard a familiar voice shouting, &quot;Gil, 
            wake up and run!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I opened my eyes to see that 
            yet another grizzley was trying to kill me, no doubt the mate of the 
            one we killed. I had just enough mana for one spell, and I knew that 
            one spell would not kill the bear--at least not any spells that I 
            knew of. I quickly cast a Fade spell, and hoped that I would teleport 
            far enough away from the beast to survive.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Apparantly, my prayers were 
            heard, for I got away, completly unsure of Rhinno's fate. But, as 
            I was running away, clouds came, and darkness set in, and I became 
            hopelessly lost. Feeling abandonded, I frantically searched for one 
            of the towers. The Plains of Karana are not a safe place for an injured 
            wizard, alone. If not bandits, then hill giants, treants, or scarecrows. 
            There are several things one can meet his doom in the wild plains.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">But soon, I came upon two 
            young fighters, who had been attacked by a giant spider. They were 
            shouting for help, and had I not come, would have surely died. I knew 
            that if they died, the spider would come for me next. Since I was 
            already injured and very low on mana, I should have run away, to face 
            danger another day.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">But I did not.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I came to the fool's rescue 
            by casting one shock of fire spell, and then leaning into Melee with 
            the giant snake fang that Duca had brought me. I slayed the giant 
            spider in no more than two or three minuets. The fighters, greatly 
            appreciative, escorted me to the nearest tower.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I collapsed on the floor, 
            greatful to still be alive, and feeling pretty good about rescuing 
            the young men. But something was troubling me: Rhinno!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was unable to find him, 
            and I wondered what had happened to him. As I finished my meditation, 
            I heard a familiar voice behind me. &quot;Good to see you again, Gilgadet.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Of course it was Rhinno, 
            and he was ok. Apparantly, the grizzley bear started to follow me, 
            but when I cast the Fade spell, it changed it's mind, and chased him. 
            There was a farmer nearby who helped Rhinno by attacking the bear, 
            even as he ran away. I suppose we were both lucky that day.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After a few more moments 
            of speaking to each other, I told Rhinno that I needed to go see my 
            guildmaster. I wanted to find out if there were any spells that directly 
            effected bears, or if there was any room to study such things.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After the long trek to Qeynos 
            from the plains, and upon reaching my guild in South Qeynos, I saw 
            my guildmaster. He smiled and said, &quot;Gilgadet, you have passed 
            the trials of the seventh circle! For your courage and willingness 
            to help those weaker than yourself, you have entered the next stage 
            of your journey!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was very pleased, as I 
            knew that in the 8th, there were a multitude of new skills and spells 
            to be had. Unfortunatly, the cost of research is great. I was able 
            to buy only one spell that I have been practising since early this 
            morning. It is a weapon of devistation called Fire Bolt. I will have 
            to be careful with this one.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">And so you see why I was 
            so jubilent in my claims of, &quot;I did it!&quot;. It is not often 
            that one passes into a new section of life. A promotion. And when 
            one does, it is a means to celebrate. Perhaps, if I didn't have all 
            this research to do, I would. However, the path I have chosen, or 
            rather, the path that my mother has chosen for me, is a difficult 
            one. But if I am to protect myself from those that would harm me, 
            this is exactly what I must do.</font></p>
