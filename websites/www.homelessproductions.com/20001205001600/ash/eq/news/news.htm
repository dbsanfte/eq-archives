          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
            far as why the website updates have been comming so slow lately, is 
            the fact that I have been working on making a Sci-Fi CRPG, growing 
            from Starflight, Sentinel Worlds:Future Magic, and Star Control II. 
            Making a game from the ground up is a very time consuming task, and 
            every ounce of freetime I have has gone into making the dream a reality. 
            I have put together a great team of programmers and artists, and we 
            are underway. For more information, click <a href="http://www.homelessproductions.com/ash/secat/">here</a>.
