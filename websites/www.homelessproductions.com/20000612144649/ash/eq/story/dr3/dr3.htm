        <td height="608"> 
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"My young friends,",Marco began,"you 
            are both indeed brave but severly lacking in smarts.Did you not see 
            what I did to your giant friend?Do you not think I could easily handle 
            the two of you?". </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">With that the young warriors 
            slowly put their weapons away. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"So whhat do you need us for? 
            Were you sent to stop us? Who is your master? Why are we so important?" 
            Drog replied barely taking a breathe between sentences. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Whoa there friend....slow down. 
            First off I am not your enemy. I was sent to find you but only to 
            aquire your help," Marco stated. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Why would YOU need our help? 
            You seem able to handle yourself quite well," Drog said as he fiddled 
            with his sword.</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"Aye, that I can lad but this 
            enemy is one of craftyness and stealth.They attack at night and hide 
            in it well. I am not a woodsman by any stretch of the imagination 
            and haven't been able to find these critters yet. We need your help." 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Drog looked at Greenhelm ,whose 
            eyes lit up from the moment Marco began his story, and gave him a 
            questioning look.</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"We would be honored to help 
            you smite these dogs who elude you.We will do anything we can to assist 
            you.",Greenhelm said with a fire in his eyes. Drog just groaned. He 
            knew his buddy would jump at the chance to help but he still wasn't 
            sure about this Marco character. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Their journey back to Hephador, 
            Marco's hometown, was long and uneventful save the kobold they found 
            trying to steal their food packs.He didnt last long.It had been 3 
            days of travel till they found themselves arriving at the gates to 
            the city. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Here we are are...home.Now 
            i leave the planning up to you two.We can go to the Knightly Slumber, 
            the towns inn, to do your planning," Marco said. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"With night upon us within the 
            hour we must be quick about it.",Drog stated. So they traveled to 
            the inn and began their work. Marco seemed perplexed by the simplicity 
            of it but Drog assured him that he hasn't seen a smart cattle thief 
            yet. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Night came quicker than they 
            had thought but they were ready.Soon after darkness fell Drog saw 
            his quary, hiding in some brush near the farms. He was hidden from 
            their site .There were three of them. They looked like gnolls but 
            he couldn't tell. Then he heard them...they spoke common! As a matter 
            of fact they sounded human! They had almost walked past his trap when 
            he finally came to his senses.He pulled his rope and the trap was 
            sprung.One was caught in the tree while the others began to panic 
            and run.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">They didnt make it far when 
            they met Marco and Greenhelm. Drog wanted answers. He cut the third 
            man down as his head covering fell off him. He thought the man would 
            be scared but he seemed about ready to laugh! </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Who are you and why have you 
            troubled the citizens of this city?" Drog began. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Hehehehe! Fool you would be 
            best served to leave me be and go back to your meaningless lives.You 
            do not want to anger my master," the man said with a smug look on 
            his face.This of course was rewarded with a punch to his left cheek 
            from Drog. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"You will answer me cur! Unless 
            of course you would rather I turn your body into my personal punching 
            block!" Drog replied as he reared his fist back to show he meant his 
            words truly. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"My master will crush you three! 
            It is too late for you now. Darkhen Mallinor shall destroy you all!", 
            the strange man said. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Drog began to ask his who this 
            man was when he suddenly vanished! </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"What the...",Greenhelm began 
            but was cut off by Marco raising his hand.</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Calisto MT">"This Darkhen Mallinor is the 
            leader of the Dark Bone Clan....I have heard of him.He is supposedly 
            as powerful as one of the gods! But stories being what they are don't 
            put much belief in that.",Marco said. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Mayhap we should think of what 
            we should do to stop this Dark Bone Clan," Greenhelm spoke as a gleam 
            began to form in his eyes.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Grand quests seemed to be what 
            he lived for but this one would prove to be the grandest of them all.</font></p>
