      <tr> 
        <td height="1415"> 
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Why you getting all worked 
            up over it? Its not like they're laughing at you or anything. They 
            just know who's the REAL hero here," Drog boasted with a sly grin 
            on his face. "And besides I'm not the one who changed his name to 
            Greenhelm....thats why they call us Drog and his friend, they cant 
            remember what your name is!" </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">At that the two young adventurers 
            burst out into laughter. They had been traveling together for at least 
            four months now and had become great friends and travel partners. 
            Drog had shown Greenhelm how to forge for food and live of the land 
            and, in turn, Greenhelm had shown him the finer points of combat. 
            They were quite a team and had fought off several orcs and many more 
            kobolds in saving the crops and lives of many of this lands people. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"So what was SO bad about the 
            name Bastion anyway?" Drog began as he stuffed some bread into his 
            mouth. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Oh no nothing was wrong with 
            it at all unless you like sounding like a rich boy whose family could 
            spoil you with anything you want...nothing at all.",Greenhelm stated. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Whoa there tiger.....no need 
            to go all berserk on me...I like the change. At least you finally 
            know what the bucket does.",Drog said as he pointed at the magic helm 
            sitting beside his partner.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Yeah useful thing too.I like 
            knowing anytime I get hurt the thing try's to heal my wounds. Its 
            my security blanket.",Greenhelm remarked as he began to stroke the 
            crest of his fathers gift. Then the rain began.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Of course they knew it was coming 
            and had already prepared a place to stay dry and Greenhelm immediately 
            went for the camp. Something had made Drog stay though even after 
            his companion had urged him to come to the camp he waved him off and 
            told him he'd be there in a bit. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Something made him rise and 
            unsheathe his sword. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">He wasn't sure what it was, 
            but he would take no chances. His many years of living near the forest 
            had taught him to be wary of anything. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Suddenly it was upon him.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">A huge Giant at least five times 
            his size stepped through the bush and eyed him with its one good eye. 
            Stunned by the sheer size of the monster Drog couldn't move. He just 
            sat there as the mountain of a man bore down upon him and smashed 
            him with its large club. The pain was unbearable but it had brought 
            his senses back to him, as he left to the side and landed on a log 
            sword at the ready. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Come get me you large overgrown 
            excuse for a rat dropping, you'll not take me without a fight!" he 
            shouted in hopes that his buddy had heard him. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Then once again it came at him 
            , but he was ready and just leapt over the club and slashed its gut 
            with his sword. The giant didn't even flinch as it came at him again. 
            He knew this was the end as the club came down towards his skull. 
            He knew he could not survive such a crushing blow.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">But then the beast fell to the 
            side as if something had just swatted it away, . And in the darkness 
            was the figure of a large man, maybe a barbarian by the looks of him. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">As the giant slowly regained 
            its feet the large man just stood and watch finally muttering, "Okay 
            if you want more you got it!". </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">The sound of its death wail 
            was horrible.It screamed as it toppled back from the mans huge blow. 
            It was incredible how he fought without weapon and yet had killed 
            the giant in just two hits! </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Thank you sir, .Whoever you 
            are. I owe you my life.", Drog said as he saw his Greenhelm coming 
            to his side. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"I'll call it even if you let 
            me have a swig of your ale and bite of your bread,&quot; the man had 
            begun,"I have only drank water for days now...I need my nourishment.".</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT"> Drog offered it readily as 
            Greenhelm spoke,"Thank you, kind sir, for saving my friend.. I fear 
            I was to be a little late coming.Oh where are my manners...my name 
            is Greenhelm and this is Drog Trollsbane.". </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"Then my quest is over, for 
            it is you two I have come for. My name is Marco and you will have 
            to come with me I'm afraid."' the large man replied. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">"I don't like this one bit.,&quot; 
            Drog thought as he unsheathed his sword again. He noticed his companion 
            following his lead.</font></p>
