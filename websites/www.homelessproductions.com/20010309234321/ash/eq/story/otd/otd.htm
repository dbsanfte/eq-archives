      <tr> 
        <td height="1773"> 
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">WHAM! Today I was hit in 
            the head with harsh reality. It was just one of those days...or so 
            I hope. What began as a simple attempt to further my studies into 
            the arcane arts became a matter of life and death...or death and death...</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It all started in Qeynos 
            hills. I heard from a traveler that there was a child missing in Qeynos, 
            and that a guard there was offering much money for someone to look 
            into it. Since my childhood was so jaded, and cold, I could not bear 
            to hear of such atrocities. So I decided to go into the city and look 
            into it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">After much digging around, 
            I met a fisherman near the bank. He told me that the child had fallen 
            into the aqueducts, but also warned me of many monsters lurking below 
            the city. I had heard tales of monsters living down below, but passed 
            them off as rumors and sagas to scare children from diving into the 
            depths. As it turns out, the rumors are true.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">On first look, it is simple. 
            The first few rooms are full of spiders, and rats, much like most 
            basements in Qeynos. Upon swimming further, however, there are some 
            fearful creatures.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was first attacked by a 
            giant translucent cube which shivers and shakes, and makes strange 
            sounds, as it sucks its prey inside. It somehow became aware of me, 
            even though it has no eyes, and started trying to suck me into itself. 
            I cast several Fire Shocks, and a few Numbing Colds, and finally put 
            it to rest. From it's insides, it dropped several silver and copper 
            counts, along with the bones of it's past prey.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I began to get confident 
            in my abilities. Perhaps too confident. I ran through the maze, and 
            became very disoriented and lost, all trying to find some evidence 
            of the girl. It was not long before I was hopelessly lost.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I sat against a wall down 
            there, trying to figure out how to get back out. But there was no 
            hope in that. So I took to walking through the tunnels, and swimming 
            in a general direction, hoping against hope that I could find a way 
            out. It was not long before I ran into a fearful creature, who identified 
            himself as Dracos.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Before he began savagely 
            attacking me with a rusty two handed sword, he said, &quot;forgive 
            me&quot;. I might have been able to take him, but his sword was laced 
            with a deadly poison.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I fell to my death upon the 
            floor of this sewer, not sure what to do, and only hoping that the 
            gods granted me yet another life. Luckily, I soon found myself standing 
            in front of Qeynos, the city to which I am bound. I ran back to the 
            aqueduct entrance, and dove in, hoping to find my body, and promising 
            myself that I would pay more attention this time to where I was.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, I became just 
            as lost as the last time, and I could not find my body. I was hungry, 
            cold and tired, and I almost swore I would never help anyone out again. 
            That was when I ran into a necromancer named Somatosis.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I had heard that necromancers 
            had an uncanny ability to find peoples dead bodies. I suppose that 
            is a good thing--at least it was in my case. I had always heard, though, 
            that it was a very easy process. It was not.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It took us a few hours to 
            locate my body, and when I found it, I was horrified. My own face 
            was puffy, and my body reeked of decomposition. The poison from the 
            feared Dracos had turned some of my skin green. I quickly took my 
            meager belongings, and hoped for the best. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">As to finding the way out, 
            I was lucky. I fell into yet another pool of water, and was sucked 
            out of the aqueducts, and thrown into the ocean west of Qeynos. I 
            decided to give up the quest for the girl for another day.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I quickly rested up, and 
            got my spells ready, and went to Qeynos Hills. I was intending to 
            buy some blank spell scrolls for my guild, but I got sidetracked at 
            the ruins. There were a few skeletons running around, and not a lot 
            of people, so I decided to help in the fight. I was not even scared 
            of Dread Skeletons, because I had gotten away so easily before with 
            the use of my Fade spell.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">That turned out to be my 
            mistake. An acquaintance of mine, Faklor, was being attacked by a 
            dread skeleton. I didn't think he could survive the onslaught that 
            they bring, and I thought I could get away. So I chased it down, and 
            attacked it, to get it off of him. I turned and cast the spell, but 
            to my dismay, it did not work.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I tried again, but still: 
            nothing. The skeleton behind me continued to stab me in the back with 
            his sword. Pain enveloped me, and once again--I was standing in front 
            of Qeynos.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I sighed, thanked the gods 
            again, and ran back to the ruins to get my body, fully intending to 
            get to the Glade, and buy those spell scrolls. However, upon recovering 
            my body, Isis, a monk of an unknown religion, told me that Faklor 
            had run off to the Gnoll caves. I thought he might need some help, 
            so I ran off after him.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">This mistake put me in the 
            most feared position of my whole life. I made it there just fine. 
            I was standing near the entrance to their lair, and I saw a hollow 
            tree. Curious, I walked slowly to the entrance...the ground beneath 
            my feet gave way, and I fell about twenty feet, into ice cold water. 
            I swam to the side, and looked around. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Everywhere I looked, I saw 
            Gnolls. From scouts to Elite guards, I was completely surrounded. 
            I had learned some tricks from Chrom back when we were younger, and 
            I snuck around everything as best as I could. I was not spotted. Suddenly, 
            just as I peered over the top of some rocks, I saw twenty Gnolls running. 
            I figured they were running toward the entrance, so I followed them. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">There, I met a few people 
            nice enough to help me out of the caves, and for once during this 
            adventure, I did not die.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I even made a little 
            money. But not nearly enough to come that close to death. I will not 
            return to that hideous place alone for quite some time. I also learned, 
            just as our Guildmaster often said, overconfidence is a wizards worst 
            enemy. <br>
