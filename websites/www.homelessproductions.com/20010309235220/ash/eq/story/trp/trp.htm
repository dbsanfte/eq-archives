      <tr> 
        <td height="1398"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The great spirits must be toying with me, 
            thought Kiedatar, as he trudged wearily through the rain. It always 
            rained in the Karanas. For a moment, he felt a great yearning of homesickness, 
            longing for the frozen north. But the Great Spirits had set him forth 
            a challenge and he must obey. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Seems a bit damp out," his companion, Lenhaj 
            the wizard said. Kiedatar cast him a sour look, but the cheerful grin 
            on the wizard's face caused him to give a slight smile. "I suppose 
            you're right. I, too, detect a bit of moisture in the air." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The piercing cry of a lioness on the prowl 
            disturbed their banter. Kiedatar gripped the haft of his axe tightly 
            and looked around for the lioness. She was not to be seen. A clever 
            beast. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"This way," Lenhaj said, heading toward a 
            nearby rocky hill. "This will give us a vantage point from which to 
            spy her out." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar followed his friend and did his 
            best to keep his already rusting axe from getting any wetter. It didn't 
            seem to be working. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">As they neared the crest of the hill, the 
            sudden smell of lion spoor filled the air. A low throaty cough, a 
            flash of movement, and the lioness was upon them. Kiedatar swung his 
            axe, but the beast jumped nimbly out of the way. For several moments, 
            the beast dodged his attacks leaving the barbarian with several deep 
            wounds in return. Lenhaj's voice whispered sibilant words that Kiedatar 
            did not understand nor did he care to, but the spell did the trick. 
            The lioness attempted to lunge, but found that the earth had bound 
            her back paws. Kiedatar stepped forward and hammered the axe into 
            the beast.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> Even trapped it put up a ferocious fight, 
            managing to hold the barbarian off until a blast of frost from the 
            wizard's hands stunned it long enough for Kiedatar to step in and 
            deliver the death blow.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Whew, that was close, my barbarian friend," 
            Lenhaj said, leaning on his staff. "I was about to get ready to start 
            running until ... just what are you doing?" Kiedatar looked up from 
            where he was cutting the heart from the lioness. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"It is a custom of my people. Eating the 
            heart of a lion will bring you it's courage." He pulled the aforementioned 
            organ from the beast's chest and brought it to his teeth, tearing 
            off a bite. He held it out to the wizard. "Want some?" "Er," Lenhaj 
            said, looking slightly greenish, "I think I'll pass this time." He 
            looked away to the south. "You always do this?"</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Only with certain animals. A lion's heart 
            will grant you courage. A bear's strength. And a wolf's will bring 
            you intelligence and cunning. They are manifestations of the Great 
            Spirit. He sends them to us to challenge us so that we will be ready 
            when the darkness comes." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"What darkness?" </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"An ancient myth of my people. There will 
            come a time when an unholy darkness sweeps across the land, crushing 
            all before it. Unless ... unless we can somehow stop it." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"And you believe this is darkness is coming 
            soon?" Lenhaj asked, looking around. "Whether or not it will actually 
            come in my lifetime does not matter, friend. What matters is that 
            we are prepared."</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> Kiedatar popped the last bit of lion heart 
            into his mouth, chewing it slowly. "Besides, I think the time is coming." 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"You do?"</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Aye. How else do you explain the increasing 
            numbers of undead that walk the land? The ever more organized tribes 
            of gnolls and orcs and such? Everywhere you turn, you see a necromancer 
            or a shadow knight. The darkness is coming, friend Lenhaj, and I don't 
            mean to be unprepared." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar gave the corpse an appraising look. 
            "Hmm, don't think we're going to be able to salvage that pelt." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"It's okay," Lenhaj said inclining his head 
            down the slope, "I see a bear that will do instead." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Ah, the Great Spirit is kind today." </font></p>
