Must say it was quite an experience, being able to read the entire story from beginning to end, and not having to wait to see what would happen 30 days from one issue to the next.<br>

No one can deny X-men's  popularity since so many to choose from and like.<br>
 <br>
Have not read comics in years myself, but dislike the trend of splitting one numerical series into several spinoffs ie. original xmen-new xmen- special xmen.<br>
<br>
My favorite was Daredevil. As far as I know it never split beyond the original numerical series, probably because of lack of popularity, but that's one of the things I liked about him, he was less pretentious and kicked ass for a blind guy.<br>

They have like 3 of them out of the x-men now.  Another good source is grpahic novels which alot of times are just straight reprints of a storyline, maybe 4-12 books in a row, not quite the whole continuity but not too bad.<br>

PS if you only have like 30 bucks to spend on comics ever you buy the graphic novels The Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns.<br>

Reason I know about the burning of Wolvie's flesh off is from &quot;Days of future past #2&quot; issue 142 I think of Uncanny X-Men. Collosus throws Wolvie at the head of a sentinal and gets caught in mid air by a blast from its hand which leaves nothing but his indestructable skelleton.<br>

Wolverine would not beat Spiderman.  If anything, Spiderman would win by rendering Wolverine incapable of attack.<br>
<br>
Wolverine could never, ever, EVER, hit Spiderman. Considering that Wolverine needs to be up close and personal to rip someone apart, he has (as you put it) &quot;not a chance in Hades.&quot;  Spiderman is capable of dodging bullets, rockets, lasers, punches, flying rodents, you name it, he's dodged it.  He'd simply anticipate every one of Wolverine's attacks.  Add to that Spiderman's immense agility, his ability to stick to walls, and his ability to use his web shooters to swing around.  <br>
<br>
Spiderman is also stronger than Wolverine.  Yes, you read that correctly, he is.  Spiderman is actually quite strong, anyone who was a fan of his comics knows that.  With the relative strength of a spider, he is capable of lifting 50x his body weight.<br>
  <br>
Don't be so quick to dismiss Spiderman's web shooters either.  You claim Wolverine can rip up anything?  Well sure, if Spiderman was dumb enough (of course, he's quite the intelligent fellow) to shoot anything but his arms.  Tie up his upper arms with the webbing so that he can't move em, and Wolverine suddenly becomes totally useless (till the web dissolves anyway).  Wolverine doesn't have the strength to simply expand his torso and arms and rip off the webbing, he simply isn't *that* strong.<br>
<br>
Spiderman 1<br>
Wolverine 0<br>

Heh, can you tell Spidey was my favorite comic book character?  Archangel was cool as hell too with those badass metal wings and kickass design.<br>

Spidey is stronger then Wolvie, I will give ya that but wolvie has better combat ability. The webbing is going to be on wolvies mind during the fight as he is no slouch in the brains department either. The one thing about wolverine when he goes bezerk is his moves are instantly thought up and dont jive with any combat style persay. Look to Wolverine vs Conan in What If? Conan did well at countering wolvie and out fighting him until wolvie went bezerk after taking a sword to the base of the neck. After that Conan had no clue what to expect from wolvie and lost a hand by a completly random move. Now I know spidey has his spider sense but I am not sure if it would be fast enough to avoid wolvie when he has truely gone nuts. Heck in fights with the hulk, doc oc, Kraven, ect... Spidey does get hit, he gets hit alot. It only takes once when fighting Wolvie and spiderman is done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uromeoofeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Romeo of EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/11/01 4:06:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Ultimate Flame Post!!!</span><hr size=1> bah juggernaut could whip spiderman hands down..no contest as well as magneto would own spider gimp so hard... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uraolfcq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/11/01 4:33:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Ultimate Flame Post!!!</span><hr size=1> The beyonder and the pheonix force are basicly the same things, but regardless Im not gonna debate this anymore, heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=625.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=625.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=625.topic&start=61&stop=77>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=641.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=590.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=625.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=625.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=625.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm21">General Chat<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <BR><table width=90 height=20 border=1 align="center" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
