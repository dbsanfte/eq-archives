Death of a game addict<br>
Ill Hudson man took own life after long hours on Web<br>
By STANLEY A. MILLER II<br>
of the Journal Sentinel staff<br>
Last Updated: March 30, 2002<br>
Shawn Woolley loved an online computer game so much that he played it<br>
just minutes before his suicide.<br>
<br>
The 21-year-old Hudson man was addicted to EverQuest, says his mother,<br>
Elizabeth Woolley of Osceola. He sacrificed everything so he could<br>
play for hours, ignoring his family, quitting his job and losing<br>
himself in a 3-D virtual world where more than 400,000 people<br>
worldwide adventure in a never-ending fantasy.<br>
<br>
On Thanksgiving morning last year, Shawn Woolley shot himself to death<br>
at his apartment in Hudson. His mother blames the game for her son's<br>
suicide. She is angry that Sony Online Entertainment, which owns<br>
EverQuest, won't give her the answers she desires. She has hired an<br>
attorney who plans to sue the company in an effort to get warning<br>
labels put on the games.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's like any other addiction,&quot; Elizabeth Woolley said last week.<br>
&quot;Either you die, go insane or you quit. My son died.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the virtual world of EverQuest, players control their characters<br>
through treasure-gathering, monster-slaying missions called quests.<br>
Success makes the characters stronger as they interact with other<br>
players from all over the real world.<br>
<br>
Woolley has tried tracing her son's EverQuest identity to discover<br>
what might have pushed him over the edge. Sony Online cites its<br>
privacy policy in refusing to unlock the secrets held in her son's<br>
account.<br>
<br>
She has a list of names her son scrawled while playing the game:<br>
&quot;Phargun.&quot; &quot;Occuler.&quot; &quot;Cybernine.&quot; But Woolley is not sure if they are<br>
names of online friends, places he explored in the game or treasures<br>
his character may have captured in quests.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed to because<br>
he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; she said.<br>
&quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures were because of stints<br>
on the computer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to<br>
get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get<br>
him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with<br>
depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which<br>
include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex<br>
drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.<br>
<br>
&quot;This fed right into the EverQuest playing,&quot; Woolley said. &quot;It was the<br>
perfect escape.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vulnerable to addiction<br>
Jay Parker, a chemical dependency counselor and co-founder of<br>
Internet/Computer Addiction Services in Redmond, Wash., said Woolley's<br>
mental health problems put him in a category of people more likely to<br>
be at risk of getting addicted to online games.<br>
<br>
Parker said people who are isolated, prone to boredom, lonely or<br>
sexually anorexic are much more susceptible to becoming addicted to<br>
online games. Having low self-esteem or poor body image are also<br>
important factors, he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;The manufacturer of EverQuest purposely made it in such a way that it<br>
is more intriguing to the addict,&quot; Parker said. &quot;It could be created<br>
in a less addictive way, but (that) would be the difference between<br>
powdered cocaine and crack cocaine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Parker doesn't make the narcotics analogy lightly. One client - a<br>
21-year-old college student - stopped going to class within eight<br>
weeks after he started playing EverQuest his senior year.<br>
<br>
After playing the game for 36 hours straight, he had a psychotic break<br>
because of sleep deprivation, Parker said.<br>
<br>
&quot;He thought the characters had come out of the game and were chasing<br>
him,&quot; Parker said. &quot;He was running through his neighborhood having<br>
hallucinations. I can't think of a drug he could have taken where he<br>
would have disintegrated in 15 weeks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Common warning signs<br>
There are several questions people who think they are addicted to<br>
computers and the Internet can ask themselves to see whether they<br>
might have a problem, Parker said, including whether they can predict<br>
the amount of time they spend on the computer or have failed trying to<br>
control their computer use for an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
Parker said that any traumatic setback to Shawn Woolley's character in<br>
EverQuest could have traumatized an already vulnerable young man.<br>
<br>
It may be that the character was slain in combat and Woolley had<br>
trouble recovering him. Or, he could have lost a treasured artifact or<br>
massive wealth, or been cast out of one of the game's social clubs,<br>
called guilds.<br>
<br>
&quot;The social component is big because it gives players a false sense of<br>
relationships and identity,&quot; Parker said. &quot;They say they have friends,<br>
but they don't know their names.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Woolley remembers when her son was betrayed by an EverQuest<br>
associate he had been adventuring with for six months. Shawn's online<br>
brother-in-arms stole all the money from his character and refused to<br>
give it back.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was so upset, he was in tears,&quot; she said. &quot;He was so depressed,<br>
and I was trying to say, 'Shawn, it's only a game.' I said he couldn't<br>
trust those people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sony Online Entertainment declined to comment for this story, but<br>
EverQuest fans say the game is a fun diversion that is much better<br>
than watching television.<br>
<br>
'It's like an adult playground'<br>
Donna Cox of Schaumburg, Ill., has played for about two years and<br>
enjoys the adventuring and socializing. Cox and her husband, Bob, play<br>
together and team up against the game's challenges.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's like an adult playground,&quot; said Donna Cox, a professional who<br>
manages a team of computer programmers. &quot;You can become anything you<br>
want. People only see the side of you that you want them to see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cox played about 40 hours a week at the height of her gaming but now<br>
plays only a couple of times a week. &quot;Once you get into the high-end<br>
game, it takes a a lot of time,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Dody Gonzales of Milwaukee has played the game for about three years<br>
and has more than a dozen characters spread across the EverQuest<br>
realm. Gonzales, who plays about four hours a night, knows EverQuest<br>
has been blamed for people's problems because it's a topic discussed<br>
in the online community.<br>
<br>
Said player Vincent Frederico of Rochester, N.Y.: &quot;It's almost like a<br>
drug. If you are not happy with your real life, you can always go in.<br>
. . . Someone who lacks social skills, they could find it much easier<br>
just to play the game instead of going out to a bar.&quot;<br>
<br>
A game without end<br>
How does it pull people in?<br>
<br>
One key component is that the game can be played indefinitely, and<br>
there are always people populating the online world. EverQuest and<br>
other online games also have a social structure.<br>
<br>
&quot;The graphics are absolutely thrilling. They just haul you in,&quot; said<br>
Parker, who has treated several people for EverQuest addiction. &quot;The<br>
other piece is that it takes time to leave the game. You have to find<br>
a place to hide to get out, and that makes people want to play<br>
longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
For people who are unhappy, socially awkward or feel unattractive,<br>
online games provide a way to reinvent themselves.<br>
<br>
Shawn Woolley - who was overweight, worked in a pizza restaurant and<br>
lived alone in an apartment the last months of his life - may have<br>
depended on EverQuest to provide the life he really wanted to live.<br>
<br>
&quot;People like to create new personas,&quot; Parker said. &quot;You see a lot of<br>
gender-bending.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hooked on 'EverCrack'<br>
Interest in online games grew in 1997 with Origin Systems' Ultima<br>
Online, now with about 225,000 players. Microsoft's Asheron's Call,<br>
with around 100,000 subscribers, provides a virtual world similar to<br>
EverQuest's. Most online games require an initial software purchase<br>
plus monthly fees of about $10.<br>
<br>
The games have roots in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the role-playing game<br>
created in 1974 by TSR Games in Lake Geneva. But D&amp;D requires human<br>
contact to play; its digital counterparts do not.<br>
<br>
David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and the<br>
Family in Minneapolis, said many EverQuest players refer to it as<br>
&quot;EverCrack.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walsh, who didn't know the details of Woolley's suicide, thinks mental<br>
health problems linked to playing online games, especially EverQuest,<br>
are growing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could a person get so engrossed that they become so distressed and<br>
distraught that it could put them over the edge?&quot; Walsh said. &quot;It<br>
probably has something to do with the game. But your average person or<br>
average gamer won't do this. It's a coming together of a number of<br>
circumstances.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walsh and Parker both said online games as a whole are not inherently<br>
bad, and Walsh compared playing online games to drinking alcohol. Both<br>
can be harmful if abused.<br>
<br>
A call for warning labels<br>
&quot;I've seen a lot of wreckage because of EverQuest,&quot; Parker said. &quot;But<br>
they are all the same. It's like cigarettes. They need to come with a<br>
warning label. 'Warning, extensive playing could be hazardous to your<br>
health.' &quot;<br>
<br>
Warning labels are exactly what Jack Thompson, a Miami attorney and<br>
vocal critic of the entertainment industry, wants to result from a<br>
lawsuit he plans to file against Sony Online Entertainment for<br>
Elizabeth Woolley.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're trying to whack them with a verdict significantly large so that<br>
they, out of fiscal self-interest, will put warning labels on,&quot; he<br>
said. &quot;We're trying to get them to act responsibly. They know this is<br>
an addictive game.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sure we are going to find things akin to the tobacco industry<br>
memos where they say nicotine is addictive,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a<br>
possibility of a class-action lawsuit.&quot;<br>
<br>
John Kircher, a professor at Marquette University Law School and<br>
expert in personal injury law, said a negligence action might be won<br>
if plaintiffs could successfully argue EverQuest's publishers &quot;should<br>
have foreseen an unreasonable risk of harm, that people could<br>
potentially hurt themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then there is the issue of First Amendment rights,&quot; Kircher said.<br>
&quot;Does the First Amendment right trump the rights of the plaintiff? If<br>
the Internet is a form of publication . . . there is a balance the<br>
courts try to strike, and it's not an easy question.&quot;<br>
