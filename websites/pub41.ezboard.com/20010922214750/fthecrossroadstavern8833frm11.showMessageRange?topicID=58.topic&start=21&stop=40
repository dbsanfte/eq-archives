Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> well, I am convinced that the fundamental problem Sabastion has is he defines &quot;best&quot; by the accomplishments of all others on all servers.  When he was in KEG on The Rathe, I think it is fair to say that for a time we were the best...certainly in the top two with BoTS and we did somethings better than BoTS and vice versa...Even from that lofty height he was constantly full of negativity because Fires of Heaven was doing things we could not dream of at that point...like Veeshan's Peak and so on.  Fact is, to be the BEST in EQ, you have to basically be able to dedicate all free time to the game and have at least 40+ like minded individuals with equal amounts of time.  KEG, in my mind, is basically consisted of power gamers but we are also good friends for the most part.  Hell, for much of KEG's history there was a 100% yes vote requirement to even get into the guild.  Even with all the power gaming urges and awesome talent/equipment in KEG, EQ is a very unforgiving game. <br>
<br>
It is fair to say that from the time KEG came to Zeb, we were one of the top two guilds on the server.  But that required a Tremendous amount of time and strain on personal lives to keep proving ourselves day after day.  So what happens next? either EQ consumes the daily life or a break is needed.   Sorry folks, choosing break is much more healthy.  Look around EQ, there are indeed guilds on every server that &quot;own&quot; everything in sight, but even now I would be willing to bet that Sab would call all but 2 or 3 of those guilds sub par.  If there is a guild out there doing something subjectively deemed better than you, all you hear is the negative comparisons from Sab everyday.  No matter if that guild is on another server.  I know this for fact, I have dealt with it first hand.  Hell, just to illustrate my point, I would bet in the two or three weeks KEG has been taking a bit of a siesta, already people are moving us out of the &quot;uber&quot; status.  Do I care? well at first I did, because I do associate a certain amount of pride with accomplishments in game and I would be lieing if I said &quot;being one of the best&quot; didn't give an artificial ego boost....but as I look more deeply into, I really don't.  You can never WIN EQ..no matter what happens, it is an unforgiving game in which you have to prove yourself over and over and over.  Hell, if Fires of Heaven disbanded right now, how long until they faded into the shadows?  Well I can tell you, the first time some new challenge arose that they did not tackle first or second EQ wide, the rumors of them slipping would begin.  At this point in EQ, I am not satisfied enough to stop striving forward, but I am certainly content with the knowledge that if the servers were unplugged tomorrow, I would have been the &quot;best&quot; at some point or another.  If my entire guild goes to AO or Shadowbane or whatever the next biggest thing is, then I will go with them.  Because I can absolutely say beyond the shadow of any doubt....if my guild and friends left this game, there is a good chance I would flounder around for a few days and probably do the cancel as well.  <br>
<br>
Being the best is no fun, if you have no one to share it with.  <br>
<br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> It has been said many times by many people that "we all have fun in different ways".  I think Sab (Hi Sab :P) is saying he has fun by beating a game, by being involved with organizations that consistently overcome whatever obstacle Verant sets up as the next pinnacle.  That is as a legitimate reason for playing as any.<br>
<br>
The dillemma occurs when the creators of the game decide that the next pinnacle will require 50+ people cooperating for hours on end repeatedly. It seems that the percentage of "pure gamers" willing to put in hours needed to beat the game (hours that have been described subjectively as monotonous, boring, headbanging-against-the-monitor-frustrating) is in the minority. Is it possible to get 50+ like-minded, dedicated beat-the-game gamers together into one organization? How does one cull the player population in order to get *just* those like-minded gamers?  <br>
<br>
In an online environment where the majority of players have a view of fun that is other than "beat the game", perhaps creating a "pure gamer guild" is the biggest challenge of all.<br>

Fitz himself was ready to jump ship for LoS on the nameless not long after i /guildremoved from KEG. So apparently even Mr. Loyalty had his issues with gaming vs. casual play.<br>
<br>
  I find it interesting how negative some people get when i point out that not everyone plays for the same motvations. I nevere criticized anyone for playing this game to find friends. I did say i dont understand it, but if my lack of understanding so threatens you that you need to flame me, then you REALLY do need to step back from the game, not me.  I never called anyone a loser, or wierdo, I did however point out a distinct difference between peoples motivations for playing.<br>
<br>
 Why does that threaten some of you so much?  Does me spelling it out so blatantly make you feel insecure?  Do you feel BAD because you play to experience the social aspects of the game?  I can only assume so if my post motivates you to such reactions.  Apparently its ok for you to play the game as a social experience but since I play for the GAME I am some sort of freak. /shrug  Whatever turns your crank.<br>
<br>
  Another possibility here is that very few true gamers bother to read message boards *grin*.  Anyhow for the few of you open minded enough to actually read what i was saying, <br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> Here's my take on the situation...<br>
<br>
Everyone has different expectations of EQ.  Everyone has different levels of goals (Explorer, Achiever, Social, etc...).   For Sabastian, it's winning or accomplishing things first and receiving due credit.  But, the problem is, he seems to be approaching it the wrong way.  If you want to be like AL or FoH...  The easiest thing would of been to switch servers and build up another character on MM or Veeshan.  And then work to be a part of them.   If you wanted to build a guild on The Zebux that will be better than them, then good luck.  I know we have the number of high calibur/extended play time hour characters that are necessary for such an 'ub4r' guild, but there are too many burned bridges to get them all to see eye to eye.  Not only that, but I would have to say there is no dominant &quot;Leader&quot; that everyone would respect and trust with their lives.<br>
<br>
That leaves the following options:<br>
1)  Keep banging your head against the wall trying to build the impossible (and if you succeed, then more props to you).<br>
2)  Switch servers, start all over and prove your 'leet' skills to the news makers.<br>
3)  Give up and play a 'social' game<br>
4)  Try out another game that might fit your style.  AO is pretty fun when you are actually able to login.<br>

<br>
<br>
 You dont get it.<br>
<br>
<br>
 And yes, I would be highly motivated to kill the entire city of Neriak just to say i did it. Anyone who knows me would know that is EXACTLY the sort of thing i would organize a 12 hour raid for and love every minute of it. Why ????<br>
<br>
 For the same reason I pulled Korocust to the zone in a full spawn. Not for his shitty crescent axe. But to say i did it.<br>
<br>
 For the same reason I tanked a Seafury Cyclops at level 50 with my damage shields and some lucky channeling roles. Everyone said it couldnt be done. Thats what motivates me. I did it.<br>
<br>
 For the same reason I competed in the Druid BOTB. Not for this lame-ass title. I did it because i want to be the BEST.<br>
<br>
 For the same reason I can run from zone-in in Seb to the Disco/Library in full spawn w/o aggroing anything. To say that I can do it.<br>
<br>
 For the same reason I can run from the zone-in in Dragon Necropolis to Zlandicar and every other corner of that zone w/o aggroing. To say that I did it, because everyone said i couldnt.<br>
<br>
  Call that bragging, i dont give a shit. It proves my point. Loot is NOT my motivation its simply a means to an end. And that end is doing things NOBODY has done, better than ANYONE else can do them. To be the BEST, to WIN.<br>
<br>
<br>
  That is my motivation. &quot;l3wT&quot; is how I get there.  If giving every single uber drop to warriors clerics and rogues means that my guild will be that ass kicking game destroying machine, then you bet ill do it and not complain one bit.  You think I am orientated on loot? Yes I am, but not as the end, its the MEANS. BIG DIFFERENCE.<br>

 Your right, a true gamers guild is not likely to spring up on Zeb. Few people have the balls to leap from an established guild. I will, however, take away a better understanding of why people play the game, and what NOT to look for in a guild. <br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> hehe I don't know where Sab's stab about me contemplating building up a character on another server came from but hell, I will address it.  I really never considered it until the server split looked like a looming reality and at the time it looked like my friends were gonna be split between the two servers.  I was a bit distraught and considered starting new rather than have to choose.  When KEG decided definitely they were going in full force to the new server, it was no longer an issue, not that it had been one to begin with.  A wise person does check out all their options though.  There is a major difference between considering all options and being disloyal.  Considering where I remained and what I have done since there, no reason to really defend myself in that arena further.  /shrug Call it like you see it I guess.  <br>
<br>
Going off what Pann said, there is no doubt in my mind that Zeb could make an awesome kill all guild and do anything as well or better as any other guild that plays this game.   Hell, to be honest, I think that as other games come out and the server populations shrink (dont worry, they will definitely shrink) there may come a time that some discussion could be opened up to somethign like that.  Hell, we know that for its time, the triad really was an asskicking alliance.  Don't think it could survive as an alliance though, would have to be done differently.  Perhaps when zeb is topping out at 1000 a night and around the time SoL comes out....maybe some like minded individuals can come together and begin those discussions....but as it stands now, the DH alliance is about the best you are gonna get.  Lot of potential there and the DKP system encourages so much participation, as long as Neen and the other leaders dont get burnt out you will see quite a powerful force develop there.  I mean at this point whats left?  Sleeper's Tomb and North Wing ToV.....maybe Sab should try to join those guys.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufiallfyrebolt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiall Fyrebolt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(6/29/01 2:38:36 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.caronetguay.qc.ca/nadine/fiallweb.gif width=175 height=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sab ponders the state of the game.

Jeez man, I just have to reply...<br>
You do these things because you are FRIGGING NUTS<br>
The whole Zlandicar thing...man, how many times did you die that day to learn all those traps?<br>
<br>
I really don't need to defend Sabby but I feel the need to say a couple things:<br>
<br>
1) Sabby is not in it for loot.  Loot is a nice byproduct of what we do when we slay the big, mean, ugly inhabitants of our world. Loot was NOT his issue with COP (or he woulda waited until AFTER a leather BP dropped in ToV for us)<br>
<br>
2) Sabby rubs people the wrong way.  I am a pretty...erm...intense individual and he got me pi$$ed at him several times BUT he provoked thought and reaction.  If you respond to him he responds back...and definitely not the way you want. If you flame he flames back and if you throw point he throws counter point. What I have learned is that I listen to him and take everything he says at face value...as an opinion. Love him or hate him he does know alot about the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sabastian, the gods know I don't agree with all you have to say, I don't believe you know everything (you don't claim to but you act like it some days), but you are a top knotch player and a great source of information. I have no clue why you felt the need to post this except maybe frustration.  <br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> Sabby takes from the guilds he joins (you honestly think you'd have that title from the BOTB without the help of a kick ass guild?), helps them out some but also drives them crazy with contradictions (we cant kill Dozekar yet, We need to kill Dozekar now!) leaves in frustration because no one can play the game to his standards then slams them on message boards.  It has become a pattern, and it really shows his character.  Sabby should camp and delete, or bribe a GM to move him to Veeshan where he can brag his way into FOH.<br>
<br>
You know what Sab?  Yes, CoP are friends, AND we are a kick ass guild.  We may not be focused purely on killing 110% of the time, but we do enough.  And the things we focus on we kill.  I very much disagree with your philosophy of loot distribution too.  If you measure commitment, who is sacrificing more for the guilds goals, the jobless, friendless guy online 24/7, or the guy with a 50 hour a week job that always tries to be there for the guild events, even if a bit late?  IMO the guy with the job is sacrificing more, giving more.  It is asinine to expect him to give up all rights to loot just so you can twink the guy living with his parents.  I’m not saying the working people should get preference, but you stiff them and you’ll lose them.  It’s a balancing act, and CoP (Selenar) does it very well.<br>
<br>
You ever hear the phrase &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot; Sabby?  It means you should stop to enjoy things a bit.  It is a game, and you should enjoy it.  When I feel more stress about logging in to a game than I do driving to work, there is something seriously wrong.  I'm not going to devote more attention and effort into a game than I do my career.  Apparently KEG has discovered this lately as well.  CoP does take breaks from raiding.  We know where we will end up, why should we stress and rage till we get there?  Personally I’m fine with the pace we’re taking, so is most of the guild.  Funny, thing is that the guild and game have been kinda fun again lately…<br>
<br>
You come here claiming you're the only true, pure gamer around, and slam people that like to enjoy others company in this game.  Well, from my perspective, you’re the one with the bassakwards views.  But you won't see me posting threads on message boards complaining about how so and so only wants to kill things and never wants to kick back and relax.  You play your game your way and I'll play my game my way.  EQ is big enough for both, with shades of both in all directions.  In the end though, if you can’t make friends in this game, you’re just a dr00d with nothing to do but solo wyverns.  Not very satisfying I’d imagine.  <br>
<br>
Good luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usabbyfkb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sabbyFKB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beat The Game!</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#333333>(6/29/01 4:03:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sab ponders the state of the game.

 Run now, you might not get your /cyber if you dont move it! You dont kick ass at anything. Your to busy cybering and all in all a waste of equipment.  As far as CoP kicking ass? At what? Glad your proud of farming armor, I think its pathetic.<br>

You have gotten to the point where nothing/noone in this game is good enough for you. That is the point to quit, cause the game is no longer fun for you and all we see is your frustrations on this board. <br>
<br>
This is a "GAME", its something that most people use to relax and wind down after work or an intersting make believe world that youngsters love to excell and have fun at it. To you this game is now neither of those things. This "GAME" is now a daily frustration and an ovious addiction. You cant seem to get away or otherwise you would of quit already instead of littering up the board with your frustrations of others who dont play the game the way you do. <br>
<br>
All I can say is either quit or take a long break from this game and go have a social life for for a while and maybe your attitude will change a little and you will start to enjoy the game once again for what it really is. Entertainment.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I plan on playing this game until its no longer fun and then move on to another form of entertainment. I did it after playing 2 years plus of UO and doing all i felt I wanted to do and I will do it with EQ when its time comes.<br>

<br>
  One only becomes a leader if his followers are willing to be led.  You like a lot of KEGgers have stong opinions and philosophy and valus in this game.<br>
<br>
  Do you really think KEG got to a position where they can kill uber mobs in a short span of time (2 years or so)?  For me to dedicate my play times in this game, I have to put my trust in those once anonymous players I now call friends.<br>
<br>
  It's a game yes, but for anything that I cannot control such as other players, it requires some social aspect or some common and shared goals, which most of the time leads to friendships or alliances.<br>
<br>
  Sure you're skilled, and willing to do that it takes. Being the &quot;best&quot; is subjective and bias to whoever is defning &quot;best.&quot;  The only satisfaction that you will get is from yourself, and maybe a few like-minded individuals that share your values in this game of EQ.<br>
<br>
  I understand that &quot;loot&quot; comes up a lot of time and becomes a source of disagreements.  In this game of &quot;EQ&quot; loot is the a means of letting others know of your accomplishments, being recognized.  How can you make everyone feel that satisfaction when 6 at most loot drops off a mob that Verant says designed for 60 players?<br>
<br>
  Well, one way is to share that experience with your friends.  You said so that you're not in for the loot, but rather you're there for the recognition of the accomplishment.  You by yourself may feel good knowing you did it, but do not deny that it feels even better when 30+ other of your so called game friends acknowledges you for whatever &quot;kick ass&quot; you did.<br>
<br>
  For me, EQ is a game and I find what little amusement I can find whether solo, with a twink, with a handufl of friends or an entire raid. I am aware that not everything good will happen to me along the way, but I do try to find humor in everything even in this game called EQ. <p><table width="262" border="1" height="102" align="center" >

You can't get along with anyone, so obviously it is all &quot;their&quot; fault.  You’re showing what a spoiled little boy you can be.  Certainly you had no need to bring personal insults into this discussion, just as you have no reason to come to COPs board, or KEG's board and insult people.  But you do.  Not even stopping when your banned from one board, you carry it over to 2 other boards out of spite.  Your making a great case for yourself Sabby.  Any ubers out there, or wanna be ubers want to pick up this trouble maker now?  After seeing this, I bet they're lining up at your door eh?  Guaranteed though all this would be turned against them after a few months and your personal inadequacies turn into everything that is wrong with “them”.   I’m sure any guild that picked you up would have their ears filled with what a bunch of idiots we are in CoP, just like we heard your crap about KEG.  Sounds exciting eh?  You may laugh at Fitz’s psychoanalysis, but I think he may be onto something.   You’ve got some issues, and its not how CoP or KEG play EQ.<br>
<br>
Naathan hit the nail on the head.  Your problems will never be solved in EQ.  Get out and get some air, you’re accomplishing nothing with this trash talk except to prove how far gone you are.<br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> Pretty much if you want to &quot;win&quot; at EQ you are going about it the wrong way.  There is no end game.  There is no &quot;best&quot; player...the player is limited by class, race, and level.  PVP in UO, EQ and quite possibly AO is a joke.  TRUE pvp is done in twitch games (which makes Planetside actually make me want to forget VI screwing us the past couple years).  Twitch game = any FPS like Quake, Unreal, or Counterstrike.  &quot;Best&quot; in EQ is all on a relative scale depening on who and what you are comparing yourself to.  One 55 warrior might be better played and equipped than another yet that same 55 warrior will be sub par when compared to any level 55 monster.<br>
<br>
Honestly Sab take a break from EQ and play a &quot;Real&quot; PVP game.  Join a clan and play to win.  Read up on Planetside (trust me it looks SWEET).  After thats out of your system EQ is there for a relaxing romp through fields of dragons which we all know we could just utterly roll if we were pitted against them in any FPS (Breath fire on me will ya?  I'll just strafe left and nail your ass to the wall with this nice big cannon...). <p><table width="50%" border="0">

Getting large groups to work togther is the hardest thing to do in the game.  It requires everyone to respect the leader, everyone to know their role, and everyone to be able to listen.  <br>
<br>
You sound like a guy who wants to do that.  Perhaps you should, just remember that paitence and understanding are your most powerful tools for obtaining respect.<br>

<br>
 I think I made it pretty painfully obvious...<br>
<br>
 I am not here to make friends. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have just found that my goals in the game are very contrary to people who do play to make friends. That doesnt mean you  cant get along with an aquaintance. Doesnt mean you cant respect that person, and work with them.  Friend is a significant barrier to cross, I do not use that lightly. <br>
<br>
 As far as this particular thread. If i agreed with me I wouldnt post here either. I mean look at the feedback I am getting. I've had considerable feedback in game. There are people who feel the same way I do to one extent or another. In the next world I will be certain to start things right from the beginning.  My biggest mistake was thinking that I would be happy joining instead of running a guild after UO. I was very burned out.  But despite my &quot;evil and impossible to get along with&quot; personality, I ran a guild of 50+ &quot;player killers&quot; and I would say everyone was pretty happy. At least until I left for EQ.<br>
<br>
 Now lets see what sort of generalizations are gonna fly b/c my guild killed /gasp &quot;players&quot;.  MUAHAHHAHA!<br>
<br>
<br>
 That pretty much sums it up.<br>
