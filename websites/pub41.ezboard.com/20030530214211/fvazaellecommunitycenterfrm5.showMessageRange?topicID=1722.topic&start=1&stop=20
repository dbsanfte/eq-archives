Technically, the layover lounge is considered international territory, and US Immigration has no jurisdiction over it, nor does it have any jurisdiction over an individual not trying to enter US territory. However, this man was detained under suspicion of being an Al-Quaeda terrorist (all evidence currently available indicates that he isn't, but he's been found guilty by birthright for being Syrian and knowing somebody who had an alleged contact with that organization over a year ago), and was deported to Syria. He disappeared 10 days ago, and nobody knows where he is, if he's even still alive.<br>
<br>
What I find most interesting about this is that American media isn't covering it at all. Most Americans don't even know about it, nor have they ever heard the name <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Maher Arar</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. To pour salt into an open wound, your ambassador smirked to himself, and said that maybe we should ask our internal people where he is, and stop bothering theirs. 200 years of friendly relations with our country, and your &quot;ambassador&quot; is willing to dissolve it because this man was a 3rd hop in a train of alleged associations. Has your leadership completely lost touch with reality? <br>
<br>
<br>
I encourage those among you living in the states to write to your leaders. At the least, have that dickhead you call an ambassador recalled, and ideally return the innocent Canadian citizen back to his home. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uatro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/19/02 11:01:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1722.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Americans enforcing internal laws in international terri</span><hr size=1> After reading that article he doesn't sound too innocent to me.

Um, if he's not required to do it, why bring it up in the article? Alot of terrorists use the canadian border to gain access to the US, makes sense we would have an agreement with Canada to register islamic immigrants.<br>
<br>
As far as his terrorist connections, I'm inclined to believe my government had their reasons. The whole international territory in airports I've never heard of, so I'm not gonna comment on it.<br>

Get your head outta your ass. What it's worried about is the security and safety of it's citizens. Let's say for the sake of argument that this guy was a terrorist. Deporting him to Canada is basically letting him walk into the US whenever he wants. The Canadian border is really easy to cross illegally. Probably due to the large amount of territory involved, and the fact that untill recent years it hasn't been a problem. What motive does the US government have for deporting this guy unless they think he's a possible terrorist? Seriously. This isn't some grand conspiriacy to piss off Canada.<br>
<br>
As for our foriegn policy, yes we have made some big mistakes. Actually we have made some really big fucking ones. And guess what? We gonna make some more. But our goal is not pissing off the world, it's empowering and freeing the oppressed. It's not fucking easy. It pisses off the people in power in these backward ass countries. But someone has to do it. Or the world isn't gonna get any better.<br>
<br>
You don't like US policy? Guess what, we don't really care. Lots of countries don't like the US. But we gonna keep doing shit we think is the right thing. Even a thousand 9/11's aren't going to stop us. We'll fight the good fight and take the lumps that come along the way, but if you think we just gonna bend over and take it in the ass with a smile you got another thing coming.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should step back and look at all the freedoms Canada, and lots of other nations enjoy because of the US &quot;emposing it's foriegn policy&quot; on others.<br>

<br>
1) The registration as an islamic immigrant thing:  Yes, Mr Arar was travelling on a Canadian Passport, however, the layover in New York put him under US law, which requires him to register.  As a people have already said, there is no &quot;international&quot; territory in US airports.  The only nondomestic terrritory in any nation is that of foriegn embassies and consulates.  The man was in our territory and had broken our laws, and we have several thousand graves to look at for our reasons to be especially vigilant.<br>
<br>
2) The man had a strong case for holding dual citizenship in both Canada and Syria.  As was stated in the article, the US takes all countries into account in cases of multiple citizenship.  The human rights record of Syria aside, the man was also listed as a wanted fugitive by Syria.  Last time I checked, the US did still have diplomatic relations with Syria, which good faith required us to deliver a wanted fugitive to them.  However, I must admit the fact that Syrian authorities now have no knowledge of his whereabouts other than &quot;we sent him to Jordan&quot; is a bit disturbing.<br>

I'm glad they deported the guy.  You're very naive, you obviously have no clue what we are going through in the United States.  Fuck international law, if we spot someone we think is a terrorist in any country, I have no problem with us using whatever force we deem necessary to detain that person and deal with him.  I don't care if he's living in montreal, I'd be fine with sending in a team of people to kidnap him and haul his terrorist act back to the US where he can rot in prison for the rest of his miserable life.  I hope our officials don't let some bullshit red tape prevent us from doing everything in our power to combat terrorism.<br>

If you think using a plane of innocent people to blow up buildings full of other innocent people is definable as &quot;right&quot; by any sane person I really don't give a shit what you think.<br>
<br>
Instead of focusing their anger on the people who actually oppress them, they turn it on us. And I'm getting sick of certain people &quot;armchair quarterbacking&quot; US foriegn policy. Is America perfect? No. Do economic factors influence our foriegn policy? OMG wow they do. Still doesn't make our current policy incorrect. When was the last time you saw the Australian government working for mid east peace? <br>
