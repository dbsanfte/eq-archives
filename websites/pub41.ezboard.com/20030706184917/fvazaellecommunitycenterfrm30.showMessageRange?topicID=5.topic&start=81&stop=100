Why?? Its in the middle of a war! Its because Exxon, Mobile, etc all already have their hands in on the contracts for who gets control of the oil. Oil is definitely a huge part of why we went in there. If you think that it is not, then you are only fooling yourself.<br>
Now Noobtar, what is it do you think the war IS about? Freeing the Iraqi people? That's sure a bunch of bull. If that's the case, then why aren't we freeing the Palestians instead of giving aid and weaponry to Israel?? Why are the civilians in Iraqi cities shooting at us and fighting against us? If they all wanted us to &quot;liberate&quot; them, then we would not have stiff resistance, and we would have control over Bashra right now, instead of occupying the outskirts and trying to starve them to death. Is it about Sadaam having WMD? Well, then why take the inspectors out and attack so soon? Where are the WMD now? Why havent we found any WMD or why hasnt Sadaam used them on us? Is it about Sadaam being a threat to the US? How? If he doesnt have any WMD, which cant reach the US anyways if he did, then how is it a threat? Is Sadaam going to launch a full scale land assault against the US? The ties to Al-Queda are false, and selling WMD to terrorists is false, but its fine and dandy to leave North Korea with WMD to sell to terrorists why we fight for illegitimate reasons in Iraq.<br>
What surrendering US troops are you referring to, I dont follow on that one.<br>
and leftist liberal media? Are you crazy? Do your research on who owns the media companies, see who is really in charge. You would be surprised who controls what you see and hear. All you see on tv and on the major news channels is moderate to insano right-wing conservative views. There are no hardcore liberal views allowed on TV (unless you watch Crossfire on CNN, but that hasnt been on since the war started... that show has both hardcore right and left views, and they debate). But try this, read both sides, because you know both will be biased, but look at the situation from all angles and look at it logically and rationally. Look at the facts, not someones personal judgements or feelings (like the Bill O'Rielly show, that guy IS a Nazi, along with that Shepard loon).<br>
Just one more little tidbit of information... when the Nazis (hey guess who had ties in with them, Prescott Bush, Dubuya's grandpa!), were attacking France and Russia, they slammed images of French and Russian people waving at the cameras and announced &quot;we are liberating these people!&quot; Think about it.<br>

And Sadaam's ties to the Al-Queda are true because? How do YOU know? You have the theory of the ties, so you are responsible for showing the proof. It seems highly unlikely to me, and its my right as an American to believe that now hmmm?<br>
Perhaps the Nazi comment offended you, but taking over and occupying a country, thats a-ok right? Because thats what we are doing. And it doesnt stop with Iraq, Iran and Syria are next most likely.<br>

However, I think it is both ludicrous and outrageous to believe that we are doing this for oil.  I think it's just horrible that you could accuse President Bush, who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders and is busting his ass to keep us all safe, of being in it for cash.  Now it's one thing to question his methods, and I think that there is much room for debate here.  However to even suggest that President Bush is so evil a man that he is willing to bring about the death of thousands of people simply to line his own wallet or the wallets of his friends is outrageous and it offends me to even hear someone suggest it.  If you really believe that the most powerful man in the world is in the business of trading human life for oil/$$, then I pity you.  The world you live in must be a truly horrific place.<br>
<br>
Perhaps after all of this the world will be a safer place, perhaps it will not, but I do not doubt for a second that President Bush is doing everything in his power to make it a better world for all of us.<br>

I guess its OK to kill your own people after the first gulf war, but I also guess you know everything about Al-Quaeda and everything that goes on there.<br>
<br>
I guess its OK to execute POW's, despite the fact they were a maintenance crew.<br>
<br>
I guess since Oil is a huge part of the war, we should invade Venezuela, Libya, and Nigeria since they have oil as well. right.<br>
<br>
Why are Iraqi citizens defending their towns and cities? Why did Russian Citizens defend Stalingrad?  Surely it was not for the Russian leader.<br>

The &quot;stiff&quot; resistance is Iraqi soldiers in the streets, moreso than citizens.

What does this have to do with race?  I don't see how anyone being white is relevant or not.  Take your racist bullshit elsewhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are many countries that exist that have huge human rights violations that we ignore. Take Russia in Chechnya or Turkey killing 30-35,000 Kurds over the last 15 years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Extending this reasoning, there are many countries that exist that have oil that we ignore.  Thus if your argument is valid in proving that human rights violations are not the reason we are in Iraq, the exact same reasononing can be applied to prove that we are not in Iraq for oil.  Of course I think the whole argument is invalid in that it is overly simplistic and attempts to compare situations as if they are commodities and fails to recognize the uniqueness of each situation.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;By the way, whatever happened to those pesky WMD? Don't want to address that eh? I guess musical feelings is just too much fun. Pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
The crux of my argument as to why we have to go in in the first place is that it's not possible to find hidden WMD's in a country the size of California unless the people that hid them tell us where they are.  Besides, we are what, 2 weeks into the war?  We haven't even gotten into Baghdad yet.  We may yet find something, though I'm fairly certain we'll never find all of it as he has it so well hidden.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your foaming-at-mouth militarism is disgusting. You are missing those little things called &quot;reasons&quot; in your worthless babble.&quot;<br>

None of these countries have much in the way of oil.  We have not kept land in any of them, so imperialism is not our goal.  Why do you think we were in all of those countries?<br>

Some other contributing factors you ignore in your comparison:<br>
<br>
1) North Korea never invaded Kuwait or any other sovereign nation<br>
2) North Korea has an army of 1 million+ men and is far more developed technologically than the Iraqi military.<br>
3) China might very well support NK in a military conflict<br>
4) NK has nukes, which they might just use on us if backed into a corner.<br>
<br>
Why didn't we invade the Soviet Union under communism?  They clearly represented a threat to us and they have the largest oil reserves of any country in the world.  Simple, they were too powerful for us to easily take over.  The likely cost of war with the Soviet Union was too high.  The likely cost of war with North Korea is too high also.  They are a nuclear power.<br>
<br>
Your arguments consistently fail to recognize the uniqueness of each situation and each country and instead you draw conclusions from one particular characteristic, whether it be oil reserves or human rights violations.  You need to look at the entire situation and examine all the factors involved in the decision making process.  It is far more complicated than you make it out to be.<br>

Which nation has the second largest oil reserves on the planet? Hint: Iraq. In addition, Bill Clinton was not a greedy Texas oilman. George Bush is NOT 200+ years of U.S. history. <br>
The human rights argument is lame, and you know it, given how we ally with nations like Turkey with horrible human rights violations.<br>
We are left with WMD. Was the threat so immanent that we needed to invade? You have presented ZERO evidence why we needed to pull the inspectors out and start butchering people. <br>

&quot;Why didn't we invade the Soviet Union under communism? They clearly represented a threat to us and they have the largest oil reserves of any country in the world. Simple, they were too powerful for us to easily take over.&quot; Exactly my point. Iraq = an easy target (or so Bush thought). Oh, and Saudi Arabia has the largest proven reserves of any country. Don't worry, even though they harbor terrorists , stone people publicly, and hate the United States, they give Bush the &quot;juice&quot; so thats ok.<br>
You said it was all about WMD. If it was, we would be engaged in NK right now. As you stated &quot;NK has nukes, which they might just use on us if backed into a corner.&quot; So then Iraq has no WMD to use if backed into a corner hmmm?<br>
&quot;North Korea never invaded Kuwait or any other sovereign nation&quot; Hello??! Where have you been? The Korean War? DUH<br>
NK is a starving country, a weak country, and there will be an immense incentive to sell WMD to the highest bidder to feed them. But NK becoming a nuclear &quot;K-Mart&quot; is okey dokey with you because they didnt slaughter Iraqi citizens under Reagan and Bush's supervision, like Saddam did.<br>
The thought of NK having nuclear weapons makes China's skin crawl.<br>

Lets not ignore this that was quoted in another thread:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>According to reports from the previous U.N. inspection agency, UNSCOM, Iraq has 600 metric tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, VX and sarin, and nearly 25,000 rockets and 15,000 artillery shells, with chemical agents, that are still unaccounted for. In fact, in 1995, Iraq told the United Nations that it had produced at least 30,000 liters of biological agents, including anthrax and other toxins it could put on missiles. This material has not yet been accounted for.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Wow!  And guess what? THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FUCKING HAVE IT.<br>

If this was a war for oil we would invade Venezuela because they have CONSISTENTLY produced more oil than Iraq since 1990. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=truthreason>TruthReason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm actually Goanad.</span><br>  Posts: 896<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/03 2:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~</span><hr size=1> Watching the leftists here flaggelate is funny....and pathetic. <br>

Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty...we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to. <br>
