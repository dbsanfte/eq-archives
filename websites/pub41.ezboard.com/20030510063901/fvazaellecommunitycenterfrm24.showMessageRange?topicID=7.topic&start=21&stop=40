Krimzin,<br>
<br>
I always enjoyed grouping with you, Majin, Krass, Tass, and Raif in the halcyon, pre-60, sebilis crypt days.  I used to look forward to that exp group.<br>
 <br>
You led IV so it ran so smoothly.<br>
There wasn't any bitching about loots or stupid @#%$ that other guilds suffer from regularly.<br>
Additionally, you managed to make me feel like IV was a place where I belonged and was appreciated.<br>
The time I was in IV was probably the best time I ever had in EQ.  <br>
<br>
Yeah, I left the guild because of a conflict of interests.  <br>
We didn't see eye to eye.  That's okay though.  We went seperate ways.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
It's a game.<br>
Your post was a great one.  I don't think I could even think of that many nice things to say about people.  Ghol questions your earnestness.  I don't care.  The guild you formed was a great place for all these people to hang out and be social.  It accomplished many things and raised the bar for everyone else.  They all benefitted from it, somehow, even if they had some disappointments along the way.  <br>
<br>
Someday, like all things, it had to end.  <br>
<br>
I wish you luck, Krim.  I think you did a pretty good job here on Vazaelle.<br>

(really long)</span><hr size=1> Well.. I certainely wasn't expecting this.  I expected that you would just fade away and I'd never see another peep out of you again.  But you were always a surprising guy huh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What it comes down to sir is that everyone makes mistakes.  And really, its just a dumb game.  I don't hold anything against you in the end, I really don't.  I forgave you myself a long time ago, even if I never said anything, because of my pride.  And pride is the essence of it, its the reason things happened as they did, your pride my pride xarr's pride, everyone's pride.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to drop the wall I've made for myself behind this persona here and say some things I hope you take to heart.  You are a good leader.  You're charismatic, you recognize talent, you have goals and you make them happen.  But you have two faults sir.  <br>
<br>
One is your pride.  Things would not have happened the way it did if you could have let go of your pride for a moment.  Clearly its not all your fault.. but it should never have happened this way.  I would have followed you, but you were afraid of being rejected, so you rejected me.  And it took many many talks with Rhyu to find that out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Basically I'm just saying.. let it go some.  Its not like I'm the paragon of humility here.. but there comes a point where you have to give in and show some humanity, and it should have come for you before this goodbye post to a game and a server you loved.<br>
<br>
Your other fault is that you get too easily coerced and controled by women.  I'm not saying this to hurt you, I'm saying this so that you can maybe take a look at yourself and understand it, and hopefully remember for the future, in real life or in games.  When I was 20 I thought with my dick too though.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   In many ways you remind me of myself at your age.. but in the end I had become too jaded and too burnt out to be an effective leader any more.  Don't let it happen to you man, take what you learned from this experience and grow on it.  Don't wind up being &quot;that @#%$ vehn from vcc&quot; like me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  because it leads nowhere.<br>

(really long)</span><hr size=1> I dont even know where to start, so i guess i'll start from the beginning.  When i first met Brian i was a total newbie on Morell Thule.  I'd played alittle, but not more than at a passing, and never with the level of dedication he showed this game.  I remember wondering how the hell he made playing a ranger look so good heh. <br>
<br>
When he formed In Virtue on MT, it was something i aspired to, something to shoot for, even if it was a hell of a longshot.  I started raiding with IV on MT some, and i watched him in action, his leadership capabilities blew my mind.  He is without a doubt the single most charismatic leader i have ever known in my life.  And then he was gone, i had only talked to him in passing, but he quit EQ because of RL stuff and i felt a like a chance had passed me by.  IV broke up on MT and the remaining members formed another guild on the server.<br>
<br>
I think the worst moment came later tho, i was in lguk with some friends and Brian shows up on Xziled, he asked me to guildinvite him so he could say hi to his friends, i kicked my guildleader a tell as a jest not thinking anything of it, and was told not to invite him.  When i told him, he just seemed sad, and i felt like i had betrayed his trust completely, when he logged off i knew i'd sided with the wrong person.  I promised myself that day i wouldnt betray his trust again if i was ever lucky enough to regain that trust.<br>
<br>
When Vazaelle came up i half heartedly went and played there at the goading of a few of my friends, Vulp playing a huge factor in getting me to play on the server.  I was afraid of Brian to be honest, i didnt know what he thought of me, or if i'd ever meet his standards, when i was invited to IV some months later it was the best moment in my EQ career if you can call it that.  He led us to become the very best in EQ and i was proud to be a part of it.<br>
<br>
Brian, if you ever need someone to walk through the valley of darkness with you, I'll be right there.  I may not be the best choice, i dont think i'm the worst, but when the it comes down to it, i wouldnt budge from your side.  See you at fan faire chief, its been a pleasure.<br>

<br>
It's amazing how much thought some of you people put into trying to impress other players and tailor your actions accordingly.<br>
Some of you stated how IV put Vazaelle on the map and how &quot;uber&quot; IV was and how it would be remembered forever.*laugh*<br>
The only people who care about IV's accomplishments are the kiddies, as one stated they worshipped IV and wanted to become a member. Well sure they do, their kids, they are easily impressed and don't know any better.<br>
Adults don't care who was the first guild to kill ubermobxyz with the least amount of people in the shortest amount of time for phatlootzxyz. How does this impact anyone outside of the guild/group that participated?<br>
<br>
Some people got it right when they acknowledged this is a game and what's important is having fun and making friends. Enjoying the experience for yourself is all that matters.<br>
<br>
The only thing &quot;uber&quot; about you people who think you have accomplished something extraordinary is that your uber-retarded. You need a serious reality check.<br>
Someone said they lost their job because they couldn't control their gaming. What a moron.<br>
As Krimzin himself stated in a post, he is a 20 year old with no job, living at home with mommy. How pathetic.<br>
<br>
These examples show a lack of accomplishment and what you achieved with a cartoon character in Everquest is not going to impress you next job interviewer.<br>
<br>
PS: I am not picking on former &quot;IV&quot; members who have voiced how incredibly talented they are. This applies to the other guilds/players who suffer from dementia also. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uatro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/15/01 2:03:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Too funny</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Some people got it right when they acknowledged this is a game and what's important is having fun and making friends.

Are you making friends with that post? Or having fun? If ripping on people you know nothing about is your idea of fun, count me out. Perhaps you should take some of your own advice and just chill out and enjoy the game? If you want to rant on players, take it to rants and flames.<br>
<br>
Btw, the vast majority of IV folks were adults with jobs, and we probably had the highest concentration of couples on Vaz. But of course, you didn't know that did ya?<br>

<br>
Personally, I base my opinions of people *only* on my interactions with them. I know a lot of people say that, but honestly, until someone's a dick to me, I think they're cool. So throughout this whole IV drama thing, I've mainly been like...hey, whatever, doesn't affect me.<br>
<br>
However when I heard Krimzin was leaving Vazaelle, I have to admit I was saddened. Not because I knew him personally, but because I believe him to be one of the most skilled EQ players ever. In a matter of months, he led a guild to do things that guilds on other, older servers can only dream of. Not only that...but he did so while maintaining the faith of his guild members.<br>
<br>
Yeah, this is only a game. However, real life emotions do come into play when your little pixellated character butts heads with another little pixellated character. When you spend 8+ hours a day playing this game...it affects you in real life.<br>
<br>
K well I've done my spouting.<br>
<br>
Krimzin the Tactician, I wish you luck in whatever you do...and remember that there are quite a few of us &quot;little people&quot; that have always respected you.<br>

It was nice reading that and laughing or smiling at some of the remarks about ppl.  Especially Menexia and Kelnok's.  =)<br>
<br>
Krim, you know I dont like posting personal stuff here, so all that needs to be said here is...  You had my respect and my support through everything that happened in EQ, and if the guild was still there, you would continue to have it.  I think you are an awsome guildleader and an ammazing player.  One of the best that I have ever met.  You are also someone I like and consider a friend.  I will never forget my time in IV, and will always consider it my home in EQ.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of things were done poorly, but hopefully we all learned from them.<br>
<br>
As for anything else that needs to be said, I will do that in private.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to everyone mentioned in this thread.  I will definetly miss you all.  As for the ppl flaming, this thread has nothing to do with you, let it go. <p><p><br><font color=#CC33FF><font type=bold>Cassiana the Templar<br><a href="http://www..org">In Virtue,</a>  Vazaelle<br><a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~qfh1/Cassiana">My Profile</a></p>
