<br>
While I was looking around I noticed <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">www.eqtraders.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> uses <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.racknine.com">www.racknine.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> .

<br>
CGI-Bin Directory<br>
This is a directory setup with special permissions to auto-execute user-defined scripts. CGI is used to accomplish tasks which are not supported by basic HTML such as shopping carts and auctions.<br>
<br>
Server Side Includes (SSI)<br>
SSI allows you embed CGI scripts into your web pages. The scripts will execute automatically when the web page is opened.<br>
<br>
JavaScript Support<br>
A popular scripting language that adds author-specified user events to static pages.<br>
<br>
Wireless Application Protocol<br>
WAP allows you to create web pages that can be viewed over mobile devices such as micro browser equipped cell phones.<br>
<br>
Subdomains - (Unlimited)<br>
A subdomain is shown as sub.domain.ext, where domain.ext is the primary domain. A subdomain can be redirected to display any page located on the internet.<br>
<br>
Subdomain Redirects - (Unlimited)<br>
A Subdomain Redirect redirects Internet traffic from a particular subdomain to another location.<br>
<br>
Statistics for Subdomains<br>
You can view statistics specifically for each subdomain using the Analog and Webalizer tools.<br>
<br>
Customizable Error Messages<br>
You can provide a customized error message when a visitor encounters an apache error.<br>
<br>
OpenPGP Keys Manager<br>
OpenPGP is a tool for securing online communication.<br>
<br>
Index Manager<br>
The Index Manager will allow you to turn indexes on or off for a directory. If indexes are off, people will not be able to see what files are in a directory that lacks an index file.<br>
<br>
Password Protected Directories - (Unlimited)<br>
Password Protected Directories are secure directories that require a username and password in order to view the documents inside using a web browser. Secure directories are recommended to ensure security of confidential and private information.<br>
<br>

<br>
Awstats<br>
Awstats provides highly detailed graphical site statistics for your domain.<br>
<br>
Webalizer Statistics<br>
Webalizer Statistics provides highly detailed graphical site statistics for your domain.<br>
<br>
View Latest Visitors<br>
This will show you the last 300 visitors who came to your site, and some interesting information about them.<br>
<br>
Bandwidth Usage Indicator<br>
This will show how many bytes of transfer your account has done.<br>
<br>
Error Logs<br>
This will show errors in your site, images not loading, missing files, etc. This is very useful for debugging a cgi script.<br>
<br>
MySQL Databases - (Unlimited)<br>
A true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL (Structured Query Language) database server. SQL is the most popular database language in the world. MySQL is a client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon mysqld and many different client programs/libraries.<br>
<br>
phpMyAdmin<br>
PhpMyAdmin is a PHP interface that abstracts mysql into a web-based administration tool allowing you to sort, edit, and create tables within a given database.<br>
<br>
Cron Jobs<br>
Cron jobs allow you to automate repetitive tasks on the server that hosts your web site. This is a powerful tool that allows you to take a hands-free approach to repetitive tasks.<br>
<br>
Add Mime Types<br>
Mime types tell browsers how to handle specific extensions. Most Mime types are set globally on the server. For example, the text/html Mime type equates to htm, html, and shtml extensions on most servers, and this tells your browser to interpret all files with those extensions as HTML files. You can alter or add new Mime types specifically for your site (note that you can not alter the global Mime type values, only add to them). Mime types are often used to handle new technologies as they appear. When WAP technology first appeared no-one had these extensions set up on their server. With Mime types, however, you could have set it up yourself and begun serving WAP pages immediately.<br>
<br>
Add Apache Handlers<br>
Apache handlers tell the server how to deal with web files that need to be processed on the server. For example, Apache is set up to process files with .pl extensions using Perl. However, if for some reason you also wanted to process files with .script extension using Perl, then you would have to set up a custom Apache handler for your site.<br>
<br>
Redirects<br>
The Redirects area allows you to redirect Internet traffics from one web page to another. This is usually used when a web page has been moved to another location.<br>
<br>
HotLink Protection<br>
Hotlinking is when another web site owner links directly to one or more of your images or multimedia files and includes it on their web page. Hotlink protection can prevent hotlinking by only allowing named sites (such as your own web site) to access files on your site.<br>
<br>
Search Engine Submit Tool<br>
This allows you to submit your web site details to several search engines at one time.<br>
<br>
Domain Lookup Tool<br>
The Domain Lookup tool allows you to look up information about a particular domain. It does this by using a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup, which is a general-purpose replicated, data query service used for translating hostnames into Internet addresses. DNS details are published for public use.<br>
<br>
Trace Route Tool<br>
The Trace Route tool allows you to trace the IP (Internet Protocol) route taken by your server to reach your current ISP (Internet Service Provider).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Account Access Features<br>

Web-based Control Panel - (Cpanel Home Page Demo)<br>
cPanel is a fully-featured web-based control panel that allows you to manage your domain through a web interface.

<br>
File Manager<br>
The File Manager allows you to manage your site through HTML, rather than an FTP tool or other third-party application.

They recently &quot;upgraded&quot; their servers, and it was such chaos and went so badly they got rid of all phone and email customer support. The EA web site along with two sites my father runs are hosted at westhost, and not only have I not been able to access my control panel since sometime in july (because they won't reset my password), they managed to delete three mailing lists my dad had set up, including the names of the subscribers, the archives, and all contact information.<br>
<br>
I've been emailing them about twice a week since July, no response - at one point I was given a link to check if my message had been read and responded to...I checked it repeatedly for about a week, then gave up for a bit, then checked back two weeks later - it had been declared &quot;resolved&quot;. Not only was the problem not resolved, they didn't even contact me to let me know they *thought* it was resolved.<br>
<br>
Uhhh yeah rambling/ranting now.

It's 750mb, 30gig transfer, perl, php, c++, mysql, 50 email accounts, message board, passworded directories...all sorts of good stuff, and it's like $10. So far the customer service is awesome too, not more than an hour after I registered I got a phone call from a contact at InMotion asking if I had any questions or anything, and they sent me a really detailed email on how to transfer everything over form Westhost. Good people there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck and sorry for the babbling &gt;&lt; <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7827"><img src="http://eternaladvocates.com/cheryl/lyllsparklesig.gif" border="0"></a> </center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lylliae99>Lylliae99</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.eternaladvocates.com/cheryl/hearticon1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/30/03 3:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lylliae99>Lylliae99</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.eternaladvocates.com/cheryl/hearticon1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/30/03 3:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4573.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any Web Host recommendations?</span><hr size=1> Oh, one more thing...depending on what type of site you have (especially if it's an image heavy site that'll have to carry a large load), I might recommend staying away from Racknine. I worked on the EQ Pixel Army and it's hosted there, and the site had a lot of downtime before we upgraded the package we were on, plus from what I heard it was a real pain getting anyone from Racknine to do anything for us. Racknine is cheap though, so if it's a smaller site it might be ok. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lylliae99>Lylliae99</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.eternaladvocates.com/cheryl/hearticon1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/30/03 3:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=merraharvaz>MerraharVaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 391<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/30/03 7:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4573.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any Web Host recommendations?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hostrocket.com">Hostrocket</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is pretty good and reliable, but I'm not sure if their basic package (which is under $10/month) satisfies your needs.<br>
