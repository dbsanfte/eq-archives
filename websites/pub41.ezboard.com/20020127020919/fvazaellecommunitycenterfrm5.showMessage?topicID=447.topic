I have NEVER seen anyone who managed to cause this many trains. He gave a shit about where my group was fighting. He just passed, pulled lots of mobs, came to us and feigned. YOUR AN ASS!!!<br>
<br>
We tried to get to LCY in KC several times but each damned time that guy passed us and about 1 minute later we had him pass again with a train after him. How the Hell can such a person become level 51???<br>
<br>
I really wonder how many other ppl know him and if there is ANYONE who is in KC sometimes too that doesn't hate him.<br>

<br>
95% of the time someone gets trained in Karnor's, it is their own fault. Allow me to explain.<br>
<br>
Most pullers are used to doing a certain something when pulling: cast a spell, shoot an arrow, throw a hammer, whatever. They just know they need to get onto the hatelist of the mob, and then move back to their team so that the mob can come merrily prancing along to the team.<br>
<br>
This works great for almost any zone where people do not pull using the same pathing as another puller. This is where Karnor's becomes problematic. This is why I just won't team for very long at all until the team moves to the back of the zone instead of the front.<br>
<br>
If you pull a mob, you need to deal ~200 damage to the mob (just kick, flying kick, whatever 3 times) so that if you were to walk a mob with easy aggro, it will follow you to the camp. If you fail to make the mob dislike you enough, your mob will train onto whomever runs by the mob.<br>
<br>
This gets even worse if that person was pulling to begin with also. A scenario:<br>
<br>
Saalron flying kicks a sentry of sathir 3 times. He then begins to move the mob to an isolated place where he will kill it, perhaps with a team. Mund, coming from another direction, throws a hammer at a drolvarg sentry. Saalron and Mund cross paths and the sentry changes to hunting Saalron because Mund failed to aggro it properly. Saalron can't solo two mobs, so he feigns. The sentry now returns to hating mund, and aggros whatever Saalron was pulling. End result? Mund just got trained. Sorta.<br>
<br>
It is very very easy to dump mobs on other people in that zone, even knowingly, espcially with the volume of undead mobs in the zone. I don't expect every person who wanders in to understand this at all. In fact, I know that most people playing there are fresh from Dreadlands where single pulls and easy exp with zero risk was the way of life.<br>
<br>
I've gotten tired of trying to explain this to other people. The only workaround I've found is to just feign and give them them mess. Then walk to their team, reaggro my mob, and walk off with it. It often (let me stress the word often here) makes people think that I've trained them, stolen a mob from them, and even more when in fact, their newbie puller has caused their team grief by being lazy.<br>
<br>
Saalron<br>
<br>
PS, I'm not defending or attacking Mund here. I'm just saying that it's a good decision to move your teams off of pathways and understand before pointing fingers.<br>
<br>
PPS, /rant Whoever the hell decided that the tower and left courtyard are 'camps' are idiots. Why the hell would you place a camp on top of no less than 5 roamers and 4 static mobs's aggro range when there are places 20 feet away that have no aggro at all? Stop camping regular spots and look around, you'll be surprised at what you find. There are more pockets in that castle for a camp to nestle into than you will ever know about if all you do is camp the tower or lcy. /end rant <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/01 11:25:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=447.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> forgot one thing</span><hr size=1> Like all of Kunark, Karnor's has lazy aggro. You can literally aggro every mob in the second castle, hop off into the moat, then swim to the front and have nothing chase you. But the moment you get near the second castle again, the whole thing will come for you. There are very many opportunities to think you have no aggro, when in fact you're aggroing the whole zone every second you're there (this goes for people healing/buffing people also, if someone has that aggro, you get it also). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujulsisters.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Julsisters</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/01 6:20:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=447.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: forgot one thing</span><hr size=1> Well, I think I understand how trains work and do you think it's ok when one group fights the mobs from behind the 2nd bridge in front of the 2 bridge to pass them with your group, run into RCY, get waxed and bring the train to the other group? Well, I think that sux big time. Still have no idea how they aggroed so much shit when walking into RCY.<br>
<br>
Or how about the time when he suddendly (while LFG) /OOCed thats its funny to FD in DoggieWL Room and after some minutes running past you when you kill stuff near entrance followed by more mobs then you have fingers without even shouting anything?<br>
<br>
Was interesting too when we were medding after one of those Trains on the right side when he came near us and feigned while a train ran to zone (dunno 100% who caused that Train so I won't go deeper in that) and when the train was at zoneline he stood up, didn't loose his aggro and the entire Train came to all the ppl on the right side. Instead of bringing them to the left side so we others could zone out he simply feigned again.<br>
<br>
Yeah I know that Trains are not uncommon in KC but some Rules have established in KC too like shouting Train and training them to the left and such like but this faggot just trains. Only one train yesterday was caused by us when we were near LCY and got some aggros, we immediatly shoutet Train and nobody who wasnt in our Group died or had to suffer anything bad, they just had to move to the left side and thats it.<br>
<br>
It's really hard to explain what that guy did there all the time, just group with him or stay a while in KC when hes there too so you can judge.<br>

I also know that it was the subject of another thread recently but it has happened so often over the last few days that I wanted to bring it up again...<br>
<br>
As a rule:<br>
<br>
*** DO NOT JOIN A GROUP UNLESS YOU ARE STAYING FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR ***  <br>
<br>
...or at least tell the group when you join them that this is the case.<br>
<br>
So many people in KC join a group, and within minutes announce that they have a guild raid to do.  I know it happens elsewhere but the turnover in a KC group can be incredibly high - which makes it very difficult to hold a camp.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I spent an hour LFG in KC last night so maybe people were staying in groups for longer...or maybe they were just busy running from the trains! <p><p align="center"><strong><font color="#008000">Uwei the Fire Caller<br>
