<br>
The land was giving way to desert as Mysse and her sister walked in silence.  Usually Myssa could keep conversations going by herself and rarely stopped except to eat and drink.  Something was bothering her, and Mysse was certain what it was.  That was why she wasn't going to start this conversation.  If her healing sister wanted to know about her activities in the Lodge of the Dead, she could ask, but Mysse had no desire to tell her.<br>
<br>
To Mysse's surprise, it wasn't about the orc, or her research and training in the guild that was on Myssa's mind, it was something else.  Seeimingly out of no where , Myssa took a deep breath and sighed.  Mysse laughed out loud, catching a mean look from her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't we stop here and rest. Its almost lunch time, I'm hungry, you seem tired, and if we go much farther there won't be any trees left for shade!&quot;  Mysse quitely unslung her backpack and sat down at the base of the tree.  Myssa followed suit as they began to dig in their packs for their rations and water flasks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead, say it.&quot;  Mysse said as she took a bit of her ration. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;About you?&quot; Myssa laughed. &quot;No my sister I was thinking of something else.&quot;  Myssa turned her head and her laughter quickly drained as she back over the rolling hills of the commonlands.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Kladea.&quot;  Mysse sighed regretfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;We haen't heard from her in such a long time.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I know, but I don't think she's in trouble.  The ghosts and ghouls and skeletons haunting Befallen are weak.  She's well able for them. She'll come back when she finds what she needs.&quot;  Mysse wondered if her sister knew just what hand she had in sending their little sister off on her quest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I miss her.  She's so young!&quot;  Myssa's face was pained.<br>
<br>
&quot;But powerful, you know she's powerful, she's risen quickly in the ranks of the Dead, I should know, I helped train her until she surpassed me with her magic.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't we forget our mission and go find her?&quot; Myssa asked in earnst.  Mysse was shocked.  Her sister was was the most devout Cleric she'd ever known.  She was wililng to forget a mission given to her from the High Priestess herself.  But Mysse knew if they went looking for her now, not only would her need in freeport be unattained, but likely Kladea's mission would be incomplete as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know we can't forget that, &quot; Mysse said laughing. &quot;I'll tell you what.&quot; Myssa's face grew tired, and an oh-i-know-that-line-to-well look appeared on it. Mysse ignored it. &quot;We can finish this mission in what? 1 more day?&quot; Myssa nodded. &quot;We'll be in freeport tonight, we'll rest, and get our business done tomorrow.  Then we'll leave and look for our little sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
Myssa smiled.  &quot;You knew I probably couldn't skip this mission anyway. &quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Pretty much.  I also have a bit of business in freeport to attend to. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I know.&quot; Myssa said it so matter of factly that Mysse was shocked. Myssa just laughed at her discomfort. &quot;Lets continue please, we'll make Freeport by dark. &quot;<br>
<br>
They packed up their bags and continued on their way.  Mysse was nervous now, but put it out of her mind.  What did her sister know of her business?  If she knew, did the Clerics of Neriak know too? Not even her master at the Lodge of the Dead knew what she was up to!  Only Kladea should know.  And Kladea wouldn't have told Myssa, would she? <br>
<br>
Mysse eyed her sister cautiously.  Maybe she was more devious than she realized, this not so innocent Dark Elf girl training to become a Priest of Innoruuk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysselyss>MysseLyss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 12:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part III</span><hr size=1> Kladea stared at the gnarled little gnome with faint amusement.  Sitting at that bottom of the ruins of Befallen, she found it laughable that so weak a creature would defy her now.  She stood, imposing before him the minions who both guarded and kept him prisoner dead now at her feet.  The undead creature she commanded to serve her stood behind her, eyes blank, bones bleach white waiting.  <br>
<br>
The gnome's little face sneered at her as he struggled to stand.  He showed no fear to her, even tho he could not stand and clung desperately to that which she was after.  She knew she would have to take it from him, somehow, and though his size was small, his body weak something inside her told her to be wary.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Enough of this gnome, give me what I want and I'll let you live.&quot;  Her voice was strong, even as she felt less sure.<br>
<br>
&quot;ohhh you want this... i know you do..&quot; the little creature rasped.  &quot;But you will not take it from old Nippo, nooo you won't...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do do you expect to stop me you frail excuse for a living creature?&quot;  She made a motion with her hand and her servant, moved forward toward the gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh quite easily you see... I cannot stand, or else I'd leave this wretched place, but now... no now I'll be able to leave...&quot; The gnome was grinning now, its hideous features controting to make him seem like the undead, teeth missing from his mouth, his skin wrinkled.<br>
<br>
Kladea saw him start to speak quietly.  A sudden wave of panic gripped her and she tried to cast a spell to protect herself.  She was too late.  With a weak geesture the gnome froze her servant in place, with another, he shattered the skeleton into his parts.  Then he turned his eyes to her, grinning the hideous, ugly grin.<br>
<br>
Kladea felt the air around her constrict and it became hard to breath.  Her hands came to her throat trying helplessly to find and remove what felt like immense stone hands choking her.  She fell to her knees, and watched helplessly as the little gnome slowly changed before her eyes.  HIs skin relaxed and became more tight.  His eyes regained their colour and became a striking blue.  His limbs seemed to grow under his clothes as they began to fill out again.  The shirt he wore was no longer rotting and fallin off, but looked to be a new piece of clothing.  He was whole again, and as she collapsed tothe group, the hands no longer around her throat she looked at her own hands.  They were withed, old.  Her once long black hair fell into her face and was no grey and stringy as much of it fell out.<br>
<br>
&quot;There we are young Teir'Dal.  I'm free now thanks to you, and now you shall never have it. &quot; He waved his arms and spoke under his breath.  Skeletons seemed to rise out of the earth at his whim, and he set them on her.  They picked her up and hauled to where he was sitting.  <br>
<br>
Kladea stared in horror at the gnome as she could no longer speak, no longer stand, and he stood there grinning at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now we wait for the others to come, so I can complete this little trinket.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kladea knew he meant to wait for Mysse.  When she did not meet her sister in Neriak, she would come for her, and likely bring the other piece with her.  Mysse would not have a chance against this ugly litlte gnome. Mysse could not use the other piece, not alone, not against him.  Not while he carried a piece of the Blood Witch with him.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=121881">Mysse Veri'exa, Dread Lord</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It didn't matter that she was young, too young to be able to join the guilds in the city.  It also didn't matter to her that no shop keeper trusted her enough to let her earn her keep by helping out in the stores.  She could get what she wanted, whenever she wanted.  There was no worry about weather here inside Neriak and the tunnels in Third Gate offered her many places to hide.  She often had reasons to hide.  <br>
<br>
Few people ever caught the little rogue, unless she wanted to be.  Like when she played tricks on her friends or the merchants who shoed her out of the stores.  Even when she had money to spend! No mind to her that she just lifted the money from their own pockets or safe when they weren't looking, it was still good money and its not lik they KNEW she took it.  But they all suspected, which was why she was hoping to find something legitimate now to cover her tracks for a while.<br>
<br>
Only no one would take her in anymore.  The Teir'dal had such littler tolerance for theives, at least openly.  The theives guild themselves would not take her, at least not yet.  They told her had to prove herself, but Runiko wasn't someone to brag. If she showed them what she could do, how could she trust them not to turn her in?  Besides she could do just fine on her own.  She had been since she was 5 afterall.<br>
<br>
All that in her life was over now though.  She had to leave Neriak, and she was scared.  For barely 8 years she had lived on the &quot;generosity&quot; of others, since her parents died.  There was no family to take her in, and now, the others wouldn't accept her.  She had to leave Neriak, her home, her place.  She would miss it.  There was talk of a human city, outside of the forest, through the commonlands that tolerated all kinds.  She would head for Freeport and see herslef settled there.  Maybe she wouldn't even have to steal to live.  But then again, maybe she would just get better at it.<br>
