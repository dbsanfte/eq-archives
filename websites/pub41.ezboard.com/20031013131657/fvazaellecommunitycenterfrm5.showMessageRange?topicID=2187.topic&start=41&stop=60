<br>
This isnt exactly true. I think only true time will ever teach anyone their &quot;craft&quot; and if you know how to really play the game its not too hard to learn another class.<br>
<br>
So far from my experience if you got a couple good members that know what they are doing the other people really dont matter as long as they are not complete fucktards. I mean some people are so bad that they would be more helpful if they just sit there AFK and then of course you do have people who just sit there AFk watching TV or something.<br>
<br>
I mean its not as bad when they actually know their class but you have players who are too easily distracted by things in the real world that you can just tell they are not paying attention. What are they really learning? They learn that they can just put their pet or hit auto attack on a mob and they are doing their job and they dont learn anything outside of that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beefor>beefor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/03 11:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2187.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speednet.com.au/~kunz/photos/mike@dnb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Failing Adventures....</span><hr size=1> This is a mid level rant. levels 29-40 only. Now i realise true newbies do still exist on our server. But to be just plain dumb and flat out refusing to learn or even respond to friendly suggestions is WTS.<br>
<br>
Ok. lets do a rundown of the last week's highlights of the groups (levels 30-40) i've been in.<br>
<br>
We had an assling druid. Naked. Asslings are teh suck and i know they look naked no matter what <br>
<br>
gear they wear, but this one really was naked. I know he was naked because he cast one spell <br>
<br>
every five minutes and said oom. You were our 2ndary healer. You nuked twice and healed once. (1 <br>
<br>
spell very 5 minutes)<br>
<br>
We had a mage(bryo) who claimed that claming/lulling mobs is a waste of time and mana. Kept <br>
<br>
getting agro so cant be an experieced mage. Later gated in the middle of the adventure. He was <br>
<br>
our ML'er. Later tried to prove that he is not a newbie by asking how many ldon points i have. welcome to /ignore.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, two monks who were suffering identify crisis. I realise playing a half naked melee <br>
<br>
character can get confusing, but lets face the truth: you're not warriors. Just because your <br>
<br>
weapons are more twinked than those of the warrior, doesnt mean you should have agro.<br>
<br>
Speaking of monk agro, i grouped with a monk who was our puller, but not main tank obviously. <br>
<br>
Never fd'ed once in 90minutes.<br>
<br>
Enchanters are awesome in ldon groups, much <3. Except when we get adds and this one enchanter <br>
<br>
mezzes themeselves and we wipe. Sure, newbie puller, but then we go in again, adds, we wipe out <br>
<br>
again only  to hear the enchanter gsay "ok, all mobs mezzed, where are you?".<br>
<br>
Then we had a cleric that kept dying. Was extremly puzzled why they kept dying. Well, here is <br>
<br>
possiblity: You healed tank while he was pulling. Then you kept nuking till you went oom. Thats <br>
<br>
the explanation for the supposedly "mysterious" agro. Also, this will come as a shock, but at <br>
<br>
level 34, you have better heals than 100hp, give em a try, your group wont belive their eyes.<br>
<br>
Some people can learn however. Grouped with this pally who kept going afk. She was obviously <br>
<br>
confused as to what class she was playing because she clearly though she must be a necro - if you <br>
<br>
go afk, no one will notice. Sadly, she was the MT.  Second group with that pally when asked for <br>
<br>
explanation the pally said they never go afk. I quoted that line every time they went afk in the <br>
<br>
2nd adventure. I am happy to say that on the 3rd adventure with us that pally stopped going afk <br>
<br>
so there is hope for everyone.<br>
<br>
Speaking of class confusion, there was a cleric who admitted halfway through adventure he thought <br>
<br>
he was playing his SK. I realise sometimes people joke about that stuff, but at that time, i <br>
<br>
thought to myself "oh yeah, that explains a lot".<br>
<br>
Wait there's more. We were putting a group together and asked this lfg person if they want to <br>
<br>
join an LDON group. We were just about to get adventure when they asked if they need the <br>
<br>
expansion for this adventure. *boggle*<br>
<br>
Did i mention the pally who casted some red glowy (stun) spell only once during adventure? kept complaining about rogue (who didnt evade even once) getting agro. <br>
<br>
Then there is this cleric, in every group he complains about at least one person, sometimes more. Spends all his time sending tells to his friends about how much the group sucks. You think thats bad? He accidentally deleted his calm spell and keeps forgetting to buy a new copy! Whenever he groups with another cleric he gets them to do the calming. Oh wait, thats me, nevermind :p<br>
<br>
And of course th en there is a large list of folks who told numerous times "dont touch chests. Dont open chests. No matter how far away we are. NO, Dont open chests. Leave chests for later" decide that perhaps it might be a good idea to just go ahead and open the fucking chest. ARGH. DIE.<br>
<br>
Still, its not all bad, even though this is supposed to be a hate filled rant  i'd like to give <3 to the following folks i grouped with:<br>
<br>
Yoey - uber cleric, calming master. no adds, anytime. <br>
Cortman - if only every tank was as cool as this one.<br>
Nindaari - a pally comming up in her ways.<br>
Studs Boils - Uber bard.<br>
Sinisters - get ldon man,  your enchanter skills are needed :)<br>
Chakrais - get asal faster, good tanks are needed :)<br>
<br>
And quite a few other folks who were pretty cool, see you in ldon.<br>
<br>
Dzauron.<br>
<br>

Watching your group die from a huge dot might be more fun than some of those shitty adventures.

<br>
Seriously though over expansions leveling is going to get easier, the game is going to be easier, things are going to be cheaper, new items that are easier to obtain will replace older harder to obtain items, older content which was hard up the ass will now be trivial to half the people.<br>
<br>
Its a game, if you really want to blame someone for all this you should blame EQ for not releasing everquest 2.<br>
<br>
Also I think it should be seriously noted that if verant didnt change a lot of these things most of you guys wouldnt be anywhere near what you are today. I bet that a bunch of you would have quit long ago or still be trying to push your way through the 50's. Sony makes money when they make a majority of the people happy and I think that the majority of the people are happy in this case.<br>
<br>
I am not as old as some of the players here but I can remember when planar armor was the shit. No I am not talking about PoP I am talking about PoH and PoF. That was the end game shit. I can remember when you could find end game loot in small groups. Hell I can remember when end game gear didnt even have the stats you needed but you proudly wore it anyways.<br>
<br>
I can remember when Mrylokar bp or greaves had mana on it! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eslizarde>ESLizarde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/17/03 9:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2187.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I never left!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
After 7 or so adventures so far, I've definitely come to think that this is the enchanter expansion, well and us high dps people.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well, I'm basing this on only two missions completed so far, but the two most important things to success in LDoN seems to be:<br>
<br>
1- knowing the zone or having a map; this reduces the time wasted by running into and having to clear dead ends and wrong turns.<br>
<br>
2- having a competent group of people; not just people who know their class, but people who stay focused on the mission.  No wandering around, no opening chests, no arguing about which way to go or how to do something.  Pull a mob, kill the mob, pull the next one, move along.<br>
<br>
We had a group with a 55 WAR - 57 SHD - 55 ROG - 58 DRU - 62 CLR - 55 CLR and did a rescue mission in Mistmoore without a hitch, finished with 15 minutes to spare.  The rogue left and we replaced him with a 55 PAL and did a slaughter mission in Rujark, finished with just under 20 minutes to spare.  Not much in the way of DPS, and with that many tanks we just split tanked everything and rooted mobs when we needed CC.  I think that having zone maps, and having groups that stayed focused, was the big difference.<br>
<br>
LDoN is the expansion that will separate the really poor players from everyone else.  You don't have to be the best at your class, but you need to be able to pay attention, follow orders, and stay focused on what you're trying to do.  The blacklist will be filled with people who constantly set off traps, constantly overpull, keep breaking mezz, keep splitting off from the group, and so on.  Those people will either learn to play the game more effectively, or they'll get back on the Gimp Express.  Either way they'll be weeded out of LDoN groups.<br>

<br>
Yes its bad enough when people have no idea how to play the mechanics of their class i.e. when to mez, heal, nuke, hold aggro etc <br>
<br>
BUT<br>
<br>
The biggest problem seems to be a lack of focus on the task at hand and understanding the craft of the group or raid dynamics.<br>
<br>
I was in a Inner Caves group in Valor with a great DPS group but unfortunately no chanter but the Cleric admitted she was torn in attention between chatting to 7 people at once, guild chat, market chat and various other chat groups she had running PLUS was making occasional commentary about the movie she was watching. I have a number of great friends in PO so its not a slag at them in any way just the level 65 Cleric with godly gear and no clue and a example how we need more people to learn their CRAFT.<br>
<br>
Needless to say after wiping to The Sleepwalker 3 times cause she didnt pacify or heal or even respond to tells / group chat we all went our own way. Next group not even as well balanced or had the levels (everyone else was 65 I was the lowbie at 62 at that stage) or had the gear and AAs the group had went straight in and spanked his ass without a single fatality.<br>
<br>
You cannot do LDoN well unless everyone participates 100% and hell lets face it you have a timer situation so its not like you can frig around.<br>
<br>
I play a variety of toons and I must say I have come accross in groups and LDoN far more good than bad players that are 45 to 55 than I have 60 to 65 (except for the fellow twinks who promelgate the same crappy skills in all their toons) and thats really sad.<br>
<br>
Learn your craft and we all have fun.<br>

<br>
1. Learn how to turn the god damn attack off when mobs enrage.<br>
<br>
2. If a mob is rooted, move away from it.  What's the point of rooting if you just keep moving toward it?  There's space, so back off and get out of the melee range please.<br>
<br>
3. If you are an enchanter, dont fuck around pulling if we already have a puller.  I don't mind Jennifer doing it, but if you don't have her gear or similar, don't do it please. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;font-family:comic sans;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=376166" target="top"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raiya Lemmingwarden</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
