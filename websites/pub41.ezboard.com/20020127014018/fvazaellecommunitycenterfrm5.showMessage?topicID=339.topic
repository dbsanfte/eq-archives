<br>
I'll do my best to explain the situation.<br>
<br>
Most of you are aware that there is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the aggro code. In Kael there are a lot of NPCs that can be charmed that are significantly more powerful than any pet. Some folks were using this combination of bug and situation to make encounters much more trivial than they were intended to be.<br>
<br>
Fixing the bug will require a full patch, and a largish one at that. We weren't willing to make a large emergency patch, taking down all the servers and requiring all that downtime for our customers to fix a bug being abused in one zone.<br>
<br>
This left us with pretty much three options.<br>
<br>
1) Allow folks to continue to use the bug to their advantage.<br>
2) Begin punishing people for using the bug until it could be patched.<br>
3) Remove the ability to use the bug in the situation where it was most abusable, Kael, and then fix the bug with the next patch and remove the temporary fix.<br>
<br>
We chose the third option.<br>
<br>
We don't want people using bugs to their advantage. We feel that it harms the game integrity and the gameplay of those that don't use bugs to their advantage. We couldn't take option one.<br>
<br>
We could choose option two, but policing such things requires resources, and banning people isn't something we like to do. This is a new bug, and perhaps people were unsure that it is indeed a bug. And in most circumstances this bug only changes the play style of some people. Only in a few circumstances does this bug become abusable. So fixing the specific circumstance is better than giving warnings to players.<br>
<br>
I know the next question, and let me answer it right now. This is a new bug, and it could be argued with some conviction that players using it to their advantage were unaware that it wasn't purposeful code change. In the case of the abuse of safe zones, it is well known that using such locations is against our rules. It can't be reasonably argued that any player with a character over 50th level doesn't understand that.<br>
<br>
In any case, we plan to fix the bug with the next patch. Until then, the NPCs in Kael will probably remain uncharmable. We understand that this adversely affects single and double group raids in that zone, and for that we are sorry. But things should be back to normal soon. Assuming anyone knows what normal is anyway… <br>

i still find it ironic that their denying the patch was not souly because of us (LoS). i know pets help people kill tormax/statue/vindi but VI knew this too, they just chose to take action after we killed AoW, strange?<br>

Maybe next time (verant) don't make fundamental game changes like messing with the long_established_aggro_system without a lot of testing??? I said it when they did it that it was incredibly stupid for them to be messing with that shit and now we are yet again paying for the repercussions of their beta testing (call a spade a spade). Changes like that should be extensively tested on *gasp* the test server before making it live.<br>

Charming monsters to help fight during combat encounters is such an obvious bug, though.<br>
<br>
After all, every enchanter out there had to personally hack the client side engine just to &quot;unlock&quot; the whole charm series of spells.<br>
<br>
You had to figure that after a while Verant was going to find out it was happening.  Lucky that the entire enchanter class wasn't banned out of hand.<br>
<br>
I understand that some wizards are using AE damage spells in situations where they face multiple mob targets thereby doing more damage than they would in other circumstances with those spells.  Beware if you are exploiting this well known bug, sounds like VI is almost at the end of their collective patience with people abusing the system.<br>

<br>
Everyone is pretty aware of the pet agro bug, including Verant.  They noted the bug prior to this incident and have plans to fix it.  Pets generate waaay too much agro right now.  Ask any mage.<br>
<br>
This bug played perhaps a key role in the defeat of the AoW.  I've read that many credit the fact that they used charmed giants as the main tanks to acheive their victory.  Without the agro bug, the charmed pets likely wouldn't have held agro.  I don't know that of course, but it seems pretty reasonable that they wouldn't have been as effective.<br>
<br>
It's pretty reasonable, in my opinion, for Verant to want to avoid a situation where a known bug plays a huge role in the defeat of one of the toughest mobs in the game.<br>
<br>
When the bug is fixed, the zone should be returned to normal, and Enchanters will be as effective there as they were prior to the bug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 586<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/01 12:18:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VI's Reasoning...</span><hr size=1> Just like they scaled down encounters due to the CHeal BP nerf?<br>

<br>
Um... what?<br>
<br>
Or are you saying enchanters should not use charmed pets EXCEPT in situations where the pets are simply for better exp efficiency in groups?<br>
<br>
Or are you trying to say that in situations where charmed pets are critical for a victory over a difficult mob, they should be unused?<br>
<br>
I guess that I am not following the logic.<br>
Tried a and failed.<br>
Tried b and failed.<br>
Tried c and succeeded.  Clearly then, c is exploiting a well known bug for an entire fucking critical spell line for a class normally underutilized in raid tactics.  What were you thinking?<br>
<br>
How come that it is acceptable that mages pay the price for this *bug* in unecessary death and disruption of their normal day to day tactics, but that to adapt to the new situation is exploiting?<br>
<br>
<br>
What if Verant decreased the amount of aggro generated by CHeal?  Should clerics not use it except when it would not affect the outcome of the battle?<br>

IMO the real choices they had were thus.<br>
1). Test before changing such a fundamental game mechanic.<br>
2.) Warn people that this was a bug that would be fixed and not to abuse it.<br>
3.) Patch the aggro back to the original way it was handled until they could get the new coding on test where it could be tweaked by the people that choose to beta test for them.<br>
<br>
Personally I would go with choice number 3 in our current situation.<br>

I imagine that adding the ability to temporarily change the agro of a player based on the effect of a spell was a pretty significant change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 550<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/01 3:13:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VI's Reasoning...</span><hr size=1> I tend to agree with ceros in principle, however, I think its pretty suspect that they just let this slide when it was only having negative consequences for the player base (mages) but then as soon as it is documented used in a positive manner suddenly it is number one on the agenda.  I mean if it was a bug the whole time, why didnt they fix it right away?  I guess its not worth taking action to correct harmful mistakes, only helpful ones. <p>Procax

I just don't see how you can advocate that position, Ceros.<br>
<br>
Enchanter pets are unfair everywhere now, but they have only decided to fix one zone where it is *most* unfair.<br>
<br>
Everywhere else it is still okay to use charmed pets that generate too much aggro because it Hasn't involved killing off a high profile mob.  <br>
<br>
Is using a charmed mob vs Cazic Thule all right?<br>
Maybe some quest mob that could help tank CT down...  completely hypothetical question, of course.<br>
Why doesn't VI make mobs in Fear uncharmable? <br>
<br>
or make Icewell mobs that might be used against the Dain uncharmable?<br>
<br>
Increased pet aggro is not a *bug*.  People use pets everyday.  Every pet sent into every combat in every zone has a hate list affected by this *bug*.  This *bug* has already been addressed once... but now that it has resulted in the death of a previously unkilled mob, they find the time to look at it again (look at it, meaning: shut off the ability to charm)  The mere fact that a VI rep mentioned warning, or banning people for using pets that are *bugged* is ludicrous.  What other kind of pets are you supposed to be using?  <br>
<br>
Kazi's post is so completely on the money, btw.<br>

Sorry...  that bore mentioning outside of my other post after I went back and read it.  <br>

Your insinuation that the two points are even vaguely comparable or that I am suggesting something of the sort is totally patronizing.  <br>

<br>
Perhaps I misunderstood your position from your first posts, this is what I got from them, right or wrong:<br>
<br>
- you were frustrated from playing the enchanter class in general<br>
- you compared the charm spell line which is currently afflicted with a bug with the wizard aoe line which is not -- which suggested that you didn't entirely understand the issue<br>
- I got the impression that you were angry that charmed pets were going to soon lose their new found ability to serve as a main tank and built larger than normal agro<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm dense for not picking up exactly where you were going with your abundant sarcasm.  I can live with that.<br>
<br>
As you're probably aware, people were able to forage naggy loot due to a bug after a patch.  This of course was patched quickly.  The agro that pets generate right now is also a bug.<br>
<br>
You seemed angry that players were no longer able to take advantage of this bug in the place where it is of the biggest (known) advantage.  Hence the comparision to the foraging of CoF's.<br>
<br>
As for logic, come now.  Reread your post comparing charms to wizard aoe's.  How are they comparable?<br>
<br>
For the record, my opinions on the subject are:<br>
<br>
- I agree with Kazi in that Verant should do a full emergency patch to revert to the old agro system, and that something as significant as the agro system should have been tested much more thoroughly<br>
- Verant uses its active playerbase to beta test, and that's inappropriate<br>
- Verant should have taken action in regards to this bug when it was inhibiting the players, rather than taking action after it was used favourably<br>
<br>
Despite all of this, I can understand why Verant is taking immediate action to prevent a bug from being used as a primary factor in the defeat of one of the top mobs in the game.  I can also understand that because of the ordeals of a full game patch and the downtime involved, a bandaid solution like they implimented might be a good compromise for them.  Hopefully they're throroughly testing the real fix for this issue as I type this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=339.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=339.topic&start=41&stop=44>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=346.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=335.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=339.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=339.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=339.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
