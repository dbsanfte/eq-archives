If you are a Libertarian, you should vote Libertarian. If you don't, I don't think you deserve to call yourself a Libertarian... We will never see the Libertarian Party become a major party in our lifetimes as long as people like you are Libertarian In Name Only.<br>
<br>
By the way, aren't you proud of Bush's views on government? He is as bad as Gore would be. He:<br>
<br>
1) Abolished part of the 1st amendment by signing the Campaign Finance Reform bill. Less free speech before elections.<br>
<br>
2) Abolished part of the 4th amendment rights with passage of the so-called &quot;Patriot Act.&quot; The FBI and CIA can now search your house without a warrent, take something, and they never even have to tell you.<br>
<br>
3) Created another government bureaucracy called the &quot;Department of Homeland Security&quot; which will have an annual budget of 38 billion dollars, and will do nothing that the FBI and CIA doesn't already do.<br>
<br>
4) Signed a bill increasing federal money for education by a lot. Can't remember the exact amount, but it was one of the largest increases in a long time.<br>
<br>
5) Increased military spending by a lot, especially on items which are not really needed in the new style of conflicts. Donald Rumsfeld admitted that he doesn't really need some of the things passed, as they aren't in his vision of the military. If the Secretary of Defense doesn't want something, it probably isn't useful.<br>
<br>
6) He keeps stepping up the &quot;War on Herbal Medi... &quot; err.. wait, &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; punishing non-violent, non-fraudulent people for doing things that harm nobody. As part of this, they spent a lot of [our] money on drug advertisements which have not worked at all, as they have admitted. <br>
<br>
7) Does nothing about an over-regulated economy. In 2001, 4,132 new government regulations became law under his administration (that is 11-12 new regulations per day), bringing the total number of pages in the Federal Register (the daily government publication in which all proposed and final regulations are announced) to 64,431 pages long.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He plans an invasion of Iraq, when Iraq has not done a thing to us. Saddam has not committed an act of aggression against the US, nor is he a threat to the US, since he has no means of attacking us from his point in the world. Also, without a declaration of war from Congress, a war against Iraq is illegal according to the constitution. Vague accusations are no basis for a war, which will cost lives and loads of money.<br>
<br>
Yes, vote for the lesser of 2 evils, since we will be better off. One day, you will realize that Republican = Democrat. There is not much difference between the 2, really... they all believe in a larger, more intrusive government. Republicans want to regulate how you can have sex, Democrats want to regulate how you can use money... other than that, there isn't much difference. Aren't you glad that we have a Republican president that believes in small government? <br>

<br>
Has there been proof of that? Even if so, there are ways of stopping that other than an all out war. Also, do you think that even completely destroying Iraq will end, or even dent, the terrorist threat? The latest news is that most of Iraq, including their military, hate Saddam. We could topple him in such a way that will not give rise to somebody just as bad (or even worse) than Saddam.<br>
<br>
&quot;But hey, lets just sit on our hands until we get punched in the nuts again&quot;<br>
<br>
See, I never said to sit on our hands. If we find that Saddam is a credible threat to us, it is then a defensive war, and justified. All we have now are vague accusations of what he might be doing. By the way, according to the Pentagon, 12 countries have nuclear weapons, 13 have biological weapons (such as small pox), 16 have chemical weapons, and 28 have ballistic missles. Should we go to war with all of them?<br>
<br>
&quot;Go back to watching the x-files or whatever little land of telletubbies and sunshine that you live in.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sign of a great debater... All I am asking for is solid proof that Iraq is a direct threat to the US. Right now, there is none. Perhaps if the CIA took time away from harassing US citizens, and concentrated on foreign intelligence, like they are supposed to, we can know exactly what Iraq is up to. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, we are spending more money than we have already, plus you want to spend more on a war. Read my lips, there will be more taxes... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 780<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/12/02 6:28:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.texasranger.org/Fake_Badges/Final/Badgerepl(1).jpg height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Will you vote to re-elect George W.

That right there just shows your stupidity and naivete'.  That's the whole reason we have organizations like the CIA and NSA, they have top-secret information and they are entrusted to use it accordingly to keep us and the rest of the free world safe.  Just cause you are a citizen doesn't give you the right to know every god damn top secret piece of info so we can have your approval to put a stop to the bastards.<br>
<br>
As far as the countries that produce weapons of mass destruction or are capable of it, most of them are our friends and allies.  And ya the ones that aren't we should systematically take care of.  Iraq is currently at the top of the list, due to the fact the Sadam has proven that he has no conscience whatsoever and could give a fuck what the rest of the world thinks, i.e. invading Kuwait.  I'm sure after that threat has been neutralized, we need to take a hard look at N. Korea, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia.  <br>
<br>
But hey, guess what, you and your thinking are currently in the minority in this country.  So you can go back to your intelectually perfect, clean world where everyone has equal rights and is innocent until proven in a court of law, while real men in the real world are out there taking care of business so cowards like you can sit around and criticize them.  <br>
<br>
And i didn't realize this was a formal debate, so fuck off i couldn't give a fuck less whether or not I am a good debater. But grats on grasping at straws.<br>
<br>
Remember kiddies, the best defense is a good offense.<br>
<br>
And if I have to pay more taxes in order to never see again what i saw on Sep 11 that's fine.  But if they would give up the godamn War on Drugs the money freed up there would be more than enough for counter-terrorism and such. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:papyrus;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'10pt'">

I do expect them to at least say &quot;we have credible evidence that Iraq has such and such with so and so intent.&quot; Or, how about a private meeting with Congress, so we can formally declare war, instead of having the President illegally declare war?<br>

And China and Egypt and Jordan and... you get the point. Going to war with half of the world is not going to solve anything. It is a bit much to say &quot;We don't like you, so you don't have the right to develop a weapons system.&quot; How would you like it if France started criticizing us for having nuclear weapons, and threatened an invasion unless we destroyed them? Actually, if France did that, I would have to laugh... but you see what I mean. <br>
<br>
We wouldn't have been attacked on Sept 11th if we weren't poking around in other people's business anyway. We fund Israel for some reason, so we gain their enemies. We should avoid entangling alliances...<br>
<br>
&quot;So you can go back to your intelectually perfect, clean world where everyone has equal rights and is innocent until proven in a court of law&quot;<br>
<br>
WAIT, you mean you are AGAINST people having equal rights and being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law? That is interesting... Sure you aren't a Republican? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udabamf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dabamf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/02 2:33:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Will you vote to re-elect George W.

Dodging weapons inspectors means you have something to hide.  I suppose you want to wait until we can stumble upon some hard evidence, and hope it happens before sadam decides he is gonna die soon anyway so he might as well attack us with all he has...?<br>
<br>
You have to monitor what's going on or you fall off the top.  If we let germany take over europe in WW2 we'd soon be next and before you know it you're saluting the nazi flag.  If we let sadam take over kuwait, by now he'd have control of the entire middle east.  That would give him more power to attack us with if he chose to do so.  There is no other means to stop terrorism and threats like sadam other than force.  <br>
<br>
No matter how good we try to look to the world, the leader of these countries ultimately controls what the people see and hear.  Why do you think so many regular citizens in the middle east hate us?  It's hardly a judgement based on all the facts and both sides of the story.  We get 100% of our information from the media.  If that information was controlled by 1 leader, we would have no way to recognize false information.  <br>

im sorry but i kinda see a differance between us not wanting our prisoners on international display and hiding possible chemical, nuclear and biological wepons of mass distruction.<br>

<br>
Now, I am not against going to war Iraq per se, I just want it done legally. We must have a reason, not speculation, and it has to be declared by Congress, not the President. <br>
<br>
&quot;and hiding possible chemical, nuclear and biological wepons of mass distruction.&quot;<br>
<br>
That goes back to my other question... why don't we attack EVERY country with such weapons? I mean, Pakistan has nukes, why don't we go into their country and take it away? Same with India, and China... heck, lets get rid of our own too! If they don't have the right to have a military, what gives us a right?<br>
<br>
Just attacking everybody that looks at us funny is bullyish. Not only that, but it isn't cheap either. In my opinion, baby Bush is just out trying to avenge his father, since Saddam is still in office, and Bush Sr isn't, and he is just searching for an excuse to go to war, instead of having a valid reason. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>O.G.

<br>
how quickly we forget<br>
<br>
Iraq is responsible for many other thigs as well, he pays the families of suicide bombers who kill themselfs in the pakistani israli war 25k each, and if im not wrong that figure went up to 50 or 100k recently.. and what do ya know.. suicide bombings are up in israel<br>
<br>
Blatant support of acts of terrorism such as this is reason enough to go to war to see him out of power imho, <br>
<br>
and dont give me any of that &quot;but he didnt cause the terrorism&quot; bullshit either, 25k is a kings ransom in a 2nd or 3rd wold country, and you cant tell me that it isnt a factor in many of these instances<br>
<br>
should we instead sit back and wait for him to commit a heinous act of violence against israel or the US? he showed 10 years ago that he could put a missile into israel<br>
<br>
little flashback ya.. it only took us 10 years to go from never having put a friggin dog into space to landing men safely on the moon and bringing them back, and we were the first to do it, so we had to start from scratch<br>
<br>
ya want that kind of information today, you can get it at most librarys in the US if you know how to look for it, and if you forgot how to read a book you can prolly find it all online too<br>
<br>
so lets just sit back and wait for the next university cafe bombing, we will wait for the next world trade center, lets wait until some region of the world is a smouldering crater incapeable of sustaning life for 1000 years because you didnt want to spend the money to enforce a sentance handed down by the rest of the world 10 years ago<br>

Typical american who learns about the world from CNN sluts. No fucking clue of geography. The 'paksitani israli' war? Get a map you turd. You know? M-A-P. Take a ruler, measure the distance between the two countries, do the math and figure out theres a few more countries between pakistan and israel.<br>
<br>
Or better yet take the ruler and shove it your ass.<br>
