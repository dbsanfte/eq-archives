      I would like to bring the matter of Tuxtrin and the agreement we had that was broken to your attention.  I noticed you guys were going to Akheva and was told by Sevur that you were going to kill The Vay'Der, and I have<br>
been wanting a &quot;Toetwister&quot; for a while.<br>
   I ask Bilidor, &quot;Hey would you mind if I came on the raid and rolled on the &quot;Toetwister&quot; if it drops?&quot;<br>
   Bilidor tells me politely, &quot;Sure, I'm not a greedy guy&quot;<br>
    So.. I tell Tuxtrin, &quot;Hey can I come to the raid and roll on a Toetwister if it drops?.. I have previously spoken to the only bard and he told me it would be ok if I rolled on the Toetwister and I was wondering if it would be ok with you since you are the Raid Leader?&quot;<br>
   He tells me back, &quot;Sure&quot;<br>
   <br>
  I tell Tuxtrin, &quot;Ok, omw over now, thanks&quot;<br>
<br>
  All I wanted was a chance on it by rolling<br>
<br>
    So I go.. and my partner Aelbram had nothing to do since I went so he asks if he can come too for some fun.  He comes as well as me to the raid and we<br>
sit there for about an hour or 2 killing stuff in the way.  Well anyways I'm playing AE mana for all the casters and hasting my group and after an hour or 2 we finally pull Vay'Der.  We kill him fairly easily (after Jora Malo'd<br>
him).. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .. and what do you know a Toetwister dropped!!!<br>
<br>
I got tells from a few people saying good luck on it as if I were going to roll on it...<br>
<br>
   Well this is where our agreement goes to hell... Tuxtrin says, &quot;Gratz Bilinor on Toetwister&quot;..<br>
    Then right after that I see spam saying, &quot;Gratz Bilinor&quot; in Guild Chat Bilinor bends down to loot and I tell him, &quot;Aren't we gonna roll?!?!?!?&quot;<br>
Bilinor loots and stands up sending me a tell that, &quot;Tuxtrin told me it's a<br>
guild only thing and for me to loot,&quot; and I am sitting there like WTF no rolling?...<br>
    And of course I then send Tuxtrin a tell asking why didn't I get to roll and he tells me it's a merit guild.. then I remind him of the agreement and he says &quot;It was a misunderstanding I didn't know you wanted to<br>
roll..&quot;. then I tell him some more saying, &quot;I know you knew that I wanted to roll beacuse you said SURE&quot;... the way he told me back sounded like it wasn't a misunderstanding at all though but that he just wanted me to be their mana bitch?!?!?...<br>
   Then Aelbram tells him about how he wasted our time and all..  And after a while Tuxtrin tells me that &quot;I'm sorry it must have just been a misunderstanding&quot;.. again.... well it's rough when it's a misunderstanding<br>
on over an hour and an 18/24 effect snare + stats sword.<br>
<br>
    I hope you find a mature way to settle this because he did not even say an apology else then, &quot;It was a misunderstanding&quot; if you even call this an<br>
apology.  I have no problems with Bilinor, because he apologized to me saying that the leader told him it was guild loot only, and then he apologized for Tuxtrin... so I guess you can call that an apology for Tuxtrin?<br>
<br>
      Thank you for your time<br>

<br>
Bear in mind that guild officers and raid leaders get a LOT of tells.  Between tell spam and battle spam, it is entirely possible that when Tuxtrin got a long message from you, he skimmed over it and didn't get your entire meaning.  He would never deliberately deceive someone and use them in that fashion.<br>

I am gonna call what i see.<br>
<br>
I see a ridiculous post on a guilds boards.<br>
<br>
What guild do you know of that will do a guild raid and let a non guildmember or even a trial guildmember for that matter attend the raid and then roll on an item that a guildmember can use?<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
Unless i totally have it wrong it seems to me you need to get over yourself.<br>
<br>
Tuxtrin owes you no apology.<br>
Odysseys owes you no apology.<br>
For you to even have the balls to come to a guilds website and bitch that you didnt get a chance to roll on a guild raid on an item that the guild can use is bullshit.<br>
If i had any kind of board access i would run you off the board quicker then you could say &quot;what the fuck?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think sometimes guilds can be to nice and people get the impression they can walk over that guild.<br>
<br>
well i think Odysseys has always been a bit on the too nice side. And what do they get? A slap on the face from someone like you?? /boggle<br>

<br>
<br>
I would like to bring the matter of Tuxtrin and the agreement we had that was broken to your attention.<br>
he means...<br>
I am going to throw a fit that i didnt get given loot cause im elite<br>
<br>
 I noticed you guys were going to Akheva and was told by Sevur that you were going to kill The Vay'Der, and I have<br>
been wanting a &quot;Toetwister&quot; for a while.<br>
he means...<br>
I have been camping the zone waiting for a guild to go get this for me when i finally found my mark...er a guild to join.<br>
<br>
I ask Bilidor, &quot;Hey would you mind if I came on the raid and rolled on the &quot;Toetwister&quot; if it drops?&quot;<br>
Bilidor tells me politely, &quot;Sure, I'm not a greedy guy&quot;<br>
he means..<br>
I ask Bilidor, &quot;hey mind if i join you?&quot;<br>
Bilidor says &quot;sure why would i care?&quot;<br>
<br>
So.. I tell Tuxtrin, &quot;Hey can I come to the raid and roll on a Toetwister if it drops?.. I have previously spoken to the only bard and he told me it would be ok if I rolled on the Toetwister and I was wondering if it would be ok with you since you are the Raid Leader?&quot;<br>
He tells me back, &quot;Sure&quot;<br>
he means...<br>
so my plan in place to get ninja...er get my new loot i ask Tuxtrin if i can join the raid.. Tuxtrin says..&quot;sure&quot;<br>
<br>
I tell Tuxtrin, &quot;Ok, omw over now, thanks&quot;<br>
<br>
All I wanted was a chance on it by rolling<br>
he means...<br>
all i needed was 1 second unattended to molest the corpse and ninja the item.<br>
<br>
So I go.. and my partner Aelbram had nothing to do since I went so he asks if he can come too for some fun. He comes as well as me to the raid and we<br>
sit there for about an hour or 2 killing stuff in the way. Well anyways I'm playing AE mana for all the casters and hasting my group and after an hour or 2 we finally pull Vay'Der. We kill him fairly easily (after Jora Malo'd<br>
him)..  .. and what do you know a Toetwister dropped!!!<br>
he means...<br>
so i know im gonna loot this thing, so i log my ebayed char on so i can play mind games and try to make it seem more peopel want me to have the loot...im leet!!<br>
Damn it is taking 2 hours to get my loot? maybe i can put autofollow on and then check back in a while when they fight my mob/shrug....ooo let me try to get some support from them ill throw in a plug for one of their great members..WOOHOOO my loot dropped im happy!!<br>
<br>
<br>
I got tells from a few people saying good luck on it as if I were going to roll on it...<br>
he means...<br>
I sent myself tells on my ebayed character so i could take a screenshot to back my claim in case a gm shows up.<br>
<br>
Well this is where our agreement goes to hell... Tuxtrin says, &quot;Gratz Bilinor on Toetwister&quot;..<br>
Then right after that I see spam saying, &quot;Gratz Bilinor&quot; in Guild Chat Bilinor bends down to loot and I tell him, &quot;Aren't we gonna roll?!?!?!?&quot;<br>
Bilinor loots and stands up sending me a tell that, &quot;Tuxtrin told me it's a<br>
guild only thing and for me to loot,&quot; and I am sitting there like WTF no rolling?...<br>
he means...<br>
well damn it the corpse is camped i cant ninja the item!!!!!!<br>
damn guild!! OMG Tuxtrin awarded it to a guildmember when i am the elite level 60 ebayed..err hard played bard! Ill tell Bilidor he should bow down to me... OMG bilidor isnt kissing my ass?? dont they know im god??<br>
<br>
And of course I then send Tuxtrin a tell asking why didn't I get to roll and he tells me it's a merit guild.. then I remind him of the agreement and he says &quot;It was a misunderstanding I didn't know you wanted to<br>
roll..&quot;. then I tell him some more saying, &quot;I know you knew that I wanted to roll beacuse you said SURE&quot;... the way he told me back sounded like it wasn't a misunderstanding at all though but that he just wanted me to be their mana bitch?!?!?...<br>
he means...<br>
OMG tuxtrin isnt kissing my ass either... they jerks want to do this as a guild and dont want me to be thier god... i dont understand it.. I need to reinflate my blowup doll to comfort me!<br>
<br>
Then Aelbram tells him about how he wasted our time and all.. And after a while Tuxtrin tells me that &quot;I'm sorry it must have just been a misunderstanding&quot;.. again.... well it's rough when it's a misunderstanding<br>
on over an hour and an 18/24 effect snare + stats sword.<br>
he means...<br>
so i send myself some mroe tells, using the blowup doll as my partner and just stew that a guild didnt give an elite bard like me this weapon... dont they know im god?<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope you find a mature way to settle this because he did not even say an apology else then, &quot;It was a misunderstanding&quot; if you even call this an<br>
apology. I have no problems with Bilinor, because he apologized to me saying that the leader told him it was guild loot only, and then he apologized for Tuxtrin... so I guess you can call that an apology for Tuxtrin?<br>

So what fat lewt are you going to give me to make up for this travesty? I was so upset that i broke my blowup doll and i chipped my tooth on that vibrating thing i was practicing on.. and tuxtrin still hasnt said he bows down in my presence!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time<br>

hurry and give me loot!!<br>

just want to let you know, that our loots are determined by officers. if tux only on, so he has full responsibility to determine the loots. <br>
basically he will ask for who need. if it an upgrade. if it so how big is the upgrade.<br>
since during the raid bili the only ody member and he isnt have epic and you and metal have epic. so the weapon wont be much help you. plus the weapon given to him would help guild become better.<br>
from his decision, i have no doubt that the weapon really for bili. gratz bili. <br>
one more thing, ody never practice ROLLING. <p><font face="Verdana,arial"><center>

I was not there but.......<br>
<br>
why would tux agree to roll? We never roll.<br>
If we dont have the forces in guild we usually just dont do a mob.<br>
A bard and a druid are not going to make the difference between doing or not doing a mob of this size.<br>
<br>
we have tons of apps and he probably thought you wanted to come raid with us as part of our app process.<br>
<br>
Anyway, sorry that you feel screwed over.<br>

<br>
Tuxtrin is the most honorable person i have ever met in this game and one of teh biggest reasons i joined Ody. Anyone who calls him anything other than a stand up guy is a liar and can suck my dorf nutz. This guild does not roll on items, if there are folks outside guild there they are given consideration but only after our own people are upgraded. Can't see an officer making a special exception for a class that we have plenty of that could use an item. If you felt you got the shaft on one of our raids there is a simple solution. Don't go to another Ody raid. You also might inquire about a new weapon at the welfare office while you are picking up some cheese to go with your whine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utuxtrin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tuxtrin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of Odysseys</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 4:32:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poor Leadership</span><hr size=1> Ok for all that doesnt know that raid was spur of the moment gank an race agianst other guilds, for a moment i felt like we were racing for lodi, I for one dont know the loot table of all these red mobs in Sol yet an i apolagize to tuvox if i gave ya the ideal of letting you roll for a item with calabir as this.<br>
<br>
I was under the gun with tells frompeople traveling to akeheva wanting to gank this mob, an just so happen tuvox sent me a tell at the most inconvient time, i was in mist of tell hell from about 15 members. When i replied to his tell i had no clue what he was talking about, only part i did understand was that he wanted to come to raid so i said "sure".  We have people that join raids all the time then disband guild. Those people that join are not there for loot or greed, they understand merit principle.<br>
<br>
Was big misunderstanding, we never let people roll on items as one-sided as this BECAUSE WE HANDLE LOOT ALL MERIT. The only thing i can say for you is if the weapon was not an upgrade for bilidor then you would have won since you were there to help. I respect the system of loot we have for guild members.<br>
<br>
For you mentioning toetwister to me in mist of 15 tells you may as well been talking greek to me because i had no clue what toetwisters was till it dropped. We only killed Vadyn like 3 times never seen this thing drop an have no history of its loot table other than spells an nice shammy 1hb. <br>
<br>
For the waisting 2hrs of your time is kinda along with the risk, the item is not common, suppose it wouldnt have dropped then you would be on your merry way trying to get a freebie from another guild on loot without earning the respect from them.<br>
<br>
You dont show up to a raid an expect to get a item that is greater than epic from rolling, 99 percent of high end guilds do loot by merit so just showing up to one raid for something will not justify rights to items such as these.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you tuvox on finding a guild that rolls for items such as these, i am sorry once again for giving you the ideal that we would roll on something like this weapon i was under tell hell an simply misunderstood the nature of you being there.<br>

Rolling on items is in very bad taste inside the guild. It's not done.. <br>
<br>
You want to roll on items, I suggest you get your own group together to go after the mob yourself. While you are at it, you might want to guarantee you are the only bard present to obtain the wanted loot. You have alot of nerve bringing this to our boards. <br>

You might as well take your ebayed toon and sell the gear and twink another one, because you have no respect from many people.  If you had any idea of what the high end game was about, you wouldn't expect to be able to roll on an item from a mob like Va'Dyn.  ROFL<br>
<br>
I remember a similar instance at lower spiders in Velks, where you wanted to loot a Black Marble for your druid friend when I was there and needed them.  It's called "Need before Greed", "NBG".  You must have sent me 20 tells, asking over and over for the Marble, then threatened me " I better not see you selling that in Gfay", why is that what you do with loot you ninja from other groups?<br>

Old Tuvoxii.  This is obviously not the Tuvoxii I remember.  I think what happened was a misunderstanding.  Tuvoxii probably asked if he could roll on loot and Tux just saw &quot;can I come help&quot; and said yes.  Tuvoxii's hopes were raised and then when loot was merited to a guild member, like all loot is, he was sad.<br>
<br>
I think to publicly flame an officer of our guild on our boards, one who has the reputation that Tuxtrin has (probably the best reputation on the whole server imo), is not an effective way to outlet your disappointment.  No one is going to believe that Tuxtrin, of all people, knowingly did you wrong.  Hell, as far as I'm concerned ZERO of my guild's members knowingly do anyone wrong, and if they do then I usually bitch them out IN TELLS, or let an officer know.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I'm sorry you didn't get to roll on Toetwister like you had thought you should have.  We have never used a rolling loot system, ever.  If you feel gypped in some way perhaps you should find a guild on the server that kills things you want to kill, or raids places you want to go.  If you were in a guild and on a raid of your own guild, these things would not happen.<br>
<br>
Also, can we please stop all the name calling, it isn't like you guys and you know it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I understand your outrage that someone would flame Tux of all people, but everyone who knows our guild knows we are fair and everyone that knows Tux knows he rocks the casbah.<br>

Tuxtrin rules and I will stand up for him anyday.  He was definately in tell hell b/c I sent him and tell and he didnt respond.  For the Toetwister thing Tux never knows what most of the mobs drops b/c I am always telling him and the guild what might be there.  <br>

This was such a quick gank that I never sent any tells in guild about anything on this guy.  Also, for the rolling issue......what the hell is that?  How do you roll and what is that all about...<br>
