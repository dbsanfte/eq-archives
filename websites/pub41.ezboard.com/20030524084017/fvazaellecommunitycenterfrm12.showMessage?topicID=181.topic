if you got in over your head with a MoB and were too far from a zone...  <br>
<br>
I died many times because when I got the place where the guard was supposed to be, there was some &quot;high level&quot; killing the guard and I was almost dead so had no chance of making it to the zone...<br>
<br>
Now, at lvl 40, I thought I would not have to deal with the problem any longer.  I guess I was wrong.  I was recently fighting near the RyGorr fort in EW and soloing cents while looking for a group...  occassionally, I would overpull or get an elite or something and I would run to the Dain outpost nearby and get them to take care of the problem for me...   was fine until some &quot;high levels&quot; decided they were gonna use this outpost for faction and killed all the Dain (not during a quest, people usually let the zone know when that is happening)...  I didn't get the names cause I died and they were gone by the time I got back to my corpse...<br>
<br>
I guess my problem is; why kill the &quot;guards&quot; that people use for protection when there are other places where you can get exp or faction?  Do you just not care about anyone else?  Are you too lazy to go find another outpost? Do you need the faction so badly and so quickly that you just have to kill &quot;all&quot; the &quot;guards&quot;? If you kill the &quot;guards,&quot; couldn't you at least kill the mobs that people bring there lookin for protection?</FONT><FORM method=post action="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm12.processVote?topicID=181.topic"><table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width="55%"><tbody><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choice" value="1"><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>I avoid guards at all cost...</FONT></td></tr><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choice" value="2"><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>I only kill em when they attack me...</FONT></td></tr><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choice" value="3"><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>I kill em, but I kill mobs for the newbs when I do...</FONT></td></tr><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choice" value="4"><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>I'm an asshole, I kill whatever I want, to hell with everyone else...</FONT></td></tr><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choice" value="5"><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>You shouldn't run to the guards, just die...</FONT></td></tr></tbody></table><P><input type=submit value="Vote"></form><a HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm12.showMessage?topicID=181.topic&pollResults=on><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Show results</FONT></A> <p><a href="http://ebonmoon.com/index2.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://ebonmoon.com/images/kel_bar.jpg" height=85 width=468 alt="Kelwin Jumala, GL - Shadows of the Ebon Moon on Vazaelle" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=birchhowlingwolf>Birch Howlingwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/4/02 2:05:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re killing guards</span><hr size=1> Your premise is wrong.<br>

Verant actually upped the mr and hps on most city guards in order to stop this practice, but you can hardly call the dains in e wastes newbie zone guards, and considering the faction choices for velious, it's part of the vision to kill them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukelwinnomad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KelwinNomad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ebonmoon.com/images/mark.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/4/02 2:12:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.ebonmoon.com/images/kd6060.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re killing guards</span><hr size=1> No, I don't think they are there for my protection; I think it is nice that they are there and that they KoS some mobs...

<br>
but there are 5 or 6 Dain outposts in EW and as I passed thru GD on my way back, there were no Dain groups there...<br>
<br>
I do not mean the poll to be for my particular situation, it was just an example, but for guard killing in general...  even something like Inn 1 in EC where there is only one guard (except when Slate wanders by)...<br>
<br>
I understand that guards are valid kill targets, but there have to be more than enough of them so that the ones that are used for &quot;protection&quot; do not need to be killed for faction or exp... <p><a href="http://ebonmoon.com/index2.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://ebonmoon.com/images/kel_bar.jpg" height=85 width=468 alt="Kelwin Jumala, GL - Shadows of the Ebon Moon on Vazaelle" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 773<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/5/02 10:40:38 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/flappy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Killing &quot;Guards&quot;...</span><hr size=1> I happen to be anti-guard-killing, but I think it'd be very hard to differentiate which spawns in Velious are quasi-newbie guards and which are &quot;just there to kill.&quot; The nature of the continent's three way war is that they're all there to kill.

<br>
In EC for example, the guard at Inn 1 is relatively close to the zone, if people knew the guard was being slain, they could easily run to the zone... at Inn 2 though, the zone is not close enough; I have seen many run to the tunnel /y all the way and sometimes they make it and most there are willing to slay the mobs, but it is still a good distance for a lvl 6 for example...<br>
<br>
Same in EW...  the Dain outpost between the pit and the bridge is prolly never gonna be trained (they won't kill the animals)...   the Dain outpost between the pit and the GD zone is more likely to be trained by an overpull of giants or orcs out of the pit or from the giant fort...<br>
<br>
The Dain outpost near the RyGorr fort is the only one within close distance of the RyGorr fort...  I know this outpost is also near a quest spawn though, but the quest stuff is not an issue here...  <br>

HA. Maybe if u were training thurg entrance, a city but in a hunting zone? Everything within the zone is targetable and killable by anyone. Just because some1 is killing something you don't appreciate doesn't make them 'assholes' and therefore your poll is biased. Personally, I never knew guards killed the orcs, and personally, now that I do, it wouldn't stop me from killing them. Those mobs aren't placed there for your benefit. They are placed there to kill or to quest with. <p>Kerai Cookies<br>

<br>
I understand the Dain are there for faction, but you do not think they were put at that precise location for a reason?  The mob pathing does not collide so they fight on thier own.  You think that VI put up a map on the wall and threw darts for mob locations?  I do not expect them to be there so &quot;save&quot; me or anyone else for that matter, but they were NOT just plunked right there without reason.<br>
<br>
If guards were not meant be for protection, then why were MR and HPs added to them?  So that you could would have a harder time killing them to get the same exp?  The Dain in EW are not meant to be there for protection as the gate guards in the cities, but their function is such none-the-less.  <br>
<br>
As I said though, this poll was not meant for my specific situation, it was only used as an example to show that it happens throughout the &quot;lifetime&quot; of a character...   It bothered me when I was 10 and it still bothers me at 40...<br>
<br>
And if you can make a comment &quot;bashing&quot; me for the poll, why is it not fair to &quot;bashed&quot; back?  There was no bashing in this thread until your post Kerai.  <br>
<br>
Yes, my original poll states that &quot;you&quot; are an asshole if you kill guards because you can or for faction or whatever...   but it is a statement, as you can see, it was selected even though it is derogetory...  I did not mean anything personally when I put it in there, but I am guessing you took it personally by your response... In my experience, when someone takes a public comment personally, it is usually because the comment has a &quot;ring&quot; of truth to it...  sorry...  ;p<br>

In Velious everything is fair game, it's the way the continent is set-up.  It's the Vision (tm).  However, in the Old World guards hp/mr wasn't put in to make them undoable as targets, but rather to make the risk vs. reward shitty so that high-levels would go elsewhere to kill stuff.<br>
<br>
Sure, when I'm a newbie it annoys me if the guards aren't there when I run to 'em, but by the early teens guards in most cases become largely irrelevent in most zones and hopefully most people are learning how better to handle themselves by then.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to kill a guard, let 'em do it I say.<br>

As you've said a dozen times, you don't want your own situation to be a judging point. But then, you shouldn't have included the anecdote, then. As for your particular situation, those weren't guards, those were an outpost. Just like the Ry'Gorr or Giant forts. They're there expressly so that people can kill them. People don't train animals or coldains to the giant fort, so why is the coldain fort any different? <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, maybe I'm just another &quot;high level&quot;, but I don't see anything wrong with killing a spawn of 4 coldains in the middle of a hunting zone. <p><center><a href="http://orderofantondwer.cjb.net" target=_new>

I used to spare the guards in WC because lowbies like to hunt there. I even used to hunt there with my twink. Then, a few days ago, Gix spawned and made a beeline for my precious level 12 bard. Being near the guards I ran to them, and stood there with a smug grin as I waited for the guards to slaughter him. He showed up, started beating and lifetapping me, and after a few moments I realized... the guards weren't helping at all. They had turned a blind eye, and were snickering as a dark elf slaughtered my half elf (which is also half human)!<br>

Needless to say I logged on my main right away and made short work of them.<br>

Funny, I'm not a roleplayer at all, but as soon as I see Freeport guards, I start saying things like &quot;You and all the Freeport Militia are corrupt, and I will not stop until every last one of you has been sent back to your maker! Tell Sir Lucan that I am coming for him!&quot;. <p><b>EQ is more interesting than real life.

In WC, I hunted the FP militia guards with my necro. Why? extremely easy xp and unlike the damn druids, they dont cast. Some necro's killed the druids, I killed the guards. The only real guards meant for guarding newbs is the ones in a newbie zone in front of a city. Anything else is fair game. <p>Kerai Cookies<br>
