<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Befb have you ever considered that your source might be a little BIASED and might tell his side to make himself look better?  <br>

If this Nag thing was such a huge deal then why hasn't the PO guildmaster posted anywhere on the board himself?<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yup, I'm the &quot;source&quot; and hell yeah, I'm a little bit biased.  Thanks for pointing that out.  <br>
<br>
For those who don't know, I'm the guild leader of the Promethian Order and I love my guild.  So I'm about as biased on this issue as say.... a member of Sacred Fires.  But actualy, there are really only 3 people that know what happened.  Carrais, Sotae, and myself.<br>
<br>
Rather than rant about it, let me just post a sequence of events.<br>
<br>
Tuesday night, we were aware that SF was killing Naggy.  I was chatting off and on with Sotae, wished them luck, wanted to know how the were doing, etc...  I'll admit it, I'm just a nOOb and dragon raids, even someone elses, excite me still (shrug).  After it was over I sent him my congrats.  He told me they were leaving to kill Vox.  I said hey... we have Vox scheduled this week.  He then told me about the emergency patch.<br>
<br>
Yes, we found out about the emergency patch from a member of SF.<br>
<br>
<br>
Great, I said, in that case we'll go kill Naggy tomorow.  Two minutes pass.  Sotae sends me another tell saying &quot;actualy, we're gonna kill him again tomorrow&quot;. <br>
<br>
Yes, they planned to kill naggy Tuesday night, go kill Vox tuseday night, and turn around and kill Nagster again on Wednesday.  And yes, for those of you that are nitpicking, I announced our intent to kill Naggy first.<br>
<br>
So anyhow, I sent him a tell back saying &quot;hey, you killed naggy tonight and are on your way to kill Vox, let us have a turn tomorrow&quot;.  No response.  So we posted the plan here on the event calendar.<br>
<br>
I think it would be fair to say that the spawn was contested all the way back on tuesday night.  The fact that we posted to the calendar first isn't all the meaningfull IMHO.    Yes, we posted first, and yes, we told them we would like to kill naggy on wednesday before they mentioned it to us but it's not a huge deal.  We want to kill naggy and vox for one reason only, epic components.  And from what I've been told, Naggy didn't drop the paladin book anyhow.<br>
<br>
Here's what bothers me.<br>
<br>
On wednesday morning Sacred Fires began gathering to kill Nagafen.  I sent Sotae a tell, asking what the heck was going on.  I sent the tell to Sotae because he's the one person in the guild I've had any real contact with lately and because he's the one I'd been chatting with the previous night.  He didn't respond.  I sent him two more tells.  Finaly Carrais sent me a tell.  In the conversation that ensued, he told me Dragons can't be scheduled.  <br>
<br>
Dragons can't be scheduled?  I refer you to the calendar on this board where SF has scheduled dragon raids.<br>
<br>
I protested.  I warned him that he was hurting relations between our guilds.  He told me that my guild had a reputation for hurting people and hoped that we would grow out of it.  Told me to cry him a river and grow up.  Told me I was an idiot for thinking dragons could be scheduled.  Told me Nagafen had been up for 8 hours already and it's first come first serve.  Told me if we didn't hurry up and move on Vox they were going to kill her too.  (our plan is still to kill Vox on friday btw).  <br>
<br>
Realizing that nothing I could say was going to change his mind I wished him luck on Nagafen and in the future and attempted to end the conversation.  Each time he persisted, saying something else mildly insulting about me or my guild.  <br>
<br>
My feeling is this.  There are some nice people in SF.  Those that treat me and my guild with courtesy and respect can continue to expect the same in return.  Those that choose discourtesy and disrespect can expect us to turn our backs and walk away.   As a whole, I've washed my hands of Sacred Fires.  Good luck to you in your future endeavors.  For any guild leaders that wish to cooperate when it comes to scheduling, feel free to seek me out, here, in game, or on our message boards.<br>

I had to go read the nameless Tavern to see wtf you all were talking about.<br>
<br>
Reid if you knew me you would know I do not hide behind names.  I have no prob saying what I think as who I am.  I think a lot of the SF members that came from the nameless can vouch for that.<br>
<br>
If I was gonna comment on SF I would have to say the Leadership sucks, and I pity the few good people that stay in that guild not knowing what a dead end there is.<br>
<br>
As to me commenting on this post... Befd looks like the fool he is.  For one, he's a third party source.  If someone in PO whined like a baby I can understand him posting here to show his support.  Instead he bitchs and complains about something that has no effect on him what so ever.  <br>
<br>
Imo the only thing that should be scheduled are planes out of respect for other guilds.  As for the rest it should be FFA and whom ever is fastest and best outfitted should have the rights to move in for the kill.<br>
<br>
I do not think it is fair to have mobs left standing when there is a means to it's death.  If you cannot organize as fast or be as efficent as another guild I feel you should take the back burner until YOU CAN.<br>
<br>
It takes 1 hr to clear FG's, 20 mins to prepare for Naggy.  There is no planning involved really.  You can explain it all when buffing up.<br>

Since the calendar isn't password protected anyone can post our raid times, and an unknown guildmember posted there without the guild knowing. Guild policy is not to reserve long-spawn mobs like dragons, gods, etc so those entries should not have been posted. Sorry =/<br>
<br>
Going to look into getting the calendar password protected and distributing the login info to guildleaders only... especially since someone posted that &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; crap today.<br>

I still think our server's guildleaders should work out a serverwide procedure for event reservations. Otherwise this is going to keep happening over and over again, and I think we should all be above that. <p><table>

<br>
Yes, a large and well-equipped guild can take down a dragon with little need to organize ahead of time.  However, Everquest isn't just played by people who are in such guilds.  Does this mean they should be excluded from killing dragons or dieties?  I don't think so.  But for groups other than the large guilds, a dragon kill does take considerable planning.  If a group of smaller guilds wanted to take out Naggy, for instance, they have to plan extensively ahead of time to muster the playerpower needed.  A lot of people may have to come on in their usual off-hours to help out their guildies and friends.  It's no small undertaking and it cannot be done on the fly as with the larger guilds.  If anything, those willing to invest such time are more entitled to a dragon kill.<br>
<br>
This issue notwithstanding, it is important imho to establish a precedent of scheduling so that groups other than the large guilds have a shot not only at the items that come from dragon/diety encounters, but also the fun of participating in one.  If dragons and dieties become a race between the large guilds other people will be denied access to something they have just as much right to, not to mention the inevitable squabbles it will create.  I've seen two guilds trying to KS Naggy from each other.  It's stupid and I don't think that's where this server should go.<br>
<br>
True. if you adhere a calendar you may not get to kill big mobs as frequently as you're capable of and occasionally boss mobs will sit unkilled for a while, but it allows everyone to have a shot at some of the more fun aspects of the game.  And remember, though for some of you dragons and dieties may be old business which was farmed on the server you came from, but for some of us it's still special.  I killed Naggy for the first time last Friday and I've been playing since release.  If Naggy is allowed to live for a few hours or days so that someone else can have that experience, how could I deny them that?  To me, at least, that's what a calendar is about. <p><p><center><img src="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/slansig2.jpg"><br><i>Sslanis Soulforge<br>Just Another Dead Lizard</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utropicsdelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TropicsDelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/01 2:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't usually rant but...</span><hr size=1> This is MY opinion and has no bearing on my guild!<br>
<br>
Personally I think saying you are gonna take the Tuesday AND Wednesday dragon is a little bunk. I mean lets face it that is like us saying we are gonna take the next 4 naggy spawns now. I figure if ya choose a day to do a dragon then let another guild have a go at the next dragon, it only seems fair.<br>
<br>
Saying a dragon in FFA is also bunk. If you want to make it like that then don't wait long and you will see guilds camped in the hallway to naggy and in the king room 5 hours before the dragons pop just so they can take it. I don't think anyone wants that. I have played this game since release and have to say that once dragons became available to kill for multiple guilds they became scheduled mobs. This is true on EVERY multi guild dragon capable server. If you thought Vaz would be different then you might as well explain why cause there is no precedent set for us to see that coming.<br>

You'll have to forgive me for being blunt with you wednesday, but as I told befb, I was trying to lead a raid at the time. What I was told was 'PO scheduled nag on the board after we told them we were doing him'.<br>
<br>
I sent you a tell in the middle of the raid, with the intention of clearing up the problem with you.<br>
<br>
I do understand why you were upset, but your attitude upset me also, and I was already stressed out. When the first thing I hear is 'if you continue you will destroy you guilds relation with PO' when all I've heard is how you tried to 'schedule' him *after* we told you we were doing him, I think you can understand why I was a bit mad.<br>
<br>
As far as scheduling mobs, its been said none of our officers have posted our intent to kill one at any specific time, which is true. We have addressed our members about it and that is cleared up. My apologies.<br>
<br>
I believe that if you want to kill something bad enough, you will make the effort to plan ahead and take him on. Had you been there before us wednesday, then we would have left it to you. We do respect other guilds, as a lot of us have friends in many guilds.<br>
<br>
If you have the power to take down a mob, then get to it and cheer yourselves on to victory. Just don't expect that mob to be up when you're good and ready, cause someone more prepared will likely beat you to it. Its about early birds and wurms. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I was straightforward in my post above.  Yes, we scheduled Naggy on the calendar after Sotae told me you were planning to do him.  I told Sotae we were planning to do him before he told me you were.  If you want to be technical, the time line was:<br>
<br>
PO tells SF: We're doing Naggy tommorrow.<br>
SF tells PO: No, we are.<br>
PO Schedules Naggy on the calendar.<br>
SF claims dragons can't be scheduled.<br>
<br>
I hate flame wars.  Who claimed Naggy first doesn't much matter to me.  I was a lot more ticked off about the things you said to me about me and my guild.  So let's put those aside for the moment.<br>
<br>
I have a few questions for you.<br>
<br>
1. Are Nagafen and Vox reservable mobs?<br>
2. Will you respect other guilds/groups plans if they post their schedule to this or a different calendar in advance?<br>
3. Is memblurring a mob at a gm event to ensure your group gets the kill acceptable?<br>

I could post that tomorrow IV or PO is going to do gimpmob00 in uberzone07.  Dont even have to be a member of those guilds.  <br>
<br>
The calender will mean nothing unless a precident can be set.  Each of us are going on old rules for old servers, those in no way match how another server worked.  Our guilds policy is to only schedule planes, everything else being first come, first serve.  A similar thing happened on Nameless shortly after it came up Q4 99, Q1 00.  The leaders of the guilds that were doing the conflicted zones/mobs decided on a loose system.  The system was simple and made sense.  Only planes can be reserved, others are only intentions and are not to be considered reservations.  It remains to this day.  <br>
<br>
This isnt just about 2 dragons, its about any mob/zone.  I believe it certainly should be discussed among the conflicting guilds guildleaders to prevent any future conflict, but its their iniative to take.  If they decide that they will respect the others schedules of anything from a plane camp to a mob like frog king/tirenna then so be it.<br>
<br>
If those guilds want to be at each others throats for the next year or two, so be it, but I doubt any of them want that.<br>
<br>
Whatever they do, the ability of anyone to make a reservation for anyone, needs to be addressed.  Wether it is controlled to registered guild leaders, or what, something needs to be done.<br>

Sacred Fires opninion on what is reservable and what is not is not the only opinion. Some servers have decided that old world dragons are FFA while others schedule them. Rather than a single guild deciding on server policy for these dragons, perhaps they should come to some sort of agreement with the other guild. Many of us come from servers where dragons are not FFA so to assume that Sacred Fires dictates server policy because thats what most members are use to and they think scheduling dragons are &quot;Stupid&quot; is a bit presumtious. Sacred Fires does not have the kind of force needed to dictate their will on the rest of the server.<br>
<br>
Before this incident no where has Sacred Fires officially declared dragons FFA. Sacred Fires have had dragons slotted on the schedule for over a week. Now perhpaps some anonymous SF person put them up but considering the fact that both Sotae and Narya are moderators of the forum, it would have been trivial for them to remove it and claim that dragons are FFA. The first time the FFA statement came out was after this whole incident blew up.<br>

Let me preface my discussion by quickly reasserting a familiar theme of my previous posts: No matter how bad you think Lord Nagafen's recommendations are, I assure you that they are far, far worse than you think. If the mass guild members were actually in the business of covering news rather than molding public attitudes to initiate a reign of salacious terror, they would unmistakably report that if the human race is to survive on this planet, we will have to reinforce notions of positive self esteem. Nagafen claims that his holier-than-thou attitudes are not worth getting outraged about. Sound suspicious? Brain-damaged is a better word. Do you really think that &quot;the norm&quot; shouldn't have to worry about how the exceptions feel, as Nagafen claims? Wake up! Even without making an ethical argument against denominationalism, I can show that an axiom among Nagafen's drones is that Nagafen is beyond reproach. I know you're wondering why I just wrote that. I'll explain shortly, but first, I should state that I'll tell you what we need to do about all the craziness Nagafen is mongering. We need to hinder the power of mudslinging tyrants like Nagafen. <br>
<br>
His methods are much subtler now than ever before. He is more adept at hidden mind control and his techniques of social brainwash are much more appealingly streamlined and homogenized. Is it not positively the distinguishing feature of Nagafen's comments to mock, ridicule, deprecate, and rebuke people for their religious beliefs? Nagafen's pleas are geared toward the continuation of social stratification under the rubric of &quot;tradition.&quot; Funny, that was the same term that his trucklers once used to toy with our opinions. <br>
<br>
We will have to become much more vigilant to ensure that Nagafen doesn't pull the levers of narcissism and oil the gears of exclusionism. You'd think I'd be pretty well inured by now to the lunacies of his demands, but I have to say that he says that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority -- or even a plurality. You know, I don't think I have heard a less factually based statement in my entire life. <br>
<br>
You know what I mean? There can be no doubt that Nagafen's values are not witty satire, as he would have you believe. They're simply the unrestrained ramblings of someone who has no idea or appreciation of what he's mocking. By now, we are all more than familiar with Nagafen's tactless tracts. Now take that to the next level: Nagafen and his slaves are grumpy, jaded doofuses. This is not set down in complaint against them, but merely as analysis. <br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but don't you think that his subliminal psywar campaigns run contrary to even the most cursory observation of the real world? It would be nice to say that effete irrationalism doesn't exist anymore, but we all know that it does. In effect, Nagafen claims that mediocrity and normalcy are ideal virtues. That claim illustrates a serious reasoning fallacy, one that is pandemic in his litanies. Then again, the main dissensus between me and Nagafen is that I think that Nagafen's purpose is not to enlighten, but to deceive. He, on the other hand, contends that he could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else. I will not quibble with him as to whether or not it looks like letting petulant poltroons engage in or goad others into engaging in illegal acts is unthinkable. Instead, I'll simply state that I oppose, deplore, and disavow discrimination, extremism, and hatred of every kind and leave it at that. Why does negativism exist? What causes it? And is Nagafen just trying to glorify the things that everyone else execrates? To understand the answers to those questions, you first have to realize that he decries or dismisses capitalism, technology, industrialization, and systems of government borne of Enlightenment ideas about the dignity and freedom of human beings. These are the things that Nagafen fears, because they are wedded to individual initiative and responsibility. <br>
<br>
An inner voice tells me that he contends that he is a martyr for freedom and a victim of Marxism. Excuse me, but where exactly did this little factoid come from? If the people generally are relying on false information sown by delusional televangelists, then correcting that situation becomes a priority for the defense of our nation. In keeping with all of their inner sick brutality, Nagafen's grunts help contemptuous peddlers of snake-oil remedies back up their prejudices with &quot;scientific&quot; proof. I insist it's important to continue discussing this even after I've made my point, because everything I've said so far is by way of introduction to the key point I want to make in this letter. My key point is that Nagafen keeps saying that the best way to reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one's psyche is to retain an institution which, twist and turn as you like, is and remains a disgrace to humanity. Isn't that claim getting a little shopworn? I mean, he would have us believe that the only way to expand one's mind is with drugs -- or maybe even chocolate. That, of course, is nonsense, total nonsense. But Nagafen is surrounded by fatuitous, sniffish scalawags who parrot the same nonsense, which is why he doesn't shower often enough, and everyone with half a brain understands that. <br>
<br>
My mother always told me, &quot;If you don't have something intelligent to say, just keep quiet.&quot; Apparently, Nagafen's mother never told him that. If someone were to blend together cannibalism and solipsism in a train wreck of monumental proportions, I'd rather it be an army of ungrateful, detestable crackpots than Nagafen, because the latter is militant, while the former are only hidebound. <br>
<br>
Again, he argues that I am brainless for wanting to punish him for his nasty jeremiads. I should point out that this is almost the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago. I'm inclined to think that what I just wrote is not based on merely a single experience or anecdote. Rather, it is based upon the wisdom of accumulated years, spanning two continents, and proven by the fact that a person who wants to get ahead should try to understand the long-range consequences of his/her campaigns. Nagafen has never had that faculty. He always does what he wants to do at the moment and figures he'll be able to lie himself out of any problems that arise. His hangers-on believe that &quot;black is white and night is day.&quot; First off, that's a lousy sentence. If they had written that Nagafen has no ground and no right to sow the seeds of discord, then that quote would have had more validity. As it stands, the same pattern of guilt-by-association practiced by his confreres can be found in his ultimata. (Actually, he has always promoted the trendiest causes, the causes that all of the important people promote, but that's not important now.) This may be a foregone conclusion, but he needs to stop living in denial. He needs to wake up and realize that I have a New Year's resolution for him: He should pick up a book before he jumps to the uppity conclusion that my bitterness at him is merely the latent projection of libidinal energy stemming from self-induced anguish. <br>
<br>
All of these things are related: antagonism, Nagafen's quips, and the general breakdown of our society. I'll tell you how they're related. It's really very simple. In essence, the world would be better off if Nagafen had never been born. That's clear. But everybody is probably familiar with the cliche that I have noticed of late a strong undercurrent of deceitful sectarianism among hostile patronizing-types. Well, there's a lot of truth in that cliche. <br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it true that his macabre propositions are a shout to the world that, in a lustrum or two, he will create widespread psychological suffering? Nagafen likes to cite poll results that &quot;prove&quot; that the ideas of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;corporatism&quot; are Siamese twins. Really? Have you ever been contacted by one of his pollsters? Chances are good that you have never been contacted and never will be. Otherwise, the polls would show that I suppose it's predictable, though terribly sad, that silly ne'er-do-wells with stronger voices than minds would revert to refractory behavior. But if we are to acknowledge that there is an implicit assumption here that an unholy alliance of intellectually stultified flimflammers and untrustworthy evil-doers has been instrumental in devising increasingly pestiferous ways to perpetuate the nonsense known technically as the analytic/synthetic dichotomy, then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology, not by the ornery and self-satisfied ideologies that Nagafen promotes. I have now said everything there is to say. So, to summarize it all, I draw strength and courage from knowing that most people comprehend the crusade to stop Lord Nagafen and are supportive of my role in it.<br>

<br>
Thats why Lord Nagafen was killed.  Thanks for reading and understanding why this menace must end!<br>
