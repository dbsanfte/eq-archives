function of Everquest.<br>
<br>
But today, in a friendly guild race to Saryrn (which is the most exciting thing to happen on a Saryrn raid since Heallun chain rezzed Cewjo into AE Rampage), some fucking loser decided to /petition &lt;Promethian Order&gt; for ..... racing to a spawn.  That's right, they petitioned us for wanting the same content as them.  Okies, whatever.<br>
<br>
First named of Saryrn's tower was pulled by ... omfg... Akethadar, that sexy monk in the pink dress with the staff of glowing yellow runes.  And aforementioned named mob was then ganked by someone in what we will call, for the protection of the innocent, the &quot;Other guild.&quot;  No problem, whatever, we keep plowing up.<br>
<br>
Time for Mareeq the Prophet.  And who should tap my monkey shoulder but GM Sentana (Who, while trying to be understanding in this situation still lacks every possible knowledge of endgame everquest) and tells me that we have been petitioned for ... (pay close attention again) Competing with Eternal Adv...errr the &quot;Other Guild&quot; for a spawn.  Ok... so to whoever logged that fucking petition, you're a loser. <br>
<br>
But it gets better.<br>
<br>
So Sentana tells me to talk to Sithka and determine how we were going to handle it.  Now, after all the rants on here about how EA beat AD to mobs only to have AD petition them.... I am fully expecting Sithka to want to finish the race, you know... like we do on Vazaelle.<br>
<br>
Nope<br>
<br>
Sithka wants to random for Saryrn.  Yes, that's right.  After all the bitching and whining that EA has done over and over about randoming for mobs and GM interference, Sithka decides he wants to random for the fucking spawn.<br>
<br>
Well my 495 on a random 500 quickly put that entire thing to rest.  But seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you guys.  You piss and moan about being petitioned to high hell for normal competition, then you cant handle the fucking heat when you're about to be sucking some other guild's exhaust fumes in a gankfest.<br>
<br>
Lamest moment for me in Everquest (well, except for that other one...).<br>

Personally, after seeing how far PO fell behind CC when you were dead set on cockblocking us in VT, I would have though you would have learned your lesson.  Which makes more sence, cockblocking to a zone will very little PoP progression content(at least until RZ is dead), or having your guild do something that would actually allow progression towards the elementals?<br>

Saryrn been up for days man, dont come here crying cockblock.  She hasnt been touched since patch till today, when there was nothing else up.<br>

(Yesterday, you raided the Rallos Zek bane guy in Tactics instead of going and doing Saryrn, in case you forgot.  We were in Sol Ro all day.  If we cared to cockblock you from the zone, she'd be dead everytime she spawned as she spawned.  Oh.. and we cockblocked you in VT?  rofl.  I dont think you know what cockblockage is in VT, if we had even cared to try, you'd never have seen a mob other than trash and Thall Va Xakra.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ralandar>Ralandar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/4/03 1:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2049.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gheyness</span><hr size=1> We didnt have the people for Saryn yestday sir, to many slackers watching Xmen 2 or some shit.

<br>
Since when did 2 guilds being in the same zone = a cockblock?  Have you ever logged in to everquest?<br>
<br>
Here let me spell it out for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) We have spawned Rallos Zek, so yeah.. we have that part figured out<br>
<br>
2) You're either an idiot or a liar to say that a guild should have gone and messed around with Rallos Zek with 3 clerics.  Your guild wouldnt have, we wouldnt either.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
3)  You didnt have the folks on for Saryrn yesterday, we did.   This is the point that you are missing.  We exhausted every possible resource that was killable with the force that we had online except for Saryrn, and so we moved there.  A cockblock is when a guild kills a mob before another guild has the opportunity for the purpose of keeping them out of a zone, or from progression.  If you want to kill Saryrn, then when we are doing other stuff, you should kill her, cuz guess what Tonto?  When other stuff is dead, we're headed to torment for another god awful plow the mistress of pain.<br>
<br>
Maybe this will make it easier for you.<br>
<br>
EA had approximately the same force online today that PO had online.  You were in Torment, instead of working on Rallos Script (which is what you alledge we should have been doing.  laf).  When you xloced out after the roll (that was decided upon by your own guildleader, and not by me), did you go then work on the Rallos script?  <br>
<br>
I seriously think the completely bafflement of having plowed to a mob that wasnt even up today had you guys twisted every which way from Sunday before our guilds ever met.  However, your VT stuff is way off bucko.  Ask Furion, your pretty little high-elf-cleric about VT, if i remember right, he was one of the ones that wanted to keep VT down everytime it spawned until we were done farming it.   I refused to do that.  I also refused to kill keymobs for the sake of not letting you have keys, and left VT up for days at a time sometimes so you could work your way ahead in the zone at your pace.<br>
<br>
Cockblockage?  Go cry on someone else's shoulder, you lost the game today and you guys even got to pick the rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ralandar>Ralandar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/4/03 2:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2049.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gheyness</span><hr size=1> Yes, we did go work on RZ script.

<br>
It makes no sense to go plow Sol Ro for a single mini when there are flag mobs still up that people still need <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>for</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Sol Ro AND that are killable by the forces online.  Not even sure it was popped when we went to Torment for that matter.<br>
<br>
And frankly, I have to say that anyone who goes to VT for any reason except loot has to be insane.  I think it was Ghol who told me once that he felt VI made that zone to test what lengths people were willing to go through to get incredible loot, and I'd have to agree.  I still see 4-arms in my nightmares!  Why on earth you'd think anyone was there to cockblock you is beyond me.  We weren't exactly the ones sitting on the Emp spawn from 3 est on during patch days, after all.  ;p<br>
<br>
(Not saying you were cockblocking Emp loot or anything, just saying: sheesh, can't PO also make a time investment in zones in order to get loot/flags/whatever without the &quot;cockblock&quot; term being tossed around?)<br>

hmm, yes. I do believe I remember this. We wiped because EA had no fucking clue what they were doing in VT and fucked up the spawns so we COULDNT even get to AHR. Dont recall you doing shit in VT that night either.<br>
<br>
As to raiding with AD, we havent killed anything FOR them. We dont as a rule flag guilds when they havent killed something themselves, but as some guilds are inclined to do in EQ, we help them when they need 2 or 3 ppl flagged for something we might be doing and they return the favor. Maybe if your guild wasnt primarily made up of assholes and whining crybaby pussies, you would understand the concept of mutual aid and some respect.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228596" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.msu.edu/user/cooking3/yd/ss/kayshasig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbanderas>Mr Banderas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 318<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/4/03 10:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2049.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gheyness</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We dont as a rule flag guilds when they havent killed something themselves, but as some guilds are inclined to do in EQ, we help them when they need 2 or 3 ppl flagged for something we might be doing and they return the favor.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

&lt;cough&gt; bullshit &lt;cough&gt;<br>
<br>
Maybe you weren't on, or weren't guilded, or I don't know what the fuck you were doing but PO was bringing AD along to do Behemoth when AD hadn't killed it themselves yet.  That's a fact.  Just because you weren't there doesn't mean it didn't happen, though.  One time that you were doing it you even whined and sent tells to random EA members telling them grats on blowing the spawn because your sorry asses were so shitty at racing that you were still sitting in Tranquil when EA ported over from Ssra and zoned in and was within the factory already before you even got into the zone with more than 1 group of AD folks.<br>

not that its any of your fucking business, the guild took a poll on whether or not to:<br>
Stay and farm/focus on VT<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Focus on moving ahead in PoP, and just do VT on days nothing else worth it in PoP was up.<br>
<br>
The majority of the guild was all for moving ahead in PoP... <br>
So even if we had 60 members on each night back then, we still would have left VT alone. so shut your dick-trap about shit you dunno about.<br>
<br>
Now, im not sure how long you've been around on vazaelle... or kept up with the happenings of the uber guilds on vazaelle... but PO losing alot of members everynow and then, is no new thing.<br>

As for VT, no.  By the time EA was in VT, we had the force to kill AHR on every night.  I chose not to hit it everytime it spawned, as i stated before, ask your very own Furion what my stances were on VT.

The point is, you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>DIDN'T</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have 60 members on back then.  You were losing members.  Even Quarken took a temporary leave.  You could barely get 25-30 people on each night and you were using AD to bolster your numbers.<br>

I don't even think you were in the guild yet with that rogue, fucktard.<br>

I was on Vaz when Kead first took over as GM, I was on Vaz when PO was first doing NToV, and I'm on Vaz now.  I took a break inbetween.  So yes I'm well aware of your guild.  <br>
<br>
The fact remains that when EA began doing VT, you couldn't have tried to race for it even if you tried to.  You don't race people with 25 people, with 18 of them being rogues.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbanderas>Mr Banderas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 320<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/4/03 10:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2049.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gheyness</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dont blow smoke out your ass Banderas, we've cleared Vex Thal with 31 people, we didnt need more people online to cockblock your sorry asses out of there. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Kind of like when you did HP with around that many and failed 3 or 4 times in a row.  We were thinking of going over and taking it but a few folks felt some huge pity for you and we decided to just move onto another target that night.  Eventually you killed him, though.<br>

We have raced in VT.  You obviously have a fuzzy memory.  But allow me to help you out.  When EA first started doing VT, we killed AHR (that's right, we killed AHR AFTER EA was in VT), what that means is that you got into VT after we had an influx, not an outflux of motivation.  We were on the upswing, and had 40-50 on every raidnight.<br>
<br>
AD was never used to bolster our numbers because we were incapable of hitting targets.  AD raided with us on days when they had low numbers and so did we (usually friday nights) to hit shit that both our guilds still needed and could be taken care of all at once.  In case you werent aware (and you can ask Nisk if you'd like), we invited EA to come along on that Behemoth raid too just to see if we could get some people into Tactics so we could xp elsewhere than Plane of Valor.<br>
