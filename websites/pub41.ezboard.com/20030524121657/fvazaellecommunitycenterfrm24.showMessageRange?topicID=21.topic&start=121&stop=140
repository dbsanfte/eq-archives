<br>
Well, guess what, I have nothing against your lifestyle, i was raised to 'live and let live.'<br>
<br>
However, most same sex couples I have seen in action, made me, you could say, uncomfortable and sometimes even disgusted. Is it my fault I have this deep seated thing in my psyche that says 'NO'? <br>
<br>
If I was able to change my sexual preference, I would certainly become equally attracted to both sexes, then I would not get grossed out seeing homosexual couples do things, I would have the opportunity to have more fun. But I do not seem able to do so.<br>
<br>
So the more homosexuals decide to make out in the park I go to, or post about their awesome lifes, the more I get this queasy feeling in my belly.<br>
<br>
Why can you homosexuals just not enjoy your lifestyle and keep it private, like most of the heterosexual population does?<br>
<br>
This thread gave me the overall impression that I should be in awe of and basically worship homosexuals, but being heterosexual is just as right, and neither heterosexuals nor homosexuals should force their bullshit onto others.<br>
<br>
But I get it, in the end I should probably believe that you being a homosexual gives you hardship, and health problems, and difficulty finding a job, and you have been opressed ever since beginning of time. Therefore I should call my representatives and ask for homosexuals to be given special rights?<br>
<br>
Wtf is this shit? Why do not we all keep our sexual preference at home, and play the game instead?<br>
<br>
Faggot: bundle of twigs, only hitting the threasurus brings up homosexual, fag, invert, queer.<br>
<br>
Gay: merry, bright and lovely, homosexual.<br>
<br>
But yeah, the world revolves around you the homosexual, so never mind that those words have other meanings first, and now that you made your point, please feel free to tell me in game that you are a homosexual if you want the mobs I might be camping, that you wish to take over. I can see that you all are sad individuals brooding about your hard life made hard by your sexual preference. I will be more than happy to let you have any camp you desire. Anything to make your horrible life sweeter, after all Eq is just a game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Also, never said I made out in parks, or that it's appropriate.<br>
<br>
As far as keeping it private, one's marital status is rarely kept private in modern society.  Whether you're a top, bottom, a missionary position only heterosexual is generally kept private - also perfectly appropriate.<br>
<br>
I certainly need no rights from you or anyone on these boards - I have them thanks.  Only thing I ever said, was that if you stop and think about it, calling people faggots, may hurt some people, should you choose to care.<br>
<br>
Nice to know you don't - I think that says more about you than it does about the poor faggots, who once again, requires nothing from you.<br>

Promise.<br>
<br>
Thought about it - being the token VCC fag, translating potentially into the Vazaelle fag isn't doing me any good.<br>
<br>
After 30 years of hard work, I've become a person i'm happy with and thru conscious decisions created a life where homophobia has no impact on my life.  I was recently involved in consultations with the government in my province, who are in the process of introducing changes for division of property on relationship breakdown and support - I have full equality in every sense of the law, other than the ability to marry (not a burning issue for a doctor/lawyer couple who can afford all the rights we want).  What is it that made me decide that I would throw myself in front of the wolves again and into a world that just doesn't exist in my day to day life?<br>
<br>
Not because I'm oppressed - I'm extremely priviledged - instead, it's because some people aren't that well adjusted or happy and some of those people happen to be gay and I do care about the damage the world inflicts on them.  Sorry for caring - but it's really naive of me to think that anything I would say here, would make even one person stop and think.<br>
<br>
Hell, I've certainly never seen it happen on this board on any other topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aarcanus>Aarcanus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/5/02 12:05:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Musings of an idiot.</span><hr size=1> Just a quick response to Aurianne.  I think you either misread or misunderstood my post, as I never stated anywhere that I believed people had a choice as to who they are attracted to.  In fact, I tried to make it very clear that I believe the opposite.  People have no control over who they are attracted to.  However, people do generally have control over who they have sex with.  Please re-read my example about the person that is sexually attracted to children to clarify my view on this subject.<br>
<br>
Also, using analogies from the animal kingdom to show how &quot;natural&quot; homosexuality is has several flaws.  First of all, when a male dog, ape, etc, mounts another male of their species in the animal kingdom, it is to show their dominance.  It has nothing to do with any emotional desire on the part of the animal to have sex with another male.  Fido does not see Spike walking down the street and think, &quot;Damn, Spike's ass looks Fabulous!  I wonder if he'd like to be my life partner?  He and I can go shopping together everyday!&quot;  In fact, this brings me to the second flaw when trying to compare animals with people.  Animals do not have sex for pleasure like people do.  It is not an emotional experience for them.  That is why the penis of every other mammal on the planet has a bone inside of it.  No mammal other than humans can sustain an erection just by being &quot;turned on&quot;.  This leads to yet another flaw.  When a male dog mounts another male dog, he does indeed grab onto the hind quarters of the dog he is trying to dominate and begin to &quot;hump&quot; or simulate sex.  However, the dominant dog does not actually insert his penis into the other dog nor does he ejaculate.  This idea, commonly spread by the gay community, that homosexuality occurs in nature is a cleverly crafted lie.  In order for a dog to ejaculate, he first has to encounter a bitch in heat.  The oder that she gives off will cause his bone to extend.  After a couple strokes, you know the rest....and afterwards, she doesn't bug him about why he never calls her.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as I sit here writing about dogs fucking, it suddenly occurs to me that this is a REALLY gay thread!

I have noticed this new trend of spelling the colloquial term &quot;ghey&quot; to differentiate it from a homophobic slur.  While I still take offense to a very small degree, I am aware that at least the effort is being made to recognize that we exist and may be offended.<br>

To that ridiculous assertion that &quot;homosexuality = having sex with someone of the same gender&quot;...so if I am celibate I stop being gay?  What drivel...as Backster said, very, very little gay sex involves anal sex (ugh, it makes me just as queasy as it probably does you).  I will not deny it, if I were ever given a choice in my sexual orientation, I would choose to be straight in a flash, simply because everything would be so much easier.  Could you as a straight male decide that from now on you would get a hard-on whenever a really cute guy walked past?  What makes you think a gay male can just &quot;choose&quot; to be straight?  Where is this choice you refer to?  Yes I can choose not to partake in gay sex (if it is indeed the ACT of gay sex that is &quot;wrong&quot;) but I am nonetheless gay.  If God thought being homosexual was wrong, then he wouldn't have made me this way...or else he had me pegged for hellfire from the moment he created me.  The God I believe in loves us unconditionally...if he chooses to send me back again until I &quot;get it right&quot;, so be it.<br>
<br>
I think the gist of this thread was not to say &quot;You may not use this term, it is offensive&quot;, but rather to point it out to the silent majority who are using it without thinking about the pain it causes, people who may actually give a damn that they are unwittingly causing someone pain.  If you are the kind of person who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but yourself then you are not the audience this thread was meant to reach.<br>

But get a clue, maybe others do not want you as their representative? Has this concept entered your little world?<br>
I personally believe you are just saying that you are speaking for others because by doing so you distance yourself from the situation in this thread, and it makes it easier for you to not get angry. <br>
<br>
But whatever, I think this whole rant is lame, because most people in game do not use the words fag and gay to indicate homosexuality.   <br>
Instead, I imagine homosexualism is often disgusting to many heterosexuals in society, and just making a blind guess, there is probably more heterosexuals than homosexuals out there? <br>
<br>
Therefore, when certain people get disgusted with some situation in game, they use the words that describe homosexualism, because they know that this is a common word that is likely to communicate their dissapointment, dismay or disgust. Again, this is because large portion of society does find homosexualism disgusting, and it is not their fault, they were born that way, or whatever latest theory on sexual orientation is.<br>
<br>
You can sue people for using those words in your presence, you can avoid them, you can find them and murder them, or you can let it slide. I am sure homosexuals explored all those options at one time or another.<br>
<br>
However, the bottom line is, if you were smart and educated, you would know that nothing you do will change the masses in this aspect, only thing you can do is screw up your own life by doing something stupid about it.<br>
<br>
I do not want to know if you are a homosexual. I do not care. I am sure some people I talk to in this game are homosexual, and that is fine. What is not fine, is when one of them tells me about it, and my first mental response is 'eww.'<br>
I simply cannot understand why I need to know that you are homosexual. Does it make you feel better to put gross images in my mind by declaring that? There is more to life than your sexual orientation, and neither the game nor the world should revolve around your homosexuality. The words fag and gay have become negative terms in this and many games, but they are not aimed at your sexual preference, how hard is that to understand? They have new meanings now, and even before those words had even different meanings. Hell, I meet people who use the word 'gay' to describe happy people, or good people. Granted, they are usually older people, or people from different nationalities, but it happens.<br>
<br>
I am not arguing here if being homosexual is good or bad. I am indifferent. What I am arguing is that whenever people type 'so and so is gay', they usually mean the person upset them, and are not referring to that person's sexual orientation. If you have accepted your sexuality, those words would not bother you.<br>
<br>
Why do you not just start petitioning all people in game who use the word 'gay or 'fag', then sooner or later people will find things to petition you for, and viola, you will be banned, and you will post this homophobic bullshit of yours someplace else, hopefully.<br>
<br>
Of course, that is just me, I live in a world where this board is dedicated to in game issues, and since there is no sex in game, there should be no homosexuals vs heterosexuals issues in the game, therefore they should not exist here.<br>
<br>
But what can I expect from the poor mistreated homosexuals?  I suppose posts like the one that started this thread is what opressed groups use to try and raise sympathy for their cause? Are you askign that whole heterosexual population jumps at your every whim? I mean, it is not liek you have no legs and are in a wheelchair, and need a special device on the public bus, in order to use it? or do you?<br>
<br>
I have not even seen a thread on here posted that said 'faggots suck' or somethign similar, but hey, you had to post one that attacks people of the other sexual orientation?<br>
<br>
Why do you not just raise support, then ask verant to make a 'homosexual only' server, since clearly you cannot handle normal servers, and there is no chance thousands of 15 year olds will become aware that the term 'fag' and 'ghey' offends your holiness and makes it hard for you to sleep at night.<br>

But really any posting on this subject is just pissing in the wind. Still, I feel the need to take a side and simply speak my piece.<br>
<br>
I have used the words &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;ghey&quot; in the game and with players in real life. But the first time I did so around non-players I became acutely aware of how it sounded and how ridiculous any protestations about it not being about homosexuals would sound to someone not familiar with EQ. <br>
<br>
So while the words still come out on occasion and on accident, I am making a conscious effort to not use them. Regardless of intent, the words are slurs, they do hurt people, and are not worthy of my speaking them. <p>Prybutok Agonista<br>

To call someone a retard or some derivation from that as an insult implies that it is bad to be retarded.  People who are retarded cannot help it...they are born that way.  Therefore, it is insensitive and close-minded of you to use the word 'retarded' in a derogatory way.  You are only fueling the fires of ignorance, etc.  After all, retarded people get made fun of plenty without you using language which helps to disparage that group of people.  Language does affect people's perceptions, after all.<br>
