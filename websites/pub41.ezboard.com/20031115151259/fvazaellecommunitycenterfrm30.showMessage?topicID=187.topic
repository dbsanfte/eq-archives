<br>
Forget the silly premise that marriage is a tool of the capitalists.  Instead, what about the valid statistics, that 50% of all new marriages end in divorce, and only 38% of couples describe themselves as &quot;happily married.&quot;<br>
<br>
Forget the utilitarian and economic advantages to marriage.  We all know they exist.  I'm talking happiness here.  When marriage becomes a duty, a commitment, a chore, and something you have to &quot;work at&quot; rather than experience, what's the point of maintaining it?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The connection between sex and love, she argues, doesn't last as long as the need for each. And we probably shouldn't invest so much of our own happiness in the idea that someone else can help us sustain it—or spend so much time trying to make unhappy relationships &quot;work.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> In marriage libido fades, and desire becomes duty.  But isn't desire the engine that makes us happy?  Isn't happiness the pursuit, and occassional acquisition, what that which we desire?  <br>
<br>
And if marriage is the black hole of happiness, what is the solution?  Fewer marriages?  Marriages that are easier to end?  Marriages that aren't designed to last a lifetime, and that actually require a renewal of vows and commitments every few years, and allow either party to &quot;opt out&quot; when they choose?  Or is that just a different kind of divorce?  <br>
<br>
And if marriage is such an unhappy state, then is divorce really a bad thing?  Should divorce be viewed as a transition, rather than an ending?  Should we remove the social stigma attached to divorce and regard it as just one of the possible outcomes of marriage, just 'one of those things.'<br>
<br>
Or are we just shallow and immature to believe that one should be happy in one's marriage?  Is unhappiness too superficial a reason to end a marriage?<br>
<br>

<br>
marriage is about love, if you believe in greed, you CANNOT believe in love, it would only be a fiary tale for you.<br>
<br>
i wonder what the statistics are worldwide for marriage? you know outside of our plastic coated sugar box we call the USA? We are so geared towards appearance its no wonder that once we get to know someone under all that appearance we find that we hate the person.<br>
monotony, daily routines, boring...whatever.<br>
Maybe its just easier to believe if we moved from partner to partner we can hide who we really are. Keep up that &quot;image&quot;.<br>
Speaking as a person thats lived an incredible bachelor's life i can say, yeah the sex was intresting, conquering the unknown so to speak. But.. the really fantastic 8 tme a night carnival rides were only with the women i really loved (well um and trio's).<br>
<br>
Maybe its just that folks don't understand what &quot; do you take this person to be your wife/husband for better or for worse&quot; means. Maybe they really didn't undertsand what love really is about. i could see someone whose instinct is greed not understanding what love is about at all.<br>
<br>

I think people expect too much from marriage. Like it's going to be this big long happily ever after story all the time. Love needs to be fed, keep doing the little sweet things you did when you were dating. You should always pursue your partner like you could lose them tomorrow, keep up that chase. Just because you're married dosen't mean that should stop. When you take your partner for granted is when you loose and when they start to loose interest. Marriage is work, but unlike the ugly conotation of that word (work), it is enjoyable. Working on things...like communication, understanding, patience, forgivness, love making, thankfulness, adventure, and on and on. It is hard work sometimes but sooooo worth it. Marriage is not and end, but the beginning of you making your way through life with another by your side..together. You should be grateful you have found a person who loves you and who you love back. I know it is cheesey but that's the simple way I see it. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:small;">The human formerly known as Graphyte the DE Dread Lord of Pactum</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=handaarcheetorf>HandaarCheetorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.trialityguild.com/tb/images/tbav/26.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/8/03 9:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> marriage</span><hr size=1> I think most people settle for whatever they can get.

I want to live on my own, I could live with my parents but i choose not to. I need to a job so I can live on my own. I want a good education so I can get a good job. I need to go to college for a good education. I would want a love in my life, but I don't need it (god bless hot chicks thread in gallery section). It's just some people think of a partner as more as personal item than something to care for. <br>

animals will share their food and even hunt for it to give away for the chance at reproduction. males warming eggs so the females can gather food. elephants caring for others young, the herd watching out for the welfare of the young that is not their own. if they were greedy they wouldn't care so all the more for themselves.<br>

and evolution is a myth, the winner of the survival of the fittest is a sponge. and until the missing link turns up it will remain a THEORY, just like all the other crazy theories about how we came to this crazy spinning ball we call earth. Funny how scientists totally accept this theory with no proof and snicker at religous folks for accepting things on FAITH.<br>
<br>
greed is a learned trait, it is what we do when all our needs are satisfied. when all of our frontiers are exhausted and there is nothing more to want, our basic desire to gather continues.<br>
<br>
children do not undertsand the concept of winning and losing, again, set 10 toddlers in a room with 9 chairs and they cannot understand why one must be without a chair, they will end up sharing.<br>

love is our innnermost basic desire, the want/need for love drives us to do many things. In our &quot;civilized&quot; view of the world, the more things we have the more attractive we look to our mates. Reproduction remains the basic and most intense trait in all animals and species on the planet.<br>

really just becuase you and your peers feel one way and agree does not mean that it's a part of the whole natural world. a man commited suicide today becuase of the things he believed, explain how greed factored into his life? or are you saying there is a greed gene? and the ones with the greed gene are the strongest and will survive?.<br>

There is tons of evidence contradicting creationism and nothing to support it.<br>
<br>
That makes both theories, but one is a well supported theory consistent with the evidence and the other is not.<br>
<br>
Consider such theories as the Theory of Gravitation and the Theory of Relativity.  They are not proven.  They are simply well accepted because they are consistent with facts.<br>
<br>
I've never understood the literalists.  I believe in God and I'm Christian, but I do not believe everything in the Bible literally.  I love those who insist everything in the Bible is 100 percent accurate word for word and should be taken as the foundation of our religion.  Where do people think the Bible came from?  A bunch of MEN sat down several hundred years after Christ and decided what was in and what was out.  Not only that, but Christ never even talks about the Bible.  I consider the foundation of Christianity to be Christ.  If he had wanted us to believe everything in the Bible, don't you think he'd have at least mentioned the Bible once?  Don't you think he'd have helped us design it and choose which books to put in it?  He didn't.  Christ never talks about or mentions the Bible.  It didn't even exist in its present form back then.<br>
<br>
Christ is the beginning.  From him comes the Church.  From the Church comes the Bible.  Certainly I believe there is much value and truth in the Bible, but I think that the fundamentalists get mixed up on the order, of what brought what into being.<br>

There are animals that are perfectly happy to eat other members of their own species.  Some eat their mates.  Some even eat their own young.<br>
<br>
There are animals that steal meat or other kills from the animals that originally made the kill even if that animal is starving and will die from it.<br>
<br>
Animals routinely place their own interests above others' interests when they kill them and eat them.<br>
<br>
You make it sound like animals or nature somehow exemplify the golden rule of Christianity.  They most definitely do not.<br>

<br>
Animals do this. There's no conscience, just instinct. Human infants do this too. They want, they will have it or they will do anything they can until they get it.<br>
<br>
I feel there is a deeper form of greed that most people do not understand. Ok, I want everything, and large amounts of all of it. But I'd also like to be a better person so that I want more important things.<br>
<br>
Being married, in a marriage that lasts and isn't just a form of abuse, will force you into being a better person. This is a good thing. Self-refinement is something worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Animals have no humility, they simply survive as best they can, you don't see lions setting up practice targets and honing their skills, or talking to other lions about dps. But as rational people, we do this.<br>
<br>
Adults aren't meant to just fulfill whims. Adults attempt to increase the worth of their character, and this often comes through self denial. You have to be able to leave first-person point of view to leave childhood behind. It is most unfortunate that many people marry before they have this skill.<br>
<br>
It is even more unfortunate that these couples sometimes have children quickly. A child being raised by two children with larger bodies doesn't get raised properly, which in turn increases the chance that they will repeat the mistake.<br>
<br>

When your deeper greed encourages you to be humble and attempt to increase the quality of others' lives as you increase the quality of your character, you've gotten to the point where the distance between self-interest and charity has approached nothing.<br>
<br>
I thoroughly advocate self-interest, just not at the 4-year-old level of wanting a toy, then hating the world until it becomes yours. What good is a plaything you'll discard or break when you could have obtained a meaningful relationship that could return happiness forever ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nazarpazar>Nazar Pazar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 429<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/03 1:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: doh</span><hr size=1> Your very correct Saalron.

Speaking of having kids early and out of marriage, I think its long overdue that mothers be given all rights to any kids they have.
