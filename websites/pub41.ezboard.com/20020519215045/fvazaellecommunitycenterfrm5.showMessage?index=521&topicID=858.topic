<br>
While the law of conservation of matter is considered a law it is still a theory. It is also combined with the law of conservation of energy for some matter converts partly if not entirely into energy.<br>
<br>
I don't know the entire line of reasoning but considering such great minds as the ones listed such as Einstein and Bohr were behind this theory, I'd give it more weight than some random person out of the blue.<br>
<br>
The fact that IBM has harnessed this ability and created a quantum computer says that the strange nature of these particles exist. We just dont fully understand them. They fail to follow basic laws.<br>

&quot;Thanks Anywon, i was definitely too lazy to find that verse but now at least its plain to people who read this board however few they may be that the muslim religion is a destructive militaristic virus set out to wipe all non-believers...betcha dont get that in the Today show...and to Kerai, the WHOLE point of the First Cause argument is that there was a First Cause to the universe which shows itself to be deterioting and losing energy every second (winding down you may say) and that First Cause was God, an eternal, all powerful God....and ROFL but the DEFINITION of God is that he is the Alpha Omega beginning end eternal all powerful being that does not need anything to exist and always was, is and will be....so just b/c you dont &quot;buy&quot; it doesnt mean thats not a totally valid argument&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, you sir are retarded. Christians have been the most violent religion in the history of men ( just look at how romans law changed after Christians took power, Charlemagne, crusades, inquisition, and more recently those catholic priest that participated in Rwanda genocide and are being protected by catholic church)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, let’s look at your First Cause argument kid. <br>
1.   Everything is caused by something other than itself<br>
2.   Therefore the universe was caused by something other than itself.<br>
3.   The string of causes cannot be infinitely long.<br>
4.   If the string of causes cannot be infinitely long, there must be a first cause.<br>
5.   Therefore, there must be a first cause, namely god.<br>
You have to understand that this argument is self-refuting,  1 says that everything is caused by something other than itself and 5 says god is the first cause. Since everything is caused by something other than itself, then god must be caused by something other than itself and therefore cannot be the first cause.<br>
And your first argument that everything is caused by something other than itself is flawed anyway. Just look at quantum mechanics, subatomic particles like electrons, photons, and positrons come into and go out of existence randomly.<br>
We have absolutely no idea of what were the law of physics of the universe before the Planck time ( 10^-43 s after the start of the universe). It is possible that the universe could have created itself out of nothing.<br>
I think the reason you believe that God created the universe can be summarized to this:<br>
“Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them.” - Steve Eley<br>
<br>
In short, you are retarded.<br>
&quot;There is a growing and significant amount of &quot;documentated cases of miracles&quot; which science readily admits it cannot explain. Clear cases of doctors, physicist and other &quot;men\women of science&quot; shrugging their shoulders for answers. <br>
<br>
Just a FYI for you atheists in the house..... &quot; –Goanad<br>
<br>
You care to back up your claim or you just imagining these things? I’m not saying science can explain everything for now, However, I haven’t seen those growing amount of “documented” cases of miracles and I’m reading a lot on scepticism and stuff like that. <br>
<br>
&quot;I read through and thoroughly understood the debate regarding the issue of whether or not matter can spontaneously come into existence. In short, the theory is bogus..completely. <br>
<br>
It violates one of the fundamental laws of science --- conservation of matter. I'm sure you're very familiar with the idea of conservation of matter and immediately see how somehow, someway they have to create a theoretic construct which permits the measurement capable of tracing where matter came from, where it went...etc...irregardless of it's state.....there no shortcut around this task for the person successfully trying to complete the total puzzle represented by the Big Bang Theory.&quot; –Goanad<br>
<br>
I’m not even going to waste time to explain you quantum physics. I’ll just tell you to go read a bit because you are ignorant sir, you have no idea what you are talking about and you should just STFU.<br>
<br>
YoshaMendel: *yawn* the 2nd law of themodynamics argument is so old and overused its sad that ignorant like you still use it and think it’s a valid argument. Your argument have already been refuted but I though it was important to point how stupid you are. <br>
 <br>
Procax: &quot;See, this is where I made the point like god 200 posts back or something. Religon says the world is this way because it was created. Science says the world is this way because we can observe it. Neither is particularly scientific.&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree. Religion claims things without backing it up with evidence, while science back up their claims. Therefore, yes science is more scientific then religion because we base our hypothesis on evidence and we adapt our theories when they cant explain everything.<br>
<br>
Someone could say that an omnipotent invisible orange unicorn created the universe 2min37sec ago ( with our memory and all, the unicorn is OMNIPOTENT). But I wont take that person seriously unless she can back what she claims with proofs. Anyway I think Bertrand Russel says it better then me.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not pretend to be able to prove that there is no God. I equally cannot prove that Satan is a fiction. The Christian God may exist; so may the gods of Olympus, or of ancient Egypt, or of Babylon. But no one of these hypotheses is more probable than any other: they lie outside the region of even probable knowledge, and therefore there is no reason to consider any of them. The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more often likely to be foolish than sensible.&quot; - Bertrand Russell<br>

I have heard that a thousand time, teachers at school tried to get me to believe that. You wont convince anyone with this kind of garbage. Your religion is full of contradictions. Ill post a couple of them just for fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ex. 20:13 Thou shalt not commit murder.<br>
Ex. 32:27 Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, put every man his sword by his side...and slay every man his brother...companion..neighbor.<br>
<br>
Eph. 2:8,9 For by grace are ye saved through faith...not of works. (Rom. 3:20, 28; Gal. 2:16)<br>
James 2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.(Matt. 19:16-21)<br>

John 1:18 No man hath seen God at anytime. (Ex 33:20; <br>
Tim. 6:16; John 6:46; I John 4:12)<br>

And here are a couple of nice quotes on religion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  :<br>
<br>
&quot;Religious ideas have sprung from the same need as all the other achievements of culture: from the necessity for defending itself against the crushing supremacy of nature.&quot; - Sigmund Freud<br>
<br>
&quot;If God kills, lies, cheats, discriminates, and otherwise behaves in a manner that puts the Mafia to shame, that's Okay, he's God. He can do whatever he wants. Anyone who adheres to this philosophy has had his sense of morality, decency, justice and humaneness warped beyond recognition by the very book that is supposedly preaching the opposite.&quot; - Dennis McKinsey<br>
<br>
&quot;Strange...a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; mouths Golden Rules and forgiveness multiplied seventy times seven and invented Hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him!&quot; - Mark Twain<br>
<br>
&quot;The whole Bible was written by slave owners, and for slave owners. There is no hint of criticism of slavery anywhere in that book. Jesus made no objection to mistreatment of slaves. He indicated that selling of debtors into slavery would be continued his forthcoming kingdom of heaven as well as masters having the right to beat their slaves and put them to torture.&quot; - Merrill Holste<br>
<br>
&quot;It would be very nice if there were a God who created the world and was a benevolent providence, and if there were a moral order in the universe and an after-life; but it is a very striking fact that all this is exactly as we are bound to wish it to be.&quot; - Sigmund Freud<br>
<br>
&quot;Man is a Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven.&quot; - Mark Twain<br>
<br>
“There once was a time when all people beleived in God and the church ruled. This time was called the Dark Ages.” -Richard Lederer<br>
<br>
“I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.” - Stephen Roberts<br>
<br>
&quot;One does well to put on gloves when reading the New Testament. The proximity of so much uncleanliness almost forces one to do this.&quot; - Fredrich Nietzsche<br>
<br>
&quot;A thorough reading and understanding of the Bible is the surest path to atheism.&quot; - Rev. Donald Morgan<br>
<br>
Creationists make it sound as though a 'theory' is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night. - Isaac Asimov<br>
<br>
If we are going to teach 'creation science' as an alternative to evolution, then we should also teach the stork theory as an alternative to biological reproduction. - Judith Hayes<br>
<br>
Creation science has not entered the curriculum for a reason so simple and so basic that we often forget to mention it: because it is false, and because good teachers understand exactly why it is false. What could be more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our entire intellectual heritage - good teaching - than a bill forcing honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any general understanding of science as an enterprise? - Stephen Jay Gould<br>
<br>
If you have a faith, it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that it is the same faith as your parents and grandparents had. No doubt soaring cathedrals, stirring music, moving stories and parables, help a bit. But by far the most important variable determining your religion is the accident of birth. The convictions that you so passionately believe would have been a completely different, and largely contradictory, set of convictions, if only you had happened to be born in a different place. Epidemiology, not evidence. - Richard Dawkins<br>
<br>

<br>
I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator. By warding off the Jews I am fighting for the Lord's work. - Adolph Hitler  <br>
<br>
Any violence which does not spring from a spiritual base, will be wavering and uncertain. It lacks the stability which can only rest in a fanatical outlook. - Adolph Hitler  <br>
<br>
People who are bitter and hateful about slavery are obviously bitter and hateful against God and his word, because they reject what God says and embrace what mere humans say concerning slavery. This humanistic thinking is what the abolitionists embraced. - Alabama State Senator Charles Davidson <br>
<br>
To affirm that the Sun...is at the centre of the universe and only rotates on its axis without going from east to west, is a very dangerous attitude and one calculated not only to arouse all Scholastic philosophers and theologians but also to injure our holy faith by contradicting the Scriptures. - Cardinal Bellarmino <br>
<br>
Freedom of the press is one of the greatest evils threatening modern society. Freedom of the press was universally one of the most pernicious of the evils of the day. - Cardinal Pedro Segura <br>
<br>
Incest is a voluntary act on the woman's part. - Charles Rice <br>
<br>
Priestesses should be burnt at the stake because they are assuming powers they have no right to. In the medieval world that was called sorcery. The way of dealing with sorcerers was to burn them at the stake. It's illegal now but if I had my way that is what would happen to them. In medieval times, I would burn the bloody bitches. - Church of England vicar Rev. Anthony Kennedy <br>
<br>
We should always be disposed to believe that that which appears white is really black, if the hierarchy of the Church so decides. - Ignatius of Loyola <br>
<br>
Sex education classes in our public schools are promoting incest. - Jimmy Swaggart <br>
<br>
It is your God-given right to destroy any man or woman calling themselves doctors who willingly slaughter innocent children. - Keith Tucci <br>
<br>
The New York Times reports that evangelist Pat Robertson, who will announce in two weeks whether he will run for the presidency, claims he can pray away bad weather. Robertson said in a recent interview that his prayers to keep Hurricane Gloria away from Virginia Beach last June had been successful, which was 'extremely important because I felt, interestingly enough, that if I couldn't move a hurricane, I could hardly move a nation.' Robertson said that if the hurricane had come ashore, he would have seen it as a sign from above to abandon his presidential ambitions. - Leah Garchik <br>
<br>
&quot;If I had to baptise a Jew, I would take him to the bridge of the Elbe, hang a stone around his neck and push him over with the words &quot;I baptise thee in the name of Abraham.&quot; - Martin Luther <br>
<br>
Reason should be destroyed in all Christians. - Martin Luther <br>
<br>
Kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. But all the young girls who have not known man...keep alive for yourselves. - Moses <br>
<br>
They have kept us in submission because they have talked about separation of church and state. There is no such thing in the Constitution. It's a lie of the left, and we're not going to take it anymore. - Pat Robertson <br>
<br>
When I said during my presidential bid that I would only bring Christians and Jews into the government, I hit a firestorm. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; the media challenged me. &quot;You're not going to bring atheists into the government? How dare you maintain that those who believe in the Judeo-Christian values are better qualified to govern America than Hindus and Muslims?&quot; My simple answer is, &quot;Yes, they are.&quot; - Pat Robertson <br>
<br>
Use against heretics the spiritual sword of excommunication, and if this does not prove effective, use the material sword. - Pope Innocent III <br>
<br>
The state (the U.S. Constitution) has not the right to leave every man free to profess and embrace whatever religion he may desire. - Pope Pius IX <br>
<br>
It was once proposed that all religious persuasions should be free and their worship publicly exercised. We Catholics have rejected this article as contrary to Roman Catholic canon law. - Pope Pius VII <br>
<br>
Let Catholic writers take care when defending the cause of the proletariat and the poor not to use language calculated to inspire among the people aversion to the upper classes of society. - Pope Pius X <br>
<br>
I want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you. I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you. Yes, hate is good ... if a Christian voted for Clinton, he sinned against God. It's that simple. Our goal is a Christian nation. We have a biblical duty, we are called by God to conquer this country... - Randall Terry <br>
<br>
There is not one verse in the Bible inhibiting slavery, but many regulating it. It is not then, we conclude, immoral. - Reverend Alexander Campbell <br>
<br>
The right of holding slaves is clearly established in the Holy Scriptures, both by precept and example. - Reverend R. Furman <br>
<br>
The good Christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who make empty prophecies. That danger already exists that mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine man to the bonds of Hell. - St. Augustine <br>
<br>
It is high time that scholars of all godly religions united to confront the forces of immorality in the present day under various names such as secularism, human rights, freedom of speech. - Tehran's Kayhan International newspaper urging cooperation with the Vatican in opposing the U.N. population control document <br>
<br>
Vaccination is a direct violation of the everlasting covenant that God made with Noah after the flood.... Vaccination never saved human life. It does not prevent smallpox. - The Golden Age <br>

If the Bible had said that Jonah swallowed the whale, I would believe it. - William Jennings Bryan <br>

I really liked your post.<br>
So, trying to play devil's advocate a little here, just because...<br>
<br>
I suppose that a theoretical debate of quantum mechanics is impending here on the EQ messageboard which seems somehow ironic and fitting at the same time.  Would Bohr or Linus Pauling have played EQ?  I think they would have.<br>
<br>
Let me first state that I have only a rudimentary understanding of the popularly publicized aspects of Quantum Mechanics and that I was a poor student in Modern Physics. <br>
<br>
That being said, your argument about the subatomic particles winking in and out of existence... are you referring to repetitive bifurcation of the universe where every particle state has a representative reality that may or may not be the one we are observing at the moment? <br>
or something else...?  Just establishing if the particles are actually coming from nowhere or from parallel universes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was just curious if you were saying that over time (and it might be a long time, or might be just a short one - just that the odds of it being a long time are better theoretically assuming that there is some sort of &quot;barrier&quot; to the particles entrance into existence) everything has kind of simply appeared from nowhere. <br>
Does an attached page of mathematical equations, that demonstrate and explain a portion of the argument give it more validity than &quot;Everything just appeared because a higher power said it should&quot;? <br>
<br>
Aren't the two things essentially the same?<br>
<br>
Is knowing how to manipulate the mathematical formalism the trick to having faith in something?<br>

When they cease to have energy, they no longer exist in our universe (to our knowledge) and therefore when a quantum particle occillates and it hits zero energy, it ceases to exist. Others go from zero energy to some level and so pop into being. To my knowledge it is unknown what happens to these particles. Perhaps they still have some sort of energy/existance in another dimension that we have yet to understand and hence when they vanish from our dimension, they really haven't ceased to exist. Conversely if they pop into being they really haven't come out of no where.<br>

Einstein disagreed, as did his good friend Erwin Shroedinger.  (Both were determinists).  &quot;God does not play dice with the world.&quot;  More probable is that these particles only appear to phase in and out of existence because we do not have the technology to track them during their 'down cycle' of activity.<br>
<br>
Imagine, if you will, a light bulb viewed through a telescope 10,000 miles away.  Turned on, the light bulb will be much easier to detect.  If a cloud passes between over the light bulb, it becomes much harder to detect.  Did the lightbulb dematerialize simply because we can no longer observe it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugoanad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goanad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 347<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/6/02 12:01:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=532>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nice post Kelnok</span><hr size=1> Time for me to exit this thread ---  When the people of science fail to see the importance and difference between laws and theories then we're past the point of any returns for effort given. <br>

Science stands high on the laws it propounds but linguistically twists them when their atheistic leanings require that they do so or they pick and choose from laws of physics to suit the argument at hand. <br>

If our existence is actually limited to the life we spend on earth, should I really care if there is a God or not?  If I cease to exist as a sentient being at the time of my bodily death, why should I care if there IS a God out there?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask these questions is because, I have yet to find any indication that there is something &quot;eternal&quot; about my eixstence.  I don't have any recollection of events that happened &quot;before&quot; my birth.  The world &quot;eternal&quot; is defined as &quot;Being without beginning or end; existing outside of time&quot;.  (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=eternal)">www.dictionary.com/search?q=eternal)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  If my &quot;soul&quot; was created within this space-time continuum at the time of conception, surely it is confined within this space-time continuum and is not eternal?<br>
<br>
I think it is either wishful thinking, fear of death, or outright arrogance to think that we are in some way immortal.  As far as I can tell, I did not exist in any meaningful way (as a sentient being) before conception, why should I believe that I should continue to exist as a sentient being after my body decomposes?<br>
<br>
Honestly, if I won't &quot;live&quot; forever in some meaningful fashion, I really could care less even if God DID exist.  His existence would be irrelevant (to my situation).  I'm curious what makes people think they will exist forever ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uganndon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ganndon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/6/02 3:03:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=534>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everlasting existence?</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
Personally, I hope that wherever I go, it's somewhere wild. I mean, wild like woods and nature, not wild like some nightclubs. I've seen enough of THAT in this lifetime. I want to be able to speak to everyone I've ever loved that had passed on before me, and I can think of a few people that I've never actually met, that I'd like to talk to as well. Savador Dali comes to mind...<br>
Also, I want to be reunited with all the pets I've lost over the years. To be able to play with and pet them all, and know that when I leave them, they'll be safe. <br>
There is no violence. Maybe interesting analytical debate, and discussion, but nothing harmful. <br>
There is no crime, because, of course, there is no coveting- everyone has exactly what they need. <br>
<br>
NO TOOTH DECAY!!!<br>
<br>
I've believed for a while now, that when my time comes, it'll be sort of like how Tom Robbins describes it in Jitterbug Perfume. <br>
I'll be transported to a sort of waiting station on a river. A lot like a train station. There is a line of people and I step to the end of the line. When I get to the front, there is a sort of angel there, or spirit, or whatever, and she is standing just on the other side of a table with a scale on it. On one side of the scale is a single feather, the other side is empty. She reaches towards me, and when she pulls her hand back, she is holding my heart in her hand. She places my heart on the empty sid eof the scale. If my heart is lighter than the feather, I am allowed to get on a boat that will take me to... beyond... Heaven.. paradise...Olympus... wherever it is you go when your time to move on has come. However, if my heart is too heavy, I am lead to another boat, and I am reborn in this world as another person, and I must correct the mistakes I made the last time around until it's time to be judged again. <br>
The trick is, I don't know what mistakes I made and can't avoid them unless I know instinctively what they are. <br>
<br>
I just think there's too much intolerance in the world. Period. I think the religious people are too intolerant of the atheists and agnostics and the religious people, and I think that atheists and agnostics are too intolerant of the religious people. Not to say everyone's like that, it's a broad generalisation, but on the whole I think it's a fair call to make.  <p><center>

I feel like I should speak out though so everyone can become more aware.<br>
<br>
Most of you will probably be skeptical that what i'm about to post is truth. I suppose many will call me crazy. But I dunno, maybe most ppl will believe me.<br>
<br>
I don't spread this info around in my real life for obvious reasons. The last thing i want to do is be ridiculed.<br>
<br>
Anyway here goes...<br>
<br>
<br>
There are 2 things in my life that Prove to me the existence of God. Now, this may not be God in the conventional sense because I don't fully understand it myself. But there is Something greater than ourseleves. There is something beyond our comprehension that we may never discover.<br>
<br>
You might wonder how the existence of a supernatural concept of God or Something was proven to me. I'll try to explain as best I can.<br>
<br>
The 2 things I spoke of earlier are this:<br>
<br>
1. My dreams<br>
2. Flashes<br>
<br>
I'll explain them both in turn.<br>
<br>
1. My dreams - ever since I was a child I've had odd dreams. As I went through life living in different places and meeting different people, many strange things would be in my dreams. I suppose I was about 9 when I became aware of what was happening. <br>
<br>
Brace yourself...I was dreaming the future. It's happened so many times that i've come to trust it. I have countless times dreamed of where I would be one day. There's never any sound. I see rooms and objects and people. When I dream them I usually have no clue what or where or who they are. As the months go by tho they occur and I remember dreaming about it. For the most part It's nothing terribly specific or important. It's not like I've dreamed that G. Bush would be president, but more like one day I'd be sitting in the living room of a new friend.<br>
<br>
One explanation for this could be that I am simply recalling something that just happened to me and that my brain is confusing it with a dream i once had. That i'm not really dreaming the future, but my mind is mixing it up with the present and past dreams. I would tend to agree with this theory if it wasn't for the flashes.<br>
<br>
2. Flashes - I get these on average 1 per week. I don't have much warning that they are about to happen. Usually only a few moments. I get a strong scent in my nose that's unlike anything. It doesn't compare to food, nature, or anything. I get a solid hum in my mind that doesn't make sound but covers me like a warm blanket. My gut gets tense as though I were sick. This is what happens just before i get the flash.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, most of the time I feel perfectly normal before they happen and I feel ok, if not disturbed, when they go away.<br>
<br>
This is how I feel during the flash. I have to completely stop what i'm doing. If i'm playing EQ i have to steady myself against the wall and chair and look away from the computer while i close my eyes. It's impossible to concentrate on anything but the flash. This may sound weird, but it's like a warm blanket that you can't feel. It's completely disturbing and unpleasant. It is not something i enjoy in the least.<br>
<br>
Now, what is the flash actually about? I'll tell you. I get flashes and images in my mind. I get a rush of feelings and feel things i've never felt at any point in my life. It's extremely odd. I get images and textures of people and places. But it's not like a future. It's like something that I've already experienced. It's like i'm getting some supernatural flashback of a previous life or some insight on something that we just can't normally see or feel. It's extremely hard to put into words.<br>
<br>
When this happens to me I just know. I can't say why or how but i KNOW. What do i know? I'm not even completely certain. It's like i know there is Something other than what we can perceive. There is another demension or God or something. I feel it. I know it's there.<br>
<br>
Usually when these flashes occur everything is perfectly clear to me. For the duration of the flash I know what it's about. I know what i'm remembering or seeing. Once the flash ends I lose my grasp on that. Afterwards I can only remember that I knew what what it was about when it happened.<br>
<br>
It occurs like that every single time without fail. I know that i'll understand for the time of the flash and that i'll lose it when it goes away. It's frustrating.<br>
<br>
For those of you that have branded me a lunatic by now, let me state a few things. I've never done drugs. I don't do drugs. I eat and live responsibly. I treat my body with respect.<br>
<br>
Also i've been to the doctors for years. I've had all sorts of tests done and no one can figure out why the things happen to me that happen. That is also frustrating.<br>
<br>
I don't know what all this means in the big picture. I don't know if i have some sort of insight into things that we have yet to discover. Maybe I am crazy.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you this though. Everything that i spoke of is reality. It happens to me. I can only hope one day I can fully understand it.<br>
<br>
Anyway i guess that's all i have to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/02 9:27:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=542>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.texasranger.org/Fake_Badges/Final/Badgerepl(1).jpg Height=100 Width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well here goes</span><hr size=1> hrmmmphh, I really didn't want to post this but since Whispered did..../sigh.  I have had the those same kind of dreams Whispered all my life.  They were a lot more frequent as a child and pretty much stopped for the five or so years when I was in my hardcore pot-smoking, ecstacy stage, but have started to come back as I have begun to chill out again.   They are EXACTLY as you desrcibed, just a small snippet of something terribly innane, but at the same time very specific and vivid.  I will wake up and totally forget about it but then a month or so later the exact dream will happen and you can totally recall dreaming this.  Most people would call this deja-vu, but these things are a lot more specific to simply be called deja-vu.  I don't know it's really hard to convey this in words, but I have the feeling Whispered knows exactly what I am talking about.<br>

As a kid these dreams and a couple other extra-sensory experiences caused me to believe in God, specifically a Christian God since I lived in a small Oklahoma bible-belt Baptist town.  I went through the whole routine for a couple years, but it just never felt quite right,  the hypocrisy and judgemental attitude of not only the people, but the whole religion itself (see Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson) sstarted to turn me off.  It also didn't help that I have had a love and fascination for Astronomy and Cosmology since i was a young boy.  My uncle has been a scientist at Jet Propulsions Laboratory since i was seven and he would always send me the brand new photos and stuff that they were receiving from the Voyager/Viking/Galileo etc satellites that they were playing with at the time.  Anyway my point is that I became a scientist in the way i anylize things, and seeing the hypocrisy on the Christians, I formed my own view of God and the universe through my own personal experiences and theories rather than 90% of humanity that are told something when they are 5 years old and accept it the rest of their lives.  For those that haven't botherered to read the whole thread and my previous posts from months ago, I am kind of a quasi Buddhist with a big dose of Sagan heh. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:papyrus;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'10pt'">
