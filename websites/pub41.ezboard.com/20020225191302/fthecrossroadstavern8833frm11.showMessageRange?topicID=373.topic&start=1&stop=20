Suffice to say:<br><br>I'm in a group up at Upper Dogs in Velks. The cleric leaves as she has to go somewhere. We get a replacemnet cleric for the 30 mins that our cleric is away for. Original cleric comes back and I go to get her at zone in to invis her. I invis her and she runs up. I invis myself and there's a nasty suprise on the way up. Crystal eyes has spawned, and he can see through invis and so he aggros me.<br><br>[Tue Feb 05 17:38:23 2002] Crystal Eyes bears its fangs and lunges at you! '<br><br>Now, I can see there's people at CE, so I slow CE, root it and carry on running up to Upper dogs. By the time I get to the top of the slippery slope, root has broken and CE has followed me up. Hum. CE group didn't bother. So I make it back to UDogs with CE rooted again right behind me.<br><br>At this point, even though CE group hadn't engaged the mob, or made any attempt to kill it, I was fully prepared to suggest to the group that we give them the loot, however just before we had killed it the flaming had already begun.
