He is peering ahead into the gloom. One hand removes a box of matches from his pocket. The other hand digs out a match. He absentmindedly strikes it against the pad. Lifts the match to the tip of the cigarette. Inhales...nothing.<br>
<br>
Bah.<br>
<br>
He lets go of the match, and watches it float to the &quot;ceiling&quot; of Kedge Keep. Dumbass. Trying to light up underwater.<br>
<br>
He is totally alone in the upside down lobby of doomed Kedge....the keep that slipped off the edge of the cliff of Dagnor's Cauldron and tumbled half intact into the waters below. The wizards and mages were clamouring for their pieces for their epics that were hidden in these submerged passages, and with the geometry of Kedge reversed, he thought it a good idea to do a little exploring before leading the Alliance here. Before heading into the waters, he had mustered his magic together to cast a spell that let him breathe the water as if air. How odd the feeling of water filling his lungs, processed out, like a water pump within him. He would never get used to that feeling.<br>
<br>
It is deathly quiet in the murky depths...a flicker of his fingers and his eyes begin to glow, violet light. The room illuminates with no light, his ultravision picking out shapes lit with eerie purple hues.<br>
<br>
He is alone.<br>
<br>
A secret pleasure, and a twinge of guilt. Silence cradled him like a babe. No one but Camille knew where he was....she had passed on his invitation to come, instead heading to the cleric guilds of Freeport to attend the teaching in how to raise the dead back to life. But nothing else was there to distract him. No reports from the guild. No requests from the Alliance. Not another voice, human or otherwise. Not even the sound of his breathing. Wrapped back in the womb, water invading his every pore.<br>
<br>
With his left hand, he passes it in front of his face....his image shivers, and then, shimmers away....nothing to mark his presense...he is invisible.<br>
<br>
And -BLINK- he reappears.<br>
<br>
God I hate this spell.<br>
<br>
Unlike his waterbreathing, which had a nice set duration, invisibility is the bane of casters everywhere. Unpredictable, tending to drop at the most inopportune times, it was almost not worth casting. But River was clueless to what lay before him, and this mission was for information best glimpsed from behind a sheild of anonimity. Tales of thinking, manevolent creatures living within Kedge had surfaced, and the bodies of adventures who went to investigate did not.<br>
<br>
Again he passes his hand in front of his face, legs kicking slightly to keep him from sinking to the floor. And once again he disappears from view.<br>
<br>
Swimming in and down into a hole in the floor, into a long descending tube, the interior of a broken column. He passes by swordfish, their snouts wicked sharp, and checks again to see if his invisibility is holding. Swinging a sword and sheild underwater requires twice the strength to get half the speed, and those fish would quickly slice him to ribbons. He swam silently past their glassy, unblinking eyes, down into the deep.<br>
<br>
Another room, filled with rainbow colored fish, swimming in small schools. They dart past his face, oblivious to his presence.<br>
<br>
Now a long hallway, silent, void of all sound. River kicks with his feet and propels forward.<br>
<br>
Ah, now this is interesting....the stories were correct.<br>
<br>
Swimming in the corner of the next room, he sees two....women....swimming around a huge shark. The shark made no move to attack the women, who are rabbing shells across the sharks dorsal area, scraping its skin down, cleaning it. The womens' hair is not hair at all, but flowing green seaweed, and from the waist down, the likeness to humanity ends and the body of a fish begins. Two mermaids, cleaning the scales of a shark. River gapes, treading water. He sees his hands absentmindedly reaching for his cigarettes.<br>
<br>
Sees his hands.<br>
<br>
He is visible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh shi....&quot; he thinks, as the womens heads snap in his direction.<br>
<br>
Immediately there is movement. The mermaid to the left swims straight at him, the shark and other mermaid breaking left and right. The mermaid rushing him is moving like an arrow, eyes lighting white. River yanks Reaver free of its scabbard.<br>
<br>
Eyes pulse light.<br>
<br>
River curses as white lighting shoots through his senses. The mermaid has sent a shock of power through him that would have knocked a lesser man unconscious.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bitch!&quot; River gasps, swinging his sword in a wide arc. Reaver slices through her neck like a knife through butter. Red clouds billow from her neck as her head floats to the floor.<br>
<br>
Blinded by the bloody clouds, River quickly loses his sense of direction....his legs kick wildly, head turning back and forth, trying to see through the blood......where are they dammit?<br>
<br>
His answer is in two forms....he hears through the water a light female humming....the mermaid. And then another sound....a muffled buzzing. Growing louder, louder.<br>
<br>
Suddenly tiny gnats are crawling into him, his mouth, his ears nostrils.....biting, stinging, invading him. The swarm settles into him.<br>
<br>
And at the same time, from his left, the shark strikes.<br>
<br>
Powerful jaws clamp his torso. River is hanging out of the shark's mouth like a ragdoll in the jaws of a dog. Only the god-forged strength of the Umbral armor he wears keeps that bite from chomping him into three pieces. Meanwhile, body screaming pain from the swarm within him, River waits for the pressure of the shark's jaws to split him open like a walnut.<br>
<br>
Not today, fish.<br>
<br>
River's hands begin to light with an unearthly glow.<br>
<br>
River slaps both of his hands over the shark's eyes.<br>
<br>
PULSE.<br>
<br>
The shark's head explodes with a muzzled pop. Fish entrails, teeth, cartilidge float in every direction, as River, stinging, silently screaming floats to the floor....above him, somewhere in the blood, was the other mermaid.<br>
<br>
And then, just like that, the swarm departs. River's interior is ravaged by tiny bites, but for now he is still whole. So the mermaid's spell had its limitations as well. <br>
<br>
Kicking to propell himself from the wall, River realized how badly he was hurt. His grip on Reaver had gone when the shark had clamped him, and was impossible to find with the blood clouding the water. The swarm had ravaged his insides, and he barely had strength to tread water. <br>
<br>
And then the mermaid was on his back, hands clawing at his eyes.<br>
<br>
With reflexes battle trained, and the inhuman power of a shadowknight, River's hands fly over his head to lock around the throat of the mermaid. <br>
<br>
And then River.....drinks.<br>
<br>
The mermaid's eyes bulge as Riverdane draws her life force into his hands. His destroyed inside begins to mend, bruises fading, as he vampirically draws the life from the mermaid now clinging weakly to his back. She floats away from him as he lets go, tail spasming, as he takes the last her of her life into him.<br>
<br>
Hmmmp, he thinks, who needs groups. Groups are for...<br>
<br>
And then, time elapsed, River gasps as his water breathing spell ceases functioning, his eyes open in surprise as his body floats to the bottom of the room.<br>
<br>
Alone.<br>
<br>
Riverdane Wyldechylde dies in a watery grave.<br>
<br>
There is only silence.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27>Artistic Endeavors</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
