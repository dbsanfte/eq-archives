A Shreveport Judge's Report on Iraq <br>
<br>
Last Wednesday night, I attended a lecture by Judge Don Walter, a federal judge who was asked to serve as part of a 12 man team in Iraq to evaluate their justice system. It was most interesting, and afterwards, I asked if he had a book or a recording of any of his lectures. Since he did not, he was generous enough to give me his notes from the evening. For those of you interested, I will give you a slightly abridged version of his lecture which I found difficult to cut down due to its wealth of information. <br>
<br>
THE LECTURE: I really am not into public speaking as I am sure you are about to find out. But my adventures in Iraq taught me something that I would very much like to share with you. I have been fortunate over the past 5 or 6 years to get to such exotic places as Bosnia, Jakarta, Indonesia, and Morocco. But, Iraq is my swan song. First, I am too old for such adventures, and second, Charlotte (my wife) won't let me. <br>
<br>
In mid-April, I got a call from DoJ asking if I would be willing to go to Iraq for up to 3 months to evaluate the justice system and make recommendations. When I went home, Charlotte said without a pause, &quot;how could I possibly tell you, no?&quot; <br>
<br>
Let me begin with a disclaimer, I was in Iraq for fewer than 40 days, I was in Baghdad for a little over three weeks and in the three provinces of the far south for two weeks. I am limited in what I saw and heard. Needless to say, the opinions are my own. I want to make it clear that, initially, I vehemently opposed the war. The team of 12 that went to Iraq was to access the judiciary and to make recommendations for the future. We were sent too soon and without sufficient planning and forethought. Accordingly we were forced to play our part by ear. Ultimately, we were successful. No thanks to the civil authorities in Washington or Iraq. <br>
<br>
We were divided into 4 teams. We were the southern team: Mike Farhang, an AUSA from Los Angeles, Harvard Summa Undergraduate, Harvard Law Review, Linguist, 5 languages including Arabic; Rich Coughlin, Federal Public Defender from New Jersey, who abandoned his wife and 23 month old daughter to volunteer for this; and me. We were accompanied by an interpreter and protected by what I called our &quot;minders,&quot; four Iraqis well-armed with 9mm hand guns and AK47's. <br>
<br>
During the first two weeks, we talked to a few hundred Iraqis and interviewed about 60 judges. Our help came from our Danish colleagues and the First Armored Division (UK), not from the civil authorities - OPCA, Office of the Provisional Coalition Authority, (formerly ORHA), Ambassador Brenner's group. Despite my initial opposition to the war, I am now convinced, whether we find any weapons of mass destruction or prove Saddam sheltered and financed terrorists, absolutely, we should have overthrown the Baathists, indeed, we should have done it sooner. <br>
<br>
What changed my mind? When we left mid June, 57 mass graves had been found, one with the bodies of 1200 children. There have been credible reports of murder, brutality and torture of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iraqi citizens. There is poverty on a monumental scale and fear on a larger one. That fear is still palpable. I have seen the machines and places of torture. I will tell you one story told to me by the Chief of Pediatrics at the Medical College in Basra. It was one of the most shocking to me, but I heard worse. One of Saddam's security agents was sent to question a Shiite in his home. The interrogation took place in the living room in the presence of the man's wife, who held their three month old child. A question was asked and the thug did not like the answer; he asked it again, same answer. He grabbed the baby from its mother and plucked its eye out. And then repeated his question. <br>
<br>
Worse things happened with the knowledge, indeed with the participation, of Saddam, his family and the Baathist regime. Thousands suffered while we were messing about with France and Russia and Germany and the UN. Every one of them knew what was going on there, but France and the UN were making millions administering the food for oil program. We cannot, I know, remake the world, nor do I believe we should. We cannot stamp out evil, I know. But this time we were morally right and our economic and strategic interests were involved. I submit that just because we can't do everything doesn't mean that we should do nothing. <br>
<br>
We must have the moral courage to see this through, to do whatever it takes to secure responsible government for the Iraqi people. Having decided to topple Saddam, we cannot abandon those who trust us. I fear we will quit as the horrors of war come into our living rooms. Look at the stories you are getting from the media today. The steady drip, drip, drip of bad news may destroy our will to fulfill the obligations we have assumed. <br>
<br>
WE ARE NOT GETTING THE WHOLE TRUTH FROM THE NEWS MEDIA. The news you watch, listen to and read is highly selective. Good news doesn't sell. 90% of the damage you see on tv was caused by Iraqis, not by US. All the damage you see to schools, hospitals, power generation facilities, refineries, pipelines and water supplies, as well as shops, museums, and semi-public buildings (like hotels) was caused either by the Iraqi army in its death throes or Iraqi civilians looting and rioting. The day after the war was over, there was nearly 0 power being generated in Iraq. 45 days later, 1/3 of the total national potential of 8000 MW is up and running. Downed power lines are being repaired and were about 70% complete when I left. There is water purification where little or none existed before...this time to everyone. Oil is 95% of the Iraqi GNP. In order for Iraq to survive, it must sell oil. All the damage to the oil fields was done by the Iraqi army or looters. The 14 story office building of the Southern Iraq Oil Company in Basra was torched by Baathist, destroying all of the books, records and computers of the company. Today, the refinery at Bayji is at 75% of capacity. The crude pipeline between Kirkuk and Bayji has been repaired, though the Baathist keep trying to disrupt it. <br>
<br>
If we are doing all this for the people, why are they shooting us? The general population isn't. By my sample, 90% are glad we came and the majority doesn't want us to leave for some time to come, but there are still plenty of bad guys, the Baathists who lived well under Saddam. The thugs of the old regime still hope to return to power, and there are plenty of them, mostly located in Sunni areas. Then too, Saddam, in the Ramadan amnesty, let every murderer, butcher, rapist and violent criminal loose on his own people. There are interests, including organized crime, with a desire for anarchy and profit. There are disruptive forces from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria. We saw poverty on a scale that I have never witnessed except in pictures of Haiti. <br>
<br>
I saw one little girl: she was slender, very pretty, about 5 or 6 years old, in a tattered dress with a broad red hem, part of which was torn and dragging in the dirt. She would touch her heart and make hungry gestures. She was duplicated a thousand times during the journey. The poverty in Iraq is a sharp contrast to the lives of Saddam and his sons. Saddam alone, not counting Ouday and Qusay and the leading Baathists, had 43 palaces. We are using several for civilian government. The one where OPCA is located is the main republican palace occupying over 2000 acres. It is a monument to narcissism, four 25 foot tall heads of Saddam decorate the front of the palace, and his portraits and statues are everywhere. <br>
<br>
We went to a second palace by the airport. It is surrounded by a lake which was created by diverting the Euphrates water which limited agricultural irrigation downstream. His palace in Basra was used by him only once I am told. Basra functions fairly well except for the power. There are 6 lines into the city, but it does not have a standard power grid. Saddam used power and other essentials as a method of punishing a city of 3 million! He would cut power for days to punish them. When I tell you the temperatures there, you will understand how bad that was. I am told that in high summer, it will hit 155 degrees, even 160! He has made no investments in this area which is overwhelmingly Shiite. He has few friends there. <br>
<br>
Consequently, it is easier for the Brits to govern, unlike Baghdad. And they are doing a good job of it. They are doing it at the moment by using pre-war personnel, perhaps contrary to Brenner's de-Baathification order. The problem with Brenner's policy is that it removes almost all of the people who ran the country. The Brits have been pragmatic: they have largely left the judges and police in place and are removing them as they see the need and they are able to train and replace the bad ones. That was our problem in Haiti, we trained a police force but did not put the judiciary in place so that the jails just filled up and then overcrowding forced criminals out. And the Haitian police have largely quit. (Ouday had a solution to overcrowding, when he received a complaint of overcrowding, he went to the prison and personally shot every 3rd prisoner.) We want to keep Iraq a secular state, and that will present some difficulties as there is no real concept of separation of church and state in Islam. Attaturk was a true revolutionary where this was concerned. The tribal and sharia (religious) courts are functioning, and if we don't get a move on, they will replace the civil and criminal courts. <br>
<br>
I find it difficult to explain how differently they think. I remember telling Mike, &quot;I don't think we are on the same page with this fellow.&quot; Mike said, &quot;Don, I am not sure we are in the same library.&quot; For a large percentage of the Iraqi people, and they are most adamant, family and tribe are everything, religion and state are one and the same. That they don't understand us is our biggest problem in the middle east. They perceive our way of life as a threat to theirs,...and it is. They fear the modern world is about to run over them, destroying family life as they know it, educating and freeing their women, forbidding honor killing...coca colas, jeans, lack of parental respect and respect for the old ways and religion. And to defend their way of life and their religion, they will die with the same fervor with which the Christians marched to the lions. In their fear of western life, some will fight and kill us; but I remain convinced that the majority want a secular society and the best that the west has to offer. <br>
<br>
We are not hated by everyone. Of the hundreds I talked to, the overwhelming majority thanked us for being there. Hundreds of adults and children on the roads waved and smiled as we passed by. We went to the law school with about 300 students, about ten of whom were female. There we were, three Americans and they wanted us to fix their school and they thought we could. They thought Americans could do anything. They were like children expecting the genie from the bottle to immediately gratify their needs. The law students were the finest example of hope that I encountered. They told me that the future was theirs and that they needed and wanted our help. I believe we should be paying more attention and giving greater effort to restoring higher education. These law students are the immediate future. When we met with them a week later, they had formed a protective association, a bus for transportation, found a disused grammar school for classes, and got their assistant dean to round up some professors who were teaching them. <br>
<br>
Still they need help and I am trying to get some help for them from our law schools. LSU has refused, Seton Hall and Rutgers have promised to help; I have not contacted Tulane, Loyola or Southern yet. <br>
<br>
Upon returning to Baghdad, I went to the Ministry of Justice to review the situation in the south. I took advantage of the situation and said the following: &quot;I have read a little of your history. I know you are a proud people who have risen from the ashes in the past, so I must tell you that I am saddened and disappointed. I have talked to hundreds of you over the past five weeks, almost everyone educated and privileged. What I have heard is what you want from us, how the Americans have to fix this and give you money and equipment, protect you from you own. The only adults planning on the future were those law students in Basra who had lost everything - their books, their desks, their records, their school. And they were doing something about it on their own. You need to do some of these things for yourselves. If you are depending on us to do everything, you are going to be sadly disappointed.&quot; <br>
<br>
I got a few nods from the judges, but the translator said to me: &quot;Thank you. I have been waiting for someone to tell them that.&quot; Our soldiers, God love them and keep them; they smiled every time I got a chance to talk to them. They want to come home, but I did not hear one word of complaint nor a question as to why they were there. This is boring, HOT, dirty, and dangerous work. They stand in 120 plus degrees in full body armor. They are amazing. Their entertainment was largely self-generated; boredom doesn't stop when they stand down. Write a letter, send a note or email; send a book, cd, tape, or magazine; do something. Thank you. <br>

<br>
However, I also feel that we didn't go to war for humanitarian purposes.  It would have been noble to have done so and I would have been more supportive of the war if that had been the case.  <br>
<br>
If we cared so much about the suffering of citizens under monsterous regimes, why aren't we in Sudan, Sierra Leone, Angola?  or Korea?  why weren't we in Rawaanda?  We are humanitarian when there is an economic interest which is appalling and quite disheartening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2135<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/30/03 11:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What you aren't seeing in the news about Iraq</span><hr size=1> Regardless of the reason we actually did it, if it achieves a noble end, why would you not support it?<br>
<br>
Personally, I believe noble reasons were involved, but were only a part of the whole picture.  I think we went for security  reasons as well (i.e. protecting our own asses).  I think the security reasons were likely dominant.<br>

<br>
Since you have admitted the security reasons were the dominant factors, and those exact same reasons have been proven to be lies by the Bush administration, I do not support it.<br>
<br>
I didn't believe the Bush administration statements when they made them before the invasion.  Many people questioned the facts.  Many of the facts presented were completely debunked before the invasion occurred.  The reliability of the Intelligence was questioned way back then, too.<br>
<br>
The Bush administration should not act surprised that they had bad Intelligence.  The rest of the world was telling him that since the very beginning.  Yet, regardless of the reliability of the information, he presented it to the public and pressed the case for war based entirely upon the threat of Saddam's mythical nuclear arsenal.  Yellow cake?  Debunked.  Research program?  Hasn't existed for a decade.  Nuclear devices?  Zero have been found.<br>
<br>
It isn't difficult to track nuclear weapon's from space.  The radiation and heavy metal content is so easily detected that hostpital radiological waste appears as a bright hot spot --- and that stuff is nothing compared to refined plutonium.<br>
<br>
Six months and zero weapons, zero plutonium, zero WMDs.  What does it take for you to believe he was intentionally lying from day one?  Please don't quote Rush Limbaugh on how hard it is to find a weapon in a country the size of Texas, and how he had ten years to hide them.  You forget he had to MANUFACTURE them first.<br>
<br>
The war for Iraq was not for humanitarian reasons.  The humanitarian spin didn't even start hitting the airwaves until March.  In my view, that spin was presented to quell the people who didn't believe the outrageous WMD claims. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammerique>Ammerique</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 578<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/1/03 11:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What you aren't seeing about Iraq</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Regardless of the reason we actually did it, if it achieves a noble end, why would you not support it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I commit crime and the outcome is noble, does that make it right?  If I go around robbing people's homes, but give it all to charity or the poor, does that mean everyone should support me.  The reasons we do things is the justifacation for support.  When the reasons are lies (and crimes), I refuse to honor the cause. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghaokogrady>Ghaok Ogrady</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/1/03 1:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What you aren't seeing in the news about Iraq</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Bush administration should not act surprised that they had bad Intelligence.

Again with the twisting of the facts...The rest of the world didnt doubt he had the weapons.The argument was about how he should be dealt with.<br>

<br>
That depends if, as a result, the &quot;victums&quot; of the crime wound up better off over all than before.<br>
<br>
So the question is this (or these):<br>
<br>
Are the Iraqi people better off than they were before the war took place?<br>
<br>
Will they be better off 5 years from now due to the fact the war took place?<br>
<br>
This is something we can argue but in the end, only the Iraqi people can answer.<br>

The rest of the world, and much of the American populace, doubted Saddam had nukes.  The American populace who doubted were called unpatriotic, and were told that they should trust Bush because he had sources of intelligence that the common public did not have.<br>
<br>
The &quot;evidence&quot; was being proven as contrived, artificial, manufactured, and outright lies from the very beginning.  The American populace was following their patriotic instincts and ignoring all of the evidence.  To doubt President Bush was to be &quot;with the terrorist&quot;.  Remember, they were either &quot;in support of Bush or they were supporting the terrorists&quot;.<br>

Religous Muslim Fanatics....you are being quite vague with that statement.  Are you trying to claim the Suni clerics even so much as disliked saddam?  Thats a very ignorant statement.  Those clerics all have different beliefs, but the problem lies not in their beliefs, its in their extremism.  <br>

Ok once i get off the floor i can make a statment on this.  Nothing to do with the war on terrorism?  Saddam has 3rd party links to Al Qaeda(Ansar Islam) first of all.  He contains tons of biological &amp; chemical weapons(Syria anyone?), is responsible for the deaths of a countless amount of innocent lives in Iraq, Kuwait, and Iran.  How does that by itself not make his regime a Terrorist State?  He also invaded Kuwait to get their ports &amp; oil and looks up to such great historical heroes such as Hitler &amp; Stalin.  I know all of this has been said over and over, but justification lies in the truth and you are obviously too stubborn to read through the propaganda.  Please no more remarks on Saddam's ex-regime being seperate from the war on terror, it just amplifies ignorance.<br>

And I will not bother to answer your unspoken, racist, between-the-lines argment, which I read as &quot;They're Arab, they hate us, and they have some nasty weapons.  So they are obviously terrorists (to one degree or another) and striking at them is a good thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Iraq was a distraction.  It completely took our attention away from the people who hit us on 9-11.  Who are still out there, btw.  Who are still planning to hit us again, btw.  The Iraq  war did NOTHING to cripple Al Qaeda, or even make them stumble, nor will it prevent them from attacking us again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=extburst>extburst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/1/03 5:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Um, </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Extburst/Tyym,<br>

Well, if you want to draw analogies, lets draw one closer to what happened.<br>
<br>
I'm a vilian.  I took over a house.  I killed anyone who complained.  I raped all the females in the house.  I took their money and build myself a few houses in other towns and bought a few shotguns.  The family in the house had to claw and scratch just to survive.  They couldn't complain or they'd be put in the basement or killed.<br>
<br>
You came along, came in and killed me.  In the process you killed 1 or 2 of the family members in the house.<br>
<br>
Pros: The family is now free.  A vilian is dead.<br>
<br>
Cons: Some inocent people died.<br>
<br>
Now, is the family better off than they were before?<br>

Your the one that came up with the analogy.  I was merely taking it and changing it to more closely fit what I think happened.  How you think I was off subject I don't know since it was your idea to begin with.<br>
<br>
I know you are drawing the analogy that the US is the criminal.  I say it isn't that simple.  My anology is closer in line what what we did in Iraq IMO.  To paint it as a crime automatically brings a response of &quot;it must be wrong&quot;.  It was a crime in the fact that innocent people died and in that you can paint all war as crimes.  However you can justify some wars as (in the end) creating more good than ill.  Our arguement is whether or not this war was justified.  I say it was because, in the end, the Iraqies are free from a brutal dictator.  You can use your simple analogy to paint the US as criminal but I say you can't do that and truely cover a complex situation like this.  Thus I came up with my own analogy.  To say you disagree with my anology is fine but you are blind if you can't see the point I was making with it.  And yes, it's very much on topic.<br>

I assume your talking to me but I can tell you you've misread what I've said.  I never called anyone unintelligent.  You should not equate being young with being unintelligent (I don't).  I was merely taking a guess at his age due to his stance on the subject.  I too, in my youth (I'm not really that old), got caught up in the whole &quot;relativity&quot; mumbo jumbo that I was spoon fed in college.  It's a falacy that everyone in the world is equal and that we are only different due to our own perspective (well, this is partially true).  Most people, when they grow older start to realize that, although it's PI, there really are bad guys and good guys in the world (to a certain extent).  You can paralize yourself with the notion that you have no right to talk ill of somebody else because you have skeletons in your closet.  That does not good but to lead to inaction in any situation.  It's better to have a sliding ruler on moral issues.  Accept and acknowledge your own faults while still recognizing somebody is clearly more wrong than you.<br>
