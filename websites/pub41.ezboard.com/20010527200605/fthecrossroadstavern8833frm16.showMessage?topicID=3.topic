<br>
LONG..PLEASE READ IT ALL BEFORE YOU HIT REPLY! <br>
This topic has been flamed and beaten to death 100s of thousands of times. Yet I'm pretty peeved at a post I saw today from some cleric trashing druids, and everyone joined in. <br>
<br>
First of all, too many people majorly confuse this issue. There's CHARGING FOR A PORT, there is not porting unless someone makes it worth your while, and then there's porting for donations. <br>
<br>
I think it's been stated before that druids who charge for ports are Lamers, asses, blah blah blah. I think it's been rebuffed before saying that with changing bindpoints (100 mana), zoning out with you (300 mana), gating back in (100 mana) and medding up, it's a SLIGHT inconvenience to do all this. Getting mana from a necro or chanter buffs is nice, but still, it's an inconvenience. At level 47 i have about 1700 mana. I just wasted 500, or 1/3 on moving you around. <br>
<br>
What if I am bound infront of my raid for tomorrow in Western Wastes, then made the run from wcomm to ecomm, to freeport to boat to camp Gornit for the night? So my slight inconvenience just became a MAJOR FREAKIN PAIN. So you throw me 10plat to compensate me? I just lost a 30plat, 5 minute spawn that still gives me exp!!!!!!!!! Call me greedy or rude or whatever, but my making *YOUR* life easier should not come at an inconvenience to me. It gets exponentially worse if I'm in a group. If i'm prime healer, it's even worse. You're taking time from an entire group because you NEED a port. <br>
<br>
Lets remember that you dont NEED a port, you'd LIKE a port. There is NO PLACE in "this world" you cant get to with running and boats. NO PLACE. Please remember that to enhance YOUR gameplay, you should be willing to give something. <br>
<br>
I am all for porting people when i'm going that way. I'll often burn the extra 150 mana to take a hitcher if it's a zone i need to get to. I told an example last night of a necro screaming for a port paying 50p for 10 minutes in burning woods. I ended my night and told him that i'd take him, he ran to me. he got there and i simply said "50p isnt necessary". Grouped and ported him. He thanked me and was quite gracious. However, he didnt even offer me the "customary" 15p which i woulda turned down. He also didnt offer all those "mana dumps" everyone says they give out all the time. <br>
<br>
So now, explain the incentive to do this again? I now have to get back to where i was fighting, as I am fighting there tonight. I am not bound there. Luckily i can port to dreads, sow, invis and levi and run for 5-6 minutes to get back there. But once I do, i have to med up for 15-20 min. Remember that porting to dreads is a 300 mana port(edit-this is no longer true), i just ported him for 300 mana .. and i had just finished fighting, so i was already low on mana. So i am oom, need to med up for 2-3 minutes to get 300 mana to port back to dreads to med up for buffs to run to burning woods to sit and med to be able to fight. WHY do i want to port people? <br>
<br>
I dont /anon and i dont /role. I also politely decline 99.9% of the random tells i get. I sometimes even /tell the person who's shouting for 15 minutes that i'm not being rude, i just CANT port them for reasons x, y and z. <br>
<br>
BUT, getting back to why i started this ... compensation for services is something you should anticipate doing each and every time you get a service. OMG! How many people (non porters/ressers) have said "Put NPC Ressers and SoWers in the game and make them like 500p or something so they are available ... but people still prefer to use the PCs". I've seen that post 100s of times. You are willing to dump 500p into the vast wasteland, but wont give a fellow player 50p or 100p for the SAME THING? <br>
<br>
And also remember that as your level, and ESPECIALLY the level of the service provider increases, you should consider increasing your compensation. When I can spend an entire night in BW and get 1-2 bubs of exp and maybe 50-100 plat in loot and coin .. why should i take time to port you? Remember we play this game to have fun, get experience, get loot and get coin. When we get to help people out, that's an aside bonus. <br>
<br>
Likewise, I always, always make sure i have 50plat on me for a 49 res. That's the going price on my server. I always offer it. If i'm in a bad situation, i offer 100p for the cleric to come to me (Died in Neriak, bound in Velious, friend found a cleric in EComm, so we offered 50p for the res and 50p for the inconvenience of zoning to get me). Some people take it some dont. I give it graciously, because i've been given a tremendous benefit. First, i got back the experience i spent so much time getting. Second, If i am in other zones, i saved time getting to my corpse. I get a service, i compensate for it. Period, end of rant. <br>
<br>
And while 10 or 15p made porting worth while at 29 and 34, at 47 for me, it's not "worth" it. I rather get my experience, and get my loot. that isnt greedy folks, that is why we *ALL* play the game. OMG think about it, you want the port so YOU can go get your experience and loot faster. WHY should I be different? You dont NEED THAT PORT because you just love to move from zone to zone. You need it get to raid, to get to a group, to get to a dungeon, to get to the bank to do a transaction, etc. Sure, there's the random "Corpse Recovery" .. but i've been duped 3 times with that. Person put his gear in backpacks, told me it was the CR run, then when we got there, geared up in front of me! 3 times 3 different people. Tell me why i need to port you again. <br>
<br>
This rant will go on forever, and there'll be flamers all the time. People will bitch at the need to pay or donate for ports and resses constantly. They'll call the ones that do it bad, they'll cheer the ones that dont. The druids who never charge for ports will condemn the ones that do. We'll defend our time and services, you'll defend your right to get a port. All i ask is before you freak out and flame, think. Think about what you are getting and what it is worth to you. If i'm moving you and 1/10th the speed you could travel for by your self, and you're a level 40+ whatever going on a raid or dungeon crawl, dont TELL me you dont think it was worth more than 15p to move you there. If you had to take the boat, missed your raid, and found out that BP dropped, it woulda been worth a LOT MORE than 15p, wouldnt it. Lost opportunity my friends, is worth a lot more than 15p. <br>
<br>
Be considerate when you ask for ports, and be considerate when you ask for resses. accept the no's and apprecaite the yesses. Offer something in terms of compensation equal to your level, the level of the porter, and time saved. If you did that, there'd be a lot more druids non-anon and willing to move your stank troll butt <br>

<br>
Sometimes I take there money and sometimes I don't, a group port doesn't cost much mana wise to me anymore, about 1/2 a bubble I think.  I have to be in the &quot;mood&quot; to port someone, if im not in the mood to take a trip i'm not going and there is no amount of money that will change that.  Someone offered me 200pp once, even put it in a trade window and I still didn't take it.<br>
<br>
I bought those spells for me, and no one else.  There isn't a person on this planet the &quot;diserves&quot; a port anywhere.  If people don't like that tuff, I don't run around expecting tanks to kill my mobs, clerics to res me, wizards to nuke, shamans to dot, necros to fear, etc without at least sharing the exp on the kill for compensation.  Now any of those types that think I'm around to be there personal savior are gonna be in for a big suprise, I have no problem watching someone die right in front of me.  If I feel like lending a hand I will but if I don't, don't get all huffy and puffy cause you didn't get your way.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty burnt out with people asking me for stuff, be it sow, heals, buffs, or TP's.  Now it's like druid rings are nothing more than druid traps, filled with people that need something or can't handle a mob, etc.  I'm no one's personal savior and the spells I have are mine, not community property.  It amazes me when someone expects me to help them out for no reason.  Compensation isn't really an issue for me.  I got enough money I don't need anyone else's.<br>
<br>
It's usually the people that never played a druid that whine the most about us not giving them something.  So, after much hard deliberation I have hardend myself to not helping anyone, and god forbid I sow myself at a druid ring.  If I cast a spell I get 10 tells asking for some kind of buff or &quot;a favor&quot;.  It's crazy.  I already take enough requests from my guild mates, now someone I don't even know want's something from me as well... sheesh<br>

I also turn down about 90% of requests (also almost never anon or /role) because I can't be bothered because 90% of the time I'm not near a druid ring and not near my bind point.  Talk about a waste of my time.  The only consistent exceptions (for strangers) are 35+ clerics if it's at all possible.<br>
<br>
But no, I don't do CR ports (unless offered a lot of plat)...I figure if they had to run back just one time they'll get the idea that perhaps they should get a bind before they go hunting (it's rare that you're killed on the way to get a bind).</font><P>Binnen Minder<br>
