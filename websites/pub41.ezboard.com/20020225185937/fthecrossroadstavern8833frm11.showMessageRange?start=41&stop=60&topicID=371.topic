The guy comes out weeks later to post that Mono shouldn't be trusted around no drop items in raids, and can't just shut up and leave it alone. IF you know Mono, Rake, you would have a total different point of view on this. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
This forum is for bottom feeders and the day I saw this forum was the day I posted on it. You seem clueless that what he did was wrong. The more you post, the more I learn about your character and so does everyone else. I won’t trust him around me and I’m sure a lot of people will keep a close eye on him after reading what he did. This was my first meeting with Monoxcide, what view should I have? I’m sure Monoxcide would like this matter closed, must be terribly embarrassing but like I said before, you keep making these inaccurate statements and I will keep responding to them. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Point is Mono isn't the boogeyman you tried to play him out to be, didn't acquire the spell from that kill, and has alot of people that can vouch for his character. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
All I did was state what happened. You sure are having a hard time grasping this. Maybe you should let Monoxcide defend himself. You’re not doing a very good job of it. <p>NO! Dont pull the %T...... <br>

<br>
Paladins will lay hands as a last resort in almost every situation to save themselves or another.  They don't burn it just because they have it up.  SKs will HT something to finish a kill that they do not think they would win otherwise or to save someone for dying.  Both of these things are very noble when done for another.<br>
<br>
In this case if the information is correct...he HT the mob in question.  If he did that, he intended to try to KS.  Either way he was in the wrong seeing that they did not need saving or his help.  It all goes back to the fact that if you don't want to be accused of KSing someone, then don't give them the fuel to do it.<br>

<br>
What mono did wrong: Killed something he was only trying to help with becuase he was bored and then checked the corpse.<br>
(LOOKS bad)<br>
<br>
What you did wrong: Called Mono a theif and liar without proof or trying to resolve it thru guild channels.  You came here and posted on a board that can very easily ruin reputations and called him the worst kind of EQ scum there is.  You can see by the support he is getting that he is well thought of, you should have resolved it thru guild channels of the flame board if nothing else.<br>
<br>
This board should be used with proof, read all the other posts out here and see if most poeple are coming to aid or are adding fuel to the flame, now look what is happening here.  I really think you should post an apology here becuase it is you who brought the issue here and blew it out of porportion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukronx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kronx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 11:00:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/FatesDecree/images/Train.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Be careful if MonoxCide comes into your camp</span><hr size=1> /realizes this tread was only feigning death<br>

I know you won't.  This guy is the guy that did something wrong not Knar, tell him to post here and set things straight and THAT will end this thread.  He does have alot of supporters but that doesn't make him immune from catching a lil flack for what he did, and you all know it was a little sketchy for someone to do that.  And how can Knar know for sure if the spell was on him?  He can't , EVER.  So that's pretty fucked up imo and to add salt to the wound he was heard braggin over guildchat that he KS'ed, WTF is that?  Call that &quot;punking&quot; if you want to but I call that acting like a bitch!  How is someone showing up in camp and HT'ing a mob before the original campers could realize what was going on &quot;punking&quot; someone?  Seems to me he &quot;punked&quot; himself.  Now, if Knar had known he was coming and what he was planning and then he KS'ed then maybe.....well no still not &quot;punking&quot; someone.  I don't see how anyone can be &quot;punked&quot; in a game.../shrug.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again, for the people that think Knar is wrong for keeping this going, quit posting inaccurate bullshit for him to respond to.  I don't care how far up this guy's ass you are, stop.  Word to ya mutha.<br>

This forum is for listing bottom feeders, scammers etc on our server. 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
So .. define bottom feeder?  Scum of the earth?  Someone who eats gargbage from the floor?  Someone disgusting?  Someone that has earned said name due to his disgusting actions.<br>
<br>
Scammers?  K .. pretty self explanitory.<br>
<br>
So lets look at what happened here.<br>
<br>
2 Sk's camp a spell.  It's not an exp camp.  It's not a faction camp.  It's for an item.  Their only reason from being at said location is for an item to drop.<br>
<br>
So ... an uninvited person gets in the frey when the mob finally pops, and not only helps kill it to get to the end result, the item, but think's it's kinda cool that he outdamaged 2 people, 1 that is 2 levels higher than him.  He looks at the corpse, see's the robe rather than the spell (it's either or, not both, or it was whenever I camped the fucking thing) .. and leaves.<br>
<br>
Then we decide to call him a bottom feeder.<br>
<br>
Why again?  Cause he did what?  Hmmm .. didnt get the spell .. know that is fact cause the robe dropped.  The fact you didnt go for the robe means, hmm, jack to this story.  Robe or Spell.  You got Robe, not spell.  And he didnt take the robe.  So that means he didnt take anything.<br>
<br>
So what was the end result?  3 people kill a mob, 1 gets a hardon cause he outdamges 2, and the camp continues.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I get bottom feeder out of that.<br>
<br>
So the end result is Mono didnt take anything .. mono didnt steal your exp .. mono didnt take your camp.  All mono did was beat you.<br>
<br>
If we're gonna beat a dead horse, beat it the right way .. <br>
<br>
If you wanna whine like a fucking baby, go camp Lodizal and have Brom KS you .. after all, he admits he does it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And he swears that next KS shield is mine!<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt; So lets look at what happened here. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Stop right there shorty. I posted what happened. You were not there so stop making assumptions about what you think happened. And for you information, the last 4 times I have killed the Mal the robe, spell and brains droped just like it did after Monoxcide the Kser left the scene. &gt;&gt; Hmmm .. didnt get the spell .. know that is fact cause the robe dropped. &lt;&lt; Doh! Doh! Doh! Doh! /em Rexronn inserts bid smelly foot in mouth.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; If you wanna whine like a fucking baby, go camp Lodizal and have Brom KS you .. after all, he admits he does it  And he swears that next KS shield is mine! &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads up, If Brorn or Monoxcide are near my camp I will keep it mind that they might be there to Ks.<br>
<br>
Lyltigr<br>
&gt;&gt; What you did wrong: Called Mono a theif and liar without proof or trying to resolve it thru guild channels. You came here and posted on a board that can very easily ruin reputations and called him the worst kind of EQ scum there is. You can see by the support he is getting that he is well thought of, you should have resolved it thru guild channels of the flame board if nothing else. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
/sigh I did nothing wrong. People need to be warned about players like Monoxcide. It was Monoxcide not me that is in the wrong so there is no need to attempt turning Monoxcides bad deeds in my direction. It truly reflects poorly on you. Monoxcide owes you and everyone else that stuck up for him while he kept silent an apology. <br>
<br>
I don’t see a lot of people coming to his defense since they found out that he actually did Ks.  I do see a lot of inaccurate crap being posted attempting to justify his actions. Why you 3 keep posting for him his beyond me. If he is of such high moral fiber and good character he would have posted in his own defense.  Its obvious you have been mislead (scamed LOL)  or are making poor assumptions about a person that has very poor judgment. <br>
<br>
The only reason I got an apology from Monoxcide was because of this thread. I got my apology, Monoxcide’s dark side was revealed and some of his buds are left with their foot in their mouths. After you found out what he did you should have just shut up instead of grasping at excuse after excuse trying to justify his actions. Let it die, you make yourselves look poorly supporting what he did. He sent me a tell apologizing and I am sure he wishes this to die. Stop giving it life by making stupid inaccurate statements.<br>

1. Everyone defending him After finding out that Mono did ks you has said the ks was wrong.They are defending his character.<br>
<br>
But demanding apologies on a public board for a simple ks of a green mob. Now that's just pathetic all this drama for nothing.<br>
<br>
  If Mono was this evil bastard you said he was.Don't you think he would have had it scribed ten seconds later after he gated out. I think he would have had taken the robe also because that's what evil ks'ing lootwhore pondscum does.<br>
<br>
  Seriously did he send you a tell saying thanks for the spell and if you ever need a summon  to send him a tell. No he said it didn't drop  and he logged.<br>
<br>
As for him saying stuff in guildchat  about him ks'ing 2 sk's. So what! if he had said he ks'ed and looted the spell. Then he would have been guildremoved on the spot.<br>
<br>
He didn't take your spell (his spell book was checked) and  he left the robe  all he did was ks a green mob from you.( yes wrong ) But to try to completely ruin a person's reputation over this is just sad. I hope you feel good that you degraded a person's public reputation.<br>
<br>
And since he has apologized  to you for ks'ing your grass snake. Now you should give him a apology for doing your best to drag his name through the mud over a 2p spell(that didnt drop) from a green mob in a green dungeon.<br>
Next time something like this happens to you think about going thru the proper guild to resolve issues.<br>
(Following is not sarcastic) sorry this happened to you from a member from a member of OOH at the time.<br>

Final post on the subject from me:<br>
<br>
Mono is a good guy and no one should have any reservations about grouping with him, you can see he is not totally liked by everyone but even those who he doesn't get along with have come to his aid.  <br>
<br>
Those that do like him think this thread is an injustice to him and if anyone has any problems w/ OoH members, we wish you would go through guild channels before posting damamging comments in this forum.. this could have been resolved very easily, but as things stand now.. anyone who just glances at the names in the titles will be prejudiced against him, and that's not a fair thing to put on someone when you don't have proof and havn't tried to get any. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uarnesto88.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arnesto88</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/02 2:09:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Be careful if MonoxCide comes into your camp</span><hr size=1> lmao at these whining young children posting on this thread.<br>

Have known mono for sometime, whether he did this or not I don't know, frankly dont care.  Monoxcide is not a loot whore or anything else like that, he will always be welcome in my groups. <p><center><img src="http://orderofhasson.com/members/arnesto_sig1.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uknar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Knar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/02 4:33:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Be careful if MonoxCide comes into your camp</span><hr size=1> I want to put an end to this thread as well but you peps from OOH keep coming back with inaccurate statements. I realize this reflects poorly on your guild but he did leave right after this happened. I have grouped many times with OOH members (In my opinion, you have great people in the guild) and that is why I didn’t think twice when Monoxicide showed up in our camp. I was thinking about looking for the OOH boards and post it there but I left your guild out of this because I new he was no longer in it. I’m not trying to be rude but I don’t need OOH permission to post here. <br>
<br>
Monoxcide never apologized until after I posted here. I sent him a tell immediately after this happened ( had 45 minutes to kill ). He was anything but apologetic. Monoxcide only inflamed the situation with his belligerent tells. He was a jerk. I guess I have to excuse this because he was drunk? Later, when I found out that he had bragged about getting the spell (not Ksing us) and confronted him with it, he logged. He didn’t say that’s not true, that he didn’t say that, he simply said I’m logging. Yes I did keep checking to see if he was on for days after but he never was. <br>
<br>
The information that he does not have the spell is incorrect. I know for a fact he had the spell before this thread began. How did you people even know to check for the spell before this thread? If you checked after this thread started then u didn’t check very closely. Stop going there, it starting to smell fishy.<br>
<br>
The mobs we were camping were not green. But that does not matter just more crap information. Since a few patches ago, that spell has dropped along with the robe and brains the last 4 times I have killed it. Although his actions were totally suspicious, you people from OOH want me to take the word of Monoxcide that he didn’t get that spell, that this time it did not drop. I am not going to take the word of Monoxcide after what he did and said. Has far has I’m concerned, anyone that would take the actions that Monoxcide did is untrustworthy. Posting what happened is not &gt;&gt; trying to completely ruin a person’s reputation.&lt;&lt;  The person’s actions will ruin their reputation.<br>
<br>
Monoxcide’s rep isn’t ruined. He doesn’t even care enough to post here. &gt;&gt; They are defending his character. &lt;&lt; Being sarcastic is not defending a persons character. Trying to demean me and what happened is shameful behavior and reflects poorly on you. The honor of OOH is not tied to Monoxcide so give it a rest. <br>
