<br>
<br>
A new disease has broke out in our nation. It's not one that can be cured by anti-<br>
<br>
bodies or by chicken soup. It's called I.A.D. or Internet Addiction Disorder. It's not <br>
<br>
lethal, but it is damaging and it is a real issue that causes real problems. This new disease <br>
<br>
can not be dismissed. It will not go away and the problems will only get bigger.<br>
<br>
Internet Addiction Disorder is an addiction to online usage. Online usage pertains <br>
<br>
to online chat rooms, message boards, auctions, games, e-mail, newsgroups, <br>
<br>
MUDs[Multi-User Dungeons], and even the organization of downloaded information. <br>
<br>
This new disorder was just recently recognized as an addiction. The first known papers <br>
<br>
on the subject used the phrase &quot;Pathological Internet Use.&quot; Dr. Kimberly Young, an <br>
<br>
assistant professor of psychology at the university of Pittsburg at Bradford, was the first <br>
<br>
professional to coin the phrase in a presentation of a major medical paper at an annual <br>
<br>
convention of the American Psychological Association in Chicago. With the presentation <br>
<br>
of her research the APA began to classify execessive internet use as addictive, just as some <br>
<br>
eating disorders, drugs, gambling, and video games can become addictions. <br>
<br>
There is certain criteria that must be met to be considered to be a person with <br>
<br>
Internet Addiction Disorder. This criteria is prescribed by the American Psychiatric <br>
<br>
Association. These symptoms are as follows. A tolerance to the net has built up: meaning <br>
<br>
that there is a need to spend more and more time on the internet to recieve the same <br>
<br>
satisfaction as once met by a predetermined amount of time spent on the internet and/or a <br>
<br>
diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of time on the internet. There <br>
<br>
must be two or more withdrawal symptoms recognizable after two days to a month after a <br>
<br>
reduction of internet use or quitting cold turkey. Withdrawal symptoms can be and <br>
<br>
include tembling, anxiety, obsessive thinking about what is happening on the internet, and <br>
<br>
voluntary and involuntary typing movements of the fingers. Another symptom of I.A.D. is <br>
<br>
to use the internet as a way to avoid withdrawal symptoms. To end up using the internet <br>
<br>
more often, or for longer periods of time than was intended is also a symptom. A very <br>
<br>
detremental symptom would be that an would individual risk the loss of a sgnificant job, <br>
<br>
relationship, educational or career opportunity because of excessive internet use. Meaning <br>
<br>
that some people would rather chat online with anonymous people than try and save their <br>
<br>
marrige or keep their job or go to school.<br>
<br>
On a more broad level of understanding I.A.D. it is sensible to talk about <br>
<br>
&quot;Cyberspace Addiction&quot; or and addiction to an internet supported virtual realm that is <br>
<br>
created by types of computer engineering. This is a very broad category with many sub-<br>
<br>
categories or subtypes with differences. A man staying up for hours trying to win the bid <br>
<br>
in an online auction may be very different than a business woman constantly checking <br>
<br>
online stock quotes which in turn may be very different than a teenager skipping school to <br>
<br>
reach that next level or kill one more person in that online game. There are online <br>
<br>
addictions that fulfill social needs, some are more oriented toward competition, and some <br>
<br>
are just extensions of an already existent workaholic addiction. These differences are very <br>
<br>
distinct. Or, &quot;...these differences may be superficial.&quot; John Suler Phd. a psycholigist came <br>
<br>
up with these ideas and I concur completely with his findings.<br>
<br>
To go into one of these subtypes of &quot;Cyberspace Addiction&quot; is to understand or <br>
<br>
come to the realization of an addiction to the internet. One such example is a MUD or <br>
<br>
Multi-User Dungeon. A MUD is a text based role playing game that people can interact <br>
<br>
with others on the net. The MUD has come a long way since the beginning days. Now <br>
<br>
people play MMORPGs or Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games. These <br>
<br>
MMORPGs are far beyond any MUD. These internet games stimulate the mind with <br>
<br>
vibrant background textures, complex manipulative modules, and animated characters, <br>
<br>
along with an indepth game play to entertain endlessly. <br>
<br>
One of the more popular MMORPGs out today is called EverQuest. The basics of <br>
<br>
the game are as follows. You create a character of fantasy. You have several different <br>
<br>
races to choose from. Ranging from an elf to a lizard-human hybrid. After you choose <br>
<br>
your race you choose your class, or your main function of the game. These choices vary <br>
<br>
also from a warrior type that fights in close combat with monsters and villans to a priest <br>
<br>
like type that helps other players by giving medical aid. Once you have created your <br>
<br>
character you get to name him/her. This is where the game develops the foundation of <br>
<br>
addiction. You have created a person, an anonymous personality where you can control it <br>
<br>
to act out or do what you want in a world that exists only in the computer realm with <br>
<br>
seemingly no ramifiications. You then walk about a virtual world interacting with others <br>
<br>
around the real life world in med-evil situations such as fighting dragons and killing <br>
<br>
wolves and bears. Objectivity of the game is in and to itself the players choice. Whether it <br>
<br>
is to become the most powerful warrior or the most widely known helper there is no <br>
<br>
wrong way to play. And there is no real way to lose.<br>
<br>
To understand how a game like this can become so addictive you have to know <br>
<br>
what a persona needs to live and be happy. Abraham Maslow, a psychologist who <br>
<br>
popularized psychological humanism, came up with a &quot;Hierarchy of Needs.&quot; These needs <br>
<br>
are Physilogical needs or biological needs such as oxygen, food, water, warmth, and so <br>
<br>
forth. Safety needs, which is basically the need to feel safe. Affection or blongingness <br>
<br>
needs or the need to not be lonely or alienated and to give and recieve love. Esteem needs <br>
<br>
or a need to have self-respect, respect from others in order to feel satisfied. And Self-<br>
<br>
actualization needs or a need to become what you feel is what you should do, or a calling <br>
<br>
if you will.<br>
<br>
This game, EveryQuest, allows you to fulfill all of these needs in a real life setting <br>
<br>
except for the physilogical need because you can not get food from your computer and it <br>
<br>
does not give you oxygen or water to drink. However, while you are playing your <br>
<br>
character in the game you are responsible with keeping him/her alive with food and water. <br>
<br>
In fact you can even indulge your real life habits such as drinking alcohol while in the <br>
<br>
game. The effects are the same in the game as they are in real life too, adding to the <br>
<br>
realism of the game. The other needs are met by playing the game and going in depth into <br>
<br>
your character. You yourself become the character. You could be a mild mannered <br>
<br>
mouse of a man in real life, but once you log on as your beastly warrior character on line <br>
<br>
you can be transformed into a boitstrous giant of a man. Your persona can change <br>
<br>
immensely. You can gain the respect online you lack in real life or gain friendships with <br>
<br>
other made up characters you don't posses amongst your peers at school or work. You <br>
<br>
can attain a sense of belonging, your self esteem can be boosted tremendously, and you <br>
<br>
have the chance to self-actualize. To be what you really want to be.<br>
<br>
These are the ways this game becomes addictive. These are not the only ways it <br>
<br>
becomes an addiction. These are only a few. And just as easy as this subtype of <br>
<br>
&quot;CyberSpace Addiction&quot; is an addiction so are the others.<br>
<br>
There are still those that do not believe that I.A.D. is an actual addiction. Ivan <br>
<br>
Goldberg, a psychiatrist, believes that it may be a disoder, but not an addiction. &quot;If you <br>
<br>
expand the concept of addiction to include everything people can overdo, then you must <br>
<br>
talk about people being addicted to books, addicted to jogging, addicted to other people&quot;, <br>
<br>
said Goldberg. I strongly disagree with his synopsis of the whole thing. The relationship <br>
<br>
formed with your computer and even more so with your internet usage can not be <br>
<br>
compared to loosing yourself in a book or getting a runner's high from jogging. These <br>
<br>
things do not fulfill enough of the needs that we as humans have. You can develop an <br>
<br>
entirely new life in cyberspace that can be better than the one you live everyday. That in <br>
<br>
itself could become addictive. <br>
<br>
Internet Addiction Disorder is a valid addiction. It is a part of a growing phase of <br>
<br>
technical communication that is not going to go away anytime soon. It is going to <br>
<br>
continue to grow until the whole world is engulfed by cyberspace and everyone has the <br>
<br>
chance to dabble in it.  <br>
