These are the things I like and dislike:<br>
<br>
LIKE: <br>
<br>
1. The world in general. The world is not too large and not too small. Every area has its unique look and creates a new atmosphere for players. The character models, colours, effects, 3D graphics, and graphical environments can not get any better in a game IMO.<br>
<br>
2. The community. Although there are some immature players that cause headaches during your adventures, most of the players on EQ are kind and mature. The community is very interactive, and the messaging system is very flexible. This goes for character searching, zone searching, player messaging, guild communication, ect.<br>
<br>
3. The cities are very realistic towards that race. I love the cities in EQ.<br>
<br>
DISLIKES: <br>
<br>
1. The spawning system. I will get very deep in this part as its the most irritating. Waiting in a certain spot for a certain MOB to spawn is very very boring, but in most cases it is necessary to improve your character. I used to play an MMORPG called &quot;The Realm&quot; in which different areas RANDOMLY spawned RANDOM monsters from that typical locations monster list. The RANDOM factor also stayed in place when items were dropped and found. The big boss might not drop that holy sword, but his adversary just might. This is like in Diablo, where items are random. Even with all this randomness, boss monsters could still be most sought after, since they will have more of a chance to drop a more powerful item. Or, like in Diablo, a rare monster always dropped some sort of magical item, but the RANDOM factor still took place into how good it will be.<br>
<br>
2. The adventuring aspect. Most classes require being grouped with a fair sized party to explore and fight in almost every area. This is very boring also, as you must take time (sometimes 1-2 hours) looking for a group. This especially takes place in the level 50-60 range. Every character, except for a select few, absolutely NEED to group with not only a full group of 6, but with specific classes in that group. This could take VERY long. Even after forming your group, you must wait for them to travel 1 hour across the world to get to you, only to find out one of them fell asleep now. I want a game where solo'ing is very attainable, but grouping will achieve the most rewards in the deepest and darkest areas.<br>
<br>
3. Kill stealing. Plain and simple. Once a MOB has been hit by a player or group, it should be flagged accordingly and if that MOB ever happens to die within your range, you will be rewarded with its kill. Also, there should be yell/help command that will &quot;de-flag&quot; your target and allow other player characters and NPC characters to attack and kill your target. If an NPC attacks and kills it, then no one is rewarded. If someone &quot;deflags&quot; their target and others jump in the frey, the one or group who did the most damage gets the kill. <br>
<br>
4. Faction. It takes WAY too long to even achieve something you wanted. I personally think faction should be taken right out of any MMORPG. If you are a Human, you should ALWAYS be killed on sight by dark elves, and vice-versa. Faction is just something put into a game to waste someones time.<br>
<br>
5. I would like to see something new in the player to player economy of &quot;trade.&quot; In EQ you must spend lots of time going through different zones auctioning items. I would like to see some sort of Trading Merchant that will take your item and hold it for you, while other players can click a button and see items in the Tradeing Merchants list, and your starting auction price. Just like...Ebay.<br>
<br>
6. The level 50-60 game in EQ. This is the most terrible experience. I must spend 1-2 hours finding a group. Spend 4-5 hours killing the same monsters non stop to gain a little bit of experience and money. When a group of people or guild does a raid, I must give my whold day to the raid. Being a melee class you can not teleport/bind/cast any spell of sort. So when you raid in a place that is teleport only, there is a big problem. All in all, I just HATE player reliability. A player should be able to do things independantly, because players are not always going to be there when you need them, so your stuck.<br>
<br>
This about wraps it up, hope you get some ideas from this.<br>

About everything, the way teamwork is used in this game and how no one can really be a &quot;hero&quot; in this game.<br>
<br>
DISLIKES:<br>
<br>
Staying up 24/7 just to lvl up and raid.  Takes too damn long.  Another thing is the pathing, jeez you'd think Verant would grasp the concept of simple math like the shortest distance between 2 points is a straight line and not 10 circles.  The way they manage their servers is just crap.  <br>

Now, I realize that i only started playing after two expansions, but still the game is massive. So, I have to congratulate VI for such an enormously well done job at making the whole game work and putting so much history and depth into it.<br>
<br>
My personal likes are:<br>
1. The enormous complexity of the game (did I mention that?)<br>
2. The large choice of classes and race combinations<br>
3. Lots of things to do while playing your character, ie....grouping, soloing, questing for items,etc... as people have stated above it can take hours to get a group together, but why not spend some of that time getting items for a quest?? I think too many people get stuck into the EXPERIENCE, let's kill mobs mindset and forget about the other parts of the game.<br>
4. All the people that I have met in game...I love online games, and in EQ i have met so many great people, and its easy to chat bout lots of things not necessarily game related (especially on long, boring camps). Hard to do that in lots of other online games.<br>
<br>
Dislikes:<br>
1. This was mentioned above, the spawns...the way mobs spawn and their drops leads to farming for good items. I am a firm believer in questing, and I think mobs that drop quest items shouldnt drop them unless someone in group attacking the mob has done part of the quest, e.g. talked to the npc that starts the quest. I think this would help reduce farming, cause you just couldnt get some items without questing for them (which alot of people dont do anyway cause it takes away time that they could be earning PHAT EXPerience). Nor could some dr00d just camp the spawn for plat (would also reduce twinkage too). Also, items NEED to have some way of decaying, e.g. swords break, armor falls apart in battle, robes get torn or burnt... the chance should be VERY small, but it should happen occasionally. Certain items could be immune to this (epics) but it would help improve the game economy. I would love to be able to see a lvl 4 twink break an exe axe simply because he didnt know how to swing it properly! (hint: chance of breaking during use depends upon appropriate skill level). This would also be greatly more realistic.<br>
<br>
I have no inherent objection to camping for loot to sell for plat, so that you save up some plat. I like the fact that there is an in-game economy. Personally, as my character is an enchanter, I enjoy playing the merchant occasionally to sell my crafted trinkets. I also dont mind twinking (hey, I've done it and will do it again), but there should be some changes to help improve the economy (and the warrens loot rule is a bust for that) and also to make questing a more integral part of the game. As it is now, you can just buy almost everything you need, or camp for it, probably without ever questing until you reach your epic.<br>

It is a social game after all and some of the best times are at a camp.  Traveling in EQ is a major hassle IMO and pretty dangerous too.<br>
<br>
I also like the fact that it gives people a common basis for discussions of humor, storytelling, tactics, etc. outside the game.  I love surfing the web and reading funny stories, the comics like Ding and Evercrest.  <br>
<br>
I like the way the magic system works, the way you have to think about what spells to load for what situation.  I like the way equipment is detailed and a 2hs is good for one situation vs a 1hs or dual wielding.<br>
<br>
I think the biggest thing that I dislike about the game is the difficulty of some of the raids.  Not that it can't be done but the way it has to be handled.  For instance, fear breaks where all camp because of the long range death touchs.  Doing things to accomplish something that makes you remove yourself from the game itself lessens the immersive experience.<br>
<br>
I dislike that EQ is bound to the internet.  Would be nice if it were ethernet and everyone had a couple of hubs at the house you could plug into a nationwide network.  Can you tell I am on dial up?</font><P>Herder

My primary dislikes are:<br>
<br>
1.  Typically, melee types have to bind so far away from anything.<br>
<br>
2.  The time it takes to get anything accomplished... i.e. raids, camps.  I love the social aspects, but I have trouble devoting 8 hours at a time to a game.<br>
