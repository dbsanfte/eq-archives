break-in got jacked. CR by Monkey and Co. kept getting interrupted by some fuck named Fright and his buttbuddy Dread doing 20,000 hps love taps, cross zone, what the fuck. the guides about the plane across the web are complete pos.<br>
<br>
anyways. the point of this post -<br>
<br>
to thank Caer Cadarn, Promethian Order, Sacred Fires, En Medias Res, In Virtue, Endless, for tagging and bailing us out =). body count at one point was somewhere in the high 80's. hell even Gm-Brettan showed up to check out the action.<br>
<br>
my gratitude goes to to fucking every single one of you beyond words in helping out our 8 hour CR. some names i can remember off the top of my head from the night - pardon the spelling - Gaelee, Supacheal, Deck, Medoc, Ryoko, Keadaian, Alyen, Cure, Borka, Yugi, Oaklanbash, Buyaodawo (ChahDianDaSi =), and the endless guys that helped in the morning - <br>
<br>
what a fucking nightmare. and at the same time a fucking relief - so thanks, so much, everyone! - =) <br>

Thanks to GM-Admin Bretton (sp?) for entertaining us for a while there at the portal. <br>
<br>
I'd leave this on the members board, but I think Divide deserves more =P.<br>
<br>
Thank you Divide for sticking it out, Thanks for logging me in and getting my sorry ass rezed a few times, and for logging in Este who I managed to die with a few times aswell. I had to quit at 3:30.. partially because I had to get up at 7:30 (I can't believe I managed to get into work..).<br>
<br>
Thanks for dying god knows how many times =P (Except I think Eeepers killed you in that category, what did he finish with.. 23 deaths?, that single handedly beat my 22 total planar deaths..). <br>
<br>
Its nice to see that so many guilds will come to the rescue when we feck up badly, I think people may be giving less credit to this server then it deserves. So a big /hug to all those that came out (ones Divide missed that I can remember: Methodor, Tumtum, ugh cant remember only 4 hours of sleep couldn't even remember my login.) hope we repay the favour some day.<br>

Fear can go really, really bad. The worst Fear run in history, I think, was like the third run on my old server. I had just hit 46 with my warrior about an hour before the raid started, and I decided to sit it out. Best decision I ever made.<br>
<br>
Roughly 5 groups zoned in and started running towards north wall camp spot behind fire wall. Right about the time everyone is halfway there, pretty much everyone goes LD, and is of course slaughtered.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a server problem (as everyone assumed), but some huge backbone router somewhere blew up. About 4 hours later, about 2/3 of the people could get back in. The other 1/3 couldn't get back on for almost 20 hours.<br>
<br>
This was also right after Vertan announced a hard-line &quot;no guides/gms will even enter the planes&quot; policy, so there was no help coming from the useless fucking guides.<br>
<br>
The server was so new that there *weren't* any people to come bail us out. It was Monday before the bodies were recovered.<br>
<br>
The final count was over 800 deaths, five people lost all their gear, nearly everyone lost at least one level (A druid friend went from 50th to 46th).<br>
<br>
Fortunately, a GM had pity and restored the gear to all the ppl who lost it all. Nobody got their xps back.<br>
<br>

The agro range is so large in fear, but even with only one enchanter, it was just hectic, not lethal.<br>

<br>
It would all depend on my initial resists once I got to the safe spot.  I think the agro can be trimmed down some by only having one person there and focusing on just keeping myself in a corner.  The problem would be runners of course.  <br>
<br>
Another big thing would be if the golems are up and how agro is distributed for DT's.  That would be a show stopper.<br>

Nothing ever forgets you, and the aggro continues to spread while you're FD in many cases, so the instant you stand, you're dead.  <br>
<br>
I know when doing CR's in Fear to the North Wall camp, the monks that were dragging were *constantly* /q'ing to reset aggro, it's the only way to avoid tons of deaths.<br>
<br>
To my experience, I've seen 2 fear break methods that work:<br>
<br>
1)  Stealth - Get a couple of FD'ers as spotters, invis and sow, and run on a very specific path to the north wall safe spot.  I've done this run solo several times, and always get there and camp out aggro free, but you have to know where to go, and keep your eyes wide open for see invis mobs.  For extra safety, run a few tanks in and along the path to 'distract' any mobs that see invis, and run clerics to the camp spot about 15 seconds behind them.  At the firewall, aggro folks head left into the corner, and those without aggro veer right and camp.  The ' safe spot' on the North Wall is small (Scarlings path on the west side, and a Glare Lord on a long roam path will sneak up on the east side along the zone wall) but it's a good place to start.<br>
<br>
2) Pure freakin' brute force - Zone in with one or 2 beefy groups buffed to the hilt.  Chanters start chain AE stunning and mezzing, nukers burn like crazy, and tanks dish out the hurt.  You kill as much as you can, and when the cleric or chanter runs low on mana, you evac out.  Wash, repeat, and eventually the portal area is clear, and you start with a West Wall break. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 642<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/15/01 11:30:54 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear even at 60...</span><hr size=1> Fear is a snap if you do it right.  I prefer the brute force method with some subterfuge.<br>
<br>
Zone some FD classes in with the intent of training mobs near the portal away from portal towards the east.  Keep those mobs busy for as long as possible to buy the break group some time.  This is very important.<br>
<br>
Zone in one, maybe 2 groups with enchanter/cleric/tanks.  Have them head to west wall *immediately*.  Don't stand around the portal because for some weird reason there is huge agro near the portal.<br>
<br>
There will be about 8 to 10 mobs to kill, about 4 right away.  Expect more to trickle in as soon as the monks can no longer keep them trained away.  Once you have the west wall fairly secure and the break-in groups are fighting, ask the enchanters if the rest can come in.<br>
<br>
Send one group at a time in and then start forming the normal groups.  Expect the incoming groups to bring roamers. <p>Herder

If your average levels are mid to upper 50's, definately use brute force.  If your tanks are high 40's, lower 50's, might be better off using stealth as they may not last long against 4-6 mobs at once, and the chanters might have too many resists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=352.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=353.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=348.topic><img src=http://sirion.netfirms.com/vcc/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=348.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=348.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Events Scheduling<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://clicks.about.com/157/spkcpa.asp?PM=485_d_ezboard_spcpa&rURL=https%3A//sprinks.about.com/userforms/create_user.htm%3Fpc%3Dd_ezboard" target="_blank">
