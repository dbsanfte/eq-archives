<br>
I usually just match the lowest prices for each of my tailored items (as opposed to undercutting, unless my regular price was lower to begin with), but then Nebuchenoozer (or something like that) comes along and spends like an hour trying to undercut my prices by EXACTLY 1 pp each.<br>
<br>
Acrylia Reinforced Leggings 1000p<br>
Acrylia Reinforced Leggings 998p<br>
Acrylia Reinforced Leggings 997p<br>
Acrylia Reinforced Leggings 996p<br>
Acrylia Reinforced Leggings 995p<br>
Acrylia Reinforced Leggings 994p<br>
<br>
And so on... a new price every minute... and I thought the clicking we had to do to make the stuff was bad.<br>
<br>
This guy is always anonymous for some reason. <br>
<br>
Can't we all just... get along? most GM (oops I mean uber) tailors are pretty reasonable people, but this sort of behavior is so gimp it makes me want to sell all my tailored junk for like 50p each and get it over with.<br>
<br>
Anyone want an Acrylia Reinforced Tunic for 50p? Just come into the Bazaar when this sort of BS is going on. And thank the instigator.<br>

The first few GM smith on the server had an agreement not to sell mistletoe cutting sickles for under 3k each.  Go look at the price in bazaar now.  1900 was the lowest I saw once.  It takes about that much to make 1 sickle + cover failrate.  People like those are the reason I charge money for sickle combines.  I used do them for free, what happened is, people will have me make them couple of them, then turn around put them on mule and sell with the price much lower than normal.  It's just f*** up.<br>
<br>
Another thing is they'll set up the price to be almost half of what you have, and if you follow them, they'll come and buy them off you, then turn around sell them with the regular price.  Bashen is the one who's doing so on golden idol of tunare I am pretty sure whose mule it is, but I hope you'd read this post and dont do that kind of bullshit again. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90395>Raiya</a> / <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90580>Jinling</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugaladonr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GaladonR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/12/02 6:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> :)</span><hr size=1> Yes, Raiya, your price fixing attempt on the Sickles fell through, as I'm sure it would on any item with any tradeskill eventually... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Nothing wrong with that idea, I think its a good one actually, but once one person ignores the agreement, others will inevitably follow.<br>
<br>
But, as with any tradeskill, as you get more and more skilled tradeskillers in each skill, prices will drop. The smiths worked hard and came out of the woodwork when they saw the profit potential in 3k sickles.<br>
<br>
I agree with Moelle that the constant undercutting is annoying and in the end hurts ALL the tradeskillers including the one doing the undercutting- when it involves items being produced in quantity.<br>
<br>
Right now on Vaz, you've got everyone and their BROTHER making studded/reinforced acrylia to skill up (today's tailors have the advantage of Acrylia, this GM Tailor destroyed more Arctic Wyvern masks and Tiger Raptor masks than you could imagine! /whine off). Of course, there's also many people that are using Acrylia to get their skill high enough to make the shawl quests more easily accomplished, and have no intention of passing 200.<br>
<br>
As the weeks progress, I'm sure higher end tailored items will see the influx of sellers just as acrylia has. There has been a sort of server standard for most Velious leathers, set by myself, and as much as I hate to admit it, the infamous Birch (miss ya, bro, /wink). I'm sure within a several weeks, there will be at least one, and possibly FOUR tailors nearing/hitting the GM (250) level. With that will come more competition. BUT, I have a feeling that prices on things like Solstice Robes and Velious leathers will continue to be pretty stable, until a non-cooperative Tailor (cough, not mentioning any names), reaches that level. Then, there will likely be another price war, as there has been in acrylia.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem I foresee with these tradeskills is the fact that it all but prevents aspiring tradeskillers (except perhaps veteran players with huge banks who create twinks to take up a skill) from reaching the 201+ level. Imagine how much MORE plat it would require to get there if Solstice Robes were 1k, and Black Pantherskin leggings were 500pp. Birch wanted this to happen, to secure his spot as the number one Tailor on Vaz. It didn't. <br>
<br>
I'm out there rooting on those who are attempting to skill up, as people like Moelle and Ydris would tell you. I want to see others enjoy the accomplishment and reward as I have by reaching 250. Yes, it might have taken 250kpp+ and a HUGELY supportive guild and 18 months, but I got there (/cheer Regression-RoK). Heck, I'm READY for someone else to join me, for I am truly suffering from burnout.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but tailoring is a unique tradeskill. It requires more time and plat to reach 250 (or the 200's, for that matter) than any other skill, hands down. Lets hope that those who reach this level can work cooperatively so that others can enjoy the skill, and MANY can enjoy some of our finer wares. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Acrylia has been a godsend to skilling up in tailoring. Wyvern masks are the suck. Of course it's a double-edged sword with all the new competitors, but whatcha gonna do. I just wish the stuff wore out over time.<br>
<br>
Othmir caps - that reminds me. Galadon are you done getting rid of your stock of othmir caps? Lemme know when you are done plz, I'm thinking of going back to 200p each or so (with the caps I don't delete that is). No biggy.<br>
<br>
I have slowly started entering the Velious market and it's pretty fun. I even sold Holgresh fur boots last night! So somebody else out there actually gets that Holgresh stuff. Who'da thunk it.<br>
<br>
And then there's that person who ordered two cobalt drake pieces and then disappeared...<br>
<br>
My main bazaarbish is Morrel at the moment, so be nice to that cat plz thx.<br>
<br>
Anyway I hope the true high end tailors can continue to play rationally. I have nothing against any tailor, hell I even gave Neboobanoozeroo a chance or three before he showed his true colors (putrid green and fungus yellow, to be precise). But I'll stop talking about that guy since this thread belongs here, not in R&amp;F.<br>
<br>
I'm glad as hell the top dog Galadon is a reasonable person, unlike some other infamous tailors! Makes the whole business so much more fun. /cheer Galadon<br>

And in response to your question, I think I'm pretty much out of Othmir Fur Caps! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I actually regret detroying all those caps now... But we both know how many can accumulate on all our mules (I can't even begin to count how many I destroyed), I had to get rid of them somehow. The market was pretty much saturated even before the new UI, so I figured I'd just dump them all.<br>
<br>
As for acrylia, it would cost me about 500pp to make an Acrylia Reinforced Tunic- but I've steered away from Acrylia all together, just to avoid conflict (now what do I do with these STACKS of furs?!!).<br>

Yeah, the market is pretty saturated, but as you know they sell reasonably fast at 125p in the Bazaar - think I'll go to 200p for a while and maybe even stop deleting them... well I'll start deleting 50% or so instead of 90%... Doesn't much matter, I have to heavily subsidize othmir craps at just about any price.<br>
<br>
Yeah I'm pretty much out of the studded acrylia market myself, but I still make a tunic or whatever every once in a while just for the helluvit. Just not very many compared to all the reinforced I have to push. Too bad they didn't make trivials for studded higher than reinfoced, people seem to buy more studded than reinforced. Ah well it's all good.<br>

I always, ALWAYS buy from the person who has had consistently better overall prices aimed at being fair. I'm not the only one doing this either.<br>
<br>
Aim your prices at what seems fair for an item. If I can just find a person who doesn't try and corner the market by keeping inflated prices, I would just blindly buy from them exclusively from here on. That's worth something because you know that Verant will keep adding worthwhile recipes, and people will keep twinking. You won't win the whole bazaar over, but having a group of high level plat-farming customers is a lot less long-term effort than trying to always control the uncontrollable.<br>

On the other hand, I refuse to buy from people that price things at 14,999pp.  It pisses me off in stores because these people fill my pockets with loose change, and that anger carries over to EQ.  I will buy stuff for 16k before i buy it for 14.999k.<br>

But something else about tailoring (especially acrylia) that has bothered me for some time. The prices of raw materials continues to RISE!<br>
<br>
In fact, unless you farm the materials yourself, you will spend 150pp+ for 1 attempt at an acrylia mask, which now only sells for 75pp or less!  I saw just the other day some greedy person with 100+ small pieces of acrylia, and he was charging 90pp each for the stuff!<br>
<br>
As a result, I have given up on acrylia as a means of skilling up.  Lucky for me, I'm a wood elf, so I can skill up to 212 on reinforced mithril leathers for much less.  I do, however, have a bottleneck with the oak bark. Verant seems to have nerfed the forage table in Kith, and I now only get 1 bark every 30 minutes at most.  I used to get 1 every 3rd forage attempt.<br>

Galadon if you still have some superb rockhopper hides. I would be willing to trade you some cobalt drake hides for them. I have close to a stack and won't be able to use them anyway for the next few months.<br>
<br>
About undercutting... just go the other way round. Instead of lowering your price raise it to something unreasonable (see superb hopper hides for 2k). People will either follow and set it at the same ridiculous price or try to undercut you. Cheapest superb hopper hide as of this morning: 500pp. I doubt anyone actually buys them, but it DID raise the price overall. Maybe I'll try this with some acrylia studded :)<br>
