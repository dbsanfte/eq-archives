Poses some questions...</span><hr size=1>   So I have played this game since April of 99'. Running a little over 200 days played on Sab, about 30 on Raine, 11 on Sabaesh, and about 8 on Sabbal.  Cant say I havent had fun, obviously I have enjoyed this game. Yet, in all those played days, and 3 guilds later I still wander in search of of a few specific things.  I guess &quot;the Wanderer&quot; was a  pretty appropirate title.<br>
<br>
  I digress a bit before i get to the point........<br>
<br>
<br>
  I have noticed in this time some fairly similar traits in the 3 guilds I belonged to.  The core of the guild is typically held together by 5-10 individuals who know each other outside of the game, or knew each other from other games before EQ.  They stress &quot;having fun&quot; and &quot;family atmosphere&quot; like a religion whether or not the guilds structure, leadership, and goals are conducive to those things.  Loot distribution is without exception pressented as fair and democractic, whether or not this is the case as demonstrated by either method, practice, or policy.  Goals stated by the guilds are generally accpted by the majority of the membership, but rarely agreed upon in practice.  I.E. &quot;Our goal is to be in VP in 3 monthes&quot;... reply, &quot;Yah yah we sure do, umm sorry i cant go to that raid tho b/c my level 11 necromancer is more fun to play&quot;. or reply, &quot; bah thats no fun camping that shit, gimmie more phat loots from other zones&quot;.  People in these guilds will always SAY that the guild should come first. And as a general rule the majority will feel strongly that they DO put the guild before themselves. Yet if the leadership decides its a PRIORITY to build a specific class up before another(I.E. decking out main tanks in armor before rogues) shit hits the fan. The guild always seems to come first until Joe might get more ph4T l3wT quicker than me.  Most players in these guilds are willing to show up for events that are certain to gain them ph4t L3wts(armor farming) but heaven forbid they show when its a certain 9-10 hours of beating your head against a Dragon knowing your gonna lose for a while until you figure that shit out.  Players are willing to accept rules and structure only up until the poitn where it, HEAVEN FORBID, might intrude upon their personal play time. Hey!! gimmie lots of phat loots but dont you dare tell me when i can play my alt or when I should attend a raid.<br>
<br>
  Anyhow I could go on and on but you should get the point by now.<br>
<br>
  My conclusion, is that very few people continue to play this game for the game itself.  They log in to find friendship, chat with other lonely people so they feel better, or to have a &quot;family&quot; atmosphere to fill some void or another... /shiver.<br>
Personally i cannot understand this approach and find it incredibly frustrating and contrary to my goals for playing the game.  Why on earth would anyone play this game for any other reason than to beat the living shit outta it? I mean i game to win. Its just very hard for me to understand why anyone would log in day after day without that drive???<br>
<br>
  Of course this is the point where many people get all defensive and assume I am making judgements. Actually i dotn really care why you play and this isnt about flaming people for their motivations.  Why I dont get is why those people join guilds whose stated purpose is to raid.   Frankly, when i sit back and think about it i have to conceed its the guilds fault.  <br>
<br>
  As a guild you recruit all the time, telling people what a wonderfull &quot;family&quot; your guild is and how well you all get along.  &quot;nobody ever complains about loot&quot; you tell your prospcetive recruits.. &quot;We are fair and demcratic!&quot;  &quot;We let you pretty much do what you want but we still kick ass!&quot;  Bullshit like this seethes from nearly every guild I have seen in the last 2 years.  Of course there is nothing wrong with that since clearly many people play the game to hang out in an environment like that. What continually amazes me tho, is taht there arent guilds of the &quot;other type&quot;. By this I mean guilds who play to beat the game, not to find a circle of friend sin an online world. There are a few.. AL, FoH, LoS.. But they are few and far between and make up a huge minority.  Are there really so few people who play this as a GAME and not a social event??  It seems the most common pattern is for a guild to be composed of a small core of gamers who really want to succeed, surrounded by a majority of socialites who want to pretty much kick back and reap the rewards.  I guess taht works for some people and some guilds, but it drives me NUTS.<br>
<br>
  Where are all the gamers?  Or is Sab just nuts!<br>
<br>
 Anyhow I've been pondering all this since I left KEG, and having left CoP recently(a guild I really did and do like) has crystallized some of these thoughts in mine mind.  I guess I share primarily because I am curious if anyone else thinks this way.<br>
<br>
 Nuff said.<br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> Well, Sab...I understand what you say, because I'm a VERY competitive person too.  However, when I play EQ, a game where there is no 'winning', the goal I am trying to achieve is my 'Win.'  Last night, our goal was to score some armor drops from Kael.  We succeeded....three drops in two hours for 9 folks.  Sometimes the goal is to score quest gems...sometimes its to finish up this level...other times its to finish up others' levels, and still other times its just to see another zone that we haven't seen before.  These accomplishments are our 'Wins.'  What good is an accomplishment if there's noone with whom to share it?  Our family, our guild, are the ones who share the sense of accomplishment when we've achieved one of those goals.  That's what makes this game more than just a game.  Its a hobby.  Its a hobby that we share with our friends.<br>

Much of my game playing is social.  I have logged on many times just to see who was on and to bs with them a little.  Maybe you should either find a pure power player guild that puts loot and accomplishments before anything else.  If there isnt one then start your own.  I would think that a guild like that would have alot of internal problems (yes I know all guilds do at some point).  However I would tend to think that all the players would want all the great items for themselves, etc.<br>
I wouldnt be happy in a guild that doesnt feel like a family but I am sure there are others besides you who do want a pure power gamer experience.  Good luck to you on your journeys and I hope you find a guild that shares your ideals.<br>

<br>
Some play eq to fill a social void, that much is for sure.  But don't doubt the role EQ plays in your own dyfunctional personality.  Perhaps your need to &quot;win&quot; in EQ so much is a direct result of not &quot;winning&quot; in RL?  Who knows....but there are many more facets to EQ and catering to the dysfunctional personality than just friendships.  <br>
<br>
In fact, I have the beginnings of proof already written out about online games in general and are they truly harmful to the psyche or just poorly stereotyped by those that dont agree or understand them.  Maybe one day I will finish it up.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usabbyfkb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sabbyFKB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(6/28/01 1:37:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sab ponders the state of the game.

Clearly his skills extend into the realm of psychoanalysis and his has determined with consumate skill that the reason I dont play to find friends is because of all the things lacking in my life.  *ahem*  <br>
<br>
 I find it interesting that people assume a guild that puts the goals of the guild above personal issues is going to have anymore internal problems than these guilds who pretend to be &quot;familys&quot;.  I laugh when guilds say they would never adopt a system of loot distribution like AL has because it would ruin the &quot;family&quot; atmosphere. I mean be honest, the real reason most guilds wont do something like that is because it very objectively puts gear in the hands of the people who play the most and do the most for the guild.  Your &quot;familly&quot; based guild distributes loot based not on what does the most good for the guild, but on other much more random and subjective things. Like who the leaders like the most, who looks the  best in that armor, or who is sleeping with who at the current time, or who bitches and moans the most.  The real reason most guilds cant build up 2-3 warriors with all the best gear FIRST and leave other warriors to wait is not because they want to do whats best for the guild. Its because they cant convince their members to wait for their Ph4t l3wTs for the good of the guild. It has nothing to do with family, its about greed and its hidden by this false veneer of &quot;happy happy love&quot; BS.  Try deciding in your own guild that one particular class should get an ub3r all/all item before anyone of any other classes.. Base it on purely objective reasons such as needs for uber encounters. See how much bitching and moaning results.. Trust me it will be a shitstorm.  Try telling people they dont get gear unless they log in for a certain percentage of raids. See what happens.  These are things that are BEST for the guild as a whole. You think what I propose is selfish or would create a bunch of loot mongers?? I say your absolutley wrong, its exactly the opposite. When it comes right down to it 90% of players are very happy with a subjective, unstructured, and lax leadership that allows them to do whatever the hell they want when they want.   /shrug<br>
<br>
  Already people are jumping to the conclusion I am saying this is &quot;wrong&quot;.  Its not wrong to answer your question Kathrynn. And had you read my original post in its entirety you would have seen where i said as much.  Its fine, play how you want for whatever reason you want. The thing that frustrates me is the lack of players who play to kick ass at this game.  I am also a tad bitter yes, because its the players who lack that conviction to play the game at a higher level who make my gaming experience so frustrating.  Yes i do understand its not their fault, its mine. The primary reason i left CoP was because it became obvious I couldnt take them any further for the simple fact they didnt WANT to go further. They are happy  being level 60 and farming armor in ToV. Its the endgame for the majority of the guild.   Sure there are some members of the guild who want more, but you cant drag half your guild kicking and screaming into something they dont want.<br>
<br>
  It becomes increasingly obvious to me that very few players continue to play for the primary goal of being the best.  My mistake was thinking that I could find a guild that was going to be any different than the previous guilds I had been in.<br>
<br>
 I do find the assumption that a guild has to be a &quot;family&quot; to be fun amusing though. I have been in 3 guilds now that were &quot;familys&quot; and its been an off and on nightmare of drama and BS.  Constant fights over loot distribution, power struggles, differing goals, personal arguments, etc etc. Hell most of these people stay in guilds simply because they cant abide logging in to no green spam, or cant bring themselves to give up their phat loots.  I'll bet no guild on this server could poll their members individially and get more than 40% of them to agree on what the goal of the guild is.  A collection of people with no focus, no overriding goals, no structure, and no real leadership is not my idea of a guild.  When someone tells me that the game wouldnt be &quot;fun&quot; anymore if a guild had those things, I can only assume they think constant guild drama and begging people to show up at events is &quot;fun&quot;.<br>

<br>
Isn't it interesting how someone can point to this thing or that thing and declare that is the source of the world's problems.  If someone were to tell me &quot;the first step in solving a problem is to know of the existence of the problem&quot; I would disagree.  The first step in solving a problem is the creation of that problem.  Stopping all clearing of tropical rain forests alone will not solve the worlds ecological problems.  There is always something that is missed.<br>
<br>
In any instance of time the world there are unsolved problems.  And here is the opportunity.  Life is incomplete.  How you deal with that fact is more important than how you balk at it.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
I have to agree with Manas on this one.   I have played since retail release as well and for along time I was not levelling up AFAP and gear wasn't an issue.  (hell I looked like I had no pants on for a year) as most of the Black Talons could attest to.   I did spend much of my time helping out guildmates whether it be advice or hunting with them,  Or as was tradition in our guild questing for items to give out at our Christmas party.  (yeah it may sound lame to many of you but then again you haven't given something to someone who could truly use it I guess)<br>
<br>
Then came Foundation Rathe and I went level crazy,  nothing else mattered and I put up 30-52 in a month.   I know again nothing special for those amongst us who play nonstop but for me as an Ogre SK pre exp adjustment it took all my time.  It took my real life events which included working out, playing basketball, and even hanging out with friends and tossed them into the gutter.   <br>
<br>
I got my levels and was involved with the guild but I couldn't have been more disgusted with how my life had been trampled on and essentially retired from the Rathe.  I was completely disgusted with what EQ did to people and was even more disgusted with what people would do to each other in the game under guidance of an ever increasingly warped sense of reason.    <br>
<br>
For all intents and purposes I was finished with EQ...<br>
<br>
<br>
But noooooooo<br>
<br>
After two or three months off I began working on a bard on Zeb.  I joined with my friends from the Rathe in Iratus Lepus (who btw are a collective of people who have been in almost every respected guild on the rathe)  and began playing again and the reasoning was more for the people I knew and was friends with before I departed.   I can say that the game has a new light to it now that I have managed to step back and re align myself.  <br>
<br>
Sabby I don't know you too well other than from reading your posts on the boards of our community but if the advice of a stranger is something that might help you I would suggest you take a step back and find something you did before you were involved with EQ.   In fact find something that you liked to do before you ever became involved with MMORPGs and start doing it again.    For me it was basketball and training in the gym and it has helped me alot.  (not to mention dropping 20 pounds lol)  <br>
<br>
Whatever you do I am willing to bet you will find time in your life again for games such as this but until then good luck if you decide to follow my advice.<br>

Poses some questions.</span><hr size=1> I would have to agree with Sabby. Not necessarily on guild politics etc etc, but on the matter of EQ: game vs. chat room. In my mind, when it comes to EQ, it is a game. Games have objectives. The reason I started playing this game, the reason I have played it for two years, and the reason I am still playing it is to advance in the game. Social relationships are secondary to me. I've made some very good friends in EQ and value them immensely, but I can go have those same friendships on AIM or ICQ or IRC. I don't play EQ and pay ten bucks a month (thirty actually) to chat with friends.<br>
<br>
If you play EQ to be with friends, that's great. I have no problem with that. I think everyone should have as much fun as they can in EQ, however they do that. However, you do have to remember this is a game, and that means there is an objective. I hardly think it is wrong for someone to make that objective his or her first priority.<br>

<br>
Are you saying that you want to join a raiding guild, or are you complaining that you made bad choices in guilds that claim to be more social than ambitious?<br>
<br>
Although it sounds like you're saying that you think it's POSSIBLE to even COME CLOSE to WINNING this game, I'm sure that after playing as many days as you have you know that anyone who thinks that is an outright certifiable idiot, so I'm sure I'm just not understanding your meaning.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for a raid guild, look for an uberguild...there's a number of them on Zeb.  CIW, COP and KEG all come immediately to mind though there's others I'm sure I'm forgetting.  You want to &quot;win&quot; the game, so I guess that means raids.  Well, those 3 along with the other ubers raid all the time...GO PLAY.<br>
<br>
You're complaining about people's selfishness, so I'm sure YOU are not concerned with getting any more ph4t l3wt...ok, so I'm lost...what ARE you complaining about again?  Can't you ignore the selfish people?<br>
<br>
Honestly, it sounds like you're not enjoying the game anymore.  Probably after 2 years playing you're getting burned out and disappointed because you still haven't won.

 Seems like things keep coming back to this central subject, and I get the impression many of you feel that anyone who plays the game to excell must be a  &quot;loot monger&quot;.  Why is that?<br>
<br>
 Let me define win &quot;To be the best at your class, to be the best guild, to be the best player in THE GAME&quot;. That is winning.  If you dont want to win why in the heck would you play? Err, go hang out in IRC where you can be with your friends for free and roleplay about traveling down to the market to work on your tradeskills.<br>
<br>
 Apparently I &quot;dont get along with anyone&quot; because my priority in this game is not making friends. /boggle.  I have friends, I dont want more. I have a family, I dont want another.  Why exactly am I being flamed for that??<br>
<br>
 What I am discovering is that yes, very few people actually play this as a GAME.  I am truly shocked. And no, there are no Uber guilds on this server. Not a single one.<br>

  Age old PVP vs Roleplayer argument.  Ive never seen either side come to any middle ground. Its a shame Verant waited to put in a decent PVP system 2+ years into things.<br>
<br>
<br>
  You think I need to take a break from the game because i log in to game, not find a family or meet friends?  Well I say you need a break from the game if you log in to find friends and family. How does that sit with you?  Well now you know how it sat with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And the assumption that I &quot;dont get along well with people&quot; because I dont want to make friends in EQ is just hilarious. Thanks, but my circle of friends is full up, I dont want more.  I'll keep the online aquiantances to just that.. Aquaintances.  I see alot of people throw that word &quot;friend&quot; around very liberally.<br>
<br>
  So let me ask... I didnt walk into the computer store, slap down 50 bux and tell the clerk, &quot;Ring me up a box of online friends and family please!&quot;.  Did you?  Apparently since i didnt I 1) need to take a break from the game 2) dont get along wtih people 3) others dont get along with me 4) am only concerned with loot 5) should play only stand alone games.<br>
