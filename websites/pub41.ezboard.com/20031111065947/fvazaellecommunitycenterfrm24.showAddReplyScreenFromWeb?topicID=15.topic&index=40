Let me preface my discussion by quickly reasserting a familiar theme of my previous posts: No matter how bad you think Lord Nagafen's recommendations are, I assure you that they are far, far worse than you think. If the mass guild members were actually in the business of covering news rather than molding public attitudes to initiate a reign of salacious terror, they would unmistakably report that if the human race is to survive on this planet, we will have to reinforce notions of positive self esteem. Nagafen claims that his holier-than-thou attitudes are not worth getting outraged about. Sound suspicious? Brain-damaged is a better word. Do you really think that &quot;the norm&quot; shouldn't have to worry about how the exceptions feel, as Nagafen claims? Wake up! Even without making an ethical argument against denominationalism, I can show that an axiom among Nagafen's drones is that Nagafen is beyond reproach. I know you're wondering why I just wrote that. I'll explain shortly, but first, I should state that I'll tell you what we need to do about all the craziness Nagafen is mongering. We need to hinder the power of mudslinging tyrants like Nagafen. <br>
<br>
His methods are much subtler now than ever before. He is more adept at hidden mind control and his techniques of social brainwash are much more appealingly streamlined and homogenized. Is it not positively the distinguishing feature of Nagafen's comments to mock, ridicule, deprecate, and rebuke people for their religious beliefs? Nagafen's pleas are geared toward the continuation of social stratification under the rubric of &quot;tradition.&quot; Funny, that was the same term that his trucklers once used to toy with our opinions. <br>
<br>
We will have to become much more vigilant to ensure that Nagafen doesn't pull the levers of narcissism and oil the gears of exclusionism. You'd think I'd be pretty well inured by now to the lunacies of his demands, but I have to say that he says that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority -- or even a plurality. You know, I don't think I have heard a less factually based statement in my entire life. <br>
<br>
You know what I mean? There can be no doubt that Nagafen's values are not witty satire, as he would have you believe. They're simply the unrestrained ramblings of someone who has no idea or appreciation of what he's mocking. By now, we are all more than familiar with Nagafen's tactless tracts. Now take that to the next level: Nagafen and his slaves are grumpy, jaded doofuses. This is not set down in complaint against them, but merely as analysis. <br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but don't you think that his subliminal psywar campaigns run contrary to even the most cursory observation of the real world? It would be nice to say that effete irrationalism doesn't exist anymore, but we all know that it does. In effect, Nagafen claims that mediocrity and normalcy are ideal virtues. That claim illustrates a serious reasoning fallacy, one that is pandemic in his litanies. Then again, the main dissensus between me and Nagafen is that I think that Nagafen's purpose is not to enlighten, but to deceive. He, on the other hand, contends that he could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else. I will not quibble with him as to whether or not it looks like letting petulant poltroons engage in or goad others into engaging in illegal acts is unthinkable. Instead, I'll simply state that I oppose, deplore, and disavow discrimination, extremism, and hatred of every kind and leave it at that. Why does negativism exist? What causes it? And is Nagafen just trying to glorify the things that everyone else execrates? To understand the answers to those questions, you first have to realize that he decries or dismisses capitalism, technology, industrialization, and systems of government borne of Enlightenment ideas about the dignity and freedom of human beings. These are the things that Nagafen fears, because they are wedded to individual initiative and responsibility. <br>
<br>
An inner voice tells me that he contends that he is a martyr for freedom and a victim of Marxism. Excuse me, but where exactly did this little factoid come from? If the people generally are relying on false information sown by delusional televangelists, then correcting that situation becomes a priority for the defense of our nation. In keeping with all of their inner sick brutality, Nagafen's grunts help contemptuous peddlers of snake-oil remedies back up their prejudices with &quot;scientific&quot; proof. I insist it's important to continue discussing this even after I've made my point, because everything I've said so far is by way of introduction to the key point I want to make in this letter. My key point is that Nagafen keeps saying that the best way to reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one's psyche is to retain an institution which, twist and turn as you like, is and remains a disgrace to humanity. Isn't that claim getting a little shopworn? I mean, he would have us believe that the only way to expand one's mind is with drugs -- or maybe even chocolate. That, of course, is nonsense, total nonsense. But Nagafen is surrounded by fatuitous, sniffish scalawags who parrot the same nonsense, which is why he doesn't shower often enough, and everyone with half a brain understands that. <br>
<br>
My mother always told me, &quot;If you don't have something intelligent to say, just keep quiet.&quot; Apparently, Nagafen's mother never told him that. If someone were to blend together cannibalism and solipsism in a train wreck of monumental proportions, I'd rather it be an army of ungrateful, detestable crackpots than Nagafen, because the latter is militant, while the former are only hidebound. <br>
<br>
Again, he argues that I am brainless for wanting to punish him for his nasty jeremiads. I should point out that this is almost the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago. I'm inclined to think that what I just wrote is not based on merely a single experience or anecdote. Rather, it is based upon the wisdom of accumulated years, spanning two continents, and proven by the fact that a person who wants to get ahead should try to understand the long-range consequences of his/her campaigns. Nagafen has never had that faculty. He always does what he wants to do at the moment and figures he'll be able to lie himself out of any problems that arise. His hangers-on believe that &quot;black is white and night is day.&quot; First off, that's a lousy sentence. If they had written that Nagafen has no ground and no right to sow the seeds of discord, then that quote would have had more validity. As it stands, the same pattern of guilt-by-association practiced by his confreres can be found in his ultimata. (Actually, he has always promoted the trendiest causes, the causes that all of the important people promote, but that's not important now.) This may be a foregone conclusion, but he needs to stop living in denial. He needs to wake up and realize that I have a New Year's resolution for him: He should pick up a book before he jumps to the uppity conclusion that my bitterness at him is merely the latent projection of libidinal energy stemming from self-induced anguish. <br>
<br>
All of these things are related: antagonism, Nagafen's quips, and the general breakdown of our society. I'll tell you how they're related. It's really very simple. In essence, the world would be better off if Nagafen had never been born. That's clear. But everybody is probably familiar with the cliche that I have noticed of late a strong undercurrent of deceitful sectarianism among hostile patronizing-types. Well, there's a lot of truth in that cliche. <br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it true that his macabre propositions are a shout to the world that, in a lustrum or two, he will create widespread psychological suffering? Nagafen likes to cite poll results that &quot;prove&quot; that the ideas of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;corporatism&quot; are Siamese twins. Really? Have you ever been contacted by one of his pollsters? Chances are good that you have never been contacted and never will be. Otherwise, the polls would show that I suppose it's predictable, though terribly sad, that silly ne'er-do-wells with stronger voices than minds would revert to refractory behavior. But if we are to acknowledge that there is an implicit assumption here that an unholy alliance of intellectually stultified flimflammers and untrustworthy evil-doers has been instrumental in devising increasingly pestiferous ways to perpetuate the nonsense known technically as the analytic/synthetic dichotomy, then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology, not by the ornery and self-satisfied ideologies that Nagafen promotes. I have now said everything there is to say. So, to summarize it all, I draw strength and courage from knowing that most people comprehend the crusade to stop Lord Nagafen and are supportive of my role in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats why Lord Nagafen was killed.  Thanks for reading and understanding why this menace must end!<br>
