Come out of the closet you "ditto" head and stop listening to the right-wing propoganda.  Hell, I even think Magi would agree that when it comes right down to it, there is not much difference between our two parties in the U.S.  To start seeing a difference, you need to begin looking to the Libertarian Party.  <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

<br>
There is a huge difference between the parties....<br>
     Democrats want to make government bigger and feel that government can solve all social ills.<br>
     Republicans want a smaller less intrusive government and feel that the individual should be free to solve his own problems.<br>
<br>
To answer your four points.....<br>
<br>
1.  Show me one place a Democrat is advocating individual freedom other than abortion.  They now want to take my SUV away from me.....the list of my individual rights being attacked is endless.... prayer in school etc.....<br>
<br>
2.  Democrats are trying to rewrite the Constitution taking religion totally out of our Society...<br>
<br>
3.  Democrats are not advocating CHOICE in schools or they would be for vouchers in lower education.  In colleges we have a semi voucher system called GI Bill and Pell grants, but Democrats dont want that same freedom in grade school because of the Unions....and who does this hurt more than the inner city kid......Polls show African Americans want vouchers by 80% and it is their kids that are being left behind... yet the Democrats are against it.<br>
<br>
4.  Yes sir..... Democrats are for suing people... most of their agenda has been achieved in the courts because they cant get it thru the legistature.....That is why they want an activist court......to circumvent the legislative process.... you only have to look at Florida and an Activist State Supreme court that tried to rewrite election law after the election for proof of this......<br>

<br>
I will agree with spioctor in the end result there isnt much difference in our two major parties. Either way you vote you end up with bigger government. Either you way you find freedom assaulted..<br>
<br>
Economic freedom from the democrats<br>
Personal Freedom from the republicans<br>
<br>
Unfortuantely this country votes too often along party lines without a clear view of the issues.<br>
<br>
Many of my personal friends voted for George W Bush in the last election because he was the lesser of two evils. I voted for Harry Browne because I knew that every single vote for the LP was a revolt against the current system. It was my own personal statement of principle. I will not further support the looters.<br>
<br>
Both republicans and democrats sell out there principles at the first chance to line the pockets of themselves or their constitutents.<br>
<br>
Compromise in their terms means ill vote for your special interest bill if you vote for mine.<br>
<br>
Democrats as of late assualt more rights than they protect<br>
(IE 2nd ammendment)<br>
<br>
Republican's talk about reducing government and taxes and then raise them(IE George Bush Sr&quot;read my lips&quot;)<br>
<br>
The problem is that today's politicians get there positions from polls and focus groups. They only convictions they have are the ones they think will get them elected.<br>
<br>
People are sick of the bullshit, and many dont vote because they feel it doent really matter.<br>
<br>
Libertarian philosophy is gaining ground amoung the &quot;politically homless&quot; because it is a party of PRINCIPLE not of subjective what will get me elected this year positions.<br>

<br>
Granted.... we do have bigger Government today then we did yesterday and the Republicans have the purse strings......but unfortunately the Federal budget is about 80% non discretionary spending..(medicare, medicaid, welfare..etc) and there is little that can be done with the other 20% other than to slow the growth... and unfortuneately the electorate has decided in many respects they want a nanny for a Government so untill we can educate the electorate and change the budgeting process the best we can hope for is a controlled growth of the Federal Government..<br>
<br>
And you stated the Republicans have assaulted our Personal Freedoms and the Democrats have assaulted our Economic Freedoms.....I know the Economic Freedoms that you speak of...But what Personal Freedom in particular were you thinking of that has been attacked by the Republican Party??<br>
<br>
I agree with you that too many voters vote with out a clear view of issues, but who is responsible for that.......The founding Fathers had in mind a free and unbiased press that cast an unsympathetic stare at both parties, and examined in a public forum all sides of an issue....they counted on this so much that they gave the press certain Constitutional Rights to insure that the politico's wouldn't control the dialogue.  Yet, today the press routinely looks the other way and only examines certain issues from only a certain perspective.... for example Campaign finance reform has never had the Conservative viewpoint discussed in the press......The press certainly has an interest in the passage of this legislation and will spin the coverage to its own end......it looks like the internet is about the only place these days you can find an open and frank discussion of an issue from all sides......<br>
<br>
You said that George Bush's broken read my lips promise was an example of how you cant trust any of them.... I look at it as an example of how he wasnt pandering to the polls or to special interest groups and was doing the business of governing.... he wanted to extract some concessions from his Democratic friends and made a tax concession for some spending concessions......he made a promise to the left that put him on the outs with his party because he felt it was in the best interest of the country.  He signed the tax increase and took the heat....... then the left reneged on their end of the promise didnt live up to their spending limits they promised him... and then to top it off... used his broken promise to the Republicans as a campaign issue.  Ex Democratic Congressman Rostenkowski several years later described the incident as the most courageous act he had ever witnessed in his 27 years in Congress........it is unfortunate that when a Politician does do the right thing for the Country that it is twisted or ignored........I contend that there is alot of good Governing going on by many good men on both sides of the aisle and it is just a few of them and a very cynical public that creates the impression that Washington is full of crooks.<br>
<br>
The cynasism that many show towards the process is what is keeping our voters away from the polls and away from getting engaged in the issues....... I contend that the incumbents want it that way..... if no one bothered to vote or to inform themselves then the guy currently in there is the guy who benefits.....unfortunately our county is so succesful that most people cant be bothered to involve themselves... they are too busy with there own lives ...... and that is great..... but our inatentiveness to the Federal Governments role in our lives and our Cynasism is allowing a ruling class to emerge that is slowly peeling away our Rights and slowly changing the political dialogue in this country....<br>
<br>
And finally the last thing you said......you stated that you didnt vote for Bush ...... I commend you on your Principals....but your principals gave us 8 years of Clinton.... the 3rd party candidate in both the 92 and 96 elections gave us the worst president in the history of our Country....he was elected in 92 with 43% of the vote and in 96 with 48% of the vote.  Idealism is wonderful......but in the push and pull of politics some times you have to be practical......Magious...I know you and I want the same things in the end.... I admire all of your Libertarian policies..... but to get there from here requires small steps... incrementally year after year....... look at how long it took the Democrats to change this Country... they had Congress for 40 straight years..... we cant even hope to change that this election... but we can hope to get back on the right path......one step at a time...<br>

They are afraid of the religiuos right. They dont want to see abortion outlawed.<br>
<br>
I myself morally am against abortion. But I dont want to push my personal moral code on the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
The reason I went from being a registered republican to a Libertarian is because of the following situation.<br>
<br>
Some of you know I own and operate a martial arts school for a living. I teach mixed martial arts a blend of kickboxing and jiujitsu which is very practical and self defense oriented. My students and I were both fans and participants in mixed martial arts tournaments like the Ultimate Fighting Championships. Do to politicians in my state wanting to take a stand &quot;against violence&quot; legislation was passed to make it illegal to participate or hold such a tournament in the state of Florida. I founded a lobbying organization to fight for the repeal of the law and promotion of the sport worldwide called the Pro Mixed Martial Arts Movement in North America. We have thousands of members across the US and Canada. I approached my local republican state rep and recieved no sympathy for my plight. The libertarian party is the only party that believes if your activity doesnt not infringe upon anothers rights that you should be free to live as you choose.<br>
I had sympathy for the pro choice faction because I know what it is like when your personal choice is not the popular one and to have someone elses morality forced upon you.<br>
<br>
The compromise that you described Dantoma is exactly the kind of deal that I cannot stand. I, probably upon entering Government(I do intend to run as a libertarian when i find a post that is vulnerable in a position that i can make a difference.) will probably become very frustrated when nothing gets done because I refuse to compromise my principles. Do some resarch on Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. The only living breathing libertarian in Washington.(he ran as a republican wink,  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . His votes on the issues are spotless and 100% according to principle. Many of the votes for spending in the House are like 414 to 1. He is the &quot;one&quot;<br>

<br>
There is very little difference Dantoma.  Bush wanted a 1.6 trillion tax increase, Gore wanted a 1 trillion.  Both want to reform medicare.  Bush wants a small portion of social security privatized, Gore wanted none.   Bush agreed to background checks on firearms, Gore wanted childproof saftey locks.  Both wanted Federal Government to play more active role in Education.  One wants Federal Govt to grow at 6%, other at 4%.  Very little difference.<br>
<br>
As for personal autonomy issues, it is more than simply abortion.  That is just the flashpoint argument.  It extends to all reproductive rights, including assisting the infertile.  <br>
<br>
Who is trying to take away your SUV?  No one.  Seeking to regulate emissions is no more taking away your right to an SUV then  requesting background checks at gunshows is seeking to revoke the Second Amendment.  These are simply extreme, terror tactics to scare the uninformed.<br>
<br>
As for your argument that we sue people to get legislation through, that is, with all due respect, simply absurd.  Republicans hate the trial lawyers and trial lawyers deal solely with money--they do not influence legislation as court opinions construing laws come from Courts of Appeals and Supreme Courts.  Also, take a look at the political landscape and see how many Democratic legislatures are actually in power.  And remember who elected them.<br>
<br>
You seem to always advocate a strict interpretation of the Constitution--except for the requirement of seperation of church and state.  Why is that?  You accuse the Democrats of removing religion from society, yet chastise the Democrats for seeking to deprive you of your constitutional right to own a firearm.   You cannot have it both ways.<br>
<br>
I posted previously that I was a Republican.   However, the religious right and the corresponding intolerance of the Republican party drove me to the Democrats.  I also love how Republicans now avoid dealing with issues by slamming the "liberal biased" media as distorting public perception.    Finally, as for being left with Clinton for 8 years, all I can say is that everyone I know is far better off today then we were in 1991.  So, while you might disagree with his personal behavior, the 8 years of his presidency brought the United States more prosperity than at anytime in history. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

<br>
As for the rest of it... well I find myself somewhat agreeing with Magiuos that if you aren't willing to stand up for your principles you don't belong in any form of government.  Compromises may be the only way to get things done but some things aren't right to compromise on.  "You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything."<br>
<br>
And one day everybody will learn that abortion truly is murder and will face judgement for their crimes.  There is such a thing as ultimate truth, but now is not its time for public acceptance or obedience.  So for now, have your fun and do what you want.  But one day you will learn and regret your mistakes.<br>

Why is it you cant give the man any due?  What is it that terrifies you so much to give him any credit for anything?  Personal ethics aside (which no one can refute), he was one of the most successful Presidents of all time.<br>
<br>
But, lets take your theory that the President should not be credited with anything related to the economy.  So that means Ronald Reagan should not be credited with the economic turnaround of the 1980s as the Democraticaly controlled Congress should be acknowledged for confirming the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  While we are at it, you can no longer blame Jimmy Carter for the rampant inflation and unemploment at the end of the 70s, we have to blame it on the Fed Reserve Chief.  Oh, and that Wall that fell down in the 1980s which everyone attributes to RR telling Gorbie to take down, we should being giving due where due belongs--to the thousands of people with their hammers for knocking down, not to any figurehead president, right?<br>
<br>
As for abortion, I am opposed to abortion personally.  But I am not so arrogant or omniscient to force my personal beliefs on anyone else.  I am not willing to tell a rape victim that she must endure a pregnancy caused by that rape.  Nor would I tell a 12 year old incest survivor that she must bring another child into the world.  Similarly, I would not tell an infertile couple that they should be denied IVF because certain people have religous beliefs inconsistent with that technology.  <br>
<br>
That is why the Republican party has had such defections--the utter lack of tolerance for different beliefs.  No one has the right to cram upon others their personal beliefs.  We need to do a better job of respecting the individuals in our diverse society and be far less judgemental of others who hold a different set of values and/or beliefs than us. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

I told you months ago that your confessed beliefs were libertarian, you didn't believe me.....<br>
<br>
Your only problem is your choice of tools. To fix the problems of society you cant use governemnt.<br>
IT is like trying to shoot flies with a double barrel shotgun. You end up hurting more than you help.<br>
<br>
If you want society's problem solved you need to give someone an incentive to solve them and allow them to work unimpeded(sp?) Microwave ovens  and cellular phones were not mandated by law they were created by individuals who saw a need and rushed to fill it becuase they knew all their hard work would be rewarded.<br>
<br>
Poverty comes from an economy overun with barriers to wealth building and full of free handouts based on need instead of ability.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Imagine once again what would happen if in response to all the wizards in the norrath complaining about not being able to find a group and get xp that Verant announced that all wizards will automatically get one bubble of xp for every hour they have there lfg tag on. There would be a big pile of wizzies sitting on there asses afk getting to 60..<br>

I give him credit for single-handedly making our entire nation look like a laughingstock by the way he twisted the system to avoid paying for his crimes.  That's quite an accomplishment.  If you want to be judged a fool, that is.<br>
<br>
And yes, there are a few things he actually did that deserve credit.  But the economy was not one of them.  He did nothing for the economy.  I wasn't politically concious in the 70s or 80s... I have no idea how much the presidents and congress did or didn't do respectively.  I'm only 22 I don't have to know everything yet! :P<br>
<br>
And additionally, it is a logical fallacy to say that just because clinton was not in any way responsible for the economy that neither was reagan or whoever else.  I did not say anything about them.  I spoke out about Clinton only.  Making that kind of illogical leap is like saying just because Magiuos is a martial artist all enchanters in EQ are and nobody else in the entire world is.  It's absurd!<br>
<br>
But as "tolerance"... I have just said that you may do whatever you want.  I never said I would force anybody to do (or not do) anything.  That's God's job, not mine, and I wouldn't dream of trying.  But just because it is not my place to force anybody to do something does not mean I should "tolerate" evil.  There is a huge difference between keeping silent (which is giving tacit approval), and telling people the truth and letting them decide what to do with it.<br>

Most democrats do not know that the particular phrase isn't in the Constitution; rather, it's a personal opinion of Thomas Jefferson written in 1802.<br>
<br>
Here's the text regarding religion from the First Amendment:<br>
<br>
---<br>
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;<br>
---<br>
<br>
This does NOT say that religion will be removed from any and all government-operated functions.<br>
<br>
''The test may be stated as follows: what are the purpose and the primary effect of the enactment? If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion then the enactment exceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the Constitution. That is to say that to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion.&quot;  --Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 222 (1963). <br>
<br>
What the Constitution DOES say is that the government will enact no laws honoring or promoting any PARTICULAR religion as the official religion of the state.<br>
<br>
What this ALSO says is that the government will enact no laws INHIBITING the freedom of a person to exercise his religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
So, should it be illegal for my child's school to offer the students 15 minutes of &quot;prayer time&quot;, not advocating any particular religion, to use as a quiet reflection time?  No, of course not!<br>
<br>
In some &quot;progressive&quot; areas, uttering the &quot;p&quot; word sets off bells and lawsuits.<br>
<br>
I think what the &quot;progressive&quot; folks lack today is a tolerance.  Many of these activists believe that the first amendment exists only to suport the arguments which they support.  They believe that the First Amendment protects only their right to express the viewpoints that protect their cause and have repeatedly asked the courts, the public, and many other institutions to suppress the views of another organization to further their cause.<br>
<br>
Freedom is a right that carries a very big responsibility.  Freedom carries the responsibility of tolerance, an invidiual being able to tolerate another individual's right to express a viewpoint that he would spend his lifetime arguing against.<br>
<br>
It's rather ironic, but the first South Park Christmas special really exposed some of the crazed and wacky things that some members of society are promoting as building the &quot;wall of separation between church and state&quot;.  You should be able to sue your co-worker if he puts up a small Christmas tree in his office, because maybe you feel offended as a jew!  We can't see ANY signs of ANY celebration anywhere!  It might offend someone!  For God's sake (oops), is it really getting to the point where no one can display his or her beliefs for fear he may get sued?<br>
<br>
Is it really a case of &quot;you're allowed to believe what you want, as long as it's what I believe; otherwise, I'll sue you for infringing upon my rights&quot;?<br>
<br>

<br>
The government should not be in the school business.<br>
<br>
Property taxes should not be used to run schools. It is unfair to take money from citizens by force and pay for a system that doent benefit all. I have no children as of yet yet i still am taxedfor it. Other people pay rent and have children so they get a free education. And even worse other people pay taxes and private school tuition because government schools are ineffective.<br>
<br>
If you want your child to have the right to pray in school you should be able to send him/her to the school which most closely follows you own personal beliefs.<br>
<br>
If governments werent in the schol business then this point would be taken care of auatomatically by the free market.<br>
<br>
I have seen the governemnt school system up close and it isnt pretty.<br>
<br>
If you have an interest in learing how to privatize them I will describe it further in another post..<br>

<br>
Should it be a free and open market for schools?  Or should the government at least set up some framework for schooling?<br>
<br>
The federal government should have nothing to do with schooling.  I believe the states have a vested interest in the development of future generations within that state, though not to the point of open socialism and the lowest common denominator that seems to slow our education system down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umagiuos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magiuos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.larryelmore.com/images/Finished%20color/dl02.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/01 12:25:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Libertarianism vs. Progressive Democracy</span><hr size=1> The state should have no interest in doing anything but protecting your rights.<br>

The open market would produce schools that meet the public needs the same as any other company for profit. Those that meet the public's need will flourish ,those that dont will perish.<br>

It would be like arguing that the Second Ammendment only permits the militia to bear arms, and not private citizens or that a criminal defendant has no constitutional right to a fair trial because that term is not used.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, Jefferson first referenced the concept of seperation of church and state in a letter while President.  But our United States Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amdendment in such a way as to mandate such seperation.  The actual language of the First Amendment has been universally contrued as requiring that seperation, so while the actual words are not used, that is the affect of the First Amendment.<br>
<br>
In fact, if you want to be so narrow in your interpretation of the Constitution, you have NO religous liberty as that is contained no where in the document.  Surely you are not advocating that? <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

<br>
This will be a hard post to write...I don't mean to pick on you but some of your statements on this particular board need refuting....I do enjoy this dialogue and most people won't even venture into these arguments and I do respect your opinion...but....<br>
<br>
You stated that Gore wanted a 1 Trillion Dollar Tax increase and Bush wanted 1.6......I'm sure you just misspoke and meant they wanted a Tax reduction... you were trying to point out the similarities in the two parties....first let me say that a ship and a car both have steering wheels and engines....but that doesn't make them similar....my problem is how in the world could you say that??.....Even the most casual observer can remember from the debates that Gore wanted targeted Tax relief for some special cases and that to qualify you had to meet certain criteria....his plan was scored by OMB and was determined to be approximately .2 Trillion Dollars... or 200 Million....and he called Bushes plan for an across the board tax reduction of 1.3 Million as a risky scheme.....This is public information that can still be found on the web.......how can you say now that Gore wanted 1 Trillion.......only 2 explanations for it....either you weren't paying attention.....or you were misrepresenting the facts to make your point......and that is exactly my problem with most Liberals... and the media....facts (or so called facts) are just thrown out to elicit some kind of an emotional reaction... without regard for the truth...another example....you said Gore wanted Child proof trigger locks and back ground checks for gun purchases... but so did the NRA and Bush....legislation was presented in congress by the NRA to do just those things.....but that story was never presented by the biased media..... another example.....you said Gore wanted Federal Growth at 6%... Bush at 4%......in actuality the Republican Congress got rid of Base Line budgeting in 1994... that had no growth at an actual 12% growth rate...and it was only the Contract with America and the Republicans who got rid of that as an issue.....Liberals were looking at a 10% growth in School Lunch programs as a 2% cut... and would kill children.... or so the Liberals and the Media would claim.....To say that the parties are similar on these issues is a trip into the Twilight Zone and can't possibly be seriously presented if you have any respect for the truth.<br>
<br>
You said that the large amount of Republican defections show the utter lack of tolerance they have for the beliefs of others.  Yet you either don't know or do not care to admit that in the last 15 years there has been 12 Democrat defections and only 2 Republican defections.  I am talking about at the Federal level of course.  Again the media doesn't tell that story.<br>
<br>
You call &quot;absurd&quot; my statement that the Liberals are trying to get their agenda thru in the courts because they can't get it thru in the Legislature.......&quot;HELLO&quot;.......<br>
1.  Does the term......ROE V. WADE .... ring a bell.....<br>
2.  Liberals are taking school districts to court to restrict prayer in school.....<br>
3.  Environmentalist are taking land owners in Northern Calif to court to stop them from cutting their own trees down because of a Red Legged Frog...<br>
4.  Liberals attacked the Tobacco Industry in court ... a legal industry and a legal product....<br>
5.  Liberals attacked the Gun Industry in court.... a legal industry and a legal product....protected by the Constitution..<br>
6.  Gore personally was attacking the pharmaceutical industry to force price caps.... (shades of the energy crisis in Calif.)<br>
7.  Liberals used the Court system to push Affirmative action on Cities that had Laws prohibiting Discrimination for any reason.... but that doesn't deter Liberals from Court action.<br>
<br>
Talk about forcing your beliefs on our Society....you claim Republicans do... but look at all the instances where Liberals have an utter lack of tolerance for others beliefs.....(to use your words).<br>
<br>
Now onto Clinton.....<br>
<br>
For the 40 years that the House of Representatives was in the hands of the Democrats....our Federal Budget and therefore our Deficits got bigger and bigger...... In 1994 when Republicans took over the House... all of a sudden controls on spending were put into place...(Contract with America).. and the Deficits start declining......and a Surplus is in the Fiscal future of America.  Sure there are many reasons for the surplus.... but it cannot be denied that the fiscal restraints put into place are a major reason for the surplus....The only Fiscal item that Clinton did was the 1992 Tax Increase.....there was not one other fiscal policy he presented to Congress in 8 years.....He presented only one bill to solve our Education problem in this country and that was the School Uniform Bill......He presented not one solution for the Social Security Crisis that is in our future.....He had absolutely no legislation presented to solve our upcoming Energy Crisis.... He had no Energy Policy at all.... He avoided doing all these things because IMHO it would require making hard decisions and showing some Leadership... and that would have alienated some of his constituency... in other words he put his Political future ahead of his Responsibilities to Lead this Country....<br>
<br>
I wont and don't have to get into his lawlessness.....those things speak for themselves.  What I think is just plain old Brass Balls..... is he gets up for his last major speech and lists all of his accomplishments..... and he listed off most of the 10 items which were on the Contract With America.....I do think he did two things right...... his intervention in the Balkans saved many lives..... and Nafta was a good thing.... of course he had to side with Republicans to get it through Congress because the majority of Democrats voted against it....<br>

I did mean "cut" not "increase."<br>
<br>
As for the tax cut, Gore sought a 900 billion tax cut on a sliding scale to help the lower and middle class. Bush sought a 1.6 trillion.  They also differed over time as the Gore tax cut would be implemented faster than Bush.  Whatever, pennies no matter what and the point was both sought tax relief, protection of social security, commitment to schools, etc....<br>
<br>
As to Roe v Wade, and some of your other examples, how is that liberals pushing through an agenda?  Please Dantoma, let be honest about many of these cases.  The results, I concede, could be called a liberal result.  But it was not the Democratic party or liberals commencing the action.  Roe v Wade was about an individual seeking the right to choose.  In 1951 Linda Brown filed a lawsuit so she could attend her local school and that resulted in Brown v. Board of Education.  It was Rosa Parks who refused to go to the back of the bus, not a group of liberals.  The results might have caused liberals to cheer, but these are individual seeking to protect their personal rights.  As for prayer in school, again you generalize and say liberals.  Again, those that seek to  stop prayer in schoos are seeking to enforce the U.S. Constitution the same way the NRA seeks to enforce the Second Amendment.<br>
<br>
I have to leave soon, so can't respond to all your points now.  However, a couple of more nits before I leave.  The "gun industry" is not constitutionally protected by any means--no more so than our right to play EQ.  All these lawsuits you identify can be matched with similar cases brought by the far right, organizations like Larry Klayman and others.  The point?  There really is none other to further illustrate that both the Republicans and the Democrats all utilize the same mechanisms to further their platform.  <br>
<br>
And in closing, please read up in the power crisis in California and watch the lawsuits in which the electric wholesalers will be forced to refund the money they gorged.  You see, deregulation would have worked but for the greed of the wholesalers.  They rasied rates over 70 times the rates charged the year before--without any justification other than they could.  Where the power companies got in trouble was that they were capped o the rates they could charge the consumer, but had to pay insane and unlawful prices to the wholesalers who created the power shortage by wrongfully taking plants offline to create an artificial shortage, but who couldn't raise their own rates.  Had price caps been placed on the wholesalers we would have no crisis.  And, I should point out, this whole free economy bs about building plants, our power companies were building new plants over the past several years so clearly the economic incentive existed even with the partial pricecaps. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

<br>
Sorry, Spio, I 100% disagree with your analysis.<br>
<br>
Had the governments at the state, county, and local levels realized their responsibility to the citizens to plan for power in the face of arguments from the environmental groups and citizens who said 'not in my backyard', we would not be in this situation.<br>
<br>
Why, for 10+ years, has California's population exploded yet power output within California remained flat?  Because governments were bowing to all the groups who didn't want the power plants, yet wanted the power!<br>
<br>
Why did wholesalers raise their prices?  Because over the last 10 years, supply and demand went severely unbalanced, and it created a market opportunity.<br>
<br>
Why did the incumbents get into debt?  Because the government didn't truly de-regulate.  They capped prices.  Absolutely, 100% wrong approach.<br>
<br>
If the power industry were TRULY de-regulated today, here's what would happen:<br>
<br>
* Utilities would be open to raise prices to bill consumers for the price they must pay for electricity.<br>
* A great market opportunity is created to create more suppliers who will compete, in turn driving power costs down (this market doesn't exist today because there are too many risks involved, especially given the current state of regulation)<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it wouldn't be painful for a short while, but it's the result of the government not being responsible.<br>
<br>
California power deregulation is much like taking a town's only local grocery store and saying &quot;We'd like to see more grocery stores, but we're worried that your corner on the grocery market in this town will keep other grocery stores from coming in.  Therefore, you can only sell bread for 30 cents per loaf.  You'll also have to sell your bread machine to this other independent organization.&quot;  When the bread machine isn't enough to serve the town (townspeople &amp; greenpeace wouldn't let them have another), the stores have to seek bread elsewhere, at a higher price per loaf.  Their price to the consumer is still capped though.<br>
