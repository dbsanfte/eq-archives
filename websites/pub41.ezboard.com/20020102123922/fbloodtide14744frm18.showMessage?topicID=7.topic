What a grand name for a ship thought Tunaria leaning over the railing to gaze at the sparkling waters of the Ocean of Tears. The sun was warm, and the tang of the briny sea seemed to awaken in her a wide-eyed sense of wonderment. Her elven heritage was clearly visible. From her small stature, long angular face to the tips of her pointed ears. She was dressed in comfortable leathers, her stout oak staff, a gift from her mother, was resting along the railing within easy reach. Her face was lit with a sunny smile, as she stared outwards, taking in the feel of life here. So different than the land and forest, yet she could still feel the pulse and movement of those creatures below the waters. Some fast and shiny, others moving more slowly and majestically. She reached out with her mind and touched lightly one then the other, learning each of them as she went. This was, after all, a part of the goddess’s demesne and she was experiencing another facet of Tunare’s great realm. She reveled in the feeling of the wind caressing her body in the bright sunshine, seeming to be alive as it whipped her hair behind her, carrying all her worries away. there was something so serene about the ocean, a placid calm that spoke of peace, carrying the cares of the world away with it. She especially loved the sunsets, watching, as the sun seemed to slide into the dark waters of evening. A molten ball of red and gold, creating a glimmering path from the Sea King to it. then the cloak of night brought the stars out. Never before had she seen such a display of richness and beauty. Even from the quiet glades of the forest, there were always distractions. Creatures settling in to their beds for the night, the birds fluttering, and insects buzzing. Here on the open water, the sound of the waves lulled her with their monotonous symphony, she would look skyward and try to count the multitudes of stars. She had never reached more than 84 before nodding off to sleep on the decks, her head cushioned with her cloak.<br>
<br>
The ship cut the water like a knife, the waves slapping the hull with a quiet shush shush shush sound as they skimmed over the surface like an endlessly skipping stone. the ship bobbed up and down, but only a little, so fast was her course. Far from her homeland of Kelethin, this experience was so unlike the tree city that was the place of her birth. As a child she had learnt to step lightly, and surely. Balance was everything; especially racing along the swaying bridges that connected the platforms high above the forest floor. She had an easy childhood, playing with her friends, and riding endlessly up and down the great lifts. She thought back to those simpler times and smiled inwardly to herself. Yes, things had been so much simpler. then the calling had tugged at her. It wasn’t something that could be explained, but rather a feeling, something within her that communed with all the living things of the woodland. She had found her destiny. Tunare demanded that she serve, and she had gone willingly to the service of the druids. There she had learnt much lore, and much she was left to discover on her own. That was why she was journeying far from her home. To see and experience all parts of the great mother. To remain in isolation, her wizened tutor had told her, is to become as stagnant water. Soon fouled and corrupted. New ideas, fresh perspectives were always needed. It was a rite of passage, a ritual that all young druids endured. When they returned they would be questioned closely about their journey. What had they seen, what did they do, and most importantly of all, what did they learn. She was being careful to remember everything that happened, but it was so hard sometimes. Sometimes she just let herself flow with the day, living the experiences instead of analyzing them. This, she thought to herself, is what was behind the great wisdom of the circle of druids. For though much can be taught, there is so much that must be put into practice. Folding her arms along the railing, she stared off into the distant horizon, a contented smile on her face.<br>
<br>
* * * * * <br>
<br>
“Freeport dead ahead!” the lookout in the swaying crows nest high above the decks cried out. the cry was soon repeated by other deckhands who stopped their work momentarily to squint out over the sun splayed water at the growing port city to the west. the ship, heedless of the sailor’s excitement, continued her course with a creaking of wood, and the steady snap of the pennons posted on her masts. Her captain, a grizzled old sailor with a grey sandpaper growth of a beard on his cheeks walked to the tiller, and relieved the person on duty there. His hands gripped the wheel firmly, and Made slight adjustments as the city loomed larger and larger. It was at this time that Tunaria came up on deck, and looked towards the city with anticipation. She scampered up to the tiller and stood there looking out over the waves. Seagulls had appeared, crying their greetings. they swooped and turned in the air above the grand ship. the sailors, glad that their journey was almost at an end seemed to scurry about their tasks. Eager to make port for some well earned shore leave. “Furl the sails and break out the oars”, cried the captain. they moved surely as the sails were taken in, and with a heavy multitudious splash, the oars were dropped into the water and the men bent to the task of maneuvering the great ship to her mooring place.<br>
<br>
“Not to worry lass” said the captain noticing her fidgeting on the deck beside him,” We’ll have you ashore before long. the lads are good, and know their tasks well.”<br>
<br>
“I know captain, and I thank you for your kindness in allowing me passage on your ship” said Tunaria,” It’s just that I long to feel the earth beneath my feet again.” She knew that there was no way that she could possibly explain the sense of communion she felt with the earth mother when she was in direct contact with her.<br>
<br>
“Ah, ye landspeople are all alike” said the captain with a grin,”Ye enjoy the ocean fer a good outing, but the true majesty is only known to us sailors. Fer make no mistake, though she be a cruel mistress, all sailors have a love fer her.”<br>
<br>
Could it be that he too was a worshipper of Tunare she thought to herself in amazement. “You worship the earth mother as well captain?” she asked, her surprise showing clearly on her face.<br>
<br>
“Tunare?” asked the captain,” Nay lass, though I bow my head to all the gods, t’is the ocean that owns me heart. Fer she Made me her own since I was a wee lass, and some day she may take me to her bosom, but not today methinks. Now, clear my decks so that I can get this old tub into port, and you to yer goddess.”<br>
<br>
Eventually, they moored against the weather beaten docks of Freeport as the sun was setting. the gangplank was run out, and the sailors quickly took leave of the ship, though a few stayed behind to tend to the neverending tasks that maintain the well being of all ships. the sun was setting behind dark foreboding clouds as they broke off into small groups and headed out for a nights entertainment. It was thus that found Tunaria standing alone on the docks of Freeport. She shivered as a cold breeze passed across her and huddled more closely into her cloak. She glanced upwards and saw clouds, heavy with rain, and as dark as a cave, gathering over the great expanse of the city. There was more to her shiver, however, than just the weather. the earth had no feeling here. Even the waters near the docks were void of life. Rather, they seemed to give off a great sense of hunger. A presence she had never sensed before. It chilled her to the very bone. Even now she sensed eyes on her, and she glanced around nervously. then, realizing that there was nothing that could be done, she shouldered her pack, gripped her staff firmly and then pressed off to find lodgings for the night.<br>
<br>
* * * * <br>
<br>
It was raining. The water coming down in great sheets and running in rivulets through the coarse cobblestone streets. It carried with it assorted refuse and filth, but instead of clearing it out, it collected in blocked drains, and in corners. the sky was torn by great jagged rents of lightning and the peals of thunder resounded across the city. The wind had picked up to a ferocious strength as it hurled itself at the city. Shutters were clapped shut, and the heavy iron bells of the great temples rocked slowly in their steeples. Tunaria stood drenched in a doorway, her cloak hanging off her like a great weight so water laden was it. Her teeth chattered, and she slowly rubs her hands on her arms in a vain attempt to get some warmth and feeling back into them. She had lost her pack earlier in the evening when it had been snatched from her by a young ruffian. Though she had run after him, crying out for him to stop, he had eventually disappeared into the throng of people that didn’t even give the boy a second glance. All her money, her clothes, were gone. Even the trail rations that she had tucked away at the bottom of the pack were gone. Try though she might, there was not one innkeeper that had let her stay in their inn. She had promised to come back and pay for the room as soon as possible, but all had turned her down. A sympathetic barmaid had pressed a small loaf of bread into her hands at the last inn, and she had hungrily eaten it as the night grew longer and longer. Now she was here, wet, cold, and miserable in the middle of this human city. Even trying to make her way back to the docks, she had gotten lost, and the mean looks of the humans around her told her more plainly than a slap in the face that no help would be forthcoming. Few people were out at this time of night, and even less that usual, she surmised, because of the foul weather. She had approached a few, but they had all spurned her, and one had even spat at her. Surely, this wasn’t what the druids had in mind when they had sent her forth into the world. Strangers were always welcome in Kelethin. At the very least, they were given food and lodgings for the night. It was no wonder that her mother had warned her about the humans. Mean and spiteful, they seemed without even a respect for the earth mother that had given them life. Even now she could still feels eyes upon her. Looking around she spied a trio of people coming up the street. One of them held a shuttered lantern, swaying wildy in the wind, and they were talking to one another in loud raucous voices. As they approached, she resigned herself to make one last attempt and stepped forward.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me good sirs,” she started,” I am new to this city, recently from Kelethin across the great Ocean of Tears. I have no money, and was wondering if you know of a place that I could stay?”<br>
<br>
“Eh, wot’s this then?” said one of them looking at her with a rude stare.”Looks like we’ve got a poor lil’waif here as is lookin’ fer a place to stay.”<br>
<br>
“I know just where she can say,” said another with a leering grin<br>
<br>
“I…I..I must have been mistaken.” stammered Tunaria taking a step back from the obviously booze sotted men.<br>
<br>
The other, not quite so drunk one reached out a hand to grasp her arm, but she twirled her staff and gave him a sharp crack on the hand. “Don’t touch me!” she said as the man gave out a surprised grunt of pain, but then the other two had already pounced on her, and held her up against the door behind her. Her staff was wrested from her grasp and then tossed casually to the ground.<br>
<br>
“Let me go.” she squeaked in fear.<br>
<br>
“Listen here lass,” said the one rubbing at his smarting hand. “We’re going to go into this alley here and we’re gonna have some fun. You might even enjoy it…”<br>
<br>
“No, let me go!” she shouted squirming in their grasps as they hustled her into the filthy and shadow cloaked alleyway. the man followed behind his companions, the light of his lantern casting a garish caricature of her struggling form against the backdrop of the alley wall. Then the light went out…<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * <br>
<br>
The alleyway was plunged into darkness as the lantern shattered into a million pieces, it’s light flaring for a brief moment, and then washed away with the rain. the bearer lifted up the now useless handle, and then back down at the ground where the remains of the lantern had shattered. A brief flash of lightning revealed a straight wooden crossbow bolt firmly embedded in between two cobblestones. He glanced around swiftly, but never saw the dark form that dropped behind him on silent feet. Turning around to flee, he saw two cold, sinister eyes peering from beneath a black helmet rise up from the ground to meet him. “What the…”he started, but never finished his sentence as a cold grip of fear squeezed his heart. He tried to backpedal but his legs wouldn’t move. Looking down, he saw the shadow’s rapier, it’s shaft limmed in a flickering mystic flame protruding from his chest. He looked up for the last time, and saw only death, as blackness claimed him and he fell over into the filth and sewage.<br>
<br>
The other two, were too preoccupied with keeping the wood elf under control to have noticed their companions death. When one of them did finally turn to see what was keeping him, it was just in time to see him fall and the dark patch of shadow move forward toward him. It held a glowing rapier in it’s right hand, and a wicked looking spear in it’s left. Letting go of the girl, he snarled and ripped a heavy longsword from it’s sheath at his side. “If it’s killin’ ye be about this evening, then come and let’s see just who gits theirs tonight!” he roared charging the now stopped figure. He brought his sword down in a great skull splitting arc, then winced as twin pains flared along his thighs. His sword crashed into the ground, and he saw two neat slices along his legs. He brought up his sword again and swung in a straight line at the dark form’s head, but a seemingly negligent flip of the spear deflected his sword, and then pain lanced through him as his belly burned with fire. The rapier, unnoticed in his mindless swing had cut a neat furrow along his sizeable gut, and blood streamed down, soaking his rent overshirt. Completely overcome with rage and a burning desire to kill, he raised his arms over his head in a great swing, but the stranger was faster. The spear came up with blinding swiftness and took him in the throat. He gave on last burbling croak as his sword slipped from lifeless fingers to clatter upon the stone, seconds ahead of his corpse. The last man, turned in surprise, and thrust the girl from him down upon the heaps of trash. the dark man stepped over the corpse of his companion and looked at him. The eyes, they were as hard as agates. “Please,” blubbered the man,” don’t kill me. We were just looking to have a good time.”<br>
<br>
The figure didn’t move.<br>
<br>
“Take my money,” said the man,” You can have it all.”<br>
<br>
Still it didn’t move.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the man grabbed a dagger from the sheath at his back and flung it at the form before him.<br>
<br>
It moved.<br>
<br>
Swifter than an arrow, it dodged the hastily thrown knife and thrust in full extension at the remaining man. The rapier seemed to cut the air with a hissing sound and it sunk into the man’s chest with a meaty schlonk, piercing his heart.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” asked the man sinking to his knees with his last gasp of breath.<br>
<br>
“Justice.” It said, kicking the dying man off his blade with one black booted foot.<br>
<br>
The figure stepped over the last man, and went to the crying girl. Kneeling down, he whispered softly, “ Are you alright? Did they do anything to you”<br>
<br>
“No, I’m alright I think” said Tunaria sniffing and wiping her nose with one wet arm. “ Who are you? What do you want from me?”<br>
<br>
“ My name is Kaldow. Kaldow Shadowstalker” he replied taking off his dark helm. His locks were as raven black as his armor, and his close cropped beard had twin streaks of grey on either side of his mouth. “Those scum won’t be bothering you again. Not you or anyone else for that matter. It’s late for someone like you to be about in the city. Come, I can take you to a place of safety. You’ll find shelter from the storm and food to eat.”<br>
<br>
He extended his hand to her, and she slowly accepted his aid in righting herself. As she got up, she noticed a gleaming medallion hanging from a small golden chain about his neck. they stopped to collect her staff and then set off in the rain.<br>
<br>
“Where are we going?” asked Tunaria already feeling a sense of hope that she might actually live to see the dawn, “ Why did you help me?”<br>
<br>
“Let me tell you of the Blood Tide.” said Kaldow, “ We have a chapterhouse here in the northern quarter of the city.”<br>
<br>
“The, B..B..Blood Tide?” she asked apprehensively<br>
<br>
“Fear not, the name is more fierce than the people there. Though we are a proud gathering, our strength is in our hearts, and not in arms” he said motioning to his sheathed blades, “ But come, it is late and all your questions will be answered come the morn’. Perhaps, one day, you will even be one of us gentle druid.” said Kaldow with a smile. As the duo passed the third gate, the rain relented it’s fury and stopped. the skies cleared, and for the first time that evening, the stars shone their otherworldly rays down upon them. Surely, an omen for better times ahead.<br>
<br>
Tunaria, looked upwards to the stars, murmuring to herself, “One, two, three, four, five…”<br>
<br>
“What are you doing?” asked Kaldow amusedly<br>
<br>
“Counting the stars.” She replied<br>
<br>
“Ah…I see.” Said Kaldow with an impish grin.<br>
<br>
She playfully swatted at his arm, and then smiled. Yes, truly there was hope for the future now. If this Blood Tide was as interesting as the rogue next to her, then she would definitely have many tales to bring back with her to Kelethin when she returned.<br>
