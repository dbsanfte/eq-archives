valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Everlasting existence?</span><hr size=1> It seems to me, that the only real reason to be concerned with the existence of God, is if one believes in eternal life.  If our existence is actually limited to the life we spend on earth, should I really care if there is a God or not?  If I cease to exist as a sentient being at the time of my bodily death, why should I care if there IS a God out there?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask these questions is because, I have yet to find any indication that there is something &quot;eternal&quot; about my eixstence.  I don't have any recollection of events that happened &quot;before&quot; my birth.  The world &quot;eternal&quot; is defined as &quot;Being without beginning or end; existing outside of time&quot;.  (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=eternal)">www.dictionary.com/search?q=eternal)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  If my &quot;soul&quot; was created within this space-time continuum at the time of conception, surely it is confined within this space-time continuum and is not eternal?<br>
<br>
I think it is either wishful thinking, fear of death, or outright arrogance to think that we are in some way immortal.  As far as I can tell, I did not exist in any meaningful way (as a sentient being) before conception, why should I believe that I should continue to exist as a sentient being after my body decomposes?<br>
<br>
Honestly, if I won't &quot;live&quot; forever in some meaningful fashion, I really could care less even if God DID exist.  His existence would be irrelevant (to my situation).  I'm curious what makes people think they will exist forever ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uganndon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ganndon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/6/02 3:03:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=534>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everlasting existence?</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
The creator of the creator is an infinite loop and not graspable by humans at the present time.<br>
<br>
The existence of God, IMO, is fully seated in ones faith, if one chooses to have faith.<br>
<br>
The existence of organized religion is a tool to control other men into conforming to their perceived societal and class ranks.<br>

Ganndon, smoking weed isn't that good I'm afraid =P Instead of debating at max mental capacity, you debate without short-term memory. Which while amusing for the sober ones in the room, really accomplishes nothing =)<br>
<br>
I'd have to agree with you Herder, believing in God is a personal choice. Organized religion is less allowing you to choose to believe what you will and more about pushing their beliefs of what is 'right' in that particular faith. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uganndon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ganndon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/7/02 5:05:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=537>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everlasting existence?</span><hr size=1> i think you missed my point, if your stoned you can concentrate on the larger mysteries of life.

I mean, personally, to you. <br>
I don't care if you believe in God or Heaven, just what is everlasting paradise?<br>
<br>
Personally, I hope that wherever I go, it's somewhere wild. I mean, wild like woods and nature, not wild like some nightclubs. I've seen enough of THAT in this lifetime. I want to be able to speak to everyone I've ever loved that had passed on before me, and I can think of a few people that I've never actually met, that I'd like to talk to as well. Savador Dali comes to mind...<br>
Also, I want to be reunited with all the pets I've lost over the years. To be able to play with and pet them all, and know that when I leave them, they'll be safe. <br>
There is no violence. Maybe interesting analytical debate, and discussion, but nothing harmful. <br>
There is no crime, because, of course, there is no coveting- everyone has exactly what they need. <br>
<br>
NO TOOTH DECAY!!!<br>
<br>
I've believed for a while now, that when my time comes, it'll be sort of like how Tom Robbins describes it in Jitterbug Perfume. <br>
I'll be transported to a sort of waiting station on a river. A lot like a train station. There is a line of people and I step to the end of the line. When I get to the front, there is a sort of angel there, or spirit, or whatever, and she is standing just on the other side of a table with a scale on it. On one side of the scale is a single feather, the other side is empty. She reaches towards me, and when she pulls her hand back, she is holding my heart in her hand. She places my heart on the empty sid eof the scale. If my heart is lighter than the feather, I am allowed to get on a boat that will take me to... beyond... Heaven.. paradise...Olympus... wherever it is you go when your time to move on has come. However, if my heart is too heavy, I am lead to another boat, and I am reborn in this world as another person, and I must correct the mistakes I made the last time around until it's time to be judged again. <br>
The trick is, I don't know what mistakes I made and can't avoid them unless I know instinctively what they are. <br>
<br>
I just think there's too much intolerance in the world. Period. I think the religious people are too intolerant of the atheists and agnostics and the religious people, and I think that atheists and agnostics are too intolerant of the religious people. Not to say everyone's like that, it's a broad generalisation, but on the whole I think it's a fair call to make.  <p><center>

I feel like I should speak out though so everyone can become more aware.<br>
<br>
Most of you will probably be skeptical that what i'm about to post is truth. I suppose many will call me crazy. But I dunno, maybe most ppl will believe me.<br>
<br>
I don't spread this info around in my real life for obvious reasons. The last thing i want to do is be ridiculed.<br>
<br>
Anyway here goes...<br>
<br>
<br>
There are 2 things in my life that Prove to me the existence of God. Now, this may not be God in the conventional sense because I don't fully understand it myself. But there is Something greater than ourseleves. There is something beyond our comprehension that we may never discover.<br>
<br>
You might wonder how the existence of a supernatural concept of God or Something was proven to me. I'll try to explain as best I can.<br>
<br>
The 2 things I spoke of earlier are this:<br>
<br>
1. My dreams<br>
2. Flashes<br>
<br>
I'll explain them both in turn.<br>
<br>
1. My dreams - ever since I was a child I've had odd dreams. As I went through life living in different places and meeting different people, many strange things would be in my dreams. I suppose I was about 9 when I became aware of what was happening. <br>
<br>
Brace yourself...I was dreaming the future. It's happened so many times that i've come to trust it. I have countless times dreamed of where I would be one day. There's never any sound. I see rooms and objects and people. When I dream them I usually have no clue what or where or who they are. As the months go by tho they occur and I remember dreaming about it. For the most part It's nothing terribly specific or important. It's not like I've dreamed that G. Bush would be president, but more like one day I'd be sitting in the living room of a new friend.<br>
<br>
One explanation for this could be that I am simply recalling something that just happened to me and that my brain is confusing it with a dream i once had. That i'm not really dreaming the future, but my mind is mixing it up with the present and past dreams. I would tend to agree with this theory if it wasn't for the flashes.<br>
<br>
2. Flashes - I get these on average 1 per week. I don't have much warning that they are about to happen. Usually only a few moments. I get a strong scent in my nose that's unlike anything. It doesn't compare to food, nature, or anything. I get a solid hum in my mind that doesn't make sound but covers me like a warm blanket. My gut gets tense as though I were sick. This is what happens just before i get the flash.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, most of the time I feel perfectly normal before they happen and I feel ok, if not disturbed, when they go away.<br>
<br>
This is how I feel during the flash. I have to completely stop what i'm doing. If i'm playing EQ i have to steady myself against the wall and chair and look away from the computer while i close my eyes. It's impossible to concentrate on anything but the flash. This may sound weird, but it's like a warm blanket that you can't feel. It's completely disturbing and unpleasant. It is not something i enjoy in the least.<br>
<br>
Now, what is the flash actually about? I'll tell you. I get flashes and images in my mind. I get a rush of feelings and feel things i've never felt at any point in my life. It's extremely odd. I get images and textures of people and places. But it's not like a future. It's like something that I've already experienced. It's like i'm getting some supernatural flashback of a previous life or some insight on something that we just can't normally see or feel. It's extremely hard to put into words.<br>
<br>
When this happens to me I just know. I can't say why or how but i KNOW. What do i know? I'm not even completely certain. It's like i know there is Something other than what we can perceive. There is another demension or God or something. I feel it. I know it's there.<br>
<br>
Usually when these flashes occur everything is perfectly clear to me. For the duration of the flash I know what it's about. I know what i'm remembering or seeing. Once the flash ends I lose my grasp on that. Afterwards I can only remember that I knew what what it was about when it happened.<br>
<br>
It occurs like that every single time without fail. I know that i'll understand for the time of the flash and that i'll lose it when it goes away. It's frustrating.<br>
<br>
For those of you that have branded me a lunatic by now, let me state a few things. I've never done drugs. I don't do drugs. I eat and live responsibly. I treat my body with respect.<br>
<br>
Also i've been to the doctors for years. I've had all sorts of tests done and no one can figure out why the things happen to me that happen. That is also frustrating.<br>
<br>
I don't know what all this means in the big picture. I don't know if i have some sort of insight into things that we have yet to discover. Maybe I am crazy.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you this though. Everything that i spoke of is reality. It happens to me. I can only hope one day I can fully understand it.<br>
<br>
Anyway i guess that's all i have to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/02 9:27:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=542>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.texasranger.org/Fake_Badges/Final/Badgerepl(1).jpg Height=100 Width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well here goes</span><hr size=1> hrmmmphh, I really didn't want to post this but since Whispered did..../sigh.  I have had the those same kind of dreams Whispered all my life.  They were a lot more frequent as a child and pretty much stopped for the five or so years when I was in my hardcore pot-smoking, ecstacy stage, but have started to come back as I have begun to chill out again.   They are EXACTLY as you desrcibed, just a small snippet of something terribly innane, but at the same time very specific and vivid.  I will wake up and totally forget about it but then a month or so later the exact dream will happen and you can totally recall dreaming this.  Most people would call this deja-vu, but these things are a lot more specific to simply be called deja-vu.  I don't know it's really hard to convey this in words, but I have the feeling Whispered knows exactly what I am talking about.<br>
<br>
As a kid these dreams and a couple other extra-sensory experiences caused me to believe in God, specifically a Christian God since I lived in a small Oklahoma bible-belt Baptist town.  I went through the whole routine for a couple years, but it just never felt quite right,  the hypocrisy and judgemental attitude of not only the people, but the whole religion itself (see Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson) sstarted to turn me off.  It also didn't help that I have had a love and fascination for Astronomy and Cosmology since i was a young boy.  My uncle has been a scientist at Jet Propulsions Laboratory since i was seven and he would always send me the brand new photos and stuff that they were receiving from the Voyager/Viking/Galileo etc satellites that they were playing with at the time.  Anyway my point is that I became a scientist in the way i anylize things, and seeing the hypocrisy on the Christians, I formed my own view of God and the universe through my own personal experiences and theories rather than 90% of humanity that are told something when they are 5 years old and accept it the rest of their lives.  For those that haven't botherered to read the whole thread and my previous posts from months ago, I am kind of a quasi Buddhist with a big dose of Sagan heh. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:papyrus;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'10pt'">

admitedly, the majority of people in the US CLAIM to be christian. however, ive met plenty of muslims, hindis, buddhists, taoists, a wiccan, and so on. <br>

<br>
If Christians would just shut the fuck up and let the OTHER religions do their own thing, the world would have a lot less grief.<br>

Again, &quot;Freedom of religion as long as you worship my white-anglo-saxon-protestant god&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
