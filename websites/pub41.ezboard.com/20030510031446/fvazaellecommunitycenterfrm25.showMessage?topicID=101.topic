They are utterly screwing up the server's high-end tailoring market and not being subtle about it at all.<br>
Prices on any items are being drastically undercut, and it he's matched, undercut again. The profit in producing said items is just plummeting.<br>
But here's another thing.<br>
This person is GROSSLY ramping up prices on high-end supplies. Like, in some cases 4X going rate or more. Don't buy from him then, you say? Not quite that easy. What happens is, unfamiliar_loothaver_01 comes in with Storm Rider Blood and doesn't know how to price it. He checks and sees Robynhood has some at 4k. So he lists his at 3.5k, thinking he's offering a good price. But Storm Rider Blood has traditionally gone for 1k until Robyn's recent antics. So now ANOTHER person comes in and sees THOSE two prices and matches 3.5k. Soon it's up across the board and suddenly an item has quadrupled in price in the bazaar. What Robynhood is effectively doing is locking out aspiring tailors who need to buy any high-end supplies. I am seeing this tactic work with item after item.<br>
So this combination of drastic undercuts on finished prices to bone established tailors AND escalating prices on raw goods to bone up-and-coming tailors is just trashing the tailoring market. Except, of course, for Robynhood. Competition is one thing, but this is a blatant and malicious attempt to utterly dominate a fairly expensive and difficult trade. I worked hard to get to GM level stuff and now it looks as though I cannot sell a single piece because of this player's actions unless I totally lowball HIM, at which point my profit is destroyed and there's no point in having done it at all.<br>
<br>
Any ideas on what can be done to salvage the situation? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aazamon>Aazamon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/03 9:24:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jollyroger.org/images/jonnyroger_button.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Robynhood - Bazaar Permamule, Info Needed</span><hr size=1> Levitate him, push him to the arena and kill him?<br>

Wait - that was nerfed...<br>
<br>
He's probably also buying up cheaper priced components specifically to either use himself or turn around and mark up, thus making himself the only person capable of producing these items at a reasonable price.  Once he's driven the other tailoring vendors out of regular circulation, I'd expect to see his prices start climbing with the reasoning of &quot;well, no one else has it for sale&quot;<br>
<br>
Only thing I can think of that might help a bit is keeping your prices consistent, using /auc to peddle your wares for the impulse buyer and if you see him browsing your wares while you're at your computer, click off trader mode so he can't snatch up your goodies... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jollyroger.org/images/jon_name.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brunansky>Brunansky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/03 11:37:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Robynhood - Bazaar Permamule, Info Needed</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>if you see him browsing your wares while you're at your computer, click off trader mode so he can't snatch up your goodies... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

As I am recently working my way up to the GM tailors club, I'd like to find out who's this person also.<br>
<br>
I've heard him buy low sell high (300pp each yew leaf), I know no matter how badly I need materials, I'll never buy from this guy.  There will always be people out there sell at the reasonable price.  It will take time to find them, but they are out there.  I will be more than happy to work with any of the GM tailors out there to ensure the market.  <br>
<br>
Another thing is, I've noticed the price has reduced on Ceremonial Solstice Robe in bazaar, some one has name started with P (dont remember fullname atm), seems always sell low.  I am not saying P has anything to do with Robynhood, but you can tell P is using the robe to train skills and makes mass quantity, robynhood is the new mule who buys low sells high on tailoring components/items, coincidence?  Maybe, but I will not ignore the connection between those 2 chars though. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=376166">Raiya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Does this ring a bell with anyone?<br>
<br>
As always when I see a new active tailor, I gave him many opportunities to show professional courtesy, or at least common sense, and he screwed up each opportunity. This guy lacks the gene for common sense, and is a prime example of why brothers and sisters are not supposed to make babies together.<br>
<br>
After lying, stalling, and otherwise yoinking off, he finally admitted in tells to me (this was a couple months ago) that he just simply hates all GM tailors and wants to make them lose money. Which is odd, because he has to be close to a GM tailor himself to make the stuff he makes; maybe he bought an ebayed tailor or something.<br>
<br>
It's possible he may be Nebucoonezzar, since they both show the same extreme lack of civility to other tailors and zero enlightened self interest, but this is only one possibility.<br>
<br>
Anyway after all my dealings with this goofwad I've decided he must be in it for the attention. So my suggestion is that you ignore his lame prices and his tells, if he sends you any. Think &quot;Venthos of the tailoring world.&quot; He's an attention-starved dork; pay him no heed.<br>
<br>
Like Raiya, I'm happy to discuss these sorts of things in-game in a civil and friendly manner. Happy tailoring and good sales to all tailors with common sense out there!<br>

Because if you've got some problem with this person trying to control market prices your best way of keeping them from doing so is to keep them from buying up everything they have.  Someone else will buy it, you'll get your money and you don't help the person whose been undercutting everyone else.<br>
<br>
Not that it would work perfectly anyway, not many people monitor their mules while in trader mode, and the buyer can just come back later when you've left it.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jollyroger.org/images/jon_name.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/2/03 4:52:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Robynhood - Bazaar Permamule, Info Needed</span><hr size=1> If it's worth it for him to do this and he is making money doing so, then it's competition at its best.

I for one am glad that there is someone bringing prices down.  It's in the best interests of consumers.<br>
<br>
Imagine complaining that walmart was ruining the market by selling things at a good price to consumers, how awful of them to cut into other people's profits.  If you want price controls America is not the place for you.<br>

He does things like buy up tailoring supplies and put them on sale at 5x or 10x the previous cost just to bug other tailors. That's how he gets his jollies.<br>

I wanna apologize to Nebuconnezzar for my comments tentatively linking the two. That was just random speculation on my part.<br>

I'm not sure I even care who the real Robynhood is. One thing for sure, he's obviously too much of a coward to come out from behind his veil of dorkish anonymity. Maybe he's a mule some otherwise &quot;respectable&quot; tailor is using to have a little childish fun at the expense of the real tailors out there?

<br>
BUT<br>
<br>
Who gives a fuck?<br>
<br>
Pricing is set by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.  No one has the power to substantially alter pricing except by altering these curves.<br>
<br>
I'm just not that concerned that he can have any meaningful effect on the market other than to bring it to efficiency which is where it should be anyways.  Stuff should sell at the highest price people will pay for it.  If it sells for less, then it's underpriced.<br>
<br>
Now if he chooses to buy things at the efficient price and sell at an absurdly high price, he'll price himself out of the market.  It will just cause him to dump assloads of plat into buying stuff, which will raise the efficient market price slightly, but not to nearly as high a level as he is trying to sell it at.  This will just cause him to burn plat while he attempts to artificially bolster the market price on the items.  Eventually he runs out of plat as no one has an infinite amount, the demand curve shifts down drastically and quickly, and now he's sitting on merchandise that cost him maybe 500kpp and is worth about 100kpp.  So he's just lost a ton of plat.<br>

It's something like the devaluation of the Thai Bhat in the summer of 1998.  Thailand was pegging the currency.  This means that in order to keep the price of the Thai Bhat higher than it was suppoed to be in an efficient market, they were buying Thai Bhat at a fixed (pegged) amount of dollars.  For a time this kept the currency at a fixed and stable value.  However, maintaining this cost the country a lot of money.  In the end, they ran out and couldn't sustain it, so they had to announce the currency would go unpegged and would be subject to market forces.  The Bhat devalued to by something huge like 80 percent in a matter of a day and the country of Thailand had just burned through massive cash reserves in the process, doing no one any good.<br>
<br>
There is really nothing to worry about, people cannot sustain a market shift on any items unless they have a monopoly on the supply or demand of/for that item, which is not the case for this guy.  If his pricing is really as absurd as you all seem to think (and I agree) just give him a bit of time and he'll end up broke.<br>
