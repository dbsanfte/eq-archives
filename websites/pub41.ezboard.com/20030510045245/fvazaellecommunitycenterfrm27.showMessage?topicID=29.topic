Eva asked me, rolling onto her stomach and looking up at me with those huge baby blues, offering me a beautiful view down along her naked back to her perfect posterior. Ready to do it again? Hells, I was still recovering from the last time. But yet I felt myself rising to the occasion. Ah, what a wonder is the male sex organ. It does more of my thinking for me than I do.<br>
<br>
A glance at the wind-up clock next to Eva's bed made the decision for me. I was an hour late.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gotta go.&quot; I apologized, springing out of bed. I pulled on my pants as Eva pouted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, Lennon.&quot; she purred when she saw she wasn't going to guilt me back to her more than ample bosum. &quot;Don't you want to stay?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, yes, I thought. &quot;Nope. Can't do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What, have to get back to the wife or something?&quot; she teased.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, actually, yes.&quot; I replied rather sheepishly.<br>
<br>
The ashtray hit me between the eyes before I could register she threw it. It drew blood. My head reeled. Damn, what an arm she had!<br>
<br>
&quot;You son-of-a-bitch!&quot; she screamed. &quot;When did you get married?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, last week.&quot; I managed, trying to button up my shirt without passing out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Last week?!&quot; She was livid. The lamp followed the ashtray. Fortunately I was bending over to pull on my shoes, and it sailed over my head to shatter against the wall. More fortunately, it wasn't lit, or the room would light up like a torch from the spilled oil.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is she?&quot; she demanded, picking up one of her shoes. I eyed the wicked heel on it and put up both my hands in supplication.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eva, put down the shoe.&quot; I could just see that heel buried in my eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is she?&quot; she repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alyssa Thissel.&quot; I replied, closing my eyes. Maybe she would miss.<br>
<br>
Nothing happened. I opened one eye. Eva had dropped the shoe and was staring at me with disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alyssa Thissel?&quot; she asked slowly. &quot;Your dead partner's wife?&quot;<br>
<br>
I winced at the implication. &quot;Yeah, Ice's wife.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shouldn't you have waited until he was dead at least three weeks?!&quot; Here came the shoe. But I was ready for it, and it sailed to my left.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a long story...&quot; I tried, but she was reaching for the other shoe.<br>
<br>
Grabbing my badge and crossbow, I bolted for the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;And she's a Drow!&quot; I heard from inside the house, punctuated by the shoe bouncing off the closed door. Then another lamp.<br>
<br>
I shook my head sadly and walked home.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 6:52:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> Alyssa Thissel, (Alyssa MORDRIL, I corrected myself), was now my new wife, having only been widowed three weeks since my partner was killed by a dagger to the heart. It's not as cold-blooded as it sounds; I didn't just take the opportunity to wed my deceased friend's wife. If it were up to me, I would have just gone to the funeral and given her a shoulder to cry upon. But Alyssa and Danell &quot;Ice&quot; Thissel were Drow, the black elves, and they have a custom bordering on religion called Blood Oath. Blood Oath allows a dying man to enlist another to avenge his death. Upon avenging that death, however, the man enlisted takes on all the responsibilities of the dead man, including marrying his wife and raising his children. I was the man Ice named in his dying breath. He didn't have any children (thank gods) but Alyssa was now mine to support. Not that I really mind. Alyssa was a good friend before the tragedy, and I would have helped out anyway I could, but taking TOTAL responsibility was another thing altogether. I had to let go of my bachelor pad and move into her house in order to reduce financial expenses. I sleep in the guest room, of course. Alyssa may be a beautiful woman, but she was my best friend's wife, and red-blooded or not, the thought of sleeping with her didn't cross my mind. Much. Not that I would have gotten anywhere anyway. Drow only have sexual relations to reproduce, and one addition to my household was enough for now. Plus, Alyssa would probably knock my head off if I tried anything anyhow.<br>
<br>
My salary as a detective for the Guard would just pull us by. My new partner, Filbin Rucksack, was less than an ideal replacement for Ice. Filbin was a kip, a race that looked like seven year old human children, only with beards and moustaches. And this particular kip had an attitude problem. He didn't smoke, didn't drink booze, didn't chase women, played by ALL the rules. More to the point, he didn't believe in ANY of the ideals that I held dear. And furthermore, he was allergic to DOGS.<br>
<br>
Big deal, you say. Well, it IS. It's difficult enough dealing with Mr. No Fun Rucksack. But I'm a lycanthrope, a closet werewolf that turns into a shaggy beast when my world's two moons are full at the same time. It's my well kept secret, known only by Alyssa and me, but if Filbin started having a sneezing fit every night he's out with me....well, it might not stay a secret for long.<br>
<br>
He and every other cop on the Guard are looking at me strangely now anyway. Marrying your partner's wife after only three weeks of his death isn't very prudent. Not if you can't let them know about Blood Oath. Most people in Silverdane wouldn't care about any Drow customs anyway, since they consider the Drow almost a sub-species because of the color of their skin. But on top of that, I'd have to explain that I was the one that murdered Vilgore, the man who killed Ice. As it is, they think that a wild dog ripped him apart. If I told the truth, not only would I be shunned by the town and lose my job for being a rabid werewolf, but I'd be thrown in jail for overriding the justice system and murdering a suspect in cold blood. Not that he didn't deserve it.<br>
<br>
I arrived at the end of the block and looked up at Ice's cottage (MY cottage, I corrected myself. I'm paying for it now).<br>
<br>
It was a nice home, as warm inside as the Drow could manage. They were a strange race, the Drow were. Silver hair, pointed ears, and almost expressionless silver eyes. A beautiful race once you got past the jet black skin and the prejudice that accompanied it. <br>
<br>
I went inside to greet my wife.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 6:54:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> &quot;You're late for dinner. &quot; Alyssa said, taking her empty plate to the wash area. She didn't look angry. My plate sat at my spot at the table. My food would be ice cold by now, but that was the price I paid for coming home late. I would just have to get used to that. And a few other things.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; she said, washing her dish, &quot;Did you have a good time with your girlfriend?&quot; A smile played across her lips. I squirmed in my seat. Every day I recieved this question, and I still couldn't shake off the feeling that I shouldn't be seeing anyone. But Hells, we had discussed this on our uneventful wedding night. I would go out and get my sex whenever I wished, as long as I didn't leave her up all night thinking I had wolfed out somewhere. It didn't make it easier.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I almost got killed by a shoe when I told Eva I was married.&quot;<br>
<br>
She broke into the giggles. Before I married her, I wouldn't have thought her capable of laughter. Just not a Drow thing. &quot;When are you going to stop telling the truth, Lennon?&quot;<br>
<br>
I mumbled something into my fork. She quieted the giggles and continued to clean the pots. Then she looked up, suddenly remembering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, by the way, Relgin stopped by. He wants to see you first thing tomorrow morning when you report to work.&quot;<br>
<br>
Relgin Berringer was my captain at work, a four-foot tall white haired dwarf with a full flowing beard and moustache, and a temper like an active volcano. He rarely made housecalls, unless I was in trouble. I used to get LOTS of housecalls.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did he want?&quot; I asked, concerned. I pushed the plate away from me. I'd just have to heat it up later. <br>
<br>
&quot;He wouldn't say.&quot; she replied. She dried the last pot and put it away on a shelf. Then she turned to face me. &quot;You know, everyone's been looking at us funny since the marriage, including Relgin, but this time he wouldn't even look me in the eye. Like he was embarrassed or something. He said for you not to come by tonight, it wasn't that important that it wouldn't wait until the morning. I offered him some coffee but he said his wife would kill him if he didn't get home.&quot; <br>
<br>
That sounded like Relgin's wife, but the Captain never passed on a cup of coffee. My concerns grew.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope everything's all right.&quot; Alyssa said, heading toward the bedroom. &quot;I'm going to sleep. See you tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wrapped up my meal and put it in the ice chest. Relgin's behavior had me unnerved. My appetite was gone. I looked over my shoulder at the bedroom door, and then to the guestroom where I would be staying. What did Relgin want?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm glad SOMEONE will be sleeping tonight.&quot; I muttered, and headed off to bed. <br>

I stood waiting patiently with my hands clasped behind my back. Relgin tossed the papers to the floor and asked again. A small, childlike head poked its way into the office. It was my partner, Filbin. His moustache and beard looked like it was drawn on.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll get it, boss.&quot; he offered. Relgin grunted and Filbin scampered off. What an ass-kisser.<br>
<br>
Relgin wouldn't look at me as we waited in uncomfortable silence for Filbin to return. He did after two fidgety minutes, and after placing the cup ceremoniously in front of Relgin, waited for us to begin. One glare from the Captain informed him he would not get to watch me being chewed out. With a sad look he silently exited the office. Regin followed him to the door and closed it as he left. Then he returned to his desk and folded his massive arms across his chest. His eyes wandered everywhere but on me. I cleared my throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, chief, this meeting was your idea, remember?&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked startled, but recovered, to a degree. &quot;Ah, yeah...&quot; he said in that deep voice of his. &quot;Well, Lennon, I called you in here because...well...&quot; He finally looked at me. &quot;Well, we have a rather large problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I didn't think you wanted to get together for a poker game.&quot; I replied. &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; he said, taking a deep breath. I wondered if I was fired. &quot;Well, Zo is suing the department for you pulling that crossbow on him last month.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah.&quot; I said, not too surprised. Zo was a special informant for the Guard, a walking library of information. He was also a wizard of rather high reputation and stature in Silverdane. And, more importantly, he was a thief when it came to the ridiculous prices he charged us for his information. On my last case things had gotten a little out of hand with Zo, and I held a loaded crossbow to his head in order to get some crucial information. I expected a lawsuit the moment I did it, but I wasn't quite myself at the time. But for Relgin to beat around the bush for something like this was unusual. Zo was ALWAYS suing someone for something.<br>
<br>
&quot;What else?&quot; I asked, and waited. A full minute passed, and then Relgin got right to the point.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've been implicated in the murders of Ot-Ot Demonspawn and your partner, Ice.&quot;<br>
<br>
My jaw hit the floor. <br>

<br>
Relgin stared at me sadly. &quot;I know what you TOLD me, Lennon.&quot; The tone set me aback<br>
.<br>
&quot;Ice and I went to the Brimstone Club to find Ot-Ot so he could testify against Vilgore as a witness to a murder. When we got there Ot-Ot was already dead with his throat cut. The same person...VILGORE...then killed Ice with the same dagger. Vilgore's dead now. End of story.&quot; I looked at him, daring him to contradict me. Which he did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lennon,&quot; he started softly. &quot;This is all what YOU told me. You also claimed you didn't actually SEE Vilgore there.&quot; Which I didn't; I SMELLED Vilgore, but I wasn't about to tell him I was a werewolf. &quot;Also, the city has over a dozen witnesses that will claim you killed Ice and Ot-Ot walked in on it, so you killed him too.&quot; This took me for a loop. &quot;And finally,&quot; he added uncomfortably, &quot;The fact that you married your partner's wife three weeks after his death does not make you look very good.&quot;<br>
<br>
That silenced any retort on my part. I wanted to scream out that I only married her because I avenged Ice's death, but I would only succeed in admitting to ANOTHER murder. Instead I just looked at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, Lennon.&quot; he said when it seemed I would remain silent for the rest of the day. He got up from his desk and poked his head out the door. Two guards entered the room. With shackles. <br>
<br>
Relgin solemnly took my crossbow from me. My hands were bound behind me. Relgin's face looked sick. <br>
<br>
He reached into my pocket and withdrew my badge. I felt like I might throw up. He would not meet my eyes. And worse, I could not meet his.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have the right to remain silent.&quot; he intoned. I had said the same thing a million times before. I never thought I'd have it said to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you choose to give up this right, anything you may say will be held against you in the High Court.....&quot;<br>
<br>

Grey stone walls, a bucket for waste, and bars. Bars I was only familiar with from the other side. Now I was on the inside, and feeling extremely sorry for myself.<br>
<br>
Fortunately Relgin had the good sense not to throw me into the holding cell with the other prisoners we kept. Most of those were habitual offenders, and I had previously arrested at least half of them. A night in lockup and I'd be ripped to pieces. The cell I was in was a special cell meant for extremely dangerous criminals, so I had it all to myself. I didn't know whether that was good or bad.<br>
<br>
What was I going to do? I didn't expect the trial to go badly. Only a loaded jury would find me guilty once the facts came out. The witnesses must all be hybrids, and a normal citizen should begin to doubt a hybrid the moment it opens its mouth. Ot-Ot Demonspawn, my late informant, was a hybrid. Hybrids were a cross breed between raped human females and demons from the lower planes. Only a few were born, but they tend to multiply like rabbits. They are born looking like little imps, blood red skin, barbed tail, horns and about two feet tall. Only one was born human, and he recieved the best of the demon and the human in his blood. His name was Dark Rotunda, a major crime figure in the northern city of Trillmore and the man responsible for sending Vilgore out on his quest that killed Ot-Ot, my partner, and a little girl, Aielya Hellrain. Aieyla was the daughter of Bloodstar Hellrain, a semi-famous treasure seeker. It seems that Rotunda wanted these four &quot;rift crystals&quot;, one diamond, one ruby, one emerald, and one glass. They were reputed to open a rift between planes, allowing travel between them. Rotunda already had the emerald crystal. The location of the ruby was unknown, thought to be lost. The diamond happened to be on display in our Silverdane Museum. And the glass crystal had been hanging around the neck of little Aielya, a gift given to her by an unsuspecting Bloodstar. He found it after an expedition into Dracur's Cave and thought it worthless, so gave his child the trinket. Rotunda decided to kill two birds with one stone and sent Vilgore to Silverdane to get the crystals. Ot-Ot saw him kill the kid, and ended up dead himself. Along with my partner. The Guard almost caught Vilgore when he tried to nab the diamond. He got away empty-handed, and I finished the job. The diamond was now on display in Black Haven, and the glass crystal...let's just say it was my private wedding gift to Alyssa. She knows it is the reason her husband died, and hasn't taken it from around her neck since I gave it to her. Her wedding gift to me was now in a box in Personal Effects, along with my money and everything else the Guard took off me when they locked me up. It was a charmed necklace that when activated would turn the wearer invisible. If only I had it now. I wish I WERE invisible.<br>
<br>
I had Relgin send word to Alyssa, and told her not to worry, I would be out soon. I knew she would be all right; she had handled the news of Ice's death better than I did. Not that she was unfeeling; it was just a Drow thing. It was me I worried about now.<br>
<br>

He nodded on the other side of the bars, and then leaned in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen, Lennon,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Between you and me I don't think you did this. You look suspicious as hell, and marrying Ice's wife was just plain stupid, but this reeks. What has me worried is that I got a lot of pressure from the people upstairs to have you arrested quickly. Someone's pushing for you to get locked up, and whoever it is, they have a lot of pull. It's starting to smell of politics, and that scares me.&quot; He didn't need to add that I probably had more enemies than he had fingers and toes. I had this little problem with playing rough with witnesses and suspects. It wasn't the politically correct thing to do in the law-enforcement profession. They'd rather I play by the rules and let criminals run free instead of bend a few and lock them up. Enemies? Hells, my own partner Filbin could be putting on the screws to send me down the river. It would be easier to count my FRIENDS than my enemies.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; I asked, &quot;Don't you have a brother who went to law school?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I sent him a message to get to Silverdane already.&quot; Relgin replied. I breathed a sigh of relief. At least the Captain believed me. &quot;He graduated top of his class, and he's never lost a case in the last two years. He's expensive, though. He might give me a break, but it's still going to cost you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell Alyssa to draw out however much it'll cost.&quot; I told him. Relgin nodded. I supressed a smile. I was the one behind bars and I had my boss running around town like my servant. If it weren't for the whole jail thing I might enjoy this.<br>
<br>
&quot;My brother should be here from Black Haven tomorrow.&quot; Relgin said. &quot;For now, sit tight.&quot;<br>
<br>
That would be easy.<br>
<br>
I mean, where was I going to go? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/03 6:23:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'm Galpin Berringer, your laywer.&quot; the dwarf said, reaching through the bars to shake my hand. I had to blink twice. He could have been Relgin's twin, except his hair and beard were jet black, with a brilliant white moustache. Hair dye, or just strange pigmentation? Whatever it was, it was striking. His handshake was firm and I guessed that he could break my hand with just a tiny application of pressure. I was glad he was on my side.<br>
<br>
Relgin stood slightly behind him, watching. Galpin turned to him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Open up the cell, Rel. I need to confer with my client.&quot;<br>
<br>
Relgin took a ring of keys off his belt and opened my cell. Strange, nothing had really changed, but the sight of the open door made me feel somewhat more free. It only lasted a second, however, as Relgin closed it behind Galpin and locked us both in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Rel, don't be an ass.&quot; Galpin snapped. &quot;He's not going to try to escape.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, Gal. Regulations.&quot; Relgin said with a sheepish look and a shrug of his shoulders. He left the room. Galpin turned to look at me. His eyes under heavy brows shot through me like an arrow a close range. I felt violated.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; he began with a drawl. &quot;Did you do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do what?&quot; I replied stupidly. Something about this guy unnerved me. I didn't want to answer any vague questions. I had a feeling he'd rip me a new asshole if I did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Make me get specific.&quot; he said. &quot;You answer to generalities and the prosecution will have a field day with you. Now, to be more specific: Did you kill your partner...&quot; he flipped through a small notebook, &quot;...Danell Thissel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; I replied, meeting his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank gods.&quot; I breathed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who cares if I believe you?&quot; Galpin snapped at me. &quot;It's my job to represent you regardless of whether I think you killed them both, ran naked through the streets, and raped the queen of the faeries and all her minions. Will the jury believe you? That's the real question.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, will they?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who knows?&quot; he shrugged. &quot;All depends on the jury. In the old days it would be an all-human jury for a human defendent. I couldn't even represent you, with my dwarven heritage. But now, with all the races attempting to live with each other, a jury of your peers consists of any race that has the capacity for rational thought. Even a hybrid can sit on a jury for a human, although I think the use of rationality for those red buggers is more the exception than the rule.&quot; He spit after he said it.<br>
<br>
My stomach tightened. &quot;Hybrids may be on the jury? They think I killed Ot-Ot too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Galpin muttered into his beard, starting to pace in front of me with his hands clasped behind his back. &quot;But I'll do my damndest to make sure we get very few hybrids during jury selection. The elven population in Silverdane is slight, so fortunately we don't have to worry about too many regular elves, if any, getting in. An elf will probably hang you for no other reason than that you consort with the Drow. Last thing we want is some high-stepping elf refusing to send in a plea of innocent. You won't get any Drow; Danell and Alyssa were the only ones considered citizens of Silverdane. Which is fine. They wouldn't be very sympathetic to a human who killed one of their own kind and then took a Drow woman. Which was REALLY stupid.&quot; He looked at me meaningfully, and I averted my gaze. Damn his eyes! He continued. &quot;Now, any dwarves or kippings that make their way onto the jury won't really affect us based on race alone. No dwarf or kipping is going to give a shit whether a human killed a Drow and hybrid.&quot; He held up his hands. &quot;Except ME, of course. I give a shit.&quot; Naturally. I was paying him enough. He went on. &quot;A mostly human jury would be the most ideal situation, because both the Drow and hybrids are looked upon as garbage by the human population, and the fact that you married a Drow female just adds to the scandal, which is the most entertainment most humans have had in years. A majority of humans on the jury is what I'll be going for. Of course our opposition will be going for an all hybrid jury.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who IS our opposition?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chelton Keller.&quot; Galpin replied.<br>
<br>
I groaned. Chelton Keller was an excellent prosecutor who would cheat, lie and steal to win a case. He won most of the cases we brought to him from the Guard. He was a real sleazeball, but he was OUR sleazeball. Now we'd be on opposite sides.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, I didn't kill Ot-Ot either.&quot; I said, changing subjects abruptly.<br>
<br>
He looked at me for a second, and nodded. &quot;I know. Who did?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Vilgore Tamera. He killed them both.&quot;<br>
<br>
Galpin flipped through his book. &quot;And then he was ripped apart by a wild dog.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot; I said. His eyes suddenly snapped up from the book. He stared at me. His look was inscrutable. I hoped mine was. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, right.&quot; he said, closing the book, still staring at me. I prayed I wasn't sweating. Nothing in my tone should have given anything away. Had I answered too quickly? Damn it!<br>
<br>
&quot;Just how good ARE you?&quot; I asked him.<br>
<br>
&quot;The best.&quot; Galpin replied, stroking his white moustache. And then he laughed out loud. <br>
<br>
&quot;And wait till you see the judge tomorrow.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 6:57:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> &quot;All rise!&quot; the baliff cried. I got to my feet as the crowd rose as one. And what a crowd. Everybody wanted one of the Guard around when their cottage was broken into, or a thief had picked a pocket, or a cat got stuck in a tree, but when you put a detective on trial? Well, Hells, that was something to see! Made me want to puke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now presiding, the Honorable Teffen D. Allimore. He speaks with the authority of the gods. Let no man overrule his judgement. His word is Law.&quot;<br>
<br>
I always hated that bit. The baliff sounded like a bad actor killing his lines. And the lines themselves! Who WROTE that crap?<br>
<br>
The Honorable Teffen D. Allimore was a name I wasn't completely familiar with, for good reason. He used to preside in Black Haven, and moved to Silverdane last week. Everyone in the Guard was buzzing about what he might be like. My little three day jail stay put me a little behind the times. I waited to see his head over the crowd when he entered. And waited. And then I realized he WAS in the room. I grabbed Galpin by the shoulder excitedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Galpin!&quot; I whispered. &quot;He's a dwarf!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; Galpin smiled, rocking back and forth on his heels. &quot;Ain't that a rip?&quot;<br>
<br>
It certainly was. The prosecutor, Chelton Keller, looked devastated. Even his professionally slicked back hair and thousand silver piece suit couldn't disguise his panic. Chelton Keller, as everyone in Silverdane knew, was a unabashed bigot. It was common knowledge in over five cities. Black Haven, Judge Allimore's home district, was one of those cities. The Judge sat down and rapped his gavel.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may take your seats.&quot; he intoned in a bass rumble. We sat. &quot;We are here to try the case of the City of Silverdane vs. Lennon Mordril. The charges are two counts of first degree murder, with lesser charges of obstructing justice, tampering with a witness, unlawful entry, and interferring with the mating rituals of another race.&quot; The crowd stirred at that last part. They always loved a good sex scandal. Allimore smashed down his gavel and the mob quieted. He continued. &quot;For the sake of expediency, the jury will decide upon the major charges first; that is, the two murder charge, and then the lesser. I do not need to remind the jury that you are not to discuss the case with each other or with anyone else when you leave this courtroom. If anyone approaches you about the case...&quot; and he looked pointedly at Chelton Keller, who tried to shrink into himself, &quot;...you will report it to me or a court officer immediately and we will handle it. You will listen to the arguments of both the defense and the prosecution, and will decide if the defendant is innocent or guilty. In the case of a criminal trial, you must find him guilty BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT if you are to return a guilty verdict. You will be given as long as you need after closing arguments to decide on the defendant's guilt or innocence. Do you understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
The jury nodded as one. They were picked the day before, after Galpin left me to ponder in my cell. It didn't go too badly, on the whole. Of the nine jury members, only two were hybrids. There were no elves or Drow, as Galpin had predicted. Three kippings, which wouldn't mean anything to either side. Only one dwarf, which was unfortunate. Even though I was a human, a dwarf might be more swayed by Galpin than a bunch of kippings. But the more important thing was the human count, which was three, two men and one woman. The other females on the jury were one of the hybrids, and two of the kips. Five men, four women. Now which one was the jury leader? I hoped it was one of the two human men. The jury leader, chosen by a closed vote within the jury, would be who led them through their deciding stage of the trial and read the verdict. The position, though only as important as I just described, also had a tendency to sway jury decision to whichever way he or she decided. Not a sure thing, but damned close. A human male would hopefully fix this case for me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is your leader?&quot; Judge Allimore asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am, your Honor.&quot; the one dwarf said, standing up. Chelton almost groaned out loud. Galpin beamed. I supposed the dwarf would be even stronger than a human with Galpin representing me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you. You may sit down.&quot; Allimore said. The dwarf sat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us begin with the opening arguments. Council for the prosecutor may start.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 6:58:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> Chelton Keller stepped to the jury box and unconsciously smoothed back his hair. I've seen him do this a hundred times before. Chelton's openings always ran a little too long, and had been our consternation when he would ramble on, putting the jury to sleep. I hoped he'd remain true to form.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,&quot; he began, rubbing his hands together and then spreading them in supplication. &quot;My name is Chelton Keller, and I'm here to represent the city of Silverdane and you, its citizens. Feel free to call me Chelt, all my friends do.&quot; He smiled graciously after bestowing this honor to them. I almost snorted out loud. None of these jurors would be calling him anything. Unless he was thinking about paying them a midnight visit. Which I was sure Relgin would have surveillance posted to prevent. The non-human jurors just glared at him, except the hybrids, who really had no idea that the term &quot;bigot&quot; refered to all non-human races, and ESPECIALLY the hybrids. The two human males looked indifferent, but the human female actually smiled back, already smitten by Chelton's handsome presence. Chelton focused on her and continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;The main question is: Why are we here today? Why did we have to leave our jobs and our homes to sit for hours in this courtroom? Why did our daily schedules have to be disrupted for possibly weeks? Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because we had to come to court.&quot; a hybrid male said, and sat back smugly, glad he had the answer before anyone else. The other hybrid nodded her head vigorously, to prove the hybrids were listening. Galpin rolled his eyes. Chelton smiled and continued, not missing a beat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly! Because we had to come to court. And why did we have to come to court?&quot;<br>
<br>
The hybrid shot to his feet again, ready with the answer, but the Judge smacked down his gavel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Juror #4, please sit down and refrain from answering Councellor Keller. He's not asking for you to give an answer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I KNOW the answer, Judge!&quot; Juror #4 exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sit...down.&quot; Allimore growled. The hybrid began to melt into his seat. The female hybrid stood up, seeing it was her turn.<br>
<br>
&quot;But he did ask for an answer!&quot; she piped up.<br>
<br>
Allimore took a deep breath, and looked angrily over at Chelton. &quot;Councellor, were you actually asking the jury to answer you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Chelton shuffled his feet and wouldn't look at the Judge. &quot;No, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought so.&quot; Allimore exhaled, sitting back in his seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;But he did!&quot; the female hybrid muttered. A sharp jab in the ribs by Juror #4 silenced her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Continue, Councellor.&quot; Allimore commanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, your Honor.&quot; But his momentum was lost temporarily. He looked confused for a second, and then readdressed the jury.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, as I was saying. Why are we here?&quot; And then quickly added as the female hybrid shifted in her seat, &quot;We are HERE because that man over there...&quot; pointing at me, &quot;...that HUMAN man, that detective of the Guard, that human whose job it is to protect and serve the citizens of Silverdane, that man killed another officer of the Guard in cold blood, and then proceeded to kill a member of the hybrid race, whose only crime was to have seen this man murder an innocent person.&quot; To this the hybrids looked horrified. The fact that they had known Ot-Ot had been killed three weeks ago seemed to escape them. They clutched each other and stared at me fearfully. I suppressed an urge to grin wickedly at them. It wouldn't help my situation, but it WOULD make me feel better.<br>
<br>
Chelton took a deep breath. &quot;We will bring forward witness after witness, placing this man at the scene of the crime and the murder weapon in his hand. We will show how this man desired one of the victim's wife, and how he was willing to kill his &quot;friend&quot; in order to possess her. We will also show how he forced entry into a local entertainment hall, disrupting the paid customers in his hunt for his victims. So again, the question is why? Why did this man do this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know!&quot; the male hybrid wailed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Juror #4!&quot; Judge Allimore roared. &quot;Contain yourself!&quot; The hybrid looked confused at the request. Allimore turned to Chelton. &quot;Councellor, are we almost through? You're either asking rhetorical questions that are completely lost on the more talkative members of the jury or you're attempting to try this case in your opening argument. Either way, wrap it up, Councellor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, of course, your Honor.&quot; Chelton gulped. &quot;That's...&quot; He looked bewildered. &quot;That's it, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looks like Chelton would have to throw out the other five pages of his speech. And now it was my guy's turn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Galpin Berringer, but that is not important. What is important is my client's name, Lennon Mordril.&quot; He looked at each juror slowly, attempting to catch each eye before it turned away from him, uncomfortable with his stare. &quot;Lennon Mordril, a detective of the Guard, a man that has served this city as a lesser officer for ten years before being promoted to the prestigious position of detective, based on an almost spotless record of policework.&quot; Except for the temper problem, I silently added. &quot;Lennon Mordril, who should not be here before you now if this were a perfect world and the obvious didn't have to be explained. And the obvious, as you will see in less time than my friend Mr. Keller would like, is that Lennon Mordril had nothing to do with the deaths of Danell Thissel and Ot-Ot Demonspawn other than witnessing their deaths at another's hand. I will show you that each witness they bring forth is either confused, unsure, or....I hesitate to say 'lying'....let's just say 'mistaken'. That is all I have to say for now; the facts will speak for themselves. And when you examine them for what they are, you'll have to unanimously agree that there is not only a reasonable doubt that Lennon Mordril committed these crimes, but that he in fact could NOT have committed these crimes at all. Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd let out a collective sigh of relief. Neither of the hybrids had commented.<br>
<br>
With the opening arguments finished, the trial could begin in earnest.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 6:59:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> The first witness Chelton called for was the seediest dwarf I have ever seen. He must have tried to trim his dirty grey beard before he came to court. Large patches of wrinkled skin showed through his greasy hair. He was sworn in and slumped into the seat on the witness stand, looking bored and just a little bit pissed to be there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please state your name for the court.&quot; Chelton prompted.<br>
<br>
&quot;HmmMmmNmm&quot; the dwarf muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; asked Juror #4.<br>
<br>
&quot;Repeat that.&quot; Judge Allimore said, clearly disgusted this creature was of his race.<br>
<br>
&quot;Balkin Grogg.&quot; the dwarf repeated, this time ringing as clear as his raspy voice would allow.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what do you do for a living, Mr. Grogg?&quot; Chelton asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean before the accident?&quot; he asked, wrapping on his knee. It emitted a hollow, wooden sound. One of the female kips suddenly looked decidely ill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, no, Mr. Grogg.&quot; Chelton said hastily. &quot;What do you do for a living now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; Grogg said, clearing his throat. &quot;I bounce over at the Brimstone Club.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what does bounce mean, for those people who may not be familiar with the term?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's easy.&quot; he said, smiling. One tooth was missing. &quot;Someone tries to get in that I don't like, I throw him out on his ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd erupted into nervous laughter. Chelton turned two shades darker. Galpin openly laughed out loud. Even the hybrids were laughing, even though it was obvious they didn't know what they were laughing about. And then Allimore's gavel crashed down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Order!&quot; he shouted, and the courtroom went dead silent. &quot;One more disturbance in here and I'll clear this courtroom and adjourn this trial till tomorrow, at which time it will NOT be open to the public.&quot;<br>
<br>
That kept everyone quiet. Chelton smoothed his already smoothed hair back and tried again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Grogg, is there maybe some OTHER way to describe a bouncer?&quot; His eyes pleaded with Grogg's.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, well...hmm...&quot; He looked like he was trying to remember something. And then he had it. &quot;A bouncer is an individual who escorts malcontents and unauthorized personnel from an entertainment establishment.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I object, your honor.&quot; Galpin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;For what reason?&quot; Allimore asked, eyebrow raised. Chelton looked similarily bewildered.<br>
<br>
&quot;On the basis that I believe Mr. Grogg doesn't even know what a malcontent is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Chelton cried indignantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Overruled.&quot; the judge said dryly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; I whispered to Galpin fiercely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just having some fun.&quot; Galpin replied. And chuckled softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great. You're having fun.&quot; My ass on the line and he's having fun. I sank into my seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pardon that rude interruption.&quot; Chelton said to an insulted Grogg. He gulped down a glass of water and continued. &quot;So you are a bouncer at the Brimstone Club.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And this is where you first saw Lennon Mordril.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Objection.&quot; Galpin called from his seat. &quot;Leading the witness.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sustained.&quot; Allimore said. &quot;Rephrase the question, Councellor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did you first see Lennon Mordril?&quot; Chelton asked Grogg.<br>
<br>
&quot;At the Brimstone Club.&quot; Grogg replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is there a rule regarding admittance into the Brimstone Club?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you please tell the court what that rule is?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No one over four feet tall allowed inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And is Lennon Mordril over four feet tall?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg looked over at me, and then at Chelton as if he was an idiot. &quot;Well, what do YOU think?&quot;<br>
<br>
Chelton tried again. Painstakingly slow. &quot;Mr. Grogg, what I meant was is it your opinion that Lennon Mordril is over four feet tall?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what happened when you first saw Lennon Mordril?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Grogg said, sitting up in his seat. He rubbed his hands together. This was the part he must have rehearsed all night.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it was a pretty hoppin' night, that night. We were almost running full, with wall to wall hybrids. That new band, the Screamin' Willies, was playing, and every hybrid in town showed up. Ot-Ot was there already. Everybody knew Ot-Ot. He was a hybrid's hybrid. And that Drow fella was there too. You don't forget a spook when you see one. He was just sorta drinking wine and listening to the band. Anyway, this guy...&quot; and he pointed to me. &quot;This guy comes up to the door, where I'm working. He says &quot;I gotta get in here to talk to my friend&quot;. I says &quot;Too bad, buddy, four feet or under only&quot;. He says, &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; and pulls out this dagger and waves it under my nose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did Lennon Mordril at any time identify himself as a member of the Guard?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chelton held up a wicked looking knife so both Grogg and the jury could see it. &quot;Is this the dagger you saw?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg didn't even look at him. &quot;Yeah, that's it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chelton said, &quot;Let the record show that Mr. Grogg identified the weapon that was used to kill Mr. Thissel and Mr. Demonspawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
I swore under my breath. It was the dagger that had killed Ice and Ot-Ot, but the rest of Grogg's story was horseshit. I wondered who paid him off and why.<br>
<br>
Grogg went on. &quot;So I'm freakin' out, right? This guy's got almost two feet on me and he's pulling a knife. Now, this is just a job to me, you see? This ain't nothin' I'm willing to get killed over. So I let him in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Grogg, why didn't you call the Guard after he threatened you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's one of them.&quot; Grogg snorted. &quot;You think they'd care if one of their officers was harrassing a poor working dwarf?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you didn't call the police immediately because you thought they wouldn't respond to a call about a fellow Guard member.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
<br>
I looked over at Galpin after each question, waiting for him to object. These were all lies, and yet my high-priced lawyer was doing nothing. In fact, it looked like he might actually be sleeping. I nudged him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it our turn yet?&quot; he asked me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you know?&quot; I hissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't sweat it.&quot; he assured me. I was not assured.<br>
<br>
&quot;And then what happened?&quot; Chelton was saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then Lennon walked over to the Drow at the bar. The Drow looked suprised to see him. Then they went into one of the backrooms, and that's all I saw until after he killed them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chelton clapped his hands together. &quot;Thank you, Mr. Grogg. No further questions, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg started to get up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not so fast, Mr. Grogg.&quot; Allimore warned. Grogg sat down testily. &quot;Cross-examine the witness, Mr. Berringer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, your Honor.&quot; Galpin said, stepping forward. &quot;Mr. Grogg, do you have a good memory?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot; Grogg was the perfect picture of a hostile witness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your Honor...&quot; Galpin asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Councellor, I have this one.&quot; Allimore said. &quot;Mr. Grogg, you are not here to ask questions, you're here to answer them. Answer Mr. Berringer's question.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg glared at Galpin. &quot;Yes, I have a good memory.&quot; Each word spit like poison.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you say a 'great' memory?&quot; Galpin asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I have a fantastic memory.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, good.&quot; Galpin said, smiling. &quot;Now, for the sake of the jury, whose memory is probably not as FANTASTIC as yours, and I emphasize the word fantastic, I'm going to ask you to recall some of the things you've just told us. Ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; Grogg wasn't giving him an inch. I wondered what Galpin was up to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Let's jump around a bit, shall we? Now, you said earlier that you first saw Detective Mordril when he approached you, alone, the night of the murder. Is that correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg just looked off, bored.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your Honor?&quot; Galpin asked.<br>
        <br>
&quot;Answer the question, Mr. Grogg.&quot; the Judge demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said it already, didn't I?&quot; Grogg growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes or no, Mr. Grogg.&quot; Allimore growled right back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; he mumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, good.&quot; Galpin said. &quot;Now, you also said that he never identified himself as a police officer when he tried to gain entry. Is this correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah. He never said nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Or showed you ID of some sort?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. Nothing.&quot;        <br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Now, Mr. Grogg, can you read minds?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg looked confused. &quot;Huh?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know...read minds. Like a fortune teller. Or a wizard. Are you a fortune teller, Mr. Grogg?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Objection!&quot; Chelton cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going with this?&quot; Allimore asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, your Honor, I'm just wondering how Mr. Grogg knew not to call the Guard because Detective Mordril worked for them when he said Detective Mordril never identified himself as an officer. Did Detective Mordril SMELL like he worked for the Guard?&quot;<br>
<br>
Allimore sat back in his seat. &quot;I'll allow the question. Objection overruled.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So, Mr. Grogg? Are you a fortune teller?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Grogg said murderously. His eyes were slits.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then how did you know Detective Mordril worked for the Guard?&quot; Galpin looked over at the jury and shrugged his shoulders. One of the female kips stifled a giggle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...&quot; Grogg tried, &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Must have been a lucky guess.&quot; Galpin winked at Grogg. Grogg did not wink back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, so let's try something else. Did you know Detective Mordril's partner, Detective Thissel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I never saw him before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So the first time you saw Detective Thissel was that night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you tell me the average height of a Drow?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um...&quot; He pondered it a bit. &quot;5' 3&quot;, 5' 4&quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not bad, Mr. Grogg. 5' 2&quot;. You certainly know your heights. But then again, you would, heights being part of your job and all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And do you care for the Drow, as a race, I mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Does anyone? No, I don't really care for the Drow. I think they should all go back to their homeland and leave decent folk alone.&quot; This got a small smattering of applause from the audience. I wished I had my crossbow. Allimore smashed down his gavel and the crowd quieted.<br>
<br>
Galpin continued as if uninterrupted. &quot;So you wouldn't do any favors for a Drow?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you good at your job, Mr. Grogg?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I'm good at it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever broken the rules at your job?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg thought about it, sensing a trap. Then he smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only once, when I let in Mordril. And that was because he held a knife on me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, yes. Other than that time when you were obviously under duress, you've never broken the rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ever?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never.&quot; He dared Galpin to contradict him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Galpin said smoothly, &quot;You never break the rules, you wouldn't do a Drow a favor, and the average Drow is 5'2&quot;. So how was Mr. Thissel already in the bar drinking wine when Officer Mordril arrived?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I...&quot; Grogg looked around wildly. Chelton seemed transfixed on a blank spot on the wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a simple question, Mr. Grogg. How could Danell Thissel have been in the bar if you didn't let anyone in over four feet? &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I don't know.&quot; Grogg said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps you were mistaken, Mr. Grogg.&quot; Galpin offered, no longer smiling. His eyes were twin daggers. &quot;Perhaps Detective Mordril and Detective Thissel arrived together to look for <br>
Ot-Ot. Perhaps no one pulled a knife on you at all. Perhaps the two detectives showed you proper ID and you let them in. Perhaps you made everything else up!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Objection!&quot;<br>
        <br>
&quot;Sustained. The jury will disregard Mr. Berringer's last comments.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grogg looked as if he had been beaten with a stick. &quot;I don't know...&quot; he said weakly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't know much, it seems.&quot; Galpin snorted with disgust. &quot;No more questions, your Honor.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/03 9:08:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Please state your name.&quot; Chelton asked the next witness after she was sworn in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bee-Bee Devilbreed.&quot; the witness said. She was a female hybrid, wearing a blonde wig that dropped golden curls pertly around her shoulders. The effect of the pretty hair with that red reptilian face was striking. There are some things nature did not intend. One was a hybrid with hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss Devilbreed, have you ever seen that man behind me?&quot; He pointed at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;I saw him in the Brimstone Club, the night Ot-Ot was killed.&quot; she said with a high-pitched voice that almost sounded feminine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was he alone?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; she said. &quot;He was with that darkie with the silver hair. Nice hair on that guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you know either of the two men?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lennon and Ice?&quot; She almost laughed out loud. &quot;Yeah, I know them all right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;By Ice, do you mean Danell Thissel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but everyone called him Ice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your relationship with these men?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, they interrupt my work every now and then.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what is your line of work.&quot;<br>
<br>
She batted her false eyelashes demurely. &quot;I'm a professional escort.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And by escort you mean you work in a...dating service?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that's right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Objection.&quot; Galpin called. &quot;Leading the prostitute...I mean... witness. Pardon me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sustained.&quot; the Judge said, hiding a smile, and tried to glare at Galpin. &quot;But watch your phrasing, Councellor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, your Honor.&quot; Galpin said, shuffling his feet. &quot;It won't happen again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chelton fumed silently, and then continued. &quot;Miss Devilbreed, how would Lennon Mordril and Detective Thissel interrupt your work?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, most of the time they would barge in right when I was negotiating a fee for my services and throw me in jail for soliciting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did this happen on the night of the murders?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That night it was even worse! Lennon stopped me right in the middle of me DOING the services! I mean, he picked me right off the guy and....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Miss Devilbreed,&quot; Chelton interrupted hastily. &quot;And then what happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, he asked me where Ot-Ot was. I told him to go to Hells. He insisted, shaking me, not letting me finish what I had started. I was afraid my client was ready to leave. So I pointed to one of the backrooms where I thought I had seen Ot-Ot go into. Both Lennon and Ice went in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did they go into the third backroom from the left of the building?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the record show that the witness has placed the defendant in the room of the two murders.&quot;<br>
<br>
I had to hand it to Chelton. For once he questioned a witness and the witness told the truth. Everything Bee-Bee had said so far was true.<br>
<br>
&quot;No more questions, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cross-examination?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The defense has only two questions for this witness.&quot; Galpin said, standing up. &quot;Miss Devilbreed, have you ever been in this particular room?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure, lots of times.&quot; she said, winking at him. &quot;You wanna meet me there one day? I run a special for non-hybrids.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, no, thank you, Miss Devilbreed.&quot; Galpin said with a smile. &quot;Although the offer sounds...interesting. Can you describe the room in detail?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, sure.&quot; she said. &quot;It's about seven, eight foot square with a matress in one corner. There's a small bathroom off one wall, so you could, you know, clean up afterward.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, that's it. You don't spend a lot of time admiring the room, if you know what I mean.&quot; She licked her lips. It looked obscene.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think I know what you mean. Thank you, Miss Devilbreed. No more questions, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Next witness.&quot; Judge Allimore declared.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/03 9:11:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> The next witness was one of the Guard, Officer Elrith Tennell, our forensics man, and one of my elven friends from the force. He was the officer who responded to the crime and was the first to arrive at the scene. He reluctantly described the aftermath to Chelton. He described how he found me holding Ice's body, covered in his blood, the dagger in my hands. He confirmed that Ice had died of a knife wound to the heart, and that Ot-Ot lay in a pool of his own blood in the corner, throat slit. Chelton released the witness. It was Galpin's turn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Officer Tennell,&quot; Galpin began, stroking his beard, &quot;What color is hybrid blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Black.&quot; Elrith answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Drow blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Red.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Red, I see. Now how about this: When a throat is cut, whether hybrid or Drow or whoever....when a throat is cut, what happens?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When the jugular is cut, the wound jets blood. The heart is still pumping blood to the brain. It is exiting the body under high pressure from the slash wound.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see. And this happened in the case of Ot-Ot Demonspawn?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. There was black blood sprayed all over the wall behind him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok. Now, was there anything strange about the bathroom?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. We found the window in the bathroom broken. Most of the glass lay on the bathroom floor. And the sill was covered in black blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Could someone have killed Ot-Ot and escaped through that window?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure. The blood on the window was Ot-Ot's.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the dagger found in Detective Mordril's hand. Did it have Ot-Ot's blood on it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. Ot-Ot's blood and Ice...Detective Thissel's as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And it's assumed this knife was used to kill both men.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. Without a doubt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand Detective Mordril was covered in Detective Thissel's blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One final question, Officer Tennell. Was there any evidence of black blood anywhere on Detective Mordril?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No black blood on him at all except a little smear on his hands from the handle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Officer Tennell. No more questions, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Redirect, your Honor.&quot; Chelton asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead.&quot; Judge Allimore allowed.<br>
<br>
Chelton approached Elrith a second time. &quot;Officer Tennell, if a throat is cut from behind, would the spray of blood necessarily hit the cutter? Is it possible for no blood to actually spray backward onto the killer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it's POSSIBLE, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you. Now, would it also be possible for someone to break a window from inside to LOOK like someone else had been in the room, then taint the window with black blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AND would it also be possible for that same person to then wash the black blood from his hands in the bathroom, return to the body of Detective Thissel, and get red blood all over him a second time?&quot;<br>
<br>
Elrith looked pained. &quot;Yes. It's possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Chelton smiled. &quot;No more questions.&quot;<br>
<br>
I had to admit it was possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Redirect.&quot; Galpin said, face set impassively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Proceed.&quot; Allimore gestured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Officer Tennell, the course of events my worthy adversary has described is this: Detective Mordril, for whatever reason, killed Detective Thissel in front of Ot-Ot Demonspawn with a puncture to the heart. Then he cut Ot-Ot's throat from behind, being careful not to get any blood on his clothing. Then he went into the bathroom, broke the window, wiped the blood from his hands on the windowsill, washed his hands, and returned to Detective Thissel to make sure his hands were covered with Detective Thissel's blood. Is this correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It sounds like what he was implying.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right. Ok. Now, if I were to come at you with a knife after you witnessed me kill someone, would you turn your back to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, no.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you back away from me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would, if I couldn't get past you and I was unarmed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Was Ot-Ot unarmed?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Apparently.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did he have any other cuts on him, like he tried to wave off the knife as he came at him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. No cuts or signs of struggle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So Ot-Ot passively turned his back to Detective Mordril and let him cut his throat? Because he must have turned, or his blood could not have sprayed the wall BEHIND him. And he couldn't have been facing Detective Mordril when he cut his throat, or else Detective Mordril would have been covered in black blood, and blood, as we all know, is a lot harder to wash out of CLOTHING that from one's hands. And if Detective Mordril DID cut Ot-Ot's throat from the front, he would be soaked with black blood; hands, clothing, face...correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, could this have happened as well? Could someone have been hiding in the bathroom, waiting for Ot-Ot to enter the room? And could this person have surprised Ot-Ot from behind, slicing his throat? And could this same person go BACK to the bathroom, to wait for the two detectives to come to the room? And finally, could this same person throw a knife from the bathroom and kill Detective Thissel and then escape through the bathroom window? The bathroom window that was broken from the OUTSIDE, when the killer entered the bathroom through it in the first place? The glass was all over the floor of the bathroom, indicative that someone broke it from the outside to get IN. And the red blood all over Detective Mordril could have happened when the detective pulled the dagger from his partner's heart. Could this have happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
Elrith smiled. &quot;Not only is it possible, it's a more plausible sequence of events than Mr. Keller's&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you again, Officer Tennell. No more questions, your Honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
From the look on Chelton's face, he didn't have any either.<br>
<br>

I could understand why. Whatever story the hybrids had concocted to describe how I killed them both would fall apart in light of Elrith's damning testimony.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you have no other witnesses?&quot; Allimore asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, no, your Honor.&quot; Chelton said apologetically. &quot;But I have two experts coming in from Black Haven tomorrow, my own forensics people. They should arrive tonight. I also would like to question Alyssa Mordril.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright.&quot; Judge Allimore decided. &quot;We'll call it a day and reconviene here tomorrow at noon.&quot; He banged down his gavel and exited the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what he expects with these &quot;experts&quot; Galpin said to me, &quot;But we'll take care of them tomorrow. As to Alyssa's testimony, frankly I'm concerned about it. We need to talk, tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
I gulped. &quot;Sure. Nice job up there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He made it easy.&quot; Galpin said, gesturing to Chelton. &quot;See you tonight.&quot; And he left.<br>
<br>
Well, that was a productive day. Captain Relgin returned me to my cell. <br>

My marriage to Alyssa and obligation to Blood Oath was something I did not want to discuss, and I took his absense as his acknowledgement of my feeling on it. I pondered why Balkin Grogg would lie about what happened. Nevertheless, I slept soundly that night, assured the next day would find me vindicated.<br>
<br>
At court the next day, Galpin Berringer did not show.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 2:31:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'm afraid I will have to postpone this case for a week.&quot; Judge Allimore said, his face grave. &quot;Mr. Berringer will no longer be able to try this case.

<br>
A murmur of surprise went through the courtroom. No one was more suprised, however, than me. Except perhaps Chelton Keller.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your Honor,&quot; he protested. &quot;If Mr. Berringer chooses to drop from this case it's his perogative. I would myself if the facts were as dead set against me as they were against him. But to delay the case a week will upset my experts' schedules and...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Keller, Mr. Berringer did not drop this case because of anything that has transpired in this courtroom.&quot; Allimore said icily. &quot;Mr. Berringer can no longer try this case because he was found stabbed to death early this morning.&quot; He smacked down his gavel. The courtroom was struck dumb.<br>
<br>
&quot;This trial will continue one week from today at noon. Till then this court is adjourned.&quot; <br>

I had been led back to my cell in a state of numb shock. Now I knew why Relgin hadn't been the one to bring me to the courtroom. His brother was dead.<br>
<br>
Why? Why kill a lawyer? My head reeled. Was he killed because he was doing such a good job in my defense? Or was it just one of those senseless, random things? If it was because of me, who would want me in jail so badly they would kill for it?<br>
<br>
And what about Balkin Grogg? Galpin had made him look like a fool on the stand. A fellow dwarf had humiliated him. Grogg would be pissed, for sure, but would that justify murder? Grogg wasn't stupid enough to believe he wouldn't be a prime suspect. I just couldn't figured it out. My professional life supplied enough mystery without it entering into my private life.<br>
<br>
Alyssa visited me for a half hour. We sat in silence almost the entire time, just looking at each other. We knew we had been granted a temporary reprieve concerning our marriage, but at a horrible price. We shared a certain amount of guilt, both knowing how badly we had wanted some reason for Alyssa to be kept from testifying. Well, now we had it. For a week at least.<br>
<br>
After she left, I spent the next few hours pacing back and forth, trying to push from my mind the pictures of stabbed Drow and sliced-up hybrids and gutted dwarves. The more I tried to forget the more vivid they became. And worse, the more the carnage encrouched on my conscious the more the subconscious beast within me awoke. In moments of high pressure, the shift from man to wolf could happen whether our two moons were full or not. That would be all I needed. For the guards to come in and find a huge wolf in the shredded remains of my prison clothes. As it was, if the trial went on a day longer than when it restarted next week, I would change. The moons would be full. When we reentered the courtroom next week, we had better finish the trial one way or another.<br>
<br>
I lay down in darkness and tried to sleep. I was almost there when my senses picked up a familiar smell in the room, just outside my cell. A scent no human nose would detect, but a wolf's nose would. Relgin, standing there in the dark. Watching me. Without a word.<br>
<br>
After what seemed an eternity, Relgin struck a spark to a hand-held lamp. The light flared up, leaving me blinded for a moment. A click, and he had entered my cell. When my vision returned he was standing in the cell, looking very sad. Looking very old.<br>
<br>
With a single motion, he threw the lamp to the floor. I jumped back onto my cot as flaming oil spilled everywhere, the glass breaking into a thousand pieces. Relgin stood still, unaware of the flames at his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guards!&quot; he cried in a loud voice. &quot;Get in here!&quot;<br>
<br>
Several officers ran into the room, confused, taking in the burning mess. One saw me and drew his crossbow. I cringed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get this man into Isolation immediately!&quot; Relgin demanded in a tone I have never heard him use before. &quot;He just attacked me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was pulled roughly from the cell by my old friends. No one bothered to be gentle about it. I was too surprised to protest. Another guard rushed in to stamp out the flames before they reached the cot. The last thing I saw before I was thrown into the windowless, pitch-black, empty isolation room was Relgin's face behind the guards.<br>
<br>
It was bitter look, cold, mirthless.<br>
<br>
I could swear he was smiling. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 2:38:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Rise (BloodOath Part II)</span><hr size=1> I had no idea how much time had passed after that first hour. It could have been minutes, it could have been days. No windows, no light, no sound. Only my sense of smell remained with me, and the only thing I picked up was the smell of my own sweat. <br>
<br>
The door swung open, and the light was so blinding I had the shield my eyes. I didn't have to see to know that Relgin and two other guards were standing in the doorway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave us alone, I tell you!&quot; Relgin snapped at one of them. &quot;I'll be alright!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But Captain...&quot; one of them tried.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was ambushed the last time.&quot; Relgin answered harshly. &quot;Do you think he could take me a second time, with me prepared?&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard wasn't about to argue that point. With a grunt, he and his companion left. Just Relgin and I stood in the room, facing each other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry it took so long to get back to you.&quot; Relgin said softly. &quot;There were things I had to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How long have I been in here?&quot; I asked, surprised at the sound of my voice. It croaked. I hadn't had water since I ended up in here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eighteen hours.&quot; Relgin said, reaching for his hip flask. He handed it to me. I grabbed it warily, and brought it to my nose. Odorless. Water. I drank it slowly, controlling myself. I didn't know how much more I'd get. When I finished I looked down at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; I asked simply.<br>
<br>
Relgin's face bore no apology. &quot;I had to get you in here. And I had to make it rough, or they would never have believed it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; I asked again.<br>
<br>
&quot;My baby brother is dead.&quot; And finally his face bore some emotion. Not a lot. But enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;My mother came in this afternoon.&quot; he said. &quot;She was hysterical, screaming and flailing out and crying. I had to use a sleep potion to knock her out. Funny, she always thought I'd be the one to bite it first. Not Gal. Not Mr. School Galpin.&quot; His face scrunched up a bit, an alien, strange, horrifying look. Please don't cry, Relgin. I don't think I could stand to see it. A man should never see his boss cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was stabbed twenty-seven times. Twenty-seven! A knife prefered by hybrids. They found him in Bee-Bee Devilbreed's apartment, naked, sprawled out next to her. She was killed too, same knife, eighteen stab wounds, more than half fatal. Both of them, naked, my brother and a hybrid prostitute. Red and black blood everywhere. Word on the street is that Galpin took her up on that offer she made in court. And that one of her regulars found her in the sack with him, didn't like it, and killed them both.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Galpin wasn't having sex with Bee-Bee.&quot; I said quietly.<br>
<br>
Relgin stared at me. &quot;How do you know that? You're correct, you know. The coroner's report showed no sexual activity had happened. But they could have been killed before anything... happened.&quot; I could see from his face that the thought of his brother and a hybrid whore in a blonde wig revolted him. It revolted ME.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was no way Galpin and Bee-Bee were having sex, interrupted or not.&quot; I said with certainty.<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Relgin asked again, watching me closely.<br>
<br>
&quot;They were both killed and arranged to look like they were. I knew Bee-Bee, very well. She was a talker, and those walks back to the Guardhouse after we'd bust her were long ones. She prided herself on never having to take off her clothes to service a client. Had her clothes tailored for...easy entry. Faster service, she called it. She tried to show us one night, but Ice told her our imaginations would suffice. She wouldn't have taken off her clothes to be with your brother. If she was found naked someone undressed her. Someone who didn't know Bee-Bee. Someone from out of town.&quot;<br>
<br>
Relgin smiled and tossed me a cigarette. He pulled out a cigar and lit it, then lit mine. I inhaled deeply. I had forgotten how badly I needed one.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right, you know. It WAS someone out of town.&quot;<br>
<br>
I exhaled and waited for him to explain.<br>
<br>
&quot;I went to Zo.&quot; he said. &quot;I know, I know. Magic is inadmissable in court, and magic identity traces are wrong half of the time. But I didn't care. I did it on my own time, and with my own money. It cost me a month's salary.&quot; I snorted. I knew Zo's prices. Relgin blew out his smoke, eyes vacant as he continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zo wasn't certain, but he sent me in the direction of Eddie's Greasy Spoon. I found the guy in a room upstairs. New in town, two days paid in advance, from Trillmore. Wanted to know if I had a warrant. Cocky. Arrogant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I knocked out his teeth. Told him that was my warrant. And as he lay writhing on the floor, I searched his room. And found a knife, hybrid-make, in one of his dresser drawers.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;It took two hours for me to beat the information out of him. But I got it. He was sent from Trillmore to kill my brother when it looked like he'd get you aquitted. Someone in the courthouse had seen the number my brother had done on Chelton and wanted to make sure you stayed in jail. Whoever it was contacted this guy, who was waiting to see which way it would go. Then he left for Trillmore after telling the assassin to kill Galpin and make it look like a jealous customer of Bee-Bee's.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trillmore?&quot; I asked. &quot;Dark Rotunda?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; Relgin said. &quot;Rotunda wants you in jail. Now I know where all the pressure was coming from to have you tried quickly. Rotunda could blackmail half of the politicians in Silverdane. He had my brother killed to keep you locked up. Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The crystal.&quot; I whispered, resigned. &quot;He wanted the crystal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The diamond crystal is in Black Haven.&quot; Relgin pointed out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not the diamond crystal.&quot; I said quietly. &quot;The glass crystal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The glass crystal.&quot; Relgin repeated. &quot;The crystal Vilgore had.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;You killed him.&quot; It was a statement, not a question. &quot;I had thought you had, but couldn't figure out how....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the assassin after he confessed?&quot; I asked softly.<br>
<br>
Relgin puffed furiously on his cigar. &quot;Let's just say I understand vengence just as well as you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smoke hung between us. That and an unspoken bond. We both had our secrets from the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Another thing.&quot; Relgin said, breaking the silence. &quot;Your box of personal items was stolen from Inventory. Rotunda must have had it stolen for the crystal. The spy from the courtroom probably has it halfway to Trillmore by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The crystal isn't in it.&quot; I said. &quot;Alyssa has it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll post a guard on the house to watch her.&quot; Relgin promised. &quot;I understand why you killed Vilgore. I liked Ice too. But why did you have to marry his wife?&quot;<br>
<br>
I inhaled deeply. &quot;Blood Oath. Drow custom. A LONG story.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; he told me, not pressing it further. &quot;You can tell me when you get back.&quot;<br>
<br>
That took me for a loop. &quot;Get back?&quot; I asked. &quot;From where?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you think I had to get you into Isolation?&quot; he asked me. &quot;I told everyone that I would be the only one to see you, to knock some sense into your head. You're going to Trillmore to get a confession from Rotunda. You have six more days before your trial starts again. There's a way out of this area, a secret that gets passed from captain to captain. No one else knows about it. No one will even know you're gone.&quot; He swung the door open for me, looked to make sure no guards were loitering around, and gestured me out. He pushed a small bag of silver into one of my hands. Into the other he placed a hybrid-made knife.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be invisible.&quot; he said. I nodded and stepped out of the cell.<br>
<br>
I was free. <br>
