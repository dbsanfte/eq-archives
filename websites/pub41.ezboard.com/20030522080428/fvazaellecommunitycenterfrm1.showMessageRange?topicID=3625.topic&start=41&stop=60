Serano, that's just the nature of the end game guilds.  Guilds like CC and PO are not there to develop members.  These kinds of guilds exist because the people in them aspire to play *THE VERY HIGHEST* level of game play that EQ has to offer.  These types of guilds are like the NFL in a way.  The teams of the NFL do not take on members that they have to develop to a professional level, but instead they scout the colleges looking for the very best of the best to add to their teams.<br>
<br>
That being said, not everybody who plays EQ are destined to be in an end game guild.  Not because they suck (although a lot do hahaha), but more because they just don't have the mentality it takes to play in an end game guild.  It takes pure dedication and an absolute love of the game or you will burn out quick.  I have known a number of good friends that went on to end game guilds, and some did very well while others didn't.  It's different for each individual.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would love to have some of the guys and gals in my guild eventually go on to an end game guild because that means that I as a guild leader did what I needed to get the ready for the hardest challenges the game had to offer.  To me, it's an honor to have someone from your guild be accepted in to an end game guild.<br>

<br>
Umm, yeah, basically, that's the idea.<br>
<br>
Bigemnose came up with an exceptional analogy, so let me build on it a bit if I may.<br>
<br>
Scenario 1 - You love football.  You love playing football.  As a kid, you loved playing football on the playground, or during gym, or whenever you could with your friends.  Heck, maybe even you were talented enough to play it on your high school team.  However, when you graduated high school, you didn't persue it further.  Oh sure, you still played pickup games with your friends on weekends, and you love watching it on TV, and you still fantasize about throwing the winning touchdown in a Superbowl, but you have other things in your life.  You have other concerns like work or relationships that are more important to you.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of EQ players are like this.  They like playing the game, they read the boards, and they fantasize about someday getting in the killing blow on some Big Bad, but due to time or desire, they are content to play the game as nothing more than a game.  They like playing EQ as a form or socializing, goofing off, and are the typical 'casual player'.<br>
<br>
Scenario 2 - You were really good in high school, and decide you want to play football in college.  It's a lot rougher, and takes a lot more time and dedication, but you really love football.  You may decide to go to a smaller school and play football at a 'lower level', but you still have a blast.  You still get happy when you win, still saddened by a tough loss, but your having fun, and that's all that matters.<br>
<br>
This is basically 3rd tier 'guilds'.  Guilds that go after targets, but are more content to just have fun.  Sure, their idea of a huge raid might be to attack a mob that can be killed solo by some uber player, but it's still a challenge and is fun to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>them</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and that's all that matters.  However, much like your local community college will never play in the Rose Bowl, they will never go after any truly big targets - and they really couldn't care less about that.  =)<br>
<br>
Scenario 3 - You want to go big time out of high school, so you decide to go to a big football college, let's say Ohio State given recent events.  You find that you have to dedicate yourself to football now more than ever, and you are going up against some stiff competition.  You still have great times with your teammates, and you still do some other things like study and just hang out, but you give up a lot of your life on road trips and practices.  You still have a lot of fun, but you are, in the back of your mind, considering the possibility that someday you might be lucky enough to end up in the NFL.<br>
<br>
This is what are commenly referred to as 'second tier' guilds.  I won't name names for sake of offending anyone, but you know who you are.  =)  These people take EQ seriously, they want to advance, and they take in some Big Bads indeed.  While they too may have that terriffic 'Rose Bowl'-level fight, they still know they aren't in the NFL.  Still, many, many, many people are very happy here, and the friendships that develop are still very strong.<br>
<br>
Scenario 4 - You decide that college is a blast, but you skip your 4th year, and declare yourself eligible for the NFL draft.  Why?  Sure, BCS games are fun, and you love your teammates, but you want to play with the big boys.  Sure, if you're the star quarterback of your college team, your teammates may not like it much, but it IS your decision to make.  If you do get drafted, you have a chance at a huge salary, and you get to play along and against some of the best known football players in the game.  The game is tough, the dedication is massive, but the rewards are impressive as well.  <br>
<br>
Of course, this refers to the tier one guilds.  They fight the toughest mobs, they get the nicest loots, and they see things that no one else can.  Sure, you have to leave your teammates behind, but that's the price to be paid.<br>
<br>
Look, no NFL team is going to draft you at age 11, and hope that you become a talented football player.  They are able to pick and choose who they want due to their position, and that's just the way life works.  You gain skills and AA and equipment as you rise through different guilds, and if you prove yourself to be dedicated enough, you might just get drafted.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  Scenario 5 - You decide to play for the NFL, you suck, and you get cut.  You then hang out at your local sports bar night after night yelling at the TV,getting drunk, shouting about mow much all the current players suck, and telling anyone that will listen how much better you would be.<br>
<br>
Of course, any analogy to any current VCC posters is purely coincidental.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anikacrystalwind>Anika Crystalwind</A> at: 1/9/03 4:26:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=corpsedagain>CorpsedAgain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1221<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/03 5:28:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3625.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Scenario 5 - hahaha</span><hr size=1> too funny. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198911">Corpsed</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qxired>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1654<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/03 5:29:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3625.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://quarken2012.homestead.com/files/face1.jpg border= 0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Hail, King Tormax&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Let me help people clear stuff up. I don't hate PO. I don't even know who's in PO or what they're up to. I also don't really care. I wrote a parody of someone's post for entertainment for me, my friends, and whoever else wanted to have a chuckle. Nice to see some people smiled from it.<br>
<br>
Baps, no shit, I'm an asshole. I've always claimed that I was. What's you're fucking point? You're an asshole too, you just are more selective about whom you stare at with your big-brown-eye'ed-ness.<br>
<br>
Akethadar is thick skinned. He and I have had a goofy friendship. I first really met him by meeting his &quot;twink&quot;, Saalronsucksdick. Funny to talk to. Funny in his Jaydrox forced name change of Saalronismyhero or something. I make fun because I can, it's just what Akethadar and I do. He might have his quirks but I respect him as a person. Especially if he did something entertaining enough that Goanad still cries about it 10 months after the fact.<br>
<br>
You see, not everyone on this planet lives in a world where you have to be ultra-defensive. Where 1 random post from a former EQ player who trolls on a message board shatters your reality to the point where you have to quote the fuck out of every post he makes. Some people are capable of snickering while I take my shot and send one back at me. Hey, good for them, more entertainment for everyone is always a good thing.<br>
<br>
You see, I don't know Talandra at all, and have no inside knowledge of how PO works. I just know from 8 months ago they used dkp so while it sounds like the current rumor is that they're having troubles mustering a raid force, I thought I'd mix the two up for a fun poke at them. Loot-whoring accusations are always fun and dramatic so adding those in as a seasoning to my recipe was just common sense, as baseless as they are. Read what Ammelen wrote, he said it better anyways.<br>
<br>
If you took the content of my words seriously, you're probably an overly defensive motherfucker who has some insecurities regarding what I wrote down. If I was serious, I'd be sending people tells in-game to resolve things, not blow them up for entertainment on a message board.<br>

I seem to have missed a few posts, so off to read them, but if you are no longer playing EQ why do you feel the need to comment in a community that is no longer yours? Its as valid as posting on some &quot;Teen Lesbian&quot; boards.<br>

Anyone besides me think that Druric is jealous because he was not creative enough to come up with this type of shout. This is just one of the many funny shouts by Ake. But of course we forgot that you are perfect and have never trained anyone. So feel free to bitch, piss and moan how he is a monk and should have FDed. That can get you started on your next post.

If you get all that stuff from guid raids and then take it with you (cause its no drop) you have just shorted your guild of the DPS that they have built up in you.  Why not take your guild to a new level by staying instead of bolting because you now qualify.  <br>
<br>
I get the NFL analogy... and I am against the mourning and antagonism that occurs when people DO depart a guild for a perceived better guild.  However - The part where the analogy goes sour is that in the NFL its all about bucks - and franchises and expantion teams.  In EQ you can be a part of what turns your guild into an expantion team.  By staying.  I am not limited by being part of a family guild.  I get to watch progression in a guild versus leaving to see progression.<br>
<br>
It is one of the coolest things to see the heros that departed to join what they thought they needed in other guilds - return home.  So what if we have only seen 2 or 3 guildies get their epic so far.  next month we will double that.  then the next month double that... and again... and then - start getting those post epic weaps and drops.<br>

We are a guild dedicated to playing fair, we expect our members to behave with respect always, and as such those who don't like this idea need not apply.<br>

Quite frankly this is the only reason i posted anything. I found it quite entertaining that this sentance was used in the recruitment post when PO's raid leader (Akethdar) apparently trains people whom he's never had contact with before for his own entertainment. Shrug. We were only there to grind exp minding our own business. We made a camp check noone said caves we were there 3 hours no problems then all of a sudden we were the target of someone we dont know. Just found it entertaining.  And yes he is a monk so we knew it was on purpose he made that abundantly clear. <br>
