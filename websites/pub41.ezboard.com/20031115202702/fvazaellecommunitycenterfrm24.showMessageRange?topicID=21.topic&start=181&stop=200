 Backster<br>
<br>
Ok, going to have to point the flaw out in this portion of the argument.  What about truly insane people, that go out and commit murder.  They have no choice, they are completely fucking nuts and cant control their homicidal urges.  According to the bible, they are condemned to the fiery lakes.  Ofcourse, insanity could get you off the hook in even a divine court.  The Bible doesnt really address insanity, as insanity back in the day was thought to have its origins in supernatural causes (ie, you burn at the stake for being possessed or a demon riding witch, then burn in hell anyway because the Church just sent you there First Class).  So what about these folks?<br>
<br>
Ok, lets get away with insane.  Some people just feel the need to engage in sex.  They have some physical need to fuck.  Its something they can control, but they dont always succeed.  Sort of like the argument that Aarcanus puts forth, you CAN choose to not engage in homosexual acts, you might suffer anxiety from denying yourself expression of these urges, but so are nymphomaniac's.  <br>
<br>
The list goes on for people that have socially unacceptable urges...  They could CHOOSE not to express these urges, and sometimes they do and sometimes dont.  But it is their choice.  Homosexuality happens to be an emerging socially acceptable phenomenon.  These others are not, but still suffer from the trauma of not being able to engage in those acts which would make their quality of lives vastly improved, but society itself frowns on their actions, and thus they must endure.<br>
<br>
As for the biological evidence of homosexuality, well, the only theories put forth so far are very tenuous, and most have no very little statistical significance.  So I withold on my thoughts on this till  some actual valid biological evidence is presented.  So far though, there is seems to be more evidence against sexual orientation being biological then it it actually having its roots in biology.  The pro-biological sides just happens to recieve more media hype.  Thus occasions of it being biological more readily coming to mind, as you have recieved more memory cues for it. <br>
<br>
I agree with Lowfyr, you shouldnt so easily allow other to offend you.  But in the case of minorities, I have to see their side.  Wouldnt you be offended when you here these negative interpretations of your lifestyle?  Nobody likes to think that their &quot;group&quot; is less than human, as the use of the terms imply.  After all, if everyone in society uses a term only as a perjorative, then how can you but think that society as a whole percieves your &quot;group&quot; in a negative fashion?<br>
<br>
You shouldnt care what one person thinks, but when the great majority thinks something, that could spell trouble for your group.  For example, in the realm of job oppurtunity.  How many people have failed to get obtain a working position because of their sexual orientation.  And before you say they should hide it, fuck off, because they shouldnt have too.<br>

It's a very rare person that has no choices... the newborn child with a crippling disease, the injurned veteran who can't maintain a grip on reality, Birch, etc. Backster, you don't sound like someone who is mentally deficient. I wouldn't guess you qualify.<br>
<br>
Anywon's right. Most people who are gay are that way because of being unwilling to do the work involved for a meaningful heterosexual relationship. Men and women will never agree on everything. It won't even come close. If you're too easy to offend or too hung up on always having your own way, by all means find someone else who's fucked up enough to be your partner.<br>
<br>
Just don't carry a chip around because most of society doesn't respect you more than a thief because many people consider your actions to be much worse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umeiren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meiren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/6/02 12:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=183>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Homophobes and Language</span><hr size=1> For the record, I dont agree with Saalron's agreeing with Anywon.

I would imagine that homosexual relationships have as many difficulties as any heterosexual relationship, with only the actual nature of those difficulties being different. not the number.<br>

<br>
As has been readily revealed here being openly homosexual is not the easy way out as Saalron would insist but incredibly difficult in a society that largely believes them to be unholy disgusting godless monsters.<br>
<br>
Of course there was a time when mainstream America felt that black folk were not fully human and were lesser beings than white folk. Try that attitude in public in 90% of the country and you will probably go to jail or get your ass kicked. <br>
<br>
It seems to me only a matter of time before the same thing happens with homosexuality. When that happens people will lose their jobs for saying &quot;fag&quot; in the workplace and anti-homosexuality will seem reactionary and barbaric.  <p>Prybutok Agonista<br>

HERE'S the issue:  &quot;Equality&quot;.<br>
<br>
You want Equality? You want no discrimination?  Then don't expect special treatment.  I'm not going to treat you with kid gloves just because you think fucking a man up the ass is preferable to fucking a woman up the ass, or a sheep, or whatever.  As far as I'm concerned, EVERYONE is a valid target for my sarcasm, regardless of race, creed, or sex.  And guess what? I'm not particularly going to hold back on what words I use.  If you're so thin skinned you can't handle it, maybe you should re-consider whether you really have what it takes to exist in society as an equal.<br>
<br>
America is about men and women and the transgendered of all ages and races coming together and relentlessly making fun of the first person that presents a valid target.  Now, let's all get together, hold hands and sing Kum bai yah.<br>

To answer a couple of points, somebody said something about Backster advertising his sexuality (I cannot remember who and I cannot be bothered to go look). Well, Backster is one of the few people I always talk to in game and at no point has the conversation included &quot;Hi I am gay&quot;. To be honest, until this thread I did not know. Why is that? Because what goes on in his private life is just that - private. Really, why do we care? Is it really going to affect me if I know that there are folks out there 'riding the chocloate speedway'? Nope.<br>

I don't wanna turn this into the religion thread all over again, and don't quote me as I don't have a copy of the good book in front of me...  The bible teaches us tolerance, not to accept something that is wrong in it's very essence.<br>
<br>
A man shall NOT lay with another man. It is an abomination unto the Lord.<br>
<br>
Something like that. Sorry if someone mentioned it or the post took on a whole new rant, but like I said, I didn't have time to read the whole post today.<br>
<br>
That being said... I won't call you gay, or even ghey, how about fucktard?! My new fav word, and I think maybe it fits. <br>

  Seriously, that book is whacked.  Scholars are aware of four-major editing phases, BEFORE King James and all the other versions.<br>
<br>
  What it means, boys and girls, is that you DO NOT have a clear ruling from The Almighty on the issue of homosexuality, you DO NOT have a lock on the ideal moral standards.  For all you know, one of the editors of The Bible might have been a repressed homosexual. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

   So, unless you happen to have the original stone tablets that God gave to Moses, I'd suggest maybe a little more thought before bandying His Will about, pls0r.  On the other hand, I thought Krialis was selling them on Ebay, so maybe you DO have them.<br>

If you are too lazy to read the whole thing read their summaries.  <br>
<br>
Silvir has a point though.  It's hard to find good ways to insult people these days.  You just have to be a little more creative in your insults, which, I think, is a good thing.  Any idiot can call someone a fag to express their disgust for them; the truly witty find much better ways to insult people.<br>
<br>
Example: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=482984cdd14668b632399bec8955e8d6&amp;threadid=1813&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=3">This thread</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> contains some truly original and clever insults.<br>
<br>
&quot;This sort of glorious genius was inevitable from someone who uses &quot;BarbWar&quot; as the surname for their Barbarian Warrior. That fact alone would have set off a huge red flag in my mind the first time I saw it. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see Banelor and tHoGg go at it. The sheer intelligence void created by their collision would destroy human existence.&quot;     <br>
