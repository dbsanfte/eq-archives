<br>
Yeah I agree that this is stupid but if Verant continues to put gear on easy to kill mobs that is the best in the game, I don't see this kind of thing stopping anytime soon. Lodi Shell is way too good for a mob like Leonardo the &quot;ninja&quot; turtle. IV doesn't chase Lodi really or watch his spawn all that closely, but if we find out he is up then your damned straight we will kill him. Same for any guild on Vaz. You gotta be fast on him, that is just a fact that you need to accept as reality. <br>
<br>
<br>
 If you REALLY want him then you will find out when he was last killed and know approximatley when he will pop, you will have your strat done before hand and everyone will know what he is about including what nukes to use etc... Then you keep one person there at his spawn and wait for him with everyone on high alert. Many guilds do this and the casual guild may not realize just how much prep work other guilds put into ensuring they get him. So in light of that... Should the guild that has done all this prep work to know when he is up and put in a great deal of effort then bow down to a casual guild that happened to get there first but didn't put any effort at all into him other than being there first by chance?<br>
<br>
Both tough questions and I don't think there is really any one good answer that works for all, so in the end you gotta keep it simple and make sure that you are there when he pops if you decide you need him badly enough.<br>

It has been years, but the following quote from Plato's Meno has stuck out in my mind:<br>
<br>
<br>
Socrates: &quot;...But Meno, by the gods, what do you yourself say that virtue is? Speak and do not begrudge us, so that I may have spoken a most unfortunate untruth when I said that I had never met anyone who knew, if you and Gorgias are shown to know.<br>
<br>
Meno: It is not hard to tell you, Socrates. First, if you want the virtue of a man, it is easy to say that a man's virtue consists of being able to manage public affairs and in so doing to benefit his friends and harm his enemies and to be careful that no harm comes to himself...&quot;<br>

<br>
Most mobs and most situations are and should be, first to engage.  In most cases ALL guilds will be more than fair with this rule.  Often guilds even go a step further and say if you've got the peeps there already to engage, and are buffing to do so, we won't jump in.  It is not always the case but mostly it is so.  <br>
<br>
If a guild tries to kill a mob and dies, then another guild has the right to kill the said mob no questions asked.  (Doesn't necessarily mean they SHOULD kill the mob, but they've certainly got the right to do so.)<br>
<br>
I've had issues with other scenarios, mostly relating to the planes but...alas...we now know how these things are working from here on out so nuff said...<br>
<br>
The last scenerio I'm struggling with is listed below and is in referance to a planes mob.  This is not a scenario I've ever been a part of.<br>
<br>
Guild_A spends X hours clearing the way to Mob_001.  They are enroute when Guild_B comes in and takes Mob_001 knowing full well that Guild_A had already done most of the prep work.  (Maybe even they already got their shot at it and died...and are now rebuffing to try again.)  <br>
<br>
No matter how I look at this I can't find it acceptable. Guild_B is taking advantage of the work Guild_A has already done and depriving Guild_A of the rewards of their own work.  To me this is theft pure and simple. <br>
<br>
What's your take on this Kaz?  If you don't want to respond on board due to ...whatever... I can understand this and would be happy to discuss in tells.  I did NOT want to outline the above in tells though so posted here.  :P Yeah I'm lazy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 9:40:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The servers attitude, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> as usual, people who use quotes to talk for them get all gnomic rather than defending them when questioned. <p>Procax

My theory on this is that some mobs/items are placed in the game specifically to be points of conflict.  It adds a wider spectrum of emotion and intensity to the game.  It draws people further into the game.<br>
<br>
They had to know bigger guilds would step over smaller guilds in races to Cazic, they had to know that Lodi would be a super-FFA nukefest.  I kind of see Lodizal as the Orc Trainer 2.<br>
<br>
In the end, I think it's not all bad.  I've said this before, I would not play EQ via a calander.  The clockwork of it would be terrible and boring.  Killing Lodi tastes that much better when there was a chance of losing him to another group.  It adds a free market, gold rush element to the game.<br>
<br>
When I was a kid, almost all Nintendo games were Player vs Environment, but there was still competition when playing with friends.  Everyone wanted to be the best player, everyone wanted to be the one who figured out a tricky part of Megaman, everyone wanted to be the one who killed the end boss.<br>
<br>
Of course, when I was younger, I used to enjoy competing with other guys for the affection of women too.  I enjoy competition, win or lose.  Some people are like that.  <br>
<br>
In my experience, most people who don't like competition are those who feel that they can't compete -- so they compete in a different way, they try to change the rules in a way which benefit them.<br>

They have helped out my guild when requested and we have always dealt with them in great awe.<br>
I have dealt with Procax and respect that knowledge that Procax has.<br>
But, that last post is nervous making if that is truly the philosophy.<br>
Assume that we are all children on a new world and to grow fast and large requires food which is only available at one place, a place hard to get to that the government gives out. So the first few that get there get the food and grow bigger. Then as they are now bigger when the next drop occurs they can get to it easier and the others still struggle to get there. The more they get to it faster the stronger and bigger they get.<br>
Then as they walk away wiping their faces belching from their full stomachs staring at the other starving kids, for them to then say, &quot;Hey kid don't look at me. It isn't my fault, it's the government for making it to easy.&quot; Is insane.<br>
The point to that post says if I can I should. <br>
And I do  hope that is not true.<br>
For indeed, as another said, that is anarchy and chaos.<br>

This is not a veiled attempt at a slam on you Ceros, I actually agreed with the post that I pulled this excerpt from. I just find this situation rather ...interesting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 1:48:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The servers attitude, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> Not that it is anyones business, but... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I quit the game a couple of months ago, as a member of good standing -- or so I hope -- of In Virtue.<br>
<br>
IV is a very close guild, and even if I'm not playing EQ, I still read the boards and consider them to be friends.<br>
<br>
A week ago or so, I reactivated my secondary account to mess around with my low level druid.  Soon, I'll likely start playing my IV guilded cleric again.<br>

Most of my posts come while bored at work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukaziqueal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 2:01:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The servers attitude, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> We're tight like that ^^.<br>
