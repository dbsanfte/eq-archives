Velks used to not be easy.  As a matter of fact, it was downright tough.  Spiders had huge magic resistance and procced a poison that was basically unresistable.  Did I mention they greened out around 40ish?  Still though, anything is doable with Rokko Rollen, that guy was an amazing cleric.  And yes, that was a 5 man, 2 chanter group thanks.<br>

<br>
Nabiki was someone who I met in a shop one day trying to sell pokemon cards to make some cash. I told him to try ebay and he said that he only dealt with Everquest stuff on it. I said Everquest wtf is that? He told me what it was about and I played for a bit loving the game, then he told me what server he played on, I didnt want to restart my lvl 9 druid after all that hard work but I did and moved to Lanys. His name over there was Akanne (first lvl 60 druid on the server), and he got into some shit and pretty much left the server and I never really talked to him for a while.<br>
<br>
One day out of nowhere he shoots me a tell in the game telling me that he lives in Austin now and hes going to start on vazaelle when the server opened and I told him I would come with him. I looked up to the guy being the best EQ player I knew in RL and told my RL friend ollunnap who was pretty excited about it. He and I started chars first day on vazaelle, I made a human druid named bulma, Akanne made Nabiki, and Ollunnap made Ryoko. <br>
<br>
Leveling my own druid was fun for a bit but then I remember seeing some guy named Raif who was always 1 lvl above me, around lvl 20 or so I agreed with Nabiki to help lvl his druid up if he would let me use it to PL one of my own chars. We did pretty well I had thought and I had gained a nickname of Nabiki2 in his guilds and everyone was very polite and nice with me.<br>
<br>
Around 51 he quit lvling his druid and started to lvl up his ogre warrior but by this time I had already left the game because school was just being affected too much. AKA I got wasnt allowed to play EQ at my house ;p. So I basicly didnt play for a while.<br>
<br>
Later I come back and hes got a lvl 60 warrior, 55 cleric, and nabiki about 53 now. I started to talk with him and he agreed that he would still let me use Nabiki but by this time the original gomes who was playing some enchanter Mrykonar or something like that was using Nabiki to PL and other things as well. I still PLed whenever I could with Nabiki but usually grouped and things were going halfway decent on the server. I was about 10 lvls behind Soliid who I found out was Lweas and about 10 lvls behind my friend Ryoko.<br>
<br>
One day Nabiki tells me that he is going to quit and I figured he was going to sell his stuff again. I was a bit sad that I got dragged over here and he was just going to leave. I then see this guy in EC auctioning a lot of stuff and I immediately recognized the name and knew it was him. I figured he had picked up all that stuff while I was away from EQ, and he told me to come here and gave me a few items like TBB, some resist gear, and a frogloks' crown. It really did make my day though and I was very happy. I ended up selling some of the resist gear since I didnt need it at the lvl to buy a 9/20 Spine Razor Krimzin was selling. I managed to get the money buy it and my days were going along smooth! <br>
<br>
The very next day however I try to log in and my account is suspended. Gomes was very upset over the whole thing and I understood why he was after I found out exactly what happened. He told the GM to get anyone who was connected with this and it just so happened that I was suspended for selling illegal items for personal gain. I was pretty much shattered but figured that Gomes, Jaydrox, and Chug would help me out and I wouldnt have gotten banned. <br>
<br>
I talked to Chug and Gomes in real life and Jaydrox in the game a lot during these times but in the end I DID have items that were stolen from an account regardless if I knew about it or not, I was banned a week later. <br>
<br>
I was too addicted to the game though, bought a new account and went back to Lanys. I lvled up my rogue over there named Hakuna and was doing pretty well. I was talking to less and less with my friend Ryoko though in RL and when they had character transfers available I took the first chance I could and did it. Thus Jetx was born on Vazaelle.<br>
<br>
Last I heard from Nabiki though he was in a good guild on the Roleplaying server playing both a cleric and warrior.<br>
<br>
This post may be a bit long but I hope that you know Nabiki does not = Keanu, but Keanu does = Jetx <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 442<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/26/01 3:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some old pics </span><hr size=1> Ah, so you were that mysterious Nabiki2 that I helped kill Garou so long ago, LOL, only to get that shitty Fang of the Garou and the Cleric Undead DoT, I think(of which I had the latter already)...<br>
<br>
And yeah, I remembered the whole Chug/Gomes(#1) thing(They're friends for a few servers now, although I don't speak to them as often anymore)<br>
<br>
Explains the Keanu -&gt; Nabiki connection alot better though, and that incident did suck alot for everyone involved... and is another example to point at about the various ways you eventually flip out if you hardcore EQ for too long...<br>
