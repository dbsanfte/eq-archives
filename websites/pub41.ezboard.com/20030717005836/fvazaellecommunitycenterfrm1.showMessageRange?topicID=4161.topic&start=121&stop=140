If you people honestly think I deserved &quot;If you don't like the way a motherfucker talks don't fucking read it. You can take your Zest-Fully Clean mouth and shove it up your fucking ass. It's intolerant judgemental ass-hatted CUNTS like yourself that make me want to shove my FUCK-YOU sandwich in your mouth and make you wash it down with some HOLY-FUCK-THATS-ALOT-OF-FUCKING-CUM. Maybe you should get off your language diet and try out some FUCKING MEATY COCK you stupid bitch. CUNT CUNT CUNT.<br>
btw, mad props Q.. /jumpinMOFIAbodyslap &quot;<br>
<br>
and if THIS is representative of the Vazaelle server, then I am very glad I don't play on this server. <br>
I used to think highly of it, people on the EQ boards always recommended it as being full of nice people, and there are a few that post there that I genuinely like.  Im sorry to see that it is apparently untrue.  Hopefully this genius is in the minority on your server....if not, its very sad.  If you want to idolize your monk hero for his trash mouth, THIS guy should be God on your server.  It's too bad that people think they need to talk like that to be either important or funny or listened to. <br>
<br>
<br>
No I havent vacated the thread, I have a real life, I don't sit here and refresh it to see what garbage you all can say about me.  I will not apologize for saying what a number of other people have said, on here and on the EQ boards.  <br>
<br>
I never said I was unguilded, did I?    No I am not in TMO,  I am not in Lost Dragons either.  If you honestly think that someone is only worth something because of the guild they are in, then you are sad as well.  What guild I am in does not matter one BIT when it comes to my opinion. If I were in TMO and still said these same things, would you suddenly think I was ok?  Would it honestly make a difference if I were in TMO, that suddenly my opinions were valid?  If that is what you base your judgement on, then that is narrowminded and more than a little pathetic. <br>
<br>
 <br>
 If you dont believe I am level 65, I don't really care.  If you don't believe I have been playing this for years, so what?  Guess what - a character in Everquest means nothing in the real world. Nothing. It is a game, a collection of pixels in a game. It does not get you a better job, it does not make you important, nothing. If I were level 1 , it would make absolutely no difference in anything but a GAME.  I'm sorry some of you seem to not know/realize this.<br>
<br>
I have to wonder why I am the target of all the hostility when there are SO many others flat out calling him a liar on this board and other boards?  There are far worse than mine, for sure.  Please feel free to come up with your foolish &quot;cuz ur a n00b&quot; , or &quot;ur teh suxxors ur guild suxxors stfu &quot; type comments.  Or have more of the above type posts if that is what does it for you.  I'm done posting here.   It's a waste of my time and keystrokes to try to reason with unreasonable people. So have a good time,  I seem to be important to many of you for some odd reason...go for it *shrug* <br>
<br>
And to the one that said the IQ comment, that was...profound. I can only hope to achieve your level of intelligence one day. <br>

<br>
Problem is, you came here to attack the credibility of one of the most upstanding members of the community.  <br>
<br>
This is a very nice server.  Low population, and people from all guilds generally get along.<br>
<br>
If you wish to spew venom, we do have a Rant board.<br>
<br>
Vazaelle has NO doubt that this actually happened.  It is people from other servers who have no idea who this monk is that come here to call him a liar, and to belittle us for believing him.  Quarken has gone out of his way, against all reason, to prove this to people who do not know him.  I wish he would stop feeding the trolls, and have fun with this.  It isn't their oppinion that should matter.<br>
<br>
I think I can speak for everyone when I say that we are glad you don't play on this server either.  Please go back to your own server board and spew trash there.  I'm sure they will all bow down to your superior knowledge and quad-kiting skills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qxired>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1883<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/18/03 3:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4161.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/gastrolicious/qx-face1.jpg border= 0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serverwide first? updated again, your answers have arriv</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If I were in TMO and still said these same things, would you suddenly think I was ok?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You didn't do your homework before you went all half-cocked and posted your knee-jerk flame denying the possibility.  If you had, you would have found some interesting information:  Namely, Promethian Order is the #1 American guild, and the #2 overall guild on Vaz, that Tecknoe is a twink alt of one of PO's star tanks, and that he is pretty respected as a player on our server.  Then you stereotype the whole server of Vazaelle based on the replies to your post where you invited yourself to be flamed?  Umm, it may come as a big surprise to you, but not everyone sees the world as you do.  In this case, Quarken likes to use some colorful language you find offensive...so what?  Does that make him any less skilled as a player or a person?  Does the fact that he uses proper Anglo-Saxon vocabulary make have any bearing on the possibility of his claim?  Take your goddamn morality crusade somewhere else, it ain't welcome here.<br>
<br>
Then you say you are 65, as if that means you have mastered all of Everquest.  Actually, that shows you know either how to bid on Player Auctions, or perhaps that you know how to grind through lower PoP teirs (not exactly rocket science).  News Flash:  There is content that a &quot;casual&quot; player really can't comment on with authority in a room full of &quot;hardcore&quot; players at or near the top level of skill...and PoP is full of it.  While it is possible that you are a little more than this, we don't know you, and you don't provide any way for us to take your skill level into context, other than to deny that you aren't in your server's top 2 guilds.  What does your guild do raidwise?  Some information please, not more holier-than-thou preaching.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm only just now learning stuff Quarken probably has either forgotten, or that is second nature to him.  But I at least know this...you, meanwhile, belittle him in your ignorance about how he cannot participate in his guild's elemental raids based upon his level.  umm....hello, ever heard of alts?  Your doctor called, that lamasil perscription you need for that nasty case of trenchmouth you've developed from repeatedly shoving your foot into your mouth is ready.<br>
<br>
You sent your dog to piss on our lawn.  You think we are really gonna just laugh it off?  You asked for flamage, you got it.<br>
<br>
Now, some stereotypiung of my own:  Mila, please turn off your computer and put your tinfoil-lined hat so you can go attend your Flat Earth Society meeting before you go see your faith-healer so the Lord will cure your acute case of IdunnowhentoSTFUitis.<br>

2 or 3 heal pots, a mend, a good DS and some buffs and you are golden. Not that this isn't really cool, but it's really not all that hard to do if you are not brain dead.

<br>
someone suggested that the raid would never leave the zone with the corpse still there..see above for 'maybe they didn't leave' and then consider you could leave droppable loot on the corpse.<br>
<br>
You havn't suggested any any point what the strategy used was. 200 heal potions?<br>
<br>
You've not accounted for Vox's Cheal, No the SoD does not stun and no you can move him around enough to interupt alone.<br>
<br>
All you have is a guy who says he did it, and a guild backing him up because 1) They Helped him Do it and 2) They'll be a laughing stock when someone a can prove it is a hoax later.<br>
<br>
<br>
You stuck your neck out there, i'm suprised a single person has bought this load. <br>
<br>
Anticipated response: &quot;who are you?&quot; or &quot;Why would we lie?&quot; or &quot;You're just cynical&quot;<br>

Unanticiapated response: An answer to any of these questions<br>

Maybe the reason you don't anticipate an answer to your "points" is that THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED.<br>

Anyway, grats on the impressive achievement. Can't wait for those videos; they sound fun to watch. :)<br>

Go back ONE PAGE. ONE PAGE!! Do you actually read the contents of a thread before ranting? On the page right before this one, HE POSTS HIS LOG. It's not just DPS, it's HOW LONG you can SUSTAIN that DPS. <br>
<br>
You can theoretically kill any mob that:<br>
1) has regen less than your DPS; and <br>
2) has DPS less than your capabilities of regenning/healing. In this case, Q's DPS far exceeds that of Vox or Naggy's regen (old world mobs), and Vox/Naggy simply don't do enough DPS versus all of his heals, regen, and INTELLIGENCE at using those items.<br>
<br>
Now, during a long fight, I find it very likely that Vox or Naggy would run out of mana casting other spells before they even got to CH. Even if they didn't though, and were able to CH, it's still only a matter of SUSTAINING your DPS. As long as he can kill Vox or Naggy once, he can kill Vox or Naggy complete healed 3 times as long as he has the regenerative/healing capabilities to do so. This is why pickup raids on Vox/Naggy fail...they don't do a very good job at SUSTAINING DPS. Any attempt at CH rotations or keeping a MA/SA typically fall apart with the first fear or AE spell that interrupts casting.<br>
<br>
<br>
One last thing, to all the haters that say this is going to get us monks nerfed....no it's not. If it gets anything adjusted, it will be Vox/Naggy's regen rates or the healing items that Q used.<br>
<br>
Q...awesome job. Way to think outside the box, and way to put down the haters.
