<br>
-include force required with classes and numbers if necessary<br>
<br>
-post for your main only at this time<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>once an encounter has been completed - EDIT your post! Do not post a new post.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If you post here -<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>a plan will get to you when we can.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It might not be next week and it might not be until next month - but with gobs of people all working theirs - but a raid force needed for all, patience - patience.<br>
While some of you are keeping a nice run down of what is left on your epic in your own threads - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this is the only thread that will be used in the near future for Epic raid planning.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Whoever posts their checklist in this thread will be planned for - guild capability and other events considered.   The Epic raid council WILL continue to plan for some early level camps and takedowns for rotating classes early epic drops.  <br>
<br>
These scheduled events will shore up those that have longer to go on their epics than those with just a couple pieces left.  Without filling up our schedule with TOO many events that detract from playing the epic raid council will continue to plan these events based on a variety of factors - mostly from requests but also from general knowlege of which things are fun to put together.<br>

no need to feel over humble - if you have an interest in your epic at all or have been working at it on the side - POST YOUR CHECKLIST. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seranotf>SeranoTF</A> at: 1/1/03 12:39:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seranotf>SeranoTF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Pathadin</span><br>  Posts: 697<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/02 10:04:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tribalfury.com/images/serano.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Post a checklist of what is left for your epic HERE</span><hr size=1> here is what I have left to do to finish mine,  Since I got Swiftwind - I consider my epic OVER - there is a 2nd sword that I might get as a bonus someday - but not really worried about it.<br>

He is on a rare pop out of several (12) places, so there can be multiples of him up, although I have never seen more than 2. The drop rate is about 1 in 4. One uber group can do him, although you probably need an all out raid.<br>
<br>
(Full blown Hate raid.  Magi P'tasa is a mini-boss mob in Hate, not to be underestimated, but stories I have read were successful for the most part.)<br>
<br>
~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~<br>
<br>
The Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water is dropped from Phinigel Autropos. The Phinigel Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard. He can be taken out by around 2-3 groups that work well together. He enjoys dispelling people (usually your enduring breath.) He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.<br>
<br>
(Phinny, 2 group minimum, raid level task.  His guards must be single pulled beneath the ledge where we would pull Phinny to.  Hit him hard, hit him fast.  After we pulled all but his last guard, we actually went in and had one tank take the last guard while the other tank and I worked on phinny till we could all focus on phinny.  Once there were two melee on Phinny, I could begin to work my magic of debuffing and then nuking.  After dropping him twice now, the method I like the best is single pulling the guards, all if possible, leaving one is ok as you can have someone charm the last guard, a great way to pet mez should a repop occur.  Once Phinny only has at max 1 guard left, CHARGE!)<br>
~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~<br>
<br>
The Crown of Elemental Mastery is dropped from anything on the 7th Island in Plane of Air. Basically, clearing the island can result in anywhere from 0-3 crowns. The crowns are not no drop, so they can be bought, but for extremely high prices.  aka, 150k pp.<br>
<br>
(MUCHO differing information throughout the web regarding just exactly which island these drop on.  I am going to hunt down some epic magi and milk them for info.  I will be back to edit this piece with my findings.)<br>
<br>
<br>
That is my punchlist. These all pretty much require a full on raid.  Having completed my piece in City of Mist (Neh'Ashiir conned yellow to 54 btw) I plan on campin out as much as I can in kedge.  Since I dropped Undertow but need piece from Phinny still, I am leaving my 31 ranger parked at Kedge to continue checking on spawns.  Kedge is not a place for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.  We had no real issues with Phinny dispelling EB spells, as he was too busy soiling his pants.  He does nuke for upwards of 600dmg, so get that MR ready <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Mainlty posting this so you know what needs to be done for monk epic.  Not sure if I have the drive for &quot;epic&quot; although it would be nice.  Maybe when I am post 55 and bored, I'll try for it &lt;shrug&gt; anyway ... here ya go ...................<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Step 2: The search for Lhaeo. <br>
<br>
In the hidden cove in Timorous Deep you will find Lhaeo. When queried he will give hints about the book of the Celestial Fists. To get this book you turn in your reference from Danl and your ROWF. The monks who first did this had balls of steel, no doubt. They did this on faith and desperation. <br>
<br>
Step 3: Bondage in Trak's Teeth. <br>
<br>
After receiving the book head over to TT. Somewhere in the vicinity of the OS tunnel, about the ruins, you will find a level 45 NPC named Kaiaren. When hailed he will act all whiney. When asked about the Celestial Fists he has something to say. Turn your book in to him and you get the same book back, and he gets unhappy with you. Just have an enchanter use blanket of forgetfulness on him and go see his true form. When you talk to the true form he will send you on a mission to destroy the fist of fire. Note: After a certain patch, you now have to turn your book in to get the Eejag quest, and the book you get back *is not* the same one you gave him before, so do not turn this book in to anyone other than the true form. <br>
<br>
Step 4: Come out, come out wherever you are! <br>
<br>
The fist of fire is named Eejag, and will come out if challenged. Time to round up a group and head to LS. Find the mob 'fire sprite' and say to it 'I challenge you, Eejag'. At this point Eejag will spawn and shout to the entire zone. If he's already spawned he doesn't shout, but he'll be there for you all the same. Eejag is in the lava pit by sol a, b, temple, so bring a porter with you. A well balanced group will have no problems with this fight if well prepared. Bump FR as high as you can get it, because you have to fight Eejag in the lava. The simplest way to do this is to have regrowth and a bard with you. Shaman casts regrowth, and bard plays whatever hp song it has. Tanks go under and beat Eejag up while nukers and healers lev up on the wall. When a tank needs a heal, swim to the surface and get one. Nukers only go under to cast then go back up. Eejag drops some scales. Take these back to Kaiaren's true form for directions on the rest of the quest, and the scales back. <br>
<br>
Step 5: Up, up, and away! <br>
<br>
Take the scales up to the Plane of Air. On Dojorn's island you will find 'a presence'. Hand the scales to this mob and Gwan will spawn. Gwan hits for 160ish, and the same group that took out Eejag will have no problems here. Fight Gwan away from the edge, though, as she procs a minor knockback and stun. MR will help here. Once Gwan bites the dust, get your Breath of Gwan and move on. <br>
<br>
Step 6: Hi ho! Hi ho! It's off to Earth we go! <br>
<br>
The next fist is Trunt, the Fist of Earth. His hidden form is 'a sleeping ogre' in the Mines of Nurga. Hand your breath to the ogre, and Trunt will spawn and immediately try to kill you. He hits for 176, double attacks, and hits fairly fast so you'll want a backup healer or a second cleric at this point, but otherwise 1 group can do it easy. When Trunt dies you get his rockfilled head (really, it weighs 20!). <br>
<br>
Step 7: Splish splash, let's take a bath. <br>
<br>
The Fist of Water is a no-fight, so this is very easy. In the underwater caverns of Lake Rathe you will find a DE named Deep. Hand her the head, and she will hand it back and despawn after telling you to take it to her master. <br>
<br>
Step 8: Over there! Over there! <br>
<br>
In OT you will find a monk named Astral Projection. Hand him the head and receive Eye of Kaiaren. Follow the dialogue and he despawns, telling you where to meet him next. <br>
<br>
Step 9: Master Vorash <br>
<br>
In Lake of Ill Omen, out on the platform in the middle of the lake you will find Astral Projection again. This fight is a tough one, so I'd suggest at least 3 groups. Once you hand Astral Projection the Eye it will spawn Vorash and Deep, who immediately start kicking butt and taking names. Have one group take Deep out. She hits for 160ish, and procs Fist of Water, so that group will want lots of CR. Master Vorash procs Fist of Mastery, which is a mean stun and DD, so those two groups will want MR. I don't know how hard he hits yet, I'll edit that in later. Once both mobs are dead Xenovorash will spawn. He's mean. Very mean. I believe he will be proccing Fist of Sentience which is a megastun and 500DD. So everyone will want MR at this point. Again, don't know what he hits for, but 3 groups shouldn't have too much trouble. Xenovorash drops a Demon's Fang. <br>
<br>
Step 10: Home again. <br>
<br>
Kaiaren's true form wanted proof of Vorash's defeat, and now you have it, so off to TT for you again. Hand in your fang and book of Celestial Fists to get your FA. This quest is level locked, so no need to worry about twinkies running around with monk FAs who haven't earned them. &gt;<br>

<br>
WHERE...Burning Woods (-2000, +1500)<br>
WHO...Ixiblat Fer, lvl 62 immense Fire Elemental, 32000hp, melee dmg max 575, casts AE fire (300pt dd~resistable)<br>
WHEN...gotta do a turn in between 6am and 6pm game time in that zone right b4 we kill em.<br>
HOW...Raid, Need a chanter and shammy for sure and mages with fire pets, main tank over 55, and as many healers and melee that we can get. Some tactics I've read: Most people pull him to skyfire zone before fightin, and report that he follows pullers reliably without aggroing additional mobs.  His magic resistance is reportedly average to below average for his lvl, and he is not immune to fire based spells, but cold magic recommeded.  Mage fire pets will be immune to his AE fire proc.  He will attempt to run when low on health, and he apparently has a high regen rate which will take affect near the end of the fight if he is not finished quickly. Slows debuffs highly recommended, charmed wurms do good damage as well.  Also that all melee cept main tank should attack form behind to avoid being hit by riposte. <br>
<br>
WHERE...Chardok<br>
WHO...Overking Bathezed, lvl 63, melee dmg max 385, casts fiery death(ae approx 500hp dmg, cancels one buff), complete heal, gravity flux, and gate.<br>
WHEN  -<br>
HOW...Raid, some tactics I've read: If we fight in his room, must be carefull not to aggro the queen, plus gravity flux may aggro mobs in above rooms if they are not kept clear.  If we fight in hallway, he may gate(cannot be interrupted) and begin summoning people to their deaths.  He has approx 6 guards (avg lvl maybe 54) with him.<br>

Once either of the golems are killed, a lvl 1 iksar spawans on the corpse.  I have to kill it and loot the iksar child's tear.  30+ people are require with big tanks and a suicide victim if we do Fright because of the DT.<br>

<br>
Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep<br>
<br>
The Drolvarg Warlord inside Karnor's Castle <br>
<br>
Amygdalan Tendril - Amygdalan Warriors in Plane of Fear<br>
<br>
Lady Vox/ Naggy = White Dragon Scale   and Gorenaire/Norflav Scalekeeper-Red Dragon Scale<br>
- we all know where these bitches are<br>
<br>
FINAL TURN IN- The One and only Trakanon/The Undead Bard<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not expecting to kill Vox or gore any time soon, i'll probably just end up buying those scales. so i'm not bothering with them as of yet. I figure i can pick up the whip on our next PoF raid, and the skull drops pretty frequently in karnor castle, so i'm sure i'll be able to snag one of those sometime soon......SO.... I will need help with<br>
<br>
PHINNY THE PHISH<br>
<br>
Phinigel Autropos requires a well-organized group or two to take down, and be sure and bring a good puller and mezzer with you. If the pull is not 100% successful Phinny might bring some Swirlspine Seahorses and Swirlspine Guardians with him. Our 28th level Pixie Strike mezz will not work on the adds, so you need to have the 53th level song to mezz, or bring along an enchanter. Try to pull the Swirlspine Seahorses one at a time, as they cannot be stunned, which means we cannot mezz them. Thankfully, the Swirlspine Guardians can easily be mezzed as a bard. <br>
Two groups seemed to be sufficient but a high level bard or enchanter is suggested just in case the pull brings back Phinnie and friends. Phinnie's backbone will fit into any container that can hold medium or larger items, or so I'm told. The Eye of Zomm exploit has been fixed, so I will not cover that here, as it no longer works. <br>
<br>
The final turn in is to the Undead bard, lvl 62, Who immediately turns agro and you have to keel him... THEN a Duplicate Trax Spawns, you do not Kill the Normal Trax, as soon as the undead bard drops, and you have to keel him too<br>
<br>
Like i said, Bard epic isn't even on the top 10 most important epics for the benefit of the guild, so i'm not really expecting to ever get it done, but if i pick up peeces here and there, by the time that everyone else in the guild has an epic, and its the bards turn we'll probably all be lvl 65 and they'll be easy :0-<br>

There is alot of sitting around and waiting for things that are on 24 hour spawns <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .. Long epic ... <br>
<br>
First thing I need is the Ink of Dark from a Ghoul Scribe in LGuk. Spawns near the excutioner room and apparently not to long of a camp. All I have to do is charm him. Not really raid force just need a group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . This part can be MQ'd as Im having trouble getting the vial from the temple in qeynos. Killed 4 times. Hoping an evil guildie can go do there and get it for me.<br>
<br>
2. Human Monk in Western Karana. Supposedly he is magic immune. But I went on this part with Xaz and the monk went down pretty easy with about 8 of us if that.<br>
<br>
That pretty much completes the first section. The other thing is just a turn and some I have already done. <br>
Now comes the fun parts! <br>
<br>
Verina Tomb, lvl 60 cleric inside 3rd gate of Neriak. She is on a terribly long spawn. I have heard 2 days to 7 day. So far I have yet to see her. She can be killed without aggoing guards provided nobody is KOS. (which im sure most are) Except me<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . A friend of mine told me to pull her closer to the zone line to avoid unwanted agro from the guards. This my feeling will be a hurry and kill and soon as we see her spawned. Dont really think I can plan this one.  Receive Innoruuk's Word of her. <br>
<br>
Vessel Drozlin, inside the Cabilis Shaman Guild. Will have to swim thru a large pool and go through the tunnels. He is high MR and will start to run as fight progesses. He will go thru a one way door. He also has a few guards protecting him. Not sure the amount to kill him. Apparently a couple high lvl groups should be enough. Receive Xolion Rod. <br>
<br>
Prince Selrach, Chardok. Level 61 warrior. As we know to get to him will require lots of force. Receive his head and turn into felwith Mage guild and receive Chalice of Kings. <br>
<br>
That completes 2nd turn in bag.<br>
<br>
Master Two:<br>
<br>
This section somewhat simple lots of waiting around on spawns mostly. <br>
<br>
Cazel, Oasis of Maar Lvl 50 Sand Giant with ridiculous regen and hits hard. I haven't tried him yet but have heard mixed opinions. Some say 2 groups others say 1 is fine. Im tempted to just try with one and see what happens. Loot the spoon. <br>
<br>
The rest of this section is just waiting on a key in Overthere, Scroll in Dalnirs Crypt, Book of Charm in the Plane of Sky (quest room) All these spawn once every 24 hours. Shalow looted the key in OT at 9ampst. So im hoping that means it spawns same time every day. <br>
<br>
Completes second bag for turn in.<br>
<br>
Master Three: <br>
<br>
Turning Dull Gems into Enchanted. <br>
<br>
Kaesora, Diamond: Lev and invis and drop straight down the hole. Not all the way down, second lvl I believe. Enter room with 3 spiders, go right, go thru a door. Secret wall behind this door. Go thru Invis Vs Undead. Will see a building when u turn the corner. Here we find Sprectre Librarian or a Tortured Librarian (placeholder). Charm Spectre give him diamond and I get Enchanted Diamond. He then turns into Enraged Spectre IF we kill turns into 3 more who will AE the heck out of us. Best is to turn in get enchanted diamond and port out ASAP. If not the 3 souls that spawn will nuke hard but have low hps. So must need an evacer, but one group Im sure is enough. <br>
<br>
City of Mist, Ruby: Wraith of Jaxion, spawns right up the back of Neh'Ashiirs building near the Reaver. It is a rare spawn apparently if he is not there keep kililng everything around and he will spawn. Charm him turn in ruby get Enchanted Ruby. <br>
<br>
Overthere, Emerald: Scorpion named Impaler Tzilug Loc neg 90 pos 810. He may have some others protecting him that we will need to kill. Charm, turn in emerald Enchanted Emerald. <br>
<br>
Skyfire, Sapphire: Felia Goldenwing, she is near the burning woods zoneline. Rare spawn. Once again kill everything around to get her to spawn. Once she spawns she is KOS to any other mob around, charm quickly turn in and get Enchanted Sapphire. <br>
<br>
Completes 3rd piece of staff. <br>
<br>
Is it done yet? lol <br>
Master 4..<br>
<br>
Essence of Ghost.. Completed sitting in the bank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Plane of Fear, Head of a Serpent: Spirit of Shissar is found in the Amygdalan Temple. 5-7 Day timer. Apparently the mob itself is easier its just getting to him that is difficult. Kill him loot the head of the Serpent. <br>
<br>
Plane of Hate, Essence of Vampire: This is a rare drop by Forsaken Revenants in the north east corner of the zone. Once again.. raid force <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
Field of Bone, Sands of the Mystics: The Tangrin a rare spawn gorilla at 3300. 2530. He is a warrior and will take a couple high lvl groups. <br>
<br>
Completes 4th piece of staff. <br>
<br>
WOOT Done! Turn into Jeb in Burning woods again and I get Staff of the Serpent ! Clicky Haste <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> !!!! <br>
<br>
While this epic seems really long, only a few will require raids forces others will just need group support, and alot of me waiting around on spawns. I have all the dull gems, SMR, haven't turned in yet because I hate to give up a 5k robe just to get a pen! lol. Will keep this updated <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  thanks for the help in advance<br>
