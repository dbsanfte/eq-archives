SO please respond on topic.<br>
<br>
So lemme ask folks....<br>
<br>
Do you respect 'generall accepted' camps or do you PnP it?  Or do you pull from another party's hunting area?  But mostly try to take out the nameds from that party's camp ground?  Like camping the Captain in Karnor's..if you are there at a camp..and suddenly the Captain pops...before you can engage it..some character has casted/wacked/threw something at it..and drags the Captain to their camp area to kill it, which may be at the zone line or left or right on the water.<br>
<br>
I mean I realize that no one truly 'owns' a camp, and yet Verant (in it's infinite wisdom), designed most of the old world game with camps (and alot of the new worlds too) as a means to gain an end...you don't 'adventure' through a dungeon...you fight your way to a room and you hold it while MoBs pop, and you get the most exp/loot/gain for your expenditure of time.  But at the same time they say that you can't 'camp' or own a spawn.<br>
<br>
Great.  So anyone wanna tell me why some wannabe gimp lawyer iksar monk kept trying to steal the king spawn from our camp when they were camping the window/pool room?  And then falling back on &quot;Read the rules..you don't own a camp!&quot;  Whenever asked to stop?  <br>
<br>
Geeze....a gimp_guild002 is born from this one...<br>
<br>
Actually..I do believe he was telling his own guildmate to fuck off for telling him NOT to be pulling from other people's camps.  He accidentally OOCed that to the zone.<br>
<br>
P.S. Ignore the sig..I dinged on 45...and I now have floaty boots...like and good gay bard would!<br>

<br>
1)Karnors.  This zone is a total pos, and every server handles camps here differently, Ive had arguments even in guild on this one^^.  My feeling is specifically with the captain if you want him camp in_ the tower.  Theres no reason to assume one group is pulling captain over another if neither one of them is in the tower, imo.  Karnors always seemed pretty ffa on pulls to me, being as you cant predict where anything will spawn and most groups setup to a safe spot and pull whatever they see rather than camp a room with mobs in it.  We wont even get into 4 groups pulling over the bridge, some of which are feigning death, with mobs on skeleton aggro <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Basicly its hard to get too mad about Karnors, my only pet peeve is groups who set up so as to 'cut off' large portions of mobs for themselves.  This is basicly if you set up on the bridge or in a courtyard.  With the aggro these things have these groups give you no choice but to either kill 5 dogs a round, or train them repeatedly.  Lame.<br>
<br>
2) groups that claim more than they can chew.  This includes anyone calling a camp from a zoneline, ug.  If you want a camp, at a minimum, be in the room, and kill the mobs^^.  Groups that are 'getting ready to pull' a named for like 45 minutes also fall into this category.  If it takes you that long to kill the thing another group could have pulled it and it would have spawned again already, heh.  Basicly if I have any safe means of checking I will go look at the spawns rather than camp check, people like to call stuff they arent really killing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufaddlefiddlethebard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faddle Fiddle the Bard</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/28/01 12:23:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well..</span><hr size=1> I'm actually talking about sitting IN the champ room, and continuously sitting there for 4+ hours and have a monk try to pull out the king when he's around.<br>

Old EQ its easy to judge, ie solb window area and beyond is window, champ group has kpc, but the area between window/kpc/zone is ffa.  In guk I generally respect pulling areas as its normally done.  <br>
<br>
In karnor a tower group would get 2nd floor tower, a hand group would get jail (usually, depends on prior warlord group), and 1 basement group.  HS is easy to define by wings (generally 1-2 groups per wing, 1 zone, 1 below), chardok is never camped, zone line groups just pull whatever.  OS broken down by names, ie crypt, 2 disco areas, prot, chef, jail, shrooms, juggs, gang jail etc.  People are very good about those things, the only funny things ive seen are some ppl taking a group and want to take the emperor from the crypt group, or some disco 1 and 2 group getting into it.  <br>
<br>
Velious, /shrug, low zones like cc have pretty divided areas, icewall is sorta defined, kael is sorta limited in group support, skyshrine is .... interesting.  Sirens is shit, WW has plenty of room, necro can support about 3 groups in various areas, Velk...haha only zone i havnt been in.  PoG can support 2-3 raids at once, however it can be sorta messy.<br>
<br>
Hate, fear are limited to 1 raid, 2 groups up there rushing each other would be a major mess.  Air, its possible to support 2 raids going, but because of the key situation, island respawn time, it would sorta suck if you wanted to port back to 1 and reclear up to the island you just cleared, so the 1 raid rule generally applies.  Sides...nobody really goes up.<br>
<br>
What is funny is a group sitting outside the frenzied room for an hour without the ability to clear frenz, or an efreeti group sitting at zone claiming it, similar for VS and stuff.  Typically I give them 30min-1hr depending on what it is, and if they arnt moving, then I consider it open.<br>

<br>
To put it into perspective Wycca...<br>
<br>
It would be like a group camping the Archmage, but the puller from the archmage KNOWS they can handle an extra Frenzy or 2...so sits (Literally) in the room waiting for it to pop to drag it past the party that is in the pulling room (No one I know has ever sat INSIDE frenzy to do it, unless initially breaking the area), just cause its not 'engaged' and thus its fair game...<br>

<br>
The person in question here btw is me, Saalron. I appreciate people not using names, but in the future, if it involves me, feel free, I don't try and cushion my reputation in any fashion, and frankly, my behavior won't ever be something illegal or something that I'm ashamed of.<br>
<br>
If you sit in a room, I will not pull from your room, I prefer to not have to deal with pulling over people also or through their rooms (monks don't have taunt, and sitting casters sometimes get more hate than 200-300 damage will give me, go figure).<br>
<br>
If you sit someplace for ease of pulls, count on me not dragging stuff from there away to be killed by my team.<br>
<br>
For example: If you sit in the archmagi room in guk, I'm not going to pull stuff that spawns in that room. I might walk by from time to time to see if you're still there, or bonk someone on the head for fun, but that's about it.<br>
<br>
Example: If you sit in the room at the top of the steps in karnor's castle, I'm not going to bother pulling stuff from up there, unless your team leaves stuff up for a while and there's nothing else to pull. But even then it's annoying to do because I have to get my face beat inside out to get the aggro to pull thru your room without training you, which is illegal, and that's not really worth it for an exp-churning team.<br>
<br>
Example: If you sit in the lord room in guk and /ooc that you're camping the lord and magi, I will pull frogs from the hall in front of you but not your room, the magi area, the frenzy area, whatever. Don't feel that you can 'reserve' part of a zone just because you 'call' it. You want a particular npc to be yours? Great, hang out in it's room, no problem. If you just want random npcs for exp, get out there and pull, just like me.<br>
<br>
This really hasn't ever been a concern about 'Saalron took my rare npc' or 'Saalron stole my frenzy' or something.  It always comes down to a few things.<br>
<br>
 - The old world dungeons have weak mobs compared to Kunark or Velious. I remember the old days of 80+ people in solb or 120+ in guk where a level 1 could walk around buying cheap bronze or words to sell for a profit elsewhere. Nowadays, pc's are just too powerful for the weak npcs, the exp rates you can sustain on old world wimps is really quite silly. The days of 2 yaks being a challenge on a dar knight are over. Now trak daggers, fighting batons, ice clubs, and more are the standard equipment and the npcs can't keep up. The old world dungeons run dry, and quickly.<br>
 - Camps that people maintained much time ago need to grow to keep up. In Sol-b, a group of 3-4 can easily eat every kobold from the window to the zones to sol-a, the whole front of the zone, the noble spot, most of the roamers by the king area, and a couple bats for good measure by level 40-45. A year ago there weren't items in the game to allow for that. That was then. If you find without enough npcs to go around, find another spot. If the well's dry, well that's how Verant has decided that spot in everquest will be. I'd love to be able to pull a lever and have the zone drop a kobold on my head. I'd love to have 50 teams of 6 people all be able to fit into the zone and camp for exp. But please don't decide that you are somewhere and as a result of your proximity, part of the game that my friends and I bought is now off limits. If you run out of npcs, pull more.<br>
<br>
And yes, this works both ways. If I'm over in the kobold window room, and you see an npc there, or beyond me, that I'm not in combat with, it's not my npc. Attack it. Kill it. Charm it and make it talk to you, whatever you want to do. Then again, if there were npcs there, I wouldn't be roaming around scavenging for anything alive to destroy in the first place. I won't keep stuff near me alive as a reserve for when taking mobs near you runs thin, that would be being a jerk. It would also mean the average pull time went up, which is bad for exp.<br>
<br>
I don't want the rare mob you're camping. Have at it, if you need help call, I'll probably come help. If you get wiped, call, I'll probably do your CR and maybe arrange resses for you, that's part of being a nice member of a nice guild. Yes, I will port to hate and CR you. Yes, I will run around a fg repop to snag bodies from nagafen. I like helping people, especially people who need help.<br>
<br>
I don't want your exp rate to go down. But I don't want mine to go down even more. If that means that my team eats the whole zone fast enough that walking to the fire giants and eating them too would be the best option for making exp, that's what I'd be doing. My actions are based on the desire to kill stuff for exp. Don't flatter yourself to think that you or your guild are on some shitlist that I maintain and that's why I am after you personally, I don't work like that.<br>
<br>
Npcs I aggro were not on your hate list or I'd be a KS-er. If 'your' npc in another part of some dungeon runs off chasing me because you didn't engage it, start killing stuff faster. It's not like I walk into a room, see a melee class waiting for a pop and decide 'oohhh, I'm going to wait here too, that would be good exp for me, yeah'. I'm here for exp, remember?<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, disclaimer time. The above opinion is mine. It's not Agony's opinion, I haven't really inquired if there even is a guild opinion. If you want to spam the person who leads my guild about this, cool, but send me a tell first and I'll be more than happy to help resolve this. Just don't decide that you're going to invent new rules for my favorite game and then try and enforce them on me, if that's your intention, you might as well not bother sending me a tell. And for that matter, enough people have done just that to both me, my guild leader, and the gms who administrate this game. To the point where I get a tell from a cool gm that goes like this:<br>
<br>
'hey, got another petition from people in sol-b, anything different this time'<br>
'nope'<br>
'k'<br>
<br>
Have fun. That's what I'm doing, it's why I bought the game. The game is far from perfect, so use the rules of the game to determine if you have a legitimate gripe or if that part of the game just could have been designed better.<br>

If you would like me to add a new set of subrules to my game, perhaps you're the one with the etiquette problem?<br>

And if I set up camp, whether its in one room or also in the two adjasent ones, im gonna be damn pissed if someone pulls from there especially if hes trying to take the named ones.<br>
<br>
Because 1. I would never do it to anyone else.  2. If someone is camping Lord Magi, that also means the entire hall, because anything less and people will be sitting on their ass with nothing to do xept pull greens.<br>
<br>
If someone can pull the entire tower, then he should be able to without someone stealing his spawns.  If not, then people could just come in and take everything except the 3 mobs that spawn in his room, FORCING him to leave since whos gonna stay camping 3 mobs giving VERY little exp, especially if its a 6 person group?<br>
<br>
There are &quot;unofficial&quot; rules out there that players expect other players to follow, whether its been set by Verant or not.  Because nobody feels good if he has set up a camp somewhere after going through the difficult process of breaking the spawn, only to have some prick start pulling from that area.  <br>
<br>
If player A was there first, let him have it.  If someone dies while camping something, let him come back and &quot;reclaim&quot; his spot.  Basically, if you werent there first, leave.  If not, you can expect them to pull the same stuff on you.  Why create that cycle?  It just causes animosity and hatred between players and makes the game less enjoyable, so why not just stick to those &quot;unofficial&quot; rules of etiquette and make friends instead of enemies?<br>

If there's a team in the hand room, how does that sharing work?<br>
<br>
If there's a team in the king and priest room of sol-b then who gets the pulls from the champ room? What about the wanderers there?<br>
<br>
You see, later in the game, Verant got a little smarter. A team 6 camping the necrosis bug spot won't get another camp taking the frogs nearby for exp because, frankly, it'd be very weak exp due to the spacing of the spawns. The old world dungeons don't have that, they're packed tightly.<br>
<br>
What if I only have 3 people in this 'lord-magi' camp and you have a team of 6 in the frenzy, or a level 35 guild raid of 12 people there, how do things change then? Who will decide all of these nonVerant rules and then keep us all posted on the whole of them? I'll tell you who, no one, it's too much of a hassle. Most of us don't have the time to play as often as we'd like in the first place, much less try and get the permission of 30 co-campers on each pull.<br>
<br>
Do you think Karnor's teams really cares which team takes which drolvarg or skeleton? Not really, there's always more npcs, just take another couple steps forward in the castle. There's no &quot;we own the future npcs that spawn in the surrounding area&quot; there. Likewise in Sebilis, people just don't camp close enough to one another to be both pulling from a communal set of frogs.<br>
<br>
The way Verant has decided to police this is fairly easy. If you're fighting it, it's all yours. If you want to fight more stuff, go pull more stuff. I'm saying we should even be more considerate and decide to not pull from rooms someone is camping inside (that's not a Verant rule, that's courtesy).<br>
<br>
You got to the room of uber_item_dropper_01 first? Great, all yours, enjoy, let me know when you're done with that room's special npc, I won't try and take it from you. You want to exclude everyone else in the game from every rarespawn in that half of the dungeon when you're obviously not killing things fast enough to keep up with the spawn? Uhm, no, that's selfish, and I didn't buy a game to be told 'no, Saalron, we're going to get around to whacking that npc, it doesn't exist for you for the time being'.<br>
<br>
Get real, follow Verant's rules (that's what the GMs enforce), and if you have a problem with me playing by the rules of the game, then fine. Have a problem with me and dislike me, put me on ignore, don't team me, etc.<br>
<br>
It works two ways, hoarding an area of a zone because you 'called it' is just as discourteous IMHO as grabbing an npc from a room someone is camped in.<br>
<br>
-Saalron<br>
<br>
And to one of the above posters about me not being able to do stuff and 'what goes around comes around'...I do a lot to help random people every time I'm in the game. I farm uncamped items for my guild, I donate to newbies thousands of plat worth of lesser items, do corpse recoveries, kill quest droppers for strangers, show other iksar monks how to do those unbearable campfest-shackle quests, explain stats and aggro and feign to newbies, the works. My guild loves my skill as a puller and my fun loving in a team. I don't need a random_complainer_02's express permission to enjoy the game, and frankly, you're little 'black ball' flag here is a waste of time for everyone. I suggest each one of you who reads this goes and finds a guild that is as supportive, coordinated, and successful as Agony and have some damned fun before your faces get stuck in that tissy-fit frown for the rest of your life.<br>
<br>
Anyone else care to dump random rules on me or jump up and down crying over their own agenda being spoiled because more than 1 person plays the game or can we get back to flaming idiots. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usllackblader.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sllack Blader</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://24.221.41.117:8080/images/adder65.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/7/01 10:54:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://24.221.41.117:8080/images/vaz/adder65.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rhetoric</span><hr size=1> All I got to say is, if everyone else in the world says you are wrong, but you say you are right, mayby you are wrong; not always, but most of the time.<br>
