When something like this happens they have REAL feelings and might be disappointed.<br><br>Ever get pushed around by a bully in school?  This pretty much feels the same way.  I am a younger bard in a smaller guild.  It is no surprise to me that it will be a challenge to get my epic pieces.  <br><br>I harbor no ill will toward anyone in this situation.  After all this is a game and after last night I realized that getting upset over these situations usually does no good.  You can explain your point of view to someone and most likely it will not change their mind once it is set.   I'm really sorry it had to come to this.  I'm in this game to have fun and promised myself when I stopped having fun, I'd quit.  I'm still having fun whether or not we end up raiding tomorrow.  <br><br>I still don't have any ill feelings toward SoF (hexum) and whoever was the mastermind behind last night (or tonight's) attempt at Vox.  It is human nature to be opportunistic and I hope no one is shocked at the fact that our two raid leaders got upset when people knowingly disrupted something that had be definately planned for more than a month.<br><br>Thanks for reading this long post if you got to the end<br>Kelly Jackson (the real human being behind) <p><BR>Lilai Sirensong <BR>Divalicious Bard of the 53rd Season<BR>Proud Leader of Guardian Alliance<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33203">Maeglo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umckennastormangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mckenna Stormangel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(1/25/02 10:51:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=352.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yo, Hexum/SoF/whoever... /gofuk</span><hr size=1> If you think SoF purposely went out last night to ruin your plans, you are sadly mistaken. Sure some of us look at crossroads, but to be honest, I only look at it for trades/sales. I rarely bother to look at any other threads because honestly I just don't have the time. Especially for forums such as this that the sole purpose is to flame people. We don't tolerate flaming on our boards, so why should I bother to look at other flame threads. The only reason I am reading this now is that I was directed here to see what terrible things were being said about my guild.<br><br>Anyone who could make Hannem feel badly has got to have their head examined. Her and Hexum are two of the absolute nicest people on the server and if you think flaming them here is going to ruin their reputation, you are wrong.<br><br>They honestly had no idea of your plans to raid Vox and by the time they received tells from you about it, it was too late. They had rallied so many non-guildies there to help and were buffing up, preparing to go in. That's like us asking another guild who has already entered Hate, to port back down because we had it planned for an hour later. Sure it's a bummer, but we deal with it and move on. This is just a game and getting all worked up over something that wasn't intentional isn't helping anything. Sure the attempt failed, but for you to be elated about it is just sad.<br><br>Good luck with your raid on Vox.<br><br>In the future, please contact me or another High Council member regarding any problems you may have with our guild.<br> <p><table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" width="547" border="0"><tr><td rowSpan="4" width="104"><a href="http://spiritsoffyre.cjb.net"><img src="http://www.smogfarm.com/sof/sofburn.gif" border="0"></a></td><td width="439"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=82879"><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="teal"><b><i>Mckenna Stormangel</i></b></font></a></td></tr><tr><td width="439"><a href="http://spiritsoffyre.cjb.net"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="red">Spirit of Fire</font></a></td></tr><tr><td width="439"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="teal">57th Howler's Brigade</font></td></tr><tr><td width="439" bgcolor="#000000"><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="orange"><FONT color="#ff3333">M</FONT><FONT color="#ff9900">i</FONT><FONT color="#ffff33">s</FONT><FONT color="#33ff00">t</FONT><FONT color="#0099ff">r</FONT>e<FONT color="#ff99ff">s</FONT><FONT color="#cc00cc">s</FONT><FONT color="#ff0000"> </FONT> <FONT color="#ffff00">o</FONT>f <FONT color="#33ff00">I</FONT><FONT color="#6699cc">n</FONT><FONT color="#ff99cc">i</FONT><FONT color="#990099">t</FONT><FONT color="#ff0000">i</FONT>a<FONT color="#ffff00">t</FONT><FONT color="#33ff00">e</FONT><FONTcolor="ff3333">s</FONT></td><td width="439"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="red">High Council Member</font></td></tr></table><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD></A>I am <B>Centipede</B>.<BR /><BR />I wander back and forth minding my own business, changing directions only when things get in my way, but I always seem to be persecuted.
