<br>
The Scabbard<br>
<br>
Step 1: East Freeport<br>
<br>
If you look behind the row of shops where the leather shop etc. are in east freeport just after you zone from west freeport, there is a path that leads to a raised area looking down over some tents. take the path to the left along the wall and you will find Wenden Blackhammer and Kargek Redblade. If you hail Redblade you will see some text explaining he has a big red scabbard on his back. Ask him about the scabbard. He will have a brief back and forth with you and ask you to take a note to a friend of his, an ogre in Feerot named Oknoggin Stonesmasher.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Feerot<br>
<br>
Oknoggin Stonesmasher hangs out around the stone bridge in Feerot. He is NOT KOS, so you need not fear approaching him to give him the note, whatever race you are. Be careful though, as bouncers wander this area on their patrols. He will give you a small lute and ask you to return it to Kargek.<br>
<br>
Step 3: East Freeport<br>
<br>
Return to Kargek and hand in the lute. He will give you a book, with some interesting story details about the blades in it, and tell you to take it to his brother Tenal, in East Karana.<br>
<br>
Step 4: East Karana<br>
<br>
Tenal Redblade resides near the top of the ramp to Highpass. Handing him the book will prompt him to give you a totem, and ask you to return a heart of frost to him from the land where the rathe bestowed his curse on the giants. This clue leads you to the Frost Giants of Permafrost, and more specifically for this step, the ice goblin wizards who drop the heart needed for this portion of the quest.<br>
<br>
Step 5: Permafrost Keep<br>
<br>
The jail in Permafrost Keep was where people I know had the most success camping the heart. Took me a couple of hours. It drops off ice giant wizards as a rare, they spawn throughout the fort. Once you have it, you can short circuit a later step by also camping the frost giants on the way to Vox's lair for the Block of Permafrost needed for the 1st blade. This is also a rare item and took me a week of returning and killing Ice Giants, who are now all 6 hour spawns.<br>
<br>
Step 6: East Karana/Emerald Jungle/Skyfire/SolusekB<br>
<br>
Returning BOTH the totem he gave you and the heart to Tenal will result in him asking for the scales of a Red and Green dragon to be returned to him. This is the point where most warriors on Brell are stuck at the moment. Green Scales are obtained from Severilious in Emerald Jungle, a random spawn dragon of level 60+. He requires a raid team of about 40 to kill, has nasty fear and ae stun poison effect. He is however, the easiest of the Kunark Dragons to kill. he generally drops from 1-3 scales, but has been known to drop none at all. Red Scales may currently be obtained from three sources: Nagafen if you are 52nd level or less, Zordakius Ragefire, the red dragon who spawns from the cleric quest (Easy to kill with the 55+ people who are likely to be accompanying the cleric doing the quest, but hard to spawn. He drops scales as a random rare drop), and Talendor, the mighty red dragon of Skyfire. The only killing of Talendor on Brell thus far produced one red scale, so we can presume his drop rate is similar to Severilious. Once both are obtained, return to Tenal.<br>
<br>
Step 7: East Karana/Plane of Hate<br>
<br>
Returning both scales to Tenal with the Totem of flaming war results in yet another subquest. This time he apparently has nothing better to do then send you traipsing off to hate to obtain the Hand of the Maestro. This is an Uncommon drop off the Maestro of Rancor in Hate. He's easily killable with 18 if you are 55+, and drops the hand every 4th or 5th attempt. He spawns once a day. Return this and the totem Tenal gave you to him.<br>
<br>
Step 8: East Karana/Plane of Sky<br>
<br>
Yet...another...subquest... sigh. This time he gives you the Mark of the Sword, and tells you to return it, and the Spiroc Wingblade to his brother Kargek in East Freeport to obtain your scabbard. The Spiroc wingblade is an uncommon drop off the Spiroc Lord on the 5th isle of Sky. He is currently broken and does not drop the blade. Verant shows no sign of fixing this, so it is likely most warriors will be unable to attain their epic weapon for some time to come. Pester them about it, I have. For those lucky warriors who got theirs during the one week he actually worked, turning in this blade with the Mark to Kargek gets you a red scabbard, the final reward of this portion of the quest.<br>
<br>
Reward: Scabbard<br>
The scabbard is simply a 4 slot combinable container, used both to combine the other parts of the quest and produce the Blade of Strategy and Blade of Tactics, but also to combine them into the 2h Jagged Blade of War and break them back into the 2 component blades again. You'll have to free up an inventory slot for this bad boy, small price to pay imho. <br>
<br>
The First Blade<br>
<br>
Step 1: Ocean of Tears<br>
<br>
A dwarf in Ocean of Tears named Renken Strongpick will talk to you if hailed and show you a runed blade, the first of 4 pieces needed to put in the scabbard. He says he will trade it to you for 4 items: 2 rebreathers, a block of Permafrost, and a keg of Vox Tail Ale. Rebreathers are tinkerable by any gnome of sufficient skill. There are 3 I know of for sure, Bten, Fidgety and Wyzskarlet. Rebreathers will generally cost you about 3-4k per device unless they've lowered their prices recently. Vox tail ale may be purchased from several vendors across Norrath, including the EFP Port Authority. It was formerly a very difficult subquest involving obtaining the scale of Faydedar (acck) and camping more greens for rare parts (double acck). Verant decided in its mercy that given the rest of our quest, this was too much, and put them on vendors.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Permafrost Keep<br>
<br>
Yes, if you didn't camp the Ice Giants the last time you were here, or didn't get the block, you are back!<br>
Giants spawn every 6 hours by vox's lair, keeeeeel them till they drop the rare Block of Permafrost. <br>
<br>
Step 3: Ocean of Tears<br>
<br>
Returning to Denken with the rebreathers, the block of permafrost, and the keg of Vox Tail Ale results in the first blade. Stow it in your bank for a while  <br>
<br>
Reward: First Blade<br>
<br>
Does nothing but take up a space in your bank... why we get none of these nifty intermediate rewards I dunno. Looks like katana in inventory, so make sure you dont accidentally destroy it. <br>
<br>
Second Blade<br>
<br>
Step 1: Chardok<br>
<br>
The one and only step here is to kill the Queen of Chardok till she coughs up her rare drop, the Ancient Blade. She's a tough mob, on a par with Venril Sathir to kill. takes 24-30. You can also camp the king next door for his nifty Incarnadine Breastplate while you are here. Royals are on a 2 hour spawn cycle. <br>
<br>
Reward: Second Blade<br>
<br>
As tasty and Bank slot filling as the first.<br>
<br>
First Hilt<br>
<br>
Step 1: Lake Rathetear<br>
<br>
Under the tall Spiroc tower straight out from the SK zone is a lagoon. Swimming under that tower in the water will reveal a small brown bag. Ganking it will give you the Unjewelled Dragon Head Hilt. <br>
<br>
Step 2: Hate/Fear/Sebilis/Other Zones<br>
<br>
You need to obtain one each of the following: Black Sapphire, Jacinth, Diamond. These may be obtained as drops from many mobs in Hate, Fear, Sebilis, and other high level zones and mobs. They typically go from 1-3k each in trade. <br>
<br>
Step 3: East Freeport<br>
<br>
Take the 3 gems and the Unjewelled Hilt to Wenden Blackhammer, the Dorf standing next to Kargek in East Freeport. Handing him all four results in the Jewelled Dragon Head Hilt. <br>
<br>
Reward: Jewelled Dragon Head Hilt<br>
<br>
Yummm, another bankfiller.<br>
<br>
Second Hilt<br>
<br>
Step 1: Timorous Deep<br>
<br>
The second hilt may be found lying against the King on the Chessboard in Timorous Deep. Looks again like a small bag. Ganking it will produce a Severly Damaged Dragon Head Hilt.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Plane of Fear<br>
<br>
The first item you need to obtain is a Ball of Everliving Golem. These are random drops off the three Golems of Cazic Thule: Fright, Dread and Terror. Most of the zone needs to be clear before you attempt them. Each golem can drop it, so between 0-3 can drop on a given raid. <br>
<br>
Step 3: Dreadlands<br>
<br>
Next, you get to camp Mountain Giant Patriarchs. The best place to spawn lots of them is at the big Giant fort in the mountains. A single warrior of 55 can pull and kill most of the giants here. A well equipped 58+ warrior can solo the patriarchs. Most of us will need the help of at least a second warrior for the patriarchs however. Rare drop is a lightstone looking item called a Monocle. This is the item you need.<br>
<br>
Step 4: Frontier Mountains<br>
<br>
Take this monocle to a giant deep in the mines within the giant fort there. His name is Mentraxx Mountainbane. There is another named giant with him, do not mistake him for the one you need. Hail both, the one that roars is NOT the one you want. Neither is KOS. Giving him the monocle produces a block of Rejesium Ore.<br>
<br>
Step 5: East Freeport<br>
<br>
Give the Rejesium Ore and the Ball along with the Severly Damaged Hilt to Wenden Blackhammer. He produces the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt.<br>
<br>
Reward: Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt<br>
<br>
More bank filler.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Blades<br>
<br>
Step 1: Combine the 2 blades and the 2 hilts in the scabbard. This produces your first rewards, the Blade of Tactics and the Blade of Strategy. if you want the stats check on eq'lizer, I don't remember them.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Combining these two blades produces the Jagged Blade of War, a nasty 2h sword.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Combining this blade alone in the scabbard splits it again into the original two blades. <br>
<br>
Congratulations, if you get to this stage you are the proud owner of the Warrior Epic Weapons!<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps some people out.  Unfortunately, I don't have mine yet, but if anyone is willing to assist, I'll be more than happy to take the help.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table><tr><td><p align="center">

<br>
Step 1. Combine both blades and both hilts.  This will make the scabard poof and produce the Blade of Tactics, Blade of Strategy and your new improved scabard_2.0.<br>
<br>
Step 2.  Your new scabard is bugged, camp out to unbug it.<br>
<br>
Step 3.  Combine the Blade of Tactics + Blade of Strategy in your new scabard to produce the Jagged Blade of War.<br>
<br>
Step 4.  Find a Magician to summon you a runed sword<br>
<br>
Step 5.  Place the runed sword inside the scabard and hit combine, this will produce the Blade of Tactics and Blade of Strategy<br>
<br>
Step 6.  Bank your scabard and keep a real bag on you because you now have both version of the epics. <p><table width="300" border="0">
