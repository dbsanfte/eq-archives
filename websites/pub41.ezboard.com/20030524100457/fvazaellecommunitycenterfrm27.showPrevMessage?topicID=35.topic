The woods in her lands were beautiful, but such a forest as this one she had only dreamed or heard legends of. Never did she imagine she would see the trees of Faydwer with her own eyes. The forest was filled with songs and chatter, for these were the lands of the Elves. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What creatures would dwell in such a forest&quot; she wondered. She found it hard to imagine that any harm could come from woods as magnificent as these....but yet she felt uneasy. Unlike the Misty Thicket that surrounded Rivervale, this forest had eyes and ears. Still, it was far more safe than the Dark Woods on the other side of the town, for in Kithicor the undead slept during the day, and the sunlight never seemed to shine and very difficult for a little hobbit to find her way by nightfall. <br>
Melluny continued down the path. The music got louder and the forest seemed to be getting brighter. She took a few more paces and stopped, wide-eyed and breathless. It was nothing less than she had imagined, and the legends she had heard did no justice to its magnificence. There in front of her stood Felwithe, and outside it two High Elf paladins wearing fine elven plate guarded the gates. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hail, young one. What is your name, and what brings a halfling such as yourself to Faydwer?&quot; said one of the guards. &quot;I am Melluny, a young cleric of Bristlebane. I left Rivervale to see new lands, we young hobbits are quite curious and adventurous. I do not care to live safely within the thicket forever, and I have ever so often dreamt about Elves and so wished to see them with my own eyes.&quot; she replied with a smile. The two guards chuckled. &quot;Very well young hobbit, our city has plenty of inns, we hope you shall find them most accomidating. I am Guard Highmoon, and this is Guard Crystalwind. If you need assistance while outside of the city walls we will gladly aide you.&quot; Melluny curtsied and thanked them, then continued inside the city.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jscherrer/aiene.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

No tale she had ever heard had accuratly described this place. It was far too magnificent, far too magical for any words to capture. The stone walls were covered in leaves and vines, and the water was crystal clear. The halls were marble with gold trim.<br>
Thuthud... thuthud... thuthud. An elf on a brilliant white steed rode past her and down the hall. Melluny followed after him, but his horse was far too fast for her to keep up with. She stopped to catch her breath. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well hello there! You look mighty tired, as if you have been travelling. Are you by any chance the one here to deliver my note?&quot;  Melluny turned around and saw a tanned elf standing in front of her. 'Wow a wood elf!'  she thought to herself.  &quot;I am here because I am travelling yes, but to deliver a note, no.&quot; she replied. &quot;Hrm, I really need this note delivered to Kelethin, and I have too much going on here to do it myself so I asked Jacub to send someone, but no one has showed up.&quot; he sighed. &quot;Oh to Kelethin you say? I will deliver it to Kelethin, I would ever so much love to see it.&quot;  &quot;Most excellent!&quot;  the elf clapped in delight, &quot;Take this note to Jacub in the Bard's guild there, tell him Tacar sent you. I assure you, you will be properly rewarded for your time. Thank you ever so much!&quot; Melluny bowed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Night came and Melluny had found a comfortable inn for the night. Felwithe was as beautiful as ever under the moonlight. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jscherrer/aiene.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

The sun shone thru the trees today, and the forest was as bright as ever. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is a strange forest indeed.&quot;  she thought to herself, for she had been walking twenty minutes and had not seen a creature other than bats and bees. She had always envisioned that the Faydwer forests would be filled with magical creatures, she figured that if she payed more attention, or was quieter, she would see them. She took each step carefully and silently. Wide-eyed and barely breathing she continued down the path and deeper into the forest. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ten more minutes passed, and Melluny started feeling...odd. The sounds of elven music and chatter had stopped, and she felt as if she was being followed. Melluny spun around, scanning the trees. <br>
&quot;Who is there? Show yourself!&quot; she commanded, shaking a little bit. <br>
Silence.  <br>
She turned back around and walked a few more steps, then snuck behind a tree and out of sight. Scared to breathe, she stayed hidden for what seemed like five minutes, but in reality was only about forty five seconds. The trees swayed as a breeze blew thru the forest, and the world seemed to set a little bit. Melluny all of a sudden realised that she was quite hungry, for she had not eaten a thing for at least three hours. Off in the bushes she heard a strange twinkling. She perked up and peered around curiously. From out of a shrub near by came a faerie singing. Her voice carried thru the air strong and clear. She sang in a tongue that Melluny could not understand. Melluny sat there in awe watching as the faerie crossed the path. She was so dainty, and so magical, she was the most wonderful thing Melluny had ever seen. Her wings were pale pink and trimmed with silver, and she wore a tiny little dress made with the finest silk thread. Her voice was incredibly strong and high pitched, Melluny was mesmorized by it. Her song seemed happy, perhaps a tale of some sort, but about what Melluny could never guess. <br>
Melluny took a deep breath and quietly started down the path again, cautiously. Something wasnt quite right. She looked around and noticed that the forest had gotten darker. The trees in this part of the wood seemed to ache, as if in deep dispair. The path reached a dead end.  Melluny found herself standing in the middle of Faydark, lost and alone. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jscherrer/aiene.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

She decided that heading back down the path towards Felwithe would be the wisest thing to do, for the path ended here and she shivered at the thought of wandering off it. She still had no idea what lurked in the Greater Faydark. Melluny heard a shuffling and looked around but saw nothing. Hastily she walked on and soon came upon a fork in the road.<br>
&quot;Which way did i come from...&quot; she tried to remember, and decided to go to the right. As she walked the trees became less thick and there was a heavy fog. <br>
Snap.   Melluny spun around.<br>
&quot;Orc stomp orc kill your blood will spill!&quot;  shouted a vile creature waving its club at her. Melluny shrieked and started to run as fast as her short legs could carry her, which was surprisingly fast as halflings are nimble folk. She stopped as she heard it howl in pain and turned around. The creature was laying on the ground dead, purple blood spilling from its body, and a high elf in gold plate armor stood wiping the blood from his blade. Melluny blinked.<br>
&quot;Hail M'lady&quot; the elf said. &quot;You look like you could use some help. I have been in this area for awhile hunting wasps and I have been keeping a secret eye on you in case you needed assistance.&quot; <br>
&quot;I was right, i was being followed!&quot; she exclaimed &quot;thank you sir, i do not know what i would have done had you not killed that dispicible creature. Might I ask your name?&quot;<br>
&quot;I am Decepi, a humble paladin of Tunare&quot; he smiled.<br>
&quot;My name is Melluny, I have come from Rivervale and I am in search of Kelethin. What was that creature, and are there more around? I never imagined I would see such a filthy vile creature in woods like these.&quot;<br>
&quot;These woods are indeed beautiful, but there is a part of it that is dying, and it is no place for a young cleric such as yourself. A few years back an army of Orcs  invaded Kelethin, together the Elves defended their lands and managed to drive them to an area we now call Crushbone. The trees around Crushbone are in pain, the orcs are not good to their lands. They have riots and fires, and they are cruel to any living animal. Horrible vile creatures they are. Bred purely to destroy, and there is much to destroy in Faydark.&quot; he said with a look of disgust. Melluny looked around. <br>
&quot;I stumbled into an area that seemed to ache at the end of a path. Was  I anywhere near Crushbone?&quot; <br>
&quot;Yes M'lady, had you taken a few more steps and I would have stopped you.&quot; Decepi replied.<br>
&quot;Oh...&quot; <br>
&quot;Come now M'lady, I will escort you safely to Kelethin.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jscherrer/aiene.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
