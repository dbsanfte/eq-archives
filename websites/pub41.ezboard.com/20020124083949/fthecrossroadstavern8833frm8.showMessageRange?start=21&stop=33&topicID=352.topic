<br>
What exactly is a &quot;corporate pocket&quot;?  Who owns corporations?  That piece if liberal rhetoric is going out of style very fast as more and more people (even the &quot;hard working&quot; ones) realize that THEY own the corporations.  If you own a mutual fund, if you invest in a 401K, 403B, individual IRA.....the list goes on, YOU own corporations.  Liberals think that people of affluence are not &quot;hard working&quot;.  In fact, most liberals I have ever been friends with were very well off and had everything given to them.  Most of the wealthy Republicans I know (I am not wealthy by any definition) have worked their ass off for everything they have.  Oh the irony. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The People have the ABILITY, and THAT IS ALL, of tearing down the Fortune 100.  It would be INSANE to do it, but We can.<br>

Big Corporations = The United States?<br>
<br>
We're getting there.  People defending Big Corporations (like they give a crap about your little opinion!  Big Business isn't a democracy, for god's sakes) is what got Bush into the White House.  <br>
<br>
Don't you find it at least a LITTLE upsetting that it's WELL kwown that He with the Most Money Wins?  It ain't The People giving them the money.  Corporate Owned politicians (of which Bush is the most obvious example but there are many many others) play a little lip service to The little People to get the votes.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, everywhere I hear (the right-wingers, anyway) say &quot;Liberal = communists and socialists.&quot;  Hardly.  I'm all for Capitalism.  I'm all for our REPUBLIC.<br>
<br>
I'm all for the politicians being accountable to The People.<br>
<br>
Those who say liberals want to give money to lazy people INEVITABLY use ghettos as an example.  I'm not sure why they never use White Trash as that example, but they don't.  That frightens me.  They seem to think that because some small percentage of People abuse that social system we should just dump it.  Just give money to those who have paid taxes, and screw the poor People.<br>
<br>
That's fine...just make sure you approve the many Bills for new prisons that will follow that.  Oh, and try to come to terms with the possibility it'll be in your neighborhood.<br>
<br>
And make sure you approve of the Bill for sterilization of poor People and anyone else that is a drain on your precious paycheck.<br>

 Anyone that gets rabid over politics in a Nation where apathy is the way of life, frankly they amaze me. <br>
 Worrying about whose paying what taxes, whose cutting what trees, where are we going to expand next...seems kinda pointless for the individual citizen at this point. Long ago our nation violated its Ethical Code, in a war waged on itself. You don't honestly think things are going to suddenly get better without getting much worse do you? Shame on you.<br>
 Nothing in this nation will return to it's former glory without changes that may very well shake it apart. Nor without the People getting it together and MAKING it better. Things don't just get better, people make them better. <br>
 Until this country bites down on the bit and starts pulling it's load, we're not going anywhere. I'm a firm believer in &quot;Fix Us First.&quot; So what if another country is going to hell in a hand basket. Lets get our crap together before we go playin in someone elses sand box. If the Leaders of the US and the hankie toting whiners that want to &quot;Feed the world&quot; want to do that SO bad, Someone give them some land and let them farm/work for the world. Americans need to work on fixing our own country. We've been so busy helping out everyone else that we've totally ignored our own needs. There is absolutely no reason for homelessness in our country. Roosevelt had some very good ideas back in his day, ressurect them. <br>
 The rest of the world can wait, we have children in 6th grade that have trouble with SEE SPOT RUN. I'm sure you've all seen them in the game...<br>

<br>
I hope to God you mean Theodore...cause Franklin is half the reason we are in the mess we are in now, and Lyndon Johnson is the other.<br>
<br>
The root of many of the problems in this country is that people stopped depending on themselves, upon their own hard work and the sweat of their own brow, and started depending on government.  We are ultimately responsible for who and what we are.  The choices we make, good and bad, belong to us, as do the consequences for them. Because today's American generally fails to own up to that notion, we have a spiral of dependency and rot that will drag us all down if not halted.<br>
<br>
The two deadly sins are thus:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a victim of xxx, it's not my fault!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am have a right to xxx!  I am entitled to xxx!&quot;<br>
<br>
How many trials do we see on the evening news where the perpetrator is portrayed as a victim?  Even though they did something terrible to another, often innocent person.  They did it because they were poor, because they were uneducated, because they were addicted to drugs, because Daddy beat and molested them...its not THEIR fault they are the way they are, is it?<br>
<br>
History is filled with examples of people who have overcome STAGGERING adversity to achieve incredible things.  What sets the George Washington Carver's and the Abraham Lincoln's of the world apart from todays average Joe is the simple desire to overcome adversity, to rise above it, rather than use it as an excuse to wallow in the mire.<br>
<br>
There is no provision in the constitution which promises anything to anybody, beyond a list of protections FROM certain actions of government.  The oft quoted &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. &quot; is from the Declaration of Independence, NOT the constitution. <br>
<br>
The PURSUIT of happiness is a great deal different from the attainment of happiness.  The Constitution is there to ensure that the government will not stand in the way of the pursuit of (lawful) happiness, but it is not there to make sure that everyone crosses the finish line.  That, my friends, is up to you.  If you have the grit to make something of yourself, the courage to overcome what other people throw in your path, and the conviction to avoid those choices that will derail you, happiness can be yours indeed.  It is up to you to EARN it, not up to me, the taxpayer, to buy it for you if you can't get it on your own.<br>
<br>
In a sense, EQ is a microcosm of this very principle.  You would never stand there and say that the beggars in Rivervale ought to get a subsidy.  You would say they should go out, kill monsters, take their lumps, and learn the path to success.  How is it any different in real life?  How can people ever hope to learn the path to success when they can follow the path of least resistance? <br>
<br>
What is there to gain for America by fostering a dependency on government?  Clearly it does not help the individuals getting the handouts, as they will never rise above mere subsistence.  Just as clearly there is nothing to gain for those footing the bill for the handouts. <br>
<br>
Think about it...<br>

 Yep I meant Teddy, Franky was a nut job as far as I'm concerned. I think one of the last good ones we had was Ike, and thats mostly for the Interstate's...I like speeding.<br>
 I have to agree with you, the death of the American Spirit, is the total lack of self reliance that the majority display. We, as a people, haven't got much spine left in our country. There is no great American Pride in doing it yourself, beyond kitchen plumbing. And lets face it, even that most of us wouldn't touch.<br>
