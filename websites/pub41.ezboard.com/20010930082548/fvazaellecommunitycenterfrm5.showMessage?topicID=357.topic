Between the pair of us we manage a SK/Wizzie duo. for the wizzie we get /tells out of teh arse asking for ports or Xlocates.. btw for those who dont know the Xlocates regents cost money..1.5 to 3 plat depending on cha and faction and are only avlable in ToSR. anyway Rezes dont need a regent but chew up a ton of mana.. in return I would say repayment of some kind is in order. I always offer some payment and (btw Vazaelle server rocks for its generosity) been taken up on that only a few times. BUT I ALWAYS OFFER. <br>
<br>
IHMO if ya can... do it. cleric/chanter/wizzie/druid or any class. its a servise to your fellow kind. If ya want repayment you are entitled to it. its yours to ask but make that known in the beginging. Anyway back to the point.<br>
<br>
I always play with HONOR. If some peep helped me and needs help I will do anything I can to aid him. If some guy got a rez thanks to you and asked for payment when ya needed him to do rezes then it is his to ask but speeks badly for his honor. If ya are pissed there is always the ignore command. /shrug<br>

Anyway best of luck to ya. May the path keep you until the Journeys end.<br>

<br>
 Ask once if I say no, then please /tell ok sorry to bother and move on.  If you want to try and change my mind do it in one sentence.  Treat it like a petition give me all the info right up front if you don't I'm likely to say no right up front. &quot; /tell Traz I'm at this location, I have druid for port, ill pay you this much, please help&quot;. I ususally get &quot;Can you help me Sir Cleric?&quot;<br>
  I'm going to say NO to that, because I know the next sentence is &quot;I'm in the lord room in lower guk I'm all alone because my group left and I got 3 corpses here but I don't no where they all are.<br>
<br>
   You got to think of it like this, I've been 49 + for about 5-6 months ?  I was also first Cleric on Vazaelle with the Cleric Epic (thanks IV). I was well known as a Cleric early on on Vazaelle and Ive goten 1000's of request for rez. You do not know most of the time what your getting yourself into when you say you'll help. Some rez requests are a 10 sec click of my stick, Some rez requests have turned into a 2 hour CR because there group left them. You get burned a few times on rez request it toughens you to say NO the next time. <br>
<br>
 As for money I think of it like this. I don't require money but your more likely to bribe me if I don't know you. I never ask for money its either offered or not. If you didnt give me any money at the end and I don't know you better kiss my ass with some cleric lovin (/t traz you clerics rock I love you guys!)  or you won't most likely get another. This is debatable if you can in the future provide me with a service.. Druids are (for the most part) are never turned down for rezzes or expected to provide cash or cleric lovin, But of course they will be asked in the future for a port. (theyll be asked politely if I'm turned down I thank them and move on.)<br>
<br>
 This server unfortunatly treats Clerics as vending machines and think just because we can we have to help. We are real people trying to accomplish things in this game just like you. If I'm sitting in EC tunnels at 60 there is a reason I'm there and it not because I'm bored so I'll sit there waiting for a rez request. <br>
   Don't get me wrong I love helping the young newbies that get into trouble and fall down the well in befallen because they didnt know better. But lets face it if your smart enough to do a /who all 60 cleric, your probably passed the newbie stage. <br>
<br>

Now, the way to *get* a res.<br>

You want to piss off a cleric that doesn't go /role or /anon (like myself) ?  Be a druid or a wizard that's anon, and ask me for a res.  I *will* ask you if you are anon to keep people from bugging you for help, and if you say yes, I will not be a happy cleric.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Conversely, if I gave you a free res and you're a wizzie or a Druid, don't even *think* about trying to charge me for a port within 3 minutes of you getting your res.

<br>
Personally, I generally don't charge for resurrections.  I accepted a donation once, as I really needed the plat and the corpse was in a place that could cause a lot of problems.  Normally, I'll help if I can, but I usually can't as I'm in a very busy guild.<br>
<br>

Simple as that.  Though it may be lame that you helped someone out and then they want cash for a res, that's the way these things work sometimes.<br>
<br>
When I need a res my search usually goes something like this:<br>
<br>
First I do a who search for all my friends who are res-capable clerics.  If any of them are nearby, I'll ask them, if not, I'll then do a search for druids and wizards I know so that I can arrange for a port if possible for my cleric friend.  After I've contacted my porting friend I'll tell my distant cleric friend what my situation is, and if they can't come they can't come.<br>
<br>
If they can't, I'll start doing a cleric search for zones near my corpse, and I'll start asking, usually it goes something like this:<br>
<br>
/tell cleric_01: Heya, sorry to bother you, but I got myself moronically killed at gimp_location and was wondering if you were free for a res.  I [can/can't] arrange for a port.<br>
<br>
cleric_01 tells you, "Sorry, I'm busy."<br>
<br>
/r "Okay, sorry to bother you, thanks."<br>
<br>
/tell cleric_02 "Heya....."<br>
<br>
Eventually I usually get a cleric to help me.  I always offer cash or gems after a cleric I don't know resses me, the amoung depending on how much trouble they went to and what I had on my corpse when I died.  I also put them on the "will go out of my way to summon corpse for" list.<br>
<br>
Now, being a 51+ SK I get corpse summon requests out of the blue, too, which are totally vicious as they eat a huge chunk of mana (700) for a SK, have a difficult to acquire, expensive component that's a pain to haul around, and usually require a trek to a dangerous dungeon (though thankfully not too far into one).  When I have a coffin on me (which I try to do whenever possible) and am not otherwise occupied, I usually try to help, but there's a much higher chance of me coming to help if sumone tells me they have ports lined up, will reimburse me for the cost of the coffin, or best of all, have a coffin for me to use for them.<br>
<br>
The point of that whole sidetrack being, in my experience, most people (clerics and wizards, though druids are not so reliable given the high d00d population in the class) are kind and like to help when it doesn't require a huge investment of time/money on their part, but it's not often that they aren't in a group, going to a group, or camping a rare spawn or good solo spawn which they might lose if they left.  Thus, any request must be treated with the expectation of failure, not due to rudeness or lack of caring, but because of other engagements.  And though, in m book, asking for money up-front is lame, it is understandable and acceptable. <p><p><center><img src="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/april.jpg"><br><i>Sslanis Soulforge<br>It's not whose habitat it is, it's how hard you hit it</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uscy46.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scy46</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/18/01 12:04:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I dont get mad easy but...</span><hr size=1> *is guilty of doing / all 49 60 cler* I won't ask unless your relatively close by ... and I don't mind dropping some plat for a rez *usually 50-100pp, depending if they only come at the mention of money*<br>

<br>
I agree strongly with Traz and Anika, its got to be the toughest thing in the world for a cleric to deny a rez.  These guys play clerics *because* they want to help people.  When conditions cannot permit them to help someone they sometimes get harassed for it.<br>
<br>
When I am in game, its hard for me to tell what the other person is thinking.  For instance, was this person in the original thread playing around and forget to add a sarcastic  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  emote?  Is there a delay in their response because something is about to eat them, they are trying to steer while following someone else or they just ignoring me?<br>

I enjoy who I am and am proud of my class and my level.<br>
I cannot tell you how many ports I have given to strangers, but I assure you the list would exceed the daily population on the server.<br>
I do not expect or ask for a penny.<br>
And most times will refuse any payment.<br>
Heck I like the good will I get from doing it.<br>
But<br>
/dude tells you &quot;CAn you port me to BB&quot;<br>
/who dude and see he is in FP and I am in Perma<br>
/tell Dude I am in perma sorry<br>
/dude but you can bind and gate back<br>
/tell Dude I like where I am bound<br>
/dude please I really need it bady<br>
(knowing I am going to hate myself )<br>
/tell dude sigh, on my way<br>
ports to WC and runs all the way to FP  as he never left<br>
ports to BB<br>
/dude thanks <br>
<br>
All that  and &quot;Thanks&quot; Not even an offer?<br>
This guy was a level 52 SK<br>

<br>
Just a few points.<br>
<br>
1) If I grouped with you once in crushbone, that doesn't mean that 40 some odd levels later you can randomly send me a tell...&quot;hey! remember me? think you can help me out for a sec?&quot; (read: hey, i have no intention of ever talking to/grouping with you again, nor do i intend to pay your or provide transportation...now come rez me plz.)<br>
<br>
2) If I'm in freeport and you ask me to come rez you in DL, then yes, I will be upset if you don't offer *something*. Peridots, jaspers, sow pots, money, a free port, WHATEVER. If I have to take my time to find my own way to wherever you are (which is usually the case) then I expect compensation. Sorry if I sound like a greedy bitch, but whatever, I'm tired of getting screwed.<br>
<br>
and 3) sigh. if i go to the trouble of hauling my ass to wherever you are, and as i'm about to click my little rez button you tell me &quot;oh nm, got someone with a click stick comin.&quot; I WILL BE PISSED. first of all, if you're asking me for a rez it's most likely because you've tried everyone 49+. and you're &quot;settling&quot; for me. terribly sorry =P second of all, i've just wasted at *minimum* 10 minutes of my time. if you think you might have someone else that can come rez your sorry ass, let me know so i don't rush on over to you.<br>

So like, these guys get the MOST rezzes in game. Probably 99% of those rezzes are done for free, with maybe 5% of the clerics accepting donations. So if these guys get so many rezzes 'for free' why is it whenever I travel, I need to have 100pp on me to pay for ports? If clerics are frowned upon for charging for rezzes (I frown upon it myself) and it's looked at as bad karma, shouldn't it work both ways for porters as well?<br>
<br>
And on a final note..<br>
<br>

As a cleric, finding a rezz isn't that hard (Laf) but god damn it.. when I was 1-28 taking a revive was a god send. When I was 29-38 getting a lvl39rezz had me giddy. When I was 39-48 getting a 49rezz was out of this WORLD and I was kneeling and offering to be the rezzing clerics whore for 3 months.<br>
<br>
So seriously.. to all the folks 50 and under, learn to take a rezz that's +/- 5 levels of yourself. It wont kill ya. I still managed to hit 60, and I took quite a few deaths in 30-31, 35-36, 40-41, 45-46 without a 56 rezz.<br>
