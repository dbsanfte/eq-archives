Fascination clouded her eyes as she watched the ghastly display cause by the long serrated black bladed sword she favoured in battle. Death was her obsession. Death of any kind. She took pleasure when she could inflict it, and delighted in any exploration of it. What made it taste sweet to her was that she could not get into trouble for this, the orc had attacked her, hoping for a few gold pieces, or thought she was a meal or something along the lines.<br>
<br>
Myssa watched Mysse with the same fascination that her sister watched the orc she had just slain. How could she be related to this, this, morbid person? Mysse noticed the wound on her sisters side. Why must she wear such flimsy armor? Not that they could afford new armor for themselves, not yet. Soon though, they had skills that would sell well.<br>
<br>
Myssa walked behind her sister and made a mental prayer to Innoruuk. She closed her eyes as the tiny blue light glowed brighter around her hands. Opening her eyes the light moved to surround Mysse's minor wound and mended it Mysse jerked her head towards her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you expending energy on something so trivial?&quot; Myssa could hear the irritation in her voice and wondered if it was really over her expending her energy, or because she interrupt her revelling in her task.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its easier, and the energy will be replenished soon enough.&quot; Myssa deliberately tried to keep her tone flat so as not to agrivate her more. She'd hoped the theif would have brightened Mysse's mood. Death usually did. <br>
<br>
Mysse's murmurs were not audible as she bent over the dead body again. When she placed her hands first on the wound, Myssa flinched, when she pushed her fingers into it, she nearly threw up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why must you do that? Its disgusting!&quot; Myssa cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you must know...&quot; Mysse's tone clearly indicated she had no need to know. &quot;I think I have a way to steal someone's life energy form them, even after they are dead.&quot; <br>
<br>
Myssa gasped. &quot;You know that's impossible! Life must still be within the body to use it, or steal as the case may be.&quot; Her tone was sour, sounding like she was recounting a lesson from her youth. Knowing Myssa, she probably was.<br>
<br>
Mysse stood up, her hands bloodied, and regarded her sister for a long moment. &quot;You bring life to the dead through ressurection.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But only if the body is relatively in tact, and only if it is done quickly before the life can leave entirely. And at that, the wounds are not healed and require more magic to heal. Mysse, you don'tknow what you are stealing if you're taking life the dead.&quot; She managed to look concered. It must be the cleric in her leaking out. Priest of Hate indeed. <br>
<br>
Myssa seemed to sense her shock, and decided not to goad her any further. <br>
<br>
&quot;There's a stream ahead to wash yourself and hands in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mysse merely nodded and followed Myssa down the path. &quot;We should be in freeport in two days.&quot; Mysse said. &quot; We'll have to stop and rest once we reach the edge of the forest tonight. You're certain the preists of Marr will let you into their temple?&quot; Myssa nodded patiently again. Freeport catered to almost all races on Norrath at least in part, but the northern building of Freeport were ran by the Knights of Truth and Priests of Marr. Neither of which had much tolerance for worshipers of hate. <br>
<br>
Mysse sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have dispensation from the High Priest there, as well as High Priestess Alexandria. You know as well as I do that since the King and Queen's death, Neriak has sought more peaceful relations with norrath. They have little problems with the clerics of Neriak anymore.&quot; Myssa noted the open revulsion on Mysse's face as she thought of peace with the rest of Norrath. Mysse was a firm believer of Dark Elf superiority; an attitude now much in the minority. &quot;There's the river, clean up, and we can be on our way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mysse took off her thin chainmail shirt and knelt at the river. The water was cold, as it always was with no sun in Nektulos Forest to warm it even slightly. As she thought over Myssa's words she realized that travelling with her sister was for the best. Without her, she could not move freely through Freeport, and would have had to work through awkward channels. The best part was, Myssa had legitimate business in Freeport, which would cover Mysse's acitivies. Just a few more days to Freeport, and at least she could begin.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/jodyu/MysseSig.GIF" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
The land was giving way to desert as Mysse and her sister walked in silence.  Usually Myssa could keep conversations going by herself and rarely stopped except to eat and drink.  Something was bothering her, and Mysse was certain what it was.  That was why she wasn't going to start this conversation.  If her healing sister wanted to know about her activities in the Lodge of the Dead, she could ask, but Mysse had no desire to tell her.<br>
<br>
To Mysse's surprise, it wasn't about the orc, or her research and training in the guild that was on Myssa's mind, it was something else.  Seeimingly out of no where , Myssa took a deep breath and sighed.  Mysse laughed out loud, catching a mean look from her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't we stop here and rest. Its almost lunch time, I'm hungry, you seem tired, and if we go much farther there won't be any trees left for shade!&quot;  Mysse quitely unslung her backpack and sat down at the base of the tree.  Myssa followed suit as they began to dig in their packs for their rations and water flasks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead, say it.&quot;  Mysse said as she took a bit of her ration. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;About you?&quot; Myssa laughed. &quot;No my sister I was thinking of something else.&quot;  Myssa turned her head and her laughter quickly drained as she back over the rolling hills of the commonlands.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Kladea.&quot;  Mysse sighed regretfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;We haen't heard from her in such a long time.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I know, but I don't think she's in trouble.  The ghosts and ghouls and skeletons haunting Befallen are weak.  She's well able for them. She'll come back when she finds what she needs.&quot;  Mysse wondered if her sister knew just what hand she had in sending their little sister off on her quest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I miss her.  She's so young!&quot;  Myssa's face was pained.<br>
<br>
&quot;But powerful, you know she's powerful, she's risen quickly in the ranks of the Dead, I should know, I helped train her until she surpassed me with her magic.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't we forget our mission and go find her?&quot; Myssa asked in earnst.  Mysse was shocked.  Her sister was was the most devout Cleric she'd ever known.  She was wililng to forget a mission given to her from the High Priestess herself.  But Mysse knew if they went looking for her now, not only would her need in freeport be unattained, but likely Kladea's mission would be incomplete as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know we can't forget that, &quot; Mysse said laughing. &quot;I'll tell you what.&quot; Myssa's face grew tired, and an oh-i-know-that-line-to-well look appeared on it. Mysse ignored it. &quot;We can finish this mission in what? 1 more day?&quot; Myssa nodded. &quot;We'll be in freeport tonight, we'll rest, and get our business done tomorrow.  Then we'll leave and look for our little sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
Myssa smiled.  &quot;You knew I probably couldn't skip this mission anyway. &quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Pretty much.  I also have a bit of business in freeport to attend to. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I know.&quot; Myssa said it so matter of factly that Mysse was shocked. Myssa just laughed at her discomfort. &quot;Lets continue please, we'll make Freeport by dark. &quot;<br>
<br>
They packed up their bags and continued on their way.  Mysse was nervous now, but put it out of her mind.  What did her sister know of her business?  If she knew, did the Clerics of Neriak know too? Not even her master at the Lodge of the Dead knew what she was up to!  Only Kladea should know.  And Kladea wouldn't have told Myssa, would she? <br>
<br>
Mysse eyed her sister cautiously.  Maybe she was more devious than she realized, this not so innocent Dark Elf girl training to become a Priest of Innoruuk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysselyss>MysseLyss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part III</span><hr size=1> Kladea stared at the gnarled little gnome with faint amusement.  Sitting at that bottom of the ruins of Befallen, she found it laughable that so weak a creature would defy her now.  She stood, imposing before him the minions who both guarded and kept him prisoner dead now at her feet.  The undead creature she commanded to serve her stood behind her, eyes blank, bones bleach white waiting.  <br>
<br>
The gnome's little face sneered at her as he struggled to stand.  He showed no fear to her, even tho he could not stand and clung desperately to that which she was after.  She knew she would have to take it from him, somehow, and though his size was small, his body weak something inside her told her to be wary.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Enough of this gnome, give me what I want and I'll let you live.&quot;  Her voice was strong, even as she felt less sure.<br>
<br>
&quot;ohhh you want this... i know you do..&quot; the little creature rasped.  &quot;But you will not take it from old Nippo, nooo you won't...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do do you expect to stop me you frail excuse for a living creature?&quot;  She made a motion with her hand and her servant, moved forward toward the gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh quite easily you see... I cannot stand, or else I'd leave this wretched place, but now... no now I'll be able to leave...&quot; The gnome was grinning now, its hideous features controting to make him seem like the undead, teeth missing from his mouth, his skin wrinkled.<br>
<br>
Kladea saw him start to speak quietly.  A sudden wave of panic gripped her and she tried to cast a spell to protect herself.  She was too late.  With a weak geesture the gnome froze her servant in place, with another, he shattered the skeleton into his parts.  Then he turned his eyes to her, grinning the hideous, ugly grin.<br>
<br>
Kladea felt the air around her constrict and it became hard to breath.  Her hands came to her throat trying helplessly to find and remove what felt like immense stone hands choking her.  She fell to her knees, and watched helplessly as the little gnome slowly changed before her eyes.  HIs skin relaxed and became more tight.  His eyes regained their colour and became a striking blue.  His limbs seemed to grow under his clothes as they began to fill out again.  The shirt he wore was no longer rotting and fallin off, but looked to be a new piece of clothing.  He was whole again, and as she collapsed tothe group, the hands no longer around her throat she looked at her own hands.  They were withed, old.  Her once long black hair fell into her face and was no grey and stringy as much of it fell out.<br>
<br>
&quot;There we are young Teir'Dal.  I'm free now thanks to you, and now you shall never have it. &quot; He waved his arms and spoke under his breath.  Skeletons seemed to rise out of the earth at his whim, and he set them on her.  They picked her up and hauled to where he was sitting.  <br>
<br>
Kladea stared in horror at the gnome as she could no longer speak, no longer stand, and he stood there grinning at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now we wait for the others to come, so I can complete this little trinket.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kladea knew he meant to wait for Mysse.  When she did not meet her sister in Neriak, she would come for her, and likely bring the other piece with her.  Mysse would not have a chance against this ugly litlte gnome. Mysse could not use the other piece, not alone, not against him.  Not while he carried a piece of the Blood Witch with him.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=121881">Mysse Veri'exa, Dread Lord</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It didn't matter that she was young, too young to be able to join the guilds in the city.  It also didn't matter to her that no shop keeper trusted her enough to let her earn her keep by helping out in the stores.  She could get what she wanted, whenever she wanted.  There was no worry about weather here inside Neriak and the tunnels in Third Gate offered her many places to hide.  She often had reasons to hide.  <br>
<br>
Few people ever caught the little rogue, unless she wanted to be.  Like when she played tricks on her friends or the merchants who shoed her out of the stores.  Even when she had money to spend! No mind to her that she just lifted the money from their own pockets or safe when they weren't looking, it was still good money and its not lik they KNEW she took it.  But they all suspected, which was why she was hoping to find something legitimate now to cover her tracks for a while.<br>
<br>
Only no one would take her in anymore.  The Teir'dal had such littler tolerance for theives, at least openly.  The theives guild themselves would not take her, at least not yet.  They told her had to prove herself, but Runiko wasn't someone to brag. If she showed them what she could do, how could she trust them not to turn her in?  Besides she could do just fine on her own.  She had been since she was 5 afterall.<br>
<br>
All that in her life was over now though.  She had to leave Neriak, and she was scared.  For barely 8 years she had lived on the &quot;generosity&quot; of others, since her parents died.  There was no family to take her in, and now, the others wouldn't accept her.  She had to leave Neriak, her home, her place.  She would miss it.  There was talk of a human city, outside of the forest, through the commonlands that tolerated all kinds.  She would head for Freeport and see herslef settled there.  Maybe she wouldn't even have to steal to live.  But then again, maybe she would just get better at it.<br>
