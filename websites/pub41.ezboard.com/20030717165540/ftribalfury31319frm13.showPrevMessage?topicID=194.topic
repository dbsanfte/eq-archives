I was a long time gaming pal of Pen's and finally broke in and bought it from all his descriptions of his EQ addiction. I loved the game, but it took me a while to get the hang of. I believe I was guilded in my low 20's and was literally hardly able to do yard trash in Unrest. Under the guidance of Serano in cleric form, I gradually made my way to raid level and attended a Seb Jugg spell farming raid (my first raid) and had a blast. <br>
<br>
Today, I'm tanking those same Juggs myself. I'm walking around in Tier 2 planes and close to entering Tier 3 even w/o the 11th's patch. Most of my equipement is almost as good or better then the ToV HoT armor drops. I'm attending Doomshade mobilizations where I crit 1k bow shots. <br>
<br>
All this and more I owe to Tribal and all the great people who've helped me to learn and grow as my PC. I mention the above to state just how drastically not only my own character's capability changed in such a short time, but also Tribal's. Farming Seb for spells and raiding ToV and taking out high end Luclin boss mobs is a huge jump. <br>
<br>
Always though, I've loved the family concept. I've had the chances to join other &quot;better raiding guilds,&quot; but I havent because I don't want to. 'Cause it's not true. TF is a mix of class, fun, and raiding that simply can't be compared with. <br>
<br>
Although we've had a string of HUGELY successful hits and raids these past few weeks, sometimes we fail at something, we dust ourselves off and try hard again. It's happened with Vindi, it's happened with Doom, and it'll happen again in the future w/o doubt. These hurdles however imo, are actually quite fun. I see how once we encounter something like this, all pretense of a farming or casual raid drop and we all get dead serious to overcome the obstacle. That's how we've grown stronger, and that's how we advanced as a guild... by remembering fun, but also by pushing our limits and working hard to break them. <br>
<br>
Doze is one of these mobs imo. That was out first encounter with him, and I believe the first skirmish we took him much lighter then we should have. The difference in our dps and reaction time between the first and 2nd encounters was significant. We're still refining our tactics with him, but I believe HE IS DOABLE. He's a mob that should give us an idea of the type of dmg that Ssra named can do, and by slaying him, we'll be that much more ready and confident. <br>
<br>
Here's a link to our friend and the quests hes good for:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6448">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=6448</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
By finishing him off, and by being able to finish him off everytime we see him, both our skill and equipment as a guild will reach a new level. <br>
<br>
He's bad. No doubt. His AoE was experienced by everyone. Some of us got smacked with Thunderblast, his dot that basically kills 75 mana per tick. He quadded for 700-900. He was a very resistant critter..... AND YET HE WAS UNDER CONTROL during the 2nd fight. <br>
<br>
We all want vengence, we all want to redeem ourselves after those fights. Doze is no joke, and we're talking about mobilization sized force preferably. As we saw, since the AoE is unresistable, resist gear isnt needed. Hence, we can have people in guild w/ the right faction stand by to help as well once the pit is cleared.<br>
<br>
If you're interested in vengence vs this dragon, might I suggest some things that would increase our chances against him siginicantly:<br>
<br>
1.) Sumven.  Yeah that's kinda weird huh? No. Sum is our highest lvl wizard and he has access to a key spell to use against Doze called Porlos' Fury, an UNRESISTABLE 2k dragon only nuke. Yes, it's questable. Yes it hurts CoV faction. Yes, it takes 2 dots to use. But with dmg modifiers, the added dps is just too much to pass by. We shouldn't hurt our faction by trying to spawn the rare dragon in WW for this quest, but rather keep an eye out for it. I know we constantly scout it for the Stength of th Elements mob and the Beneveolence scout, so what's the big deal checking for one more? Taking out that dragon and then doing the equivalent Giant bane 2k spell quest should greatly increase our dps for ToV and future Vindi hits. The Siren's Grotto part can also be hunted along with Ari's seeming love of the zone for DotB. Links to the them are below:<br>
<br>
Porlos’ Fury<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1294">everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=1294</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1293">everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=1293</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
2.) He dispels. It sucks. I'm sure alot of people weren't prepared for this and had key buffs stripped, severely hurting our raid power. He dispells one slot at a time, and from top to bottom as i observed. Solution? Try your best to grab an instant clicky item to act as a barrier against this. It'll help with this and in the future. <br>
<br>
3.) Bard power. This is an endurance fight more then not. We'll ether have our lower hp people get fragged by his AoE sooner or later, run oom, or both, usually one after another. Hence why we need our bards here. Playing hp/mana regen is key to keeping our caster mana up and us alive. Ari's epic should help considerably, as Trak is a joke compared to this guy. Pens and any other necros we have can twitch the clerics as well while doing their thing. Yes, I know you don't like it pens, but like it or not, it would greatly help. Speaking of cleric mana...<br>
<br>
4.) Slow. I have no doubt that our tanks can handle Doze unslowed with heals. That isnt an issue, so don't take this the wrong way. Rather, its that the longer we wait on slow, the more mana is being used up by the clerics. It might even be worth it to sacrifice someone just to land slow and debuff ASAP.<br>
<br>
5.) Positioning. Where we fight makes a difference based on adds and casters being able to hide. We found this out the hard way yesterday.<br>
<br>
and lastly,<br>
<br>
6.) Battle rezzing. We havent had much need for this in the past, but we better start practicing this for Doze and for future uber mobs we're considering taking down. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind, these are just suggestions. I myself took the morning + afternoon to just chill out and relax after that. We're here to have fun first and foremost. We'll take him down someday, and we'll do it with the grace of a guild that isn't known for sacrificing bonding and courtousy for power. <br>
That's what we should all be proud of, remember that ^_^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wulfzor>Wulfzor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/8/03 3:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dozekar the Cursed</span><hr size=1> Arkard I couldn't have composed a better speech than that bro!!

Now as to slowing I used Malo and attempted to slow as soon as I saw him. Problem is even after Malo hit he resisted slow time after time. I do have a solution or an idea anyway. Shoot me for not trying this last nite.... I have a diseased base slow and an ae disease slow. I think it would land easier and would help until either My regular slow or a Chantys slow landed. I do know that at 61 I get an upgrade of the diseases slow also. We will give this a try on our next encounter.<br>

I agree with it all but ya you guessed it one part.<br>
<br>
If you are depending on me feeding the clerics to keep a raid alive then said raid is doomed from the start. We either need<br>
<br>
1. More DPS to drop the mob or<br>
<br>
2. More healing power<br>
<br>
For me to give a cleric enough mana for a Cheal it takes 4 &quot;twitches&quot;. It's a 400 - 150 ratio fyi. I lose 400 you gain 150.<br>

<br>
Oh and Serano, yeah that's pretty much exactly what we have to do, so we ether have to a.) drag along more clerics on these hits or b.) get more epiced clerics or c.) get our high lvled clerics divine rez <br>
<br>
Regardless, I'm well aware of just how much we CANNOT afford to drop a cleric out of the cheal chain at this point. But, eventually, we'll need to be able to battle rez and I'm just pointing this out, hence why it was last on my list. Ideally, that cleric would be able to do combat rezzes and emergency rebuffs. In reality, we barely can afford to click one of our main tanks at this point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
No line of sight for casting will save our asses, but it might take some getting used to and heal buttons set up on multiple people. Also, it limits the heals done on the non tank melee, and w/o a heal once in while, doze's AoE will eventually kill them off.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sumven666>sumven666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/8/03 11:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dozekar the Cursed</span><hr size=1> Arkard, i have the peice from sirens grotto for porlos fury but havent pursued the dragon in WW for a couple reasons:<br>
<br>
now that i have sunstrike i can do 1615 dmg to a mob that is rarely resisted, with crits i can do well into the 2000s not to mention it does 1800 or so with the mage bracer. I have the hsagras wrath spell for the giants and i dont even use it because the cost of the 2 peridots isnt worth 200 more dmg a nuke if i dont crit. <br>
 <br>
Just a thought by being unresistable do i still need to be in melee range to have it land???  Also i heard that this spell only works on dragons that are on specific big name dragons that are on the CoV faction these were the dragons listed.<br>
Lord Yelinak (Skyshrine) Telkorenar (ToV West) Gozzrem (ToV West) Lendiniara the Keeper (ToV West) Dozekar the Cursed (ToV East aka HoT) Aaryonar (ToV North) Lady Mirinella (ToV North) Lady Nevederia (ToV North) Lord Feshlak (ToV North) Lord Koi'Doken (ToV North) Lord Kreizenn (ToV North) Lord Vyemm (ToV North) Vulak`Aerr (ToV North) Ventani the Warder (Sleeper's Tomb) Nanzata the Warder (Sleeper's Tomb) Tukaarak the Warder (Sleeper's Tomb) Hraashna the Warder (Sleeper's Tomb) Wardersn. <br>
<br>
Wouldnt mind having porlos fury but it just doesnt seem to be worth it. If you can find out about the melee range thing let me know because it was a pain the other night trying to time it to run in and nuke so id avoid the aoe. Shoot me a tell in game  or post if you have some more input.<br>

Got something to try for mobs that cast mana drain.  An OOM cleric sucks.  Mana drain is a debuff.  It has an icon.  The wise thing to do in this case would be to have all the int casters and clerics strip all their buffs.  HP buffs mean nothing, when you don't have mana.  Clerics should make a hotkey that lets someone know they've got mana drain debuff, and when it's removed.  That person then casts Annul Magic on said cleric repeatedly til told to stop.  If both have mana drain, take care of the cleric first and then yourself.  You may have to cast Annul Magic 3+ times before it's removed.<br>
<br>
As for clicky items, Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring is one that works indoors, and is all/all.  You may want to look into picking one up in bazaar for about 4-5k.  Unless, you prefer to farm Warsilk Woods for the rare drop. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47682">Sage Milkna Wraithcaller</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

All other buffs followed. During the battle before the door opened I never got debuffed past the first slot. As soon as Waterbreathing i would go away...round the corner and eat me a stone to replentish first junk buff. I did give one to hedorm but dunno if it helped, was even used or what. Second at level 59 I was completely unable to get malase to stick till after wulf landed his malo spell. We did get in the groove after wasting much mana but thats was a major consideration. During the course of the battle I think I landed maybe two spells for partial damage if that many. Unless we can figure out a way to debuff him everytime and early its gonna be strictly a melee battle. I feel attacking him without pets crippled a good portion of our melee capabilities. Standing there not able to get a spell to stick and not being able to send in a pet IMHO is foolish and wasteful. After playing strictly a mage for over two years, my pet control is pretty good. One reason I chose DE as a race was for the ability to hide.......ie instant pet suicide if pet goes and does something stupid, reguardless of the range. Now please dont get me wrong up to the point of dozer, pets are prolly a bad thing...way to much AE to keep it under control. But there is a med/buff break just before doz gets pulled...why not break out a pet then? Yes pets will die fast but till they do thats just more DPS giving dozer the beatdown. Those who ARE of a  level to have pet hold command are not in a majority yet and prolly wont be for some time. Till then we need to adapt to overcome and use what we got to its fullest. <br>
<br>
 Drannor, Fnord, Morg........please please please would you help me out on next one. Being the only mage for an entire raid was no fun, I need help on them Mod Rods. Preliminary summonings for blankies was easy and i only had a couple peeps asking for them after I moved on to other summoning which is thx. But once the AE's started sitting to med was just this side of impossible, and the clerics NEED that mana.<br>
<br>
 Just some thoughts..a bit disorganized but hey I'm at work<br>

<br>
To answer you concisely sumv: Dragon's Bane will not be resisted regardless of range.<br>
<br>
For the dot's: don't forget to get a reagent conservation necklace from the magi before the fight. I think it's something like 20% chance to conserve a reagent, which is nothing to laugh about if you are casting the spell 10 times (meaning some 4 dots saved).<br>
<br>
Finally, you can get innate crits on dragon's bane, which could push it up past 3k damage. Too bad there's only a 2% chance on that. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=596996" target="top">Infirno</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Insidious decay loweres poisen and diesease resits. It also stacks with malise line spells. It is also unresistable. With that and malosiana or whatever mages have should be able to lower those to resist by close to a 100. This should help with shammy and necro dots as some of them are dieseased based. Will also help with my dieseased base slow witch at 61 is a 40% slow. (better than no slow till turgers lands.)
