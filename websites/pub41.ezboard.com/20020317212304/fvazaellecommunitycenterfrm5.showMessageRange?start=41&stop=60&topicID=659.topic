What I mostly said was that I was bummed out that Jetx seemed to have forgotten about us since he left. See I thought, apparently I was wrong, that we were friends and I was kinda sad to see him gone.<br>
<br>
Jet, I'm very aware of who is in the guild and knew what I was saying could get back to you. Nice to see that what you heard was totally not even close to what I said. Also nice to see Samir here nailing me after spending a whole 2 weeks(maybe?) guilded with me where his contact was watching me pull PoG, and Ghol who doesn't know me from Adam and who maybe saw me at BotB once or something.<br>
<br>
Also nice to see you lie thru your teeth about the things I say when we were grouped, uh like twice? Since most of my group chat involves saying 'heya' before I twist songs for hours on end.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, sorry that I thought we were friends and for being bummed out that I hadn't seen you for a month. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueqjetx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ JetX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://eqscreenshot.homestead.com/files/icon57.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 471<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/01 3:24:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Motherfuckers that talk shit behind your fucking back.</span><hr size=1> Maybe I was wrong to pick on Alyen, but there is some fucked up shit going on in the top of PO.<br>
<br>
Every day I hear shit, in game people send me tells saying hey bro they are talking about you again, or in RL someone will say the exact same shit. I am sick and tired of having to hear that keadaian says that I was saying some shit in EC when he didnt even confront me about it. I am sick and tired of hearing all the bullshit that is going on to other members in PO, I am sick and tired of people coming to me telling me how they feel they are being mistreated and then tell me shit thats happening to their friends in the guild and not doing a SINGLE thing about it. Today was just the last day for me, I heard Alyen was saying something about me again and I said I just cant take this fucking shit anymore and made this fucking post.<br>
<br>
I believed you to be a nice person Alyen, but from shit I am hearing and looking back on things I have seen its hard to dinstinquish the truth from whats not. Its hard to say Keadaian is a two faced liar and how he uses people is bullshit when you and Anika are by his side. Your in charge of a lot of shit and when things are fucked up your who a lot of people turn to. <br>

I played EQ to have fun and loved meeting all the people that I could. I dont think I ever rubbed someone off the wrong way and if I did im sorry.<br>
<br>
I used to have a lot of fun on this server, then I felt that someone was rubbing me the wrong way, people were able to have family members guild invited regardless of level but not me. Ever get invited to a group only to find out someone else logged in who they would rather have?<br>
<br>
I mean I should have known something was up when the only person who even seemed to care about me when I applied was Talandra. One minute everyone likes you the next minute they hate you. Ninla I feel pretty bad for you, everyone seemed to love you but when Shyde posted about how inspected her a while back and how it made her feel bad everyone seemed to turn tables and hate you! Of course Shyde you are one of Kead's favorites (I even think shes an officer, no clue when this happened!), and I got nothing against you but its sad how everyones mind changed so quickly about someone.<br>
<br>
I long ago made a post talking about how I felt on PO's website back when I was a member and it got deleted and then rumors started to pop up about me. I guess thats when I knew for sure I was no longer needed and wanted to leave my friends looking good so at least the situation wouldnt be too far turned on me unlike so many others who were in the guild and put in soo much only to be treated like shit when they left.<br>
<br>
I am not really mad, I am just sad I guess, and feel like its time to get things off my mind. Dont be shy if you can relate to what im saying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukeadaiansongborne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keadaian Songborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 360<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/01 5:10:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Motherfuckers that talk shit behind your fucking back.</span><hr size=1> Ahh... so 3 months later you're suddenly concerned about a question I asked one time about some comments allegedly made by you in EC?<br>
<br>
Ok, let's set the record straight then, shall we?<br>
<br>
One night, 2 or 3 days after you left the guild, I received a tell from someone I do not know asking if you were a member of PO.  I said you had been but had recently left.  This person then said you were in EC selling gear, claiming to be in PO, and making derrogatory statements about the guild.  I said I was sorry to hear that but as you were no longer a member, there wasn't much I could do about it.  He responded by saying something like &quot;sorry to hear you don't care about your guilds reputation, I thought you would want to know when someone is trying to hurt it.&quot;  Mind you this was mid raid, so forgive me paraphrasing.<br>
<br>
I asked your father about it, to see if he might know what this was all about.  He didn't.  That was pretty much the last I heard about it or talked about it.<br>
<br>
There, I'm guilty of talking about you behind your back, a few months ago.<br>
<br>
It baffles me a bit tho... there's only one person on this server I actively dislike, and you aren't it.  Hell, even Vehnn isn't that special.  For all the bickering and flaming, I actualy like Krimzin, I think he and I are more alike than we are different.  <br>
<br>
And for the record Jet... we're still killing ST mobs on a regular basis.  5 more keys this week and no plans to slow down anytime soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usiggymk5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SiggyMk5</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 678<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/01 6:10:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Motherfuckers that talk shit behind your fucking back.</span><hr size=1> Been a while since we've had a good, serious rant.

Jet, you started your thread about one thing, and now it's about something completely different. WTF are you talking about? What do you want? First you say it's about Alyen, and now you're apologizing to Alyen and saying it's really about Kead -- when it's really about the board colors? What you really wanted was to stir up some more bullshit because clearly this board doesn't have enough. Like all the attention you're getting?<br>
<br>
And you wierd-ass lurker people. What's your deal? It's raining! FUCKING PO! Oh, I'm late for middle school! GOD DAMN PO'S FAULT! PO killed Cazic? They must have zerged him! PO always stirring up trouble!<br>
<br>
You don't know anything about us. You've just taken in and accepted all the bullshit these people WHO DON'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE AND HAVEN'T FOR MONTHS have been posting. The people who still load up good old VCC in their browser because they think whoring their post count makes them some kind of celebrity.<br>
<br>
PO is a guild of friends who like to play EQ together. It's not a giant dictatorship that runs around ruining people's lives. Or secretly making evil death pacts and OooOOOooOOo talking behind everyone's back!<br>
