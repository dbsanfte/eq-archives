Date: 14 DEC 02<br>
Loc: Plane of Sky (Airplane) Assemble in Toxx forest spires<br>
Show Time: Currently planning for 7PM will adjust with sign-ups - Likely to last at least 6 - 7 hours.<br>
Raid Channel : skyraid<br>
Level Range: 46 and up (preferance will go to over 50 players)<br>
Number of players : 24 (I have a plan for an additional 6 players IF there is interest to do part of the raid.)<br>
goal: Monk epic drop, last necro drop for epic from sky, Ranger Epic completions (Swiftwind), 6th Isle Spirocs - Warrior epic drops<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sign up requirement: sign up here or by email to me. or in game tells to me or to Xdus or Pensfan.  When you sign up - please give list when the earliest you can start and the latest you can play.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I will be on vacation and won't be playing from 25 Nov to 6 Dec.  Xdus or Pensfan if you get an ingame sign up from someone please ask them the earliest and latest information and post for them if they don't have an ezboard account. <br>
<br>
extra: Epic drops for many classes - I am post below about various links on how to do Air.  Please post about your PoSky epic encounter if you have one. There are also other random nice drops in zone(class haste belts and random top tier Original EQ items) as well - and gobs of class quests that one raid will not finish any that are started - as they start and end in Sky.  Currenly have most of the air drops from the first raid on a mule - will add the new drops to the mule and see what we can turn in after the raid.<br>
<br>
For this raid - I will require a level of comitment I do not expect more than once a month. Even then I am asking a lot. I am asking that people that are willing to commit to this raid - actually really truly definatly actually real life and in game - commit to this raid. This is the kind of raid where we really need to have everyone that signs up be there on time. If thru this discussion thread we need to change the show time or the duration or things like that we will - so we will be flexible depending on the discussion that ensues.  Most of the people on the raid are not likely to get a reward as this is our second trip and we will have a few more before the class quest turn ins start to roll in.  I expect after this raid we have a good chance at having enough quest items for some of the class quests.<br>
<br>
I request a sign up for this raid from you if you will really be there - oh and please don't be turned off by all this commitment crap - I am only putting it so seriously because parts of Sky require some good cohesion. <br>
<br>
To pull this off I need to have:<br>
3 clerics.<br>
2 enchanters (1 can do but 2 is a bonus)<br>
1 MT 53+<br>
2 AT 50+<br>
1 necro [ 8~) ]<br>
2 FD pullers preferably one SK for snare <br>
2 shammys (1 ok)<br>
1 wizard - prefer 4.<br>
1 mage min<br>
1 Beastlord<br>
<br>
Notice I ask for 16 to 19 prefered class/players already. This counting me adds up to only 5 slots left. I see a possibility we might not get more than 2 wizards but would like 4. I might only get 1 chanter instead of 2. So just because you see other people sign up for this sign up out of those classes that you shouldn't sign up with hopes to go. Note the raid will be no less than 24. I am interested in an extra group of 6 to help us break Isle 3 (Azzaracks) I will try to get everyone there that wants to go.<br>
<br>
This is a TF raid with openings for our allies. HOWEVER - if due to my 24(30) player cap - if you sign up and are not selected as part of the raid force, it is prolly not personal. It might be... but prolly not 8~). You see that I have asked for a SK and we don't even have one in TF. Please sign up if you are interested and force the hard work on me to choose who is in. I will publish the who is in list by Thursday the 12th at the latest - preferably before then. I will publish extra group list as well<br>

<br>
Isle 2.  I need Dominac to post how he would like to do Isle 2.  We will recover to Isle 1 by reusing Alter plane Sky.<br>
<br>
Plan for Azzeracks -<br>
<br>
Instead of doing a 4 party rush in Azzeracks this time - I am looking at doing a 3 party break in with 2 parties standing by. ( I will pay for keys for the extra party if enough peeps sign up for it.)<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that there are 7 moving Azzriacks and once we kill 3 the rest are cake.  so if We can get the 1st raid force to go in and kill at least 3 then the follow on force can get in and take the remaining 4 with a little less getting smoked.  I will want to try and see if we can charm one on the initial break.  Depending on who signs up - will affect how we break Isle 3.<br>
<br>
On the initial break chanters will not mez the 1st two adds.  the first two adds will be tank mezed by AT1 and AT2.<br>
<br>
Isle 4.<br>
<br>
This Isle was cake for us to break last time.  just bear in mind 2 things.  the metorite guys have knockback and will be fought last.<br>
<br>
2nd to last will be the evil eye guys.   they are chanters and were dispelling everything.  we wasted a lot of time rebuffing after each of their fights - and am thinking next time we will rebuff the MT after each fight with them and NOT send any more melee in for them.... prolly kill The evil eyes (guardians?) with MT aggro and nukes dots and arrows.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the plan for breaking Isle 5<br>
Excerpt from a Guide on Krulls:<br>
<br>
You’d think that after finishing off the fourth island, the natural progression would dictate you teleport up to the fifth island. Not so fast. The next island is full of flying horses and griffins that are not aggro but will assist each other. There’s really no room to fight effectively on this island without all hell breaking loose. It is far better to pull MOBs down to the fourth island after you’ve cleared it. So how is that done without levitate you ask? A cleric goes up, aggros a MOB, casts Divine Aura and jumps off the island to the fourth below them. In this fashion, the cleric is sure to live if they fall quickly enough to hit the ground while under the effects of DA. Hitting the fourth island below them isn’t too hard either – it sounds worse than it is. This can also be done with Safe Fall, but it’s not nearly as reliable. So let’s assume you’re on the fourth island pulling MOBs down from above you for the rest of this section. This leaves you with eight hours to clear both island four and five basically before four starts respawning, which shouldn't be a problem at all.<br>
<br>
There are 6 flying MOBs on the island, called either Soul Harvesters (level 52) or Essence Harvesters (level 52). This looks deceptively easy due to the lack of MOBs but it gets interesting, fast. The Soul Carriers look like griffins and the Essence Harvesters resemble flying Pegasus-like horses. They hit in the high 200s and cast stun. The griffins are susceptible to fire based attacks, where the &quot;pegs&quot; are vulnerable to magic based attacks. You only want to pull one and here’s why….<br>
<br>
When these MOBs are attacked and killed, they split into two smaller versions of the MOB you just killed – which are smaller in size, NOT in level. The second generation of MOBs, known as Carriers instead of Harvesters, will both be level 54, but with higher HP, AC, and resists. They’ll also hit harder and despawn after 80 minutes if left undisturbed. It gets worse. When a Carrier is killed, it spawns another offspring, who is tougher as well. The offspring of a Carrier is a Tamer. Essence Tamers and Soul Tamers are level 56. Predictably, they have even higher HP, AC, and resists and hit even harder than the Carriers (in the 300s). They too will despawn after 80 minutes if left alone. Towards the end of fighting these, they will become Enraged so the tanks should be careful here. All of these MOBs drop Bird Whistles, 24 in all, just like on the other islands, and their respawn time on the first generation version of the MOB is eight hours as well. When the island &quot;boss&quot; is slain, these whistles are handed into Sirran the Lunatic for the key to island six.<br>

          For the monk epic, it is best to set the camp in the windmill as Gwan has a knockback proc and will throw people off the island. Simply hand the presence the scale from Eejag, tell Gwan you are ready and carefully walk him to the windmill. Neither the Blade Storms or Noble Dojorn will assist.<br>
So we will not have to kill either Dojorn or the Blade Storms.  The dojorn drops some pretty good stuff though if we could handle em...<br>

So I will have a full group. I dont think any of us needs anything from the zone, side from a fair split of the exp and loot. So no contest for the epic/quest items, We are all NBG (need before greed) anyways. But we are all up for the challenge and the confirmed ppl are all about staying up all day and night so no time issues for us.
