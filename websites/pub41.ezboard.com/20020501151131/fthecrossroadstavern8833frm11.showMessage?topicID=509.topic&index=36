<br>
To sum things up: <br>
<br>
1. I never saw NBG mentioned till I won the roll<br>
<br>
2. Even if I went along with NBG the cloak would still be  a +7str +9dex +50hp upgrade to my current cloak.<br>
<br>
3. In a NBG situation like this where every melee could have benefitted from the cloak a roll would have transpired anyways....I won this roll with a 96 over his 76.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you think I should have just say &quot;Ok Mr. Total stranger, fellow melee that I'll never see again, you havent worked as hard as I have on your gear, so here ya go, take my 7str 9dex 50hp upgade, im content with the light blue exp that moves my AA bar 1/10 a bubble every 50 kills&quot;.<br>

this same &quot;greedy fewl&quot; (nice spelling, btw) passed on 2 bracers (6k ea.), 2 handwraps (4-5kea.), and 2 crystal chitin shields the *very* next day at the frenzy camp in velks.<br>

NBG?  ....ok, so lets assume Dakon knew it was going to be an NBG group, despite the fact that he says he never knew (and I'm inclined to believe him, given my experiences with him the past few days...he was an excellent groupmate).  Would it be an upgrade for him?  Hastewise, maybe not.  Statwise, apparently yes.  There's more than haste on the cloak, even if that *is* the primary thing we all think about when SBC comes up.  So, it's an upgrade.  Thus, he has &quot;Need&quot;.  He deserved a roll....&quot;/whine but he has haste already&quot;...did said group help Dakon get his ragebringer?  I doubt it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Why should he have to lose a chance on an upgrade due to the fact that he's got his epic (which no doubt enhanced the effectiveness of the group)?<br>
<br>
bottom line, as I'm sure has been said before, and will be said many, many times in the future...NBG in a pickup group=Lame.  If I want NBG, I'll put together some guildies and friends.  People who I can trust, so I know the &quot;need&quot; really does exist.  Otherwise, I want a shot at anything that drops, with the exception of spells. <p><table width=350 height=120 border=1 style="border-color:#000000; border-width:3; border-style:solid;font-family:Arial;" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<br>
First off, let me tell you how I had to lift my jaw from my desk when I heard a SBC dropped from the zone-in group.  The only thing I recall hearing shouted was someone asking our opinion on who should get it between a 60 warrior and 60 rogue with epic.  Nothing was shouted about trains after the fact or any other altercations, other than &quot;d00d this is gonna be on Crossroads bottom feeders!&quot;.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I'm getting kind of sick of hearing people use rogue's epic as a crutch when it comes to upgradeable slots.  Rogue epic is about as easy as they come; I'm pretty sure on Legends server when a rogue hits 50 a GM personally visits and hands them their Ragebringer to avoid the tedious running around collecting crap. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I hate to throw this into the thick of it, but if I recall both were non-guilded level 60's.  So unless they get a lucky invite which includes randoming on dragon haste from Gore/Sev/Talendor, their best and only way of obtaining 27%ish haste would be from a RBG or SBC, both of which have fairly good alternate stats along with their haste (hell, it's better alternate stats than RBB and CoF).<br>
<br>
As far as them heading to disco, if this is the same chanter that I res'd a few hours earlier, that makes it a level 42 chanter, level 42 cleric, level 60 warrior and rogue and whoever else was in the group.  This group in no way was heading to disco if I was res'ing due to zone-in trash.  If it was indeed a NBG group, then all that would really mean (to me) is that casters/priests should not have rolled on it.<br>
<br>
All of this, of course, is my opinion alone.  Then again, I've never randomed for loot and have never dealt with rolling, NBG, or seeding?...heck if I know.<br>
<br>
Either way, I guess it depends on the group make-up, whether friends or pick-up and the off-chance that something this rare would actually drop to begin with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I hardly ever group from 1 to 60 I guess =( ...<br>
<br>
Hence the concept of NBG is a bit alien to me, in my opinion it will only work to friends or guildies. <br>
<br>
Apart from how easy NBG gets exploited (put on crappy gear, or put on resist gear!), there is no telling that the person who gets defaulted the item won't sell it either. Maybe not straight away, but sometime in the future. <br>
<br>
Let's say I'm a ghetto warrior in full crafted and FBSS. If SBC drops, well ... I might keep it, but I might also sell it to buy me armor with better AC (You can afford serveral pieces of Incarnadine/Cobalt armor maybe)<br>
<br>
So basically you view that item as an asset. Imagine instead of a SBC, a 20,000 pp Thurgadin Bank Bond dropped ... why should the cleric not be allowed to grab that amount of cash, he can use it to upgrade himself. Maybe when SBC drops cleric thinks something like, &quot;Cool, Orb of Infinite Void dropped!&quot; <br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents ... random is the way to go when you're in a pickup group (Come to think of it, I haven't been in a non-guild group for the last 6 months). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvetronnidrakurion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vetronni Drakurion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(4/15/02 11:24:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Assassinated</span><hr size=1> <br>
Umm  you said &quot;The druid in the group left out of disgust over the warriors total disregard to the roll, &quot;  <br>
<br>
Excuse me but thats total BS, The druid's name is Tillerill, catch her in game - she was not totally disgusted, she agreed with the decision like EVERYONE else in group except you.  And quite frankly she is a friend I met in game here on this very server a few weeks ago. And yes, I group with her often now when we are on at the same time.  I usually DO know the people I am grouped with, at least to an extent, as I meet them here for the most part like we all do.  There was an open slot in group, you came in LFG -  it was offered to you - so now that makes US wrong?  /sigh <br>
<br>
As for being called NBG, it was - and before you started pulling, (cleric in group and yes she was 42ish at that time I believe, granted she is low for seb and doesn't have aego, but she knows her job and does a damn good job ) had just started buffing when it was called.  I am sorry if you missed that point,  tho I am not sure how -apparently you were the only one. Still, that MIGHT explain some of your response / reactions - but not all, and surely not this flame  ( I too fail to understand why you flame the recipient, instead of all those making / agreeing with it, well at least in the origination of your flame it was limited to Shriok), but it WAS announced BEFORE one mob was ever pulled at the entrance, which is well before getting past the doors where cloak dropped.<br>
<br>
As for being a lowbee warrior, I am just 54 - not 60, but I think that takes me beyond the &quot;noob status&quot; you seem to keep trying to put me in.  Nevertheless, what you think of me - doesn't particularly change anything.  I know I do my job, I know I have never taken an item not earned and basically thrown at me from my group, I keep my word, and I can look at myself everyday in the mirror, proud of the reflection I see. I do and always will agree/honor with the groups decision tho - bottom line.  The game , nor the world, is all &quot;about me&quot; - its about the majority in which we all play a part of - I guess that where we differ most.<br>
<br>
As for you personally?  I don't know you - I have had two encounters with you - this one, and then another a few days later  where  I will openly say your group assisted in a CR - of course you scowled at me ect in emotes - but hey to each his own.  I still appreciate your groups assistance and truly wish none of this negativity had occurred. I have tried to let it go, but you refuse too.<br>
<br>
If you want to hate me because the rest of us agreed on the NBG roll, or because I spoke up to reveal the ENTIRE occurrance, so be it.  You certainly have that right, I don't agree with your tactics of what happened post that incident either.  Then again, my personal feelings aren't the deciding factor either.  What is? The group was called NBG, the group decided what was fair ( REMEMBER I DIDN'T GET CLOAK EITHER ), but I do follow whats pre-agreed upon and I don't go talking smack about someone just because they were the final recipient.  <br>
<br>
Again, all I can judge by is what I have encountered - from what another person posted, maybe your not a &quot;greedy fewl&quot; but what you showed me was just that, during that encounter.<br>
<br>
In closing, the group was announced NBG, the GROUP agreed in the decisions except ONE - that says something. THREE from this group have posted to these facts in response to your flame, and I wouldn't be surprised if the other 2 do as well.<br>
<br>
So, rogue, I am sorry you feel slighted - it still doesn't justify your actions in relations to said incident.  Do I hate you?  Nope.  Neither do I care to group with you after this ( of course I am sure that is quite mutual on your behalf as well, and its fully understandable).  Again, I would like to say I wish the negativity hadn't occurred.  I wish you well in your endeavors, but I stand by the groups decision.<br>
<br>
Be well all - take care  <p><img src=http://jalenyawns.homestead.com/files/vetronni.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvetronnidrakurion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vetronni Drakurion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(4/15/02 11:50:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Assassinated</span><hr size=1> <br>
Oh, Vipin...you lost me - just what has the 60 warrior been known for doing before that you are saying he repeated here?  He didn't say or do anything. I mean literally said nothing except answered FBSS when asked what haste items he had, and actually he didn't even offer that info, he was inspected, asked and confirmed, nothing more.<br>
<br>
Saryan made the call due to haste being main factor/stat for cloak as he was group leader in an NBG group, (tho it was put before the group for final if I remember right), all agreed due to haste factor, I was ML and handed it over when he won the roll. The cleric had done the actual invites and after the rogues incidents, reformed the group when he wouldn't calm down and endangered the group in anger because she felt she had no other choice - so tell me, what the hell did the warrior do wrong? I think you have something here confused...<br>

Another thing to remember folks is that punctuation is our friend.  Longwinded posts with no form of thought division give me a headache to read, and could in some situations lower my opinion of the poster.
