Drendal introduced me to Kenolein (who also plays Cadyenie/Atdaar) and after we hang around doing all sorts of crazy shit we decided to form our own guild. Thats when we created &quot;Honor Legends&quot;. <br>
<br>
I was GL and Drendal and Kenolen were the officers. Met some great people in HL like Keyath, Riphen, Fangorn, Dorax, Cadyenie, Jebnar, Kunglao, Fenlaorn, Eeventinee and Baedar between others. Stayed in HL till around lvl50 when I got tired of being part of a social guild, so I passed the leadership to keyath who proceeded to disband the guild.<br>
<br>
Joined Epic Heroes at lvl51 because I was sick of being guildless and couldn't get decent groups, met some great people there too. Stayed with them till lvl56. I left EH along with Hurk and other high lvls in the guild looking for greener pastures. <br>
<br>
I met Soulreever and Sammy in velks and they talked me into applying to EA, joined them at lvl56 and finally found family again in EQ. Stayed with EA for about 2 years where I finally retired.<br>

MRON was the first one i stayed with for any length of time, think it was 18 to 37.  That was when the mage guy was the head... umm what was his name?  Mildane became leader when i was level 20 and then i became an officer at level 21.  Left shortly before mildane stepped down for EH.  Stayed there from 38 to 62 and ~35 pre-planar AA points.<br>

Avatars of Tunare, which was totally uber at the time - Breowan was the Guild leader - I remember he had a Green Jade Broadsword and a Lammy and was level 40 - I was awed by his power. Taliana was the acting Guild leader because Breowan quit to join Fantasy, who at the time was one of the most uber of guilds (I believe In Virtue was #1 back then). We had some interesting raids in places like Permafrost and Splitpaw. I remember my friends Merlinian, Greyswander, Daddor and many others. As that guild matured, attrition set in and I de-guilded at around level 30 and joined - <br>
Raiders of Twilight with Estebar (Psycho) and many many cool people were there - Diabolous, Audacity, Gefling, Khardan, Lylliae and Joeb, Nisk, Stormhawk, Kalamon, Kone and Malathorn to name a few(oh yeah! and Allegra!). Everyone got tired of Estebar and 10 of us split off and formed Vengeful Dragons (Stormhawk came up with that name). We started that guild in Firiona Vie at the Paladin Trainer place.<br>
It was a good guild, but we just couldn't gain the teamwork needed to advance, despite Lots of great people (Astaren and I became friends there when we used to do the Frontier mountains cylce for uber lewtz together). I met Mukkrakk there and lots of other friends I have to this day. I left there feeling horrible, a month after Gefling and Khardan were thrown out for a bad reason and Diabolous and Daddor left for Promethian Order after being reprimanded for training newbs in Estate of Unrest - They claimed innocence). ( I should have gone with them in retrospect). Then I joined a guild called<br>
Razor's Edge with Riverdane - What a guy! He is the guy more into his character than anyone I ever knew. Good hearted and well meaning guy who just wants to have fun. I got along well with him and the others in that guild - Nizzre, Addonnicus, Malkar, Zullie, Talvarian and many others, Before and after the merger with Sacred Circle of Life - from the Alliance. I left to seek greener pastures after a silly disagreement.<br>
After that I think I joined the Carnival, under Furion's leadership and had a blast for the short time it lasted. One day after a Hate raid, Furion decided to fold the guild, rather than just turning it over to the officers - why I don't know, but we got together, tried to pick up the pieces and formed <br>
Arcane Odyssey, a guild that had Great potential, but never got off the ground because the GM's took like 2 weeks to make our guild official and we lost a TON of people who didn't want to wait. We limped along for about 3 weeks and folded from lack of members. Good folks, just not enough of us.<br>
After that, I went unguilded for a while and found it very Lonely until one day Wovoka asked me to apply to EA. I should have done that a year earlier and kicked myself for not doing so, but finally did about a year ago and have been here ever since as a Baby-eating killer! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sendaenea>Sendaenea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hstrial-kscavone.homestead.com/files/Sen_Avatar3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/2/03 2:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4494.topic&index=185>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hstrial-kscavone.homestead.com/files/Sen_Avatar3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you remember your first guild?</span><hr size=1> Consortium of Death, LOL Nanarie thought it would be cool to have a good race in the guild.

Wow, I haven't thought of them for a long time. I was the one who came up with the name (only I spelled it correctly, I think).<br>
<br>
And I don't remember the names of either of my first two guilds - one had Freedomborn/Warrdawn in it (still a friend) and the other had Skex (recently of PO) in it. I remember talking to Skex about this recently and he didn't remember the name either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
