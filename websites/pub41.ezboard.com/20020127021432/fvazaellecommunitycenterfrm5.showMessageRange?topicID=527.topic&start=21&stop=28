I  am currently lvl 52 and I agreed with the poster that it's lame to kill the questgiver or bossmob which ends the event. The people who do this as quickly as possible are only looking out for themselves because they want the &quot;phat lootz&quot;, and they could give a damn about anyone else.<br>
<br>
According to you, when someone complains, it's a whine, thus suggesting it has no merit. Just keep that in mind when you or your friends encounter something you disagree with. Somehow though I suspect your complaints will be viewed as valid.<br>
<br>
I think the suggestion that Verant designed these events poorly is wrong. Verant screws up a lot, but these events allowed the playerbase to either work together or screw each other over. The only complaint I have with Verant is that the zones like wc cannot handle the amount of players and people get disconnected and cannot relog until the event is over. <br>
  <br>
I have seen rampant ksing and members of so called &quot;uberguilds&quot; killing the bossmobs as quickly as possible to the dismay of most other players. I have also seen people working together by calling out locs of items and healing/buffing each other and trying to make the event last as long as possible for maximum enjoyment. It's interesting to see which camp people fall into, as I have already had to change my opinion of someone that was acting like a jerk.<br>
<br>
Those of you who say it's ok to kill and do anything you want because you can, I simply return your sentiment, FUCK YOU. You are the same people who will be leaving soon because you will be &quot;beating the game&quot; and finishing the so called endgame, and I couldn't be happier when you leave. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/4/01 12:11:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ah ok</span><hr size=1> I think I misunderstood what you meant, but this time I really think I've got it.<br>
<br>
Someone doing something to enable you and other low level players to get items = good. Mainly because the advancement of your items is what is important to you, and should be important to everyone on the server.<br>
<br>
Someone doing something because they want to, or because it helps them = bad. Mainly because they are not helping you.<br>
<br>
By not being Birch, I should forfeit my idea of having a first person perspective and try and see how I can change my attitude and playing style to be more in the interests of Birch.<br>
<br>
I want to apologize on behalf of all the people who have played eq and not taken up the Birch style of play. Please contact me when I can camp your epic mobs for you, powerlevel you, or destroy any kos mobs that might inconvienience you. If I am not online in Norrath, please leave me a message here so that I can login when you need me, Birch.<br>
<br>
I'd like to also ask that if anyone at Verant is reading this that they please implement a confirmation box when any npcs are attacked on Birch's screen so he can accept or decline that npc being fought, or maybe he can have a /acceptabletodie list where he can place mobs so it would be more convienient for Birch.<br>

If the mob(s) in question were meant for a certain level of player, why didn't Verant put a limit on the level of the characters in the zone(s) OR put a limit on the level of the characters who can actually attack the mob. Seems that the only limits were placed on who could get the no drop items. You would think the higher ups would have something better to do than to mess with some lowly boss mob (like in Karanna) but trust me, I've seen the uber guilds there killing the thing with one group... I know they didnt get anything good for killing it, so I don't know why they bothered. Let the little guys have some fun too? I guess if nothing is in place to stop them, they will do as they please - regardless of what anyone else thinks of them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/01 4:25:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gm event griefers</span><hr size=1> Bingo, Limber. VI was wrong to put phat lewt on the NPCs whose death could end the events in WC and NRo. They were closer to right in EK, where the big bad could be killed repeatedly. It was amazing the rumors going around about what you'd get for ending the event, though. I know people who've done it on other servers and tossed 200 people out of the event for ... an emerald. Whee.<br>
<br>
I'd rather these events were set up on a timer -- it ends in two hours no matter what before coming back again two hours later. It wouldn't be functionally different for the players, but it'd absolve the people solving the quest of the ill will of other players who, realistically, are getting better loot than some of them will ever see otherwise. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-banner-long.gif" height=60 width=468 alt="Whizbang Dustyboots" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uqxired.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 533<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/01 4:55:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://quarken2012.homestead.com/files/m-venom.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gm event griefers</span><hr size=1> Yes, I agree.
