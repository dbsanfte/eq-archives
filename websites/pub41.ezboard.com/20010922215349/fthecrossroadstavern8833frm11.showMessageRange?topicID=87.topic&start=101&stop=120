Fitz - where do you get your info?  I am so bored - out of work programmer and all.  I decided to check this out and do my OWN investigating.<br>
<br>
First off - this Syden person is a little odd.<br>
<br>
However, I checked on the IP thing and here is what I came up with.<br>
<br>
Esmeralda posted earlier on this site - IP was from a gateway from chicago.ameritech.net on the 64.108.192 net.  Syden posted every time under the dsl.net.  Investigating these I see that they are completely different ISPs.  I don't understand how you see these as being the same so I checked market coverage for Ameritech.net and dsl.net.  Much of their coverage area over laps so I checked Chicago since the ameritech domain actually breaks their DNS names into cities.  I see that in Chicago, Ameritech and dsl.net have coverage.  So... I decided to look at coverage a little closer.  Ameritech is primarily Chicago area - downstate Illinois, and Indiana.  dsl.net covers Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana - a much bigger area.  dsl.net is much more national than ameritech.net.<br>
<br>
Next, I checked the gateways and the traffic on those gateways.  The gateway reported by Syden had several thousand hits while the gateway Esmeralda has listed was more like a few hundred.  So it looks like there is a slim chance that these people are the same but not based on IP.  I am not sure where you got that.  Please let me know because I do this stuff for a living and I can't see how you got that information.  Inquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
As far as the SocialEngineer being the same person as Syden, I don't know, but their gateways are the same meaning they both live in the midwest.  I have not delved that far although it looks like Esmeralda didn't post much until March on the KEG board.  It looks like he posted under your guild members section so he definitely had access.  The IP address on those postings back then do not mach anything that I found now.  (If you are wondering how I saw stuff on your boards... don't worry about it.  I am merely helping you.)  It looks like he posted something about some web site not working and DSL something or other... It looks like there were very limited posts ANYWHERE using Esmeralda Tavyl prior to March of this year.<br>
<br>
Because I was bored, I dug a little deeper just because.  I also did some sloothing (sp?).  Esmeralda's EZ account began in November 2000 it looks like.  According to my info, this EZ board account was started before Esmer was out of the KEG guild.  Since the new owner came in in what looks like February or March of this year, how does he have access to an EZ board account created so long ago.  You mentioned he tried to sneak onto your boards.  It looks like whoever used to be in your guild with Esmeralda gave him the EZ board account information unless it was hacked.  This intrigued me so I looked even further into it.<br>
<br>
If I am boring you, let me know...<br>
<br>
Apparently the deal was this.  The original owner (I am basing this only on hypotheticals)  got the account info to the NEW owner AND gave him the passwords to your EZ board, AND gave him the EZ board account information.  This was really starting to inrigue me so i dug even DEEPER.<br>
<br>
The new Esmeralda admitted to some officers in KEG what the original owner was doing.  Apparently, the original owner wanted the legacy of Esmeralda to remain in KEG.  You guys must be an awesome guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So, in order to do that, he convinced the new Esmeralda to lie.  Obviously he couldn't do it because 2 weeks later he disbanded himself and wrote emails to people explaining what the deal was.  It sounds like it was the original owner plotting this if my information is correct and basing the evidence I have at hand.<br>
<br>
So, I talked to some people today to find out what people in the game knew.  Apparently whoever has Esmeralda now isn't even the person who had Esmeralda 4 months ago.  It looks like this character has been around!  My information I have is that whoever had Esmeralda last gave the character to his guild and the guild uses the character as a raid whore.<br>
<br>
So, after all this tiring slooth work I have done I have come up with some conclusions.  (Can you tell I am bored?)<br>
<br>
1) Esmeralda and Syden are not the same person.  Different ISPs, gateways, and IP addresses.<br>
<br>
2) Whoever got Esmeralda and tried to get into your guild was more &quot;convinced&quot; it was the right thing to until his conscience got the best of him and admitted the deal.  And besides, that character belongs to a guild now so now what....<br>
<br>
3) Don't believe everything you see on postings.  Everything can be found out and the truth will be known at some point.<br>
<br>
4)  EZ boards are not as secure as you think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usnootay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snootay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#333333>(8/22/01 4:26:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoA gets the Boner of the month award</span><hr size=1> Portege has more time on his hands than I do.<br>

s sad but I do have a lot of time at the moment.  My primary business is eBusiness consulting and we all know how slow that market is right now.<br>
<br>
But alas, I have some more information hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I wanted to do a little research on SocialEngineer and Syden connection just because <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
This was a hard one because both of the gateways matched.  As I mentioned before, this simply means that they used the same ISP.  No way to really tell if they are the same person.  So I thought about it to see if I could maybe puzzle this together.<br>
<br>
dsl.net provides service to many of the schools, libraries, and coffee shops in the Chicago area as well as Milwaukee, Indianapolis, and St. Louis.  They provide discounted service to the places that may not have the money to afford T1 or fractional but want the better of the 2 types of DSL.  In exchange, dsl.net gets to advertise.<br>
<br>
Now, there is a chance that SocialEngineer and Syden are the same people, but I think that is doubtful.  Looking at the posts, it seems to have a different tone.  Now, this would make all the sense in the world is Esmeralda and Syden were the same person because the owner of Esmeralda may have been feeling pressure about being Ebayed (oh and I am not saying this account was ebayed or not.  The evidence supports it but I could be wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - so Ill keep saying he is ebayed until proven wrong).  If so, it is conceivable that he posted something as one person and defended himself as another so that people in the game might look at Esmeralda differently.  Then I thought, it would have to be a really messed up person to really care what people in a game thought of them.  I have characters on several servers because... i have a LOT of time.  One character in particular has a very bad reputation.  He is an ass hole to put it lightly.  I role play him that way.  However, I could care less about what people say in game or on the boards.<br>
<br>
Being as how I am a computer geek and not a psychologist, I can't make any assessment here.  It looks like there is a possibility this would happen but even as much as I play, EQ is not that important.  I see many people taking it too seriously.<br>
<br>
My only concern is if SocialEngineer and Syden are the same.  If they both used libraries or coffee shops or maybe teach in a school, they could simply be living in the same area using the same gateway - it's entirely possible.  I know a lot of people that play EQ that live in the same area.  Looking at this board and KEG boards and a few others - it looks like there are many people that share ISPs in certain areas.  If I dug really deep I could probably figure out the general area of where you all live hehe.  However, I am really bored and I have wasted your time.<br>
<br>
I am not choosing sides here but I am always up for a challenge and I think Fitz needs to do a little more homework.  Any time I see someone mentioning IP stuff I HAVE to look into it and I am pretty goosd at what I do although not perfect.  Oh and please don't worry about me divulging any information about anything on the boards.  AS much as I like breaking into shit, I am not insensitive enough to share information so please do not ask me to do that or hack EQ accounts blah blah blah.  I will not do that - even though you would really be suprised how easy it is to do.  The only secret I would divulge is how to post anonymously to EZ boards that require you to register.  I don't do that because I have nothing to hide, but if you ever wanted to vent without letting people know who you are, lemme know.  I'll take care of you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukulvarian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulvarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#333333>(8/22/01 10:03:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoA gets the Boner of the month award</span><hr size=1> &quot;sleuth&quot; <p><table width="262" border="1" height="102" align="center">

<br>
Esmeralda has the exact same IP according to someone that is an admin of one of the board he/she frequents.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, all three accounts are showing up as the same IP. <br>
<br>
That is enough evidence for me to realize they are the same people, or at least posting from the same computer/LAN.<br>
<br>
Story closed.  I could spend time pointing out the obvious flaws of logic in your long winded search but I see no reason to.  I stand by what I said initially and add this...I would not be surprised that if I compared your ip to the other three I would come up with the same person as well!<br>
<br>
And if you wanna know where I live, just ask.
