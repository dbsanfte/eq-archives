How do I know that?  Because you still had the password to the board.  For that matter, is there anyone left on this server that DOESN'T have the password to our board?  If so, msg ghol or zozz and I'm sure they'll provide it, but that's a rant for another day.<br>
<br>
Not only did you still have the password, but you used that password to cut and paste something from the private board to the public board of your new guild on sullon.  After you left the guild.  That's how I'm sure you know damn well no such flame existed..<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, after you cut and posted that, you got flamed there too.  Then you were demoted from your officer position there and given a very stern warning not to be such a dumb bitch again or get kicked from the guild entirely.  Meanwhile, your new guild on Vazealle also gave you the boot.  And yet... you persist.  Give it up, you have been so thoroughly owned you're looking like a 2 bit whore the morning after the navy came to town. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usiggymk5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SiggyMk5</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/01 6:44:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=188.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/icon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Promethain Order -stay away-</span><hr size=1> Khar is among the most trustworthy people on this server, as well as being one of the most giving and tolerant.  ...and if he had flamed you, there wouldn't be a cinder left.  I see no reason to question either he or Keadaian in their assertion that no such thread exists.  <br>
<br>
But frankly, that's irrelevant.  What goes on behind the doors of a guild board after you've left isn't your business.  Period.  I know when I leave a guild I full-well EXPECT that guild to discuss me in their guild forum.  How else are they going to figure out what went wrong in a)their application process, that I originally got in and/or b)recent guild events and developments, that I would feel I needed to leave.  I don't expect it to be kind.  It should be honest... and honestly brutal.<br>
<br>
When you left PO was supposed to be the time when you took stock of your situation, cut your losses, and moved on.  The only proper message to make when leaving a guild is to post a message on their private board explaining why you chose to leave, and if you want to rant, do it there.  Lashing out at a guild you've left, and then refusing to back down when you've completely shredded your rep helps no one, except maybe Rajin, who gets his rant jollies....<br>
<br>
If you were wise, you would have learned from your mistakes (joining PO, which obviously wasn't a good fit for you) and helped PO learn from its (admitting you, when you weren't a good match).<br>
<br>
/sigh, if only natural selection was in real time... do something stupid and don't learn and adapt, die. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uskirm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skirm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/01 7:44:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=188.topic&index=165>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Promethain Order -stay away-</span><hr size=1> Man, this got to 150+ posts fast.

I don't know you at all in RL.<br>
<br>
I am extremely upset however at one thing that has occured on this board, and thats your comments regarding Khar. Giving Samir, Anika Keadaian and the others shit was stupid IMO, but when you called Khar a liar, I think you showed the kind of person you are in RL and in game. <br>
<br>
Khar is the type of person who would do just about anything to help someone out in EQ. The respect he has earned as a player is up there among the top people on this server. I think you can ask anyone from any guild or high level player that has grouped with him and find that without exception they would vouch for his characterand  group with him anytime. He has been there for me on many occasions when I have had problems. <br>
<br>
I have made many mistakes myself in this game, but always admit when Im wrong or screwed up. It's normal for people to make mistakes. It's how they behave after they make their mistakes that determines their moral fiber. I think you owe Khar a public apology. Anything less demonstrates your character or lack there of. <br>

<br>
I am always saddened by the death of a rant thread. <br>
<br>
This is my flame guideline, not very big but all I need. <br>
<br>
1. Address the issue at hand.<br>
<br>
2. Do not resort to being my 6th grade english teacher.<br>
<br>
3. Swear alot and use witty one liners *this might not win the war, but will take bystanders out the war when they spew coke all ove their keyboard*<br>
<br>
4. Do not make the main body of your post merely a quote, and add a weak sentence like, &quot;See Krimzin is an ass, I told ya!&quot; *oops I did that myself b4 didnt i? damn!*<br>
<br>
5. Never declare supremacy/ownage yourself. The mob rules here, and well you not all that sister *snap* *snap* *snap*<br>
<br>
6. Do not use Mike Reed witt to fight your war, ie, do not post back to the fuggin flame warrior definitions, if you can not think of a comeback,...step away from the mic because your 15 seconds are up.<br>
<br>
7. Do not argue with Zozz *dunno just running out of rules and needed to fill dead space with trivial junk* <br>
<br>
8. Have sense of humor and be able to laff at yourself. *please, if people I am like this in rl, man are they way off base, its not like we are curing cancer here, so have fun. Be a jerk, a mouse, a lamer, a gamer,...its all irrelevant. ie if your pc crashes and your eq-less for a month you will live!*<br>
<br>
9. No POLLS! polls = ghey. <br>
<br>
10. Don't be  poon!<br>
