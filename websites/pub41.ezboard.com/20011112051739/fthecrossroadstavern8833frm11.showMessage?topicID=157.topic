I've seen some of the best, funniest, hurtful and critical posts that don't at all use slanders, cuss words or slurrs. The only ones who feel the need to use those 3 generalizations in order to state a point are very misconstrewed. <br>
  Just annoying as I read through a nice clean thread of hot tempered flames and come across, &quot;BTW Like them explicatives? If this is a flame board learn how to fucking cuss.&quot;(1)<br>
 Flame board does not mean you are required to swear in every post you make, it just means your post lacks real content. In fact usually when the first few words I read are expletives I tend to skip them unless they come from a name-brand flamer who makes me laugh with them such as Mareth.  <br>
If you're going to use them, don't abuse them! I could care less if your post contains them but you better either get your point across with them and do it well or you better make me laugh. Otherwise don't bother. If you don't know the difference - use &quot;Spell Check&quot; and if it comes up with word not found and gives you another one to use like 'duck' don't use the origin of it.<br>

1. A quote from Daelem found here - <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessage?topicID=155.topic&index=8">ignorance.</a><br>
Out of 215 words (thank you Micro. WordCount) There were 14 expletives which wouldn't be bad except there are only 15 sentences! Also, a poor poor display of sentence format though I must give him credit for learning to capitalize proper names though most things NOT needing capitalization were and things that DID need it - were not. Better luck next time.  <p><hr>

those two statements or suggestions, whichever you prefer, have allowed me to come to the conclusion that you are in some way tryint to establish your own standards or &quot;rules&quot; (hence your brilliantly titled post). therefore im completely justified in showing you your flawed logic in that there are already rules set here and the irony is is that there arent any, except for expect to get what you give.<br>
so take your proper grammar, sentence structure, and capitalization and shove them right up your ass. <br>

Sorry I can't be all  educated  and shit like you are .  O NM I am bitch..( damn I cussed).   I like cussing, it frees my mind, it is something I can't do all day in my business.  I can do it here. Generally no one cares, after all this is a flame board.  I really  don't do it alot either.  I meant my comment to be funny to me,  not to you, others found it funney I think.  <br>
<br>
As far as ignorance goes. Your ignorance of the word's definition caused you to make a mistake.Not that I am picky about Gramar andword useage and shit.8^)  <br>
<br>
To put it in laymans terms for you.<br>
<br>
 Ignorance is not knowing how or what to do.  <br>
<br>
I think the word you were looking for is Stupidity.  <br>
Stupidity is knowing better but not careing.  <br>
<br>
Am I stupid, yeah , I often am. The majority of people are at times.  Am I ignorant? Naw.  I knew exactly what the fuck I was typing when I fucking typed it.<br>

So do you admit to your Ignorance of word usage? After all I believe a Male of the species corrected you.  <br>
<br>
 After all. I did admit to stupidity, but noted that it was intentional. Whereas you were to Ignorant to notice your own ignorance....next time you misuse the word ignorance you will fall under the catagory &quot; stupid&quot;.  After all I explained to you in simply terms its meaning.<br>
<br>
Also did you say I was attempting to force my foul language upon the enlightened viewers of this board?  No mam, I have no such priority in mind.<br>
<br>
But you, however  with &quot; Flame Board rules..&quot;, aperantly are trying to force feed us your standard.  Well i bite my thumb at you Adira Darling!  I could give a rats ass less what your rules are, cause frankly in the scheme of all things great and small in my life you are merely a source of profound amusement to me.  Just as surely am to you.<br>

As far as staring at your devilish picture I pondered it for abit.  But no,  I am sorry to say my nipples did not stiffen and nor did my manhood. <br>

<br>
Adira...I don't see your point at all. Seems you have a facination with proper gramar...go to school and get a degree.  If you have one then teach kids with it, but don't teach me, I think I am more educated than you can probablly ever hope to be. Its just that this, the Inferno is a flame board and means absolutely Jack Shit to an English teacher anywhere. I am not writeing essays ...I am not writeing for your fucking enjoyment. I am writeing for ME.<br>
<br>
If you don't like my Goddamn cussing, do what everyone did to Nymrals Posts...skip the motherfuckers.  In Fact the only reason I posted was because you mentioned me and no one else in your assault on improper gramar.   Maybe you like me or something...I'm not sure.  But I only serve my Root Tonic to those who grovel.  So on your knees. <br>
