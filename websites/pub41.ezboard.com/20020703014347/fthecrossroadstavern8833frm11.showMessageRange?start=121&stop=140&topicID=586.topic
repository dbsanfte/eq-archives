<br>
Just one thing though Aggy...<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that for myself, I do not in general like the British government due to the way they have treated the Irish and their refusal to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where exactly is it that you think Britain should leave? Northern Ireland? Did you consider that maybe they wish to remain British? I've been to both Eire and Northern Ireland, most of the people I met in NI are quite happy being British; I even stayed with a friend there who had a picture of the Queen up on the wall.<br>
<br>
Britain wants NI to be part of it, and NI wants to be part of Britain as far as I'm aware. Saying that we should give back Northern Ireland to the Irish is like saying America should give Alaska back to the Russians.<br>
<br>
The IRA are terrorists pure and simple; they can't get what they want through peaceful means, because what they want is a minority opinion, and so they resort to violence to get what they want. It's still wrong.<br>
<br>
Saying you side with the Irish against the British is almost as bad as if somebody told me they were siding with Osama Bin Laden against the Americans because a relative was killed in cave over in Afghanistan.<br>

<br>
Aye the obscure law is what was used against my uncle as I understand it, hell I wasnt there and never got to meet my uncle unfortunately.  I didnt get here by accident ya know &lt;G&gt;<br>
<br>
Xora--<br>
<br>
I think I stated pretty clearly several things, you taking my post out of context is what flaws your argument.  What I said was :<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that for myself, I do not in general like the British government due to the way they have treated the Irish and their refusal to leave, the fact that they have illegally murdered some of my family members using bullshit terrorist laws, and the fact that my immediate famiy was forced to move to this country rather than have a choice they deserved &quot;<br>
<br>
Pretty clearly this states that while I do having a problem with the British occupying land in Ireland (as it isnt their country after all is it?) that I had a certain disdain for the govt due to the fact that my family was forced out of Ireland (Eire not NI) and that the govt there killed my uncle for suspicion of terrorism.  Pretty clear to me, although maybe not you.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I said the following on my PERSONAL opinion of NI:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am fully aware of the differences in N.Irleand these days, and am very saddened by this as I personally think that Ireland should be one country and this is becoming more and more unlikely since as you say a lot of people there consider themselves British, Irish, Cath/Prot, whatever&quot;<br>
<br>
I think that the Irish were screwed in the deal that they signed with the Crown in regards to NI, they should have fought for the whole country but they let it go....a sad mistake on the part of Ireland.  Nevertheless, what do the Brits need in NI anyways? They arent there for jobs, exports or any other reason to be mean hateful fucks that I can tell.  I personally think they are there to run it in the faces of the Irish, again my opinion.<br>
<br>
I never said that I agree with the IRA, terrorism or anything else, killing people is wrong in most cases.  I do agree with the Sinn Fein in that Ireland should be a whole country, that will never happen, but I agree with a right of a people to have their own voice, that voice was made clear in the early 1900's by the Irish people and was ignored by the Crown until the Irish bombed, killed and maimed them to notice.<br>
<br>
Did you ever think that the people that are prefectly happy to be British now might just not know any fucking better?  It's liked breeding they are breeding the Irish culture out.<br>
<br>
Lastly, comparing this to Alaska is just stupid.  I am sorry but we PAID for Alaska.  I dont recall anyone in Ireland getting a dime for N.Ireland.  If that was the case there wouldnt be a gripe.  England took over Ireland and attempted to drive the Irish out....hardly the same thing.<br>
<br>
Its pretty clear why I am &quot;against the British&quot; Xora.  Stick to correcting my spelling mistakes if you must...at least you would have a more valid point. <p><BR><BR><B>Send /tells to Aggy and Fomhar cause I aint Aggro no mo and am too lazy to make a new EZBoard acct (but apparently not too lazy to make this dumb ass sig)</B>

<br>
I'm Currently US ARMY guard and have been on several annual training tours in germany and britain.  I could nto imagine people over there being any more willing to work and more high speed.  Everyone that i met while there treated the americans with the utmost respect.  I'm leaving on tuesday for ft benning georgia to attend Airborne and rip schools and then will be placed in ranger bat.  I can only hope that the people i get to meet in other parts of the world are as kind and respectfull as the people i met while in the guard. <br>
<br>
So to some it up SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU WHINY UNEDUCATED SON OF A BITCH. Nobody gives a fuck what you think you know and who you think you are the only thing you did in your post was show how a fucking bigot sees the rest of the world. You wanna talk some shit get your facts straight.  Respond if you will, i could give a  fuck less what you say i've said what i came hre to say.  <br>

Then he was either convicted/hung in 1047 for Treason ( last person hung ) - or was before 1964 - because these are the last 2 people to be executed in the UK - and they were executed in 1963 - <br>

I assume that you doubt my story...and since we dont even know one another that's fine.<br>
<br>
Grandparents moved here in late 30's/early 40's, uncle was &quot;executed&quot; in the early 70's from what I was told as a kid.  Last name was Conway but I dont see a single Conway on that list.  <br>
<br>
Unless I have been lied to my whole life (which being an Irishman is entriely possible LOL) I would assume that he wasnt &quot;officially logged&quot; if that makes sense.  I have no reason to doubt my grandparents in regards to this, I know that he wasnt killed in England, he was tried there and was killed somewhere on Irish soil. <p><BR><BR><B>Send /tells to Aggy and Fomhar cause I aint Aggro no mo and am too lazy to make a new EZBoard acct (but apparently not too lazy to make this dumb ass sig)</B>

If you're suggesting that he was found guilty in an English court and then taken to Irish just so that he could be executed... that violates UN law in a bit way. I just don't see how it could have happened.<br>

There are no better Oppressors in the world. Matter of fact, Gods little trick to keep them from taking over in a fortnight was to give them the Irish, Scots, and Welsh to deal with on the same little islands. Lucky for the Alaskans eh?<br>
<br>
 Here's another old joke, that gets trotted around the reenactments quite often. <br>
 Q: Know why the sun never set on the British Empire?<br>
 A: Because even GOD didn't trust the English in the Dark.<br>
<br>
 Now, being a bit of a History buff, I'll say this to the person who went off on the UK on the first page. Read your history. You'll find that we Americans are the only people whom the filthy French can ever claim they've liberated. That's right, Revolutionary War? Yeah that thing yer going on about how we kicked the English out of our country...nuh uh. Didn't happen that way fella. Hate to say it but if the Frenchies hadn't blockaded Chesapeake Harbor, Washingtons head would have been on a pike outside of Yorktown withing 2 weeks. Chilton was outside the harbor with another 20 thousand troops if I remember my numbers right, which would have countered Rouchambaue...however the hell you spell his name..'s forces. That's right, Mr. French-Doubting-General had an overwhelming portion of the army arrayed against England on HIS turf. 20k compared to Washingtons piddly 7k and Roachies forces were rested, well geared, and highly trained. Washington's men had just finished successfully running away from Lord Cornwallis for 6 months. &quot;Ran through the valleys and we ran'em through the hills, ran'em through the places that a rabbit wouldn't go&quot; was the song sung by the forces of a Mr. Nathaniel Greene. Known throughout history as the Only General to ever run away from EVERY Fight and still win the war. Because of Mr. Greene Cornwallis had lost more than half his forces in pursuit of Greene through Georgia, Carolina (all one state back then.), Virginia, and even the gods forsaken hinterlands of Tennessee. (Boo Vols)<br>
<br>
 What it all breaks down to, is Cornwallis was exhausted, and at 50% str, Washingtons forces lead by Greene were wiped out though still close to 80% str, and Roachie was at 100% str (better than 300% of the forces of Greene) and fully geared. The French Navy sat in Chesapeake Harbor denying supplies to the English encamped in Yorktown and blocking Chilton from sending any further troops into Yorktown to secure his hold on the city and the southern territories.<br>
<br>
 Shut yer yap, and just thank God the French went to Canada and left us alone.<br>
 One other note, RE: Hitler. You should grab your ankles and offer your ass to Churchhill, if it hadn't been for that ugly bastard we'd ALL be Goosestepping around. HE cried wolf and by god when Hitler finally started moving Churchhill got to say I told you so! America was operating on isolationism. &quot;If it's not over here, it won't hurt us.&quot; That'd have lasted as long as it took the germans to perfect their missle technology. (Note: ICBM...roots in German WWII era Missle Tech)<br>

Asking to start a popularity contest in the polls section? That's the most pathetic attempt at a bluff I've ever heard. Saying I'm impartial is not only pointless, but is also, for lack of a better word, simply stupid. I'm impartial simply because of my guild affiliation with Mystykal? You're impartial by your dislike of her.<br>
<br>
Whoever you think you are, you are no one special. Your little &quot;Popularity&quot; poll won't dissuade that either way. I personally don't give a fuck if other people like you or not -- you still aren't the icing on a cake. And what the fuck does popularity have to do with ANYTHING, anyway?<br>
<br>
And as a side note, drop the /gofuk crap. That's DH's thing, if you will, and you only make yourself more foolish trying to gain popularity -- that thing that means nothing -- by using the term. <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~timharron/tarv.jpg"><br><b>Tarv Kanadae</b><br><b><i>SUPA TWINKED UBER ARMOR WEARING EVERQUEST ADDICT (((with his epic)))
