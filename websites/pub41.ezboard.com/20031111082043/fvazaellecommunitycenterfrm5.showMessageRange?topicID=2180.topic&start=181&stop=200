<br>
Yep, I firmly believe in no touching unless you are touched.  You said yourself you get bothered and wonder why he isn't touching.  Whether you realize it or not, this piques your curiosity, and potentially, your interest.  <br>
<br>
It's not that I'm being sheepish, or &quot;respectful,&quot; I'm simply giving women what they want: a little bit of challenge and excitement.  When it's apparent to me that she's interested, via light touches on the arm, sustained eye contact, personal questions, standing close to me with an expectant look at the end of a date, whatever... THEN I make my move, with no small amount of enthusiasm.  <br>
<br>
Once I know we're in the same ball park, then I'll start making moves and taking more control-- albeit, slowly.  <br>
<br>
This way, it's more climactic, exciting, and dare I say it, romantic for the woman.  <br>
<br>
The fact that it bothers you or strikes you as somehow &quot;weird&quot; is precisely why I behave with this kind of posture.  It helps me weed out the ones who aren't really interested while making making it more exciting and interesting for the girls who are.<br>
<br>
The fact that I'm asking for your phone number, calling you, and taking you on a date should be indication enough I'm interested.  It's no mystery.  I know YOU know if a guy is interested in you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Remember, I can't make a girl like me. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I can only work with what's there.  If her interest in me is below 5 from the get-go, there's zero chance it's every getting above that, no matter what I do.  You can't make wine from bad grapes.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and yes, despite the fact that I'm all about crazy jungle monkey sex on the first night, it doesn't contradict my belief in going slow.  For me, and the people in my little slice of western culture, sex doesn't equate to the desire for continued dating and relationships.  Therefore, I can still have sex with someone on the first night, yet still go slowly thereafter with no pressure.  <br>
<br>
In those awkward hours after, I keep it light and funny with no mention of the future.  I'll get her phone number and say good-bye.  If I'm interested, I'll call her a few days later, making sure she has her own time and space. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raiyaeq>RaiyaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1144<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/03 1:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=183>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: easy to understand</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>maybe it is just me, but i definitely prefer a guy making the moves, flirting, touching, and not being afraid to show his interest before me holding up a big flashing sign that says it is ok.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I think most of the girls perfer guys make the first move.  I know I would never touch Ayiar if he didn't make the first move.  Different cultural background might have something to do with it.  I just know, no matter how cute this guy is or how much I want to be his gf, I would never touch him before he makes the move.<br>

Normally this won't happen until you've seen each other few times and there's a great chance you'd be a couple.  If any girl ask you about this on the first 3 dates, she's strange.

I'm not talking about tearing up and confessing undying love.. more so just letting her know &quot;I like you and want to spend more time with you&quot; or something of that nature. Flattering, yes.. premature, not in my opinion.<br>
<br>
I can be shy on dates if I'm attracted to a man, so the option of touching him or making a move doesn't always come easily for me. Does this mean I would feel smothered if he put his arm around me at a movie? Touched my arm as he opened a door? Gave me his coat? No.. I'd be flattered, and it would do wonders to ease my uncomfortable feelings. Would it discourage me from continuing the relationship if he made these kinds of gestures? Not at all.<br>
<br>
If a man doesn't show me attention, I start to wonder.. I feel it's entirely natural to be dating someone and to feel their touch, or to hear it out loud is only going to put my mind at ease. I think I've ended a few relationships due to the man waiting (and waiting and waiting..) to show some signs that he was interested.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe most healthy, lasting relationships come about gradually, with no pressure on either person. Besides, it's always more fun to gradually discover someone. Would you want to know the whole plot of a movie in the first 2 minutes?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure, I can agree with that.. but being excited and giddy about dating someone new ended years ago for me. More often then not, if I'm dating him chances are I'm liking him, too. So admitting he feels the same is okay for me. Relationships should progress naturally, and if you prefer your feelings in the open, go for it.<br>
<br>
I've recently had someone tell me that they have a crush on me.. am I scared? No.. flattered, yeah. Am I interested in a relationship? Of course, I was already in one with him on a different level, but how would I have known otherwise?<br>
<br>
&quot;Had I immediately divulged my feelings and professed my &quot;like&quot; for her, I can guarantee she'd be a little weirded out by that, and preclude any chance of taking the relationship further.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not this woman.. but I agree there are other ways to show interest in a woman. Personally, saying it in addition to the other things you've mentioned doesn't &quot;weird me out&quot;. <br>
<br>
Perhaps it's due to the fact that I haven't had a single female friend since grade school, and I have several close friends that come to me when they're having issues in their relationship.. and I can realize that men in general have a lot of anxiety about dating, and saying (or not saying) the right things to a woman.<br>
<br>
I can easily overlook a man coming on too strong, but if he does, I will be letting him know to slow down.. which isn't saying I don't care about him. A lot of younger men seem to do this, but in general, the men I date are 5+ years older then I am, so I don't usually see this.<br>
<br>
I think saying &quot;I like you&quot; is okay... &quot;I love you&quot;, now that I'd feel some pressure for. I agree. It depends on how comfortable I am with a man, and if I'm feeling the same. It's honestly been a very long time since I've felt in love with someone, but in the past I can't remember telling a man I've been in a relationship that. <br>
<br>
Friendships, yes.. I have several friends that I love, and they've said the same to me. It doesn't pressure me into feeling they want more of a relationship.<br>
<br>
&quot;See, women possess an instinctive grasp of men's interest level in them.&quot;<br>
<br>
If this is true, what harm could admitting it be? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;In this culture, men assume the role of the pursuer and accept rejection as a possibility. Women, on the other hand, (surprise, evolution at work) get hit on all the time and can therefore be a bit more choosy. They have to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep, hit counter reached about 8 this week. Although one was a woman, so ^_^ not sure that would count in this discussion.<br>
<br>
For me, if a man tells me he likes me, compliments me, wants to spend more time with me, calls me.. that gives me a clear sign that he's interested. Often being shy, I really do prefer to hear it. It also sorts out which ones are interested in me for reasons I don't enjoy being pursued for, such as a one night stands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive the length of this post, and please stop if you're tired of my lecture.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's np <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Gives me something interesting to read until I go home.. but I'm finding myself disagreeing with most of what you're saying. I'm an individual that *prefers* things to go naturally in a relationship.. if a man wants to say he likes me and enjoys my company, okay <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I'm a type of woman that's a little shy and a man being clear on his intentions puts me at ease much more so then being aloof.. and most likely if he holds back, I'll lose my interest. I enjoy a man that can take control in most situations and would be much more comfortable if he did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uninterested women will not touch you. Do not touch them first. Contrary to popular belief, it actually makes them subconsciously uncomfortable and less likely to touch you back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Untrue for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Take my hand when we walk.. smile a lot, put your arm around me if it's chilly out. This is all okay. When I'm interested in a man, it's *okay* for him to make a move. And if I'm not interested.. you wouldn't be getting a call from me anyway, so what is there to lose? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;She asks you personal questions. This means, beyond the usual boring &quot;So, what's your major and where are you from?&quot; chit-chat. She will ask questions about past relationships, things that involve your feelings and emotions. This signifies she is interested in getting to know you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do this with nearly all of the people I am interested in, as friends or otherwise. Good conversation is hard to find, so I'll get it where I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But being one sided? No.. ask me questions, show an interest in me, too.. please.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Smile and nod, say, &quot;Ok, maybe.&quot;  Remember, slooooow doowwwn.&quot;<br>
<br>
That'd work for me.. but say it with some interest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Calling once a day is too much. Take it easy, boy. Every other day might even be pushing it...&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure, space is nice when you're just getting to know someone.. if you spend too much time with someone, in general, it gets to be a strain on the relationship. But calling.. ^_^ I like to chat, so once a day, or every other day or so is just fine. Or I really prefer to hear from someone just as I'm going to bed.. it's always nice to say g'night.<br>
<br>
&quot;No references to exclusivity. Even if she's the only one you want to be with, don't make mention of it. She'll figure that out based on your actions, not your blubbering Romeo and Juliet soliloquy. There's no need to try and make her think you're seeing other people, because that's deceptive. Just enjoy your time together, and don't make references to other girls. If she asks what you did last night, answer simply, honestly, and without elaboration or justification.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can agree to most of that, but if a man wants to be in a relationship like that, it would be much better for him to tell me. I can at times be a bit of a flirt, and if I was in a relationship, it usually gets toned down a lot out of respect for the man I'm with. How would I know unless he tells me that he's wanting that kind of relationship with me?<br>
<br>
I believe in keeping friendships during a relationship, even when it's another woman. However, a recent relationship has made me afraid that dishonesty is a lot more common then I'd first considered. Where there were little signs, I tried to give the benefit of the doubt.. but something wasn't quite right when she was referred to an &quot;old friend&quot; he'd met long before he'd met me, then seeing her refer to meeting him on a date weeks after we had. In the end, it turned out he was pursuing several other women at the same time as me.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for me, I'm in no rush for a relationship, but for now.. I am comfortable with hearing as well as seeing when someone is interested. I've been single without a serious relationship for nearly 3 years now. I'm content, and have no problems living or being alone.. I have cat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  he keeps me warm np.<br>
<br>
I'm sure the advice you're giving is wonderful for most women.. just not for me.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.edenproject.org/~elafount/sepha/images/gallery/sephasig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
wyndigo - i don't see how me saying i found it annoying supports your opinion that it is a good thing and women like it. i didn't like it. :P just because we are together now doesn't mean that has anything to do with why i am with him.<br>
<br>
i've experienced guys being more open about their interest and not afraid to show me, i liked that a lot better. it made me feel good. it didn't creep me out. <br>
<br>
i like how the girls on this board can say one thing, and guys are still like &quot;that isn't REALLY what you mean, THIS is what you REALLY want&quot; :P<br>
<br>
and you may not be doing it out of respect, wyndigo. never said that was your reasoning and i did not assume it was. i was referring just to how my boyfriend was with me, i definitely know it wasn't to keep me challenged. we were friends before we started dating. i didn't feel &quot;challenged&quot; , if anything it made me feel insecure and question his interest. but now i know he was just afraid. shrug...<br>
<br>
don't assume all women know when someone is interested, any more than a guy would. especially when guys are being told to not show it... we aren't mind readers.<br>
<br>
but if that is what works for you, leave it all up to the woman to let you know she likes you before you make any moves, i am sure it is safer that way. but don't assume that is what we want, either.<br>
<br>
i agree with a lot of what sepha said, applies to myself too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blargon>Blargon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/03 5:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Only Guy</span><hr size=1> Sepha, I understand your point of view and respect it, but the one thing that bugs me is, this way of being a woman is extremely common in the country that I live in (US).  So common in fact that there's hardly any room for shy guys.  I mean, girls go on and on about how they're shy so the guy should show all his cards, but if he's shy, he's out of luck, right?  Anyway, I'm just glad I met my gf.  She professes to be shy but is so inherently expressive (heart on the sleeve type) that I knew right off what made her tick and had a pretty good idea of what she wanted.  That's why I'm with her.  It took a *hell* of a long time to find her.  I just barely stuck to my guns through all of it, but will continue to now and forever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2047<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/03 6:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=188>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Only Guy</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i like how the girls on this board can say one thing, and guys are still like &quot;that isn't REALLY what you mean, THIS is what you REALLY want&quot; :P<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is because the first hundred or so times we actually listened to the woman and believed her, we found it didn't work.  Most guys when they are young start out by believing women.  As time passes, and we gain more experience, we learn that the surest path to doom is to take a woman literally.<br>

It's always better if the woman brings it up first.  Let me put it another way, which I can guarantee you won't like.  In a relationship, the one with the lower interest level has more control and power.  <br>
<br>
In my current relationship, my girlfriend was the one who brought up &quot;the talk&quot;, mostly because I never approached the subject.  She knew I was very into her, but I never brought it up, and she didn't like wondering if I was dating other girls (I wasn't, but did she really need to know that?), so she popped the question, so to speak.  <br>
<br>
The main reason that the girls on this board don't like what I'm saying is that everything I'm telling guys to do gives power back to the men and forces women to risk a little rejection for once.

There are so many wonderful and intelligent women out there.. if one is going to reject you for playing these games (holding back your emotions, waiting to touch her, waiting to call her..) I can see why. I would likely do the same, but if you are finding women and having quality relationships with them, good for you. When you're looking for someone and dating often, do whatever works for you.<br>
<br>
I'm going to continue to keep an open mind and understanding of how emotional and eager men *really* are when they're dating someone, and if they happen to do something you don't agree with.. it might work with a woman like me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
