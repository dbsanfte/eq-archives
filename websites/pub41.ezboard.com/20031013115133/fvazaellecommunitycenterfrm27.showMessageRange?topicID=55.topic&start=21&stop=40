<br>
The lair of Terris Thule.<br>
<br>
Terris still lay on the ground where Camille had seen her last, dress shredded around her, soaked in caked blood. Most of the puddles of blood had reduced themselves to dry dark stains on the floor. Terris' wounds were all gone, without a scar, but she did not move.<br>
<br>
~~dismount~~ came that disembodied voice, but now with some direction. It was coming from Terris herself.<br>
<br>
Camille, for the first time since the insane journey had begun, loosened her leg muscles and released her grip on Brimstone's mane. She half slid, half fell off the horse, exhausted, every sinew screaming. She landed uneasily on her feet, and then just slid abruptly to the ground, panting. She feared she would never walk again.<br>
<br>
Slowly, painstakingly, Terris rolled over, without a sound of rustled cloth, to lay on her side and yet look upon Camille. The goddess' breast heaved as her nostrils flared out and in, taking in air. Her huge dark eyes scrutinized the sprawled out paladin, dressed only in her sleeping gown, still clutching her husband's sword.<br>
<br>
For a long time they just contemplated each other silently.<br>
<br>
~~you are a strong woman, to have survived that~~<br>
<br>
&quot;So are you,&quot; Camille remarked, looking at the dark stains on the ground.<br>
<br>
~~i am a goddess, i will never truly die, until the day mortals finally succeed in their little dream of conquest, and kill us all in the plane of time ~ then they can see how they like a world with no gods ~ akethadar and his dogs did not kill me, just my avatar, and slowly, over time i will be whole again ~ and then i suppose they will be back, as mortals always are ~ although i imagine akethadar will not be leading the next set, no no~~ and the sound of a chuckle that chilled Camille.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you drive Akethadar mad?&quot; Camille asked bluntly.<br>
<br>
~~me?~~ Terris asked, actually surprised, ~~i wouldn't touch that man's mind even if the nameless commanded me to ~ no, camille wyldechylde, the only mind i have touched in quite a while has been yours~~<br>
<br>
&quot;The dreams. You sent them to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~yes ~ garbled at first as i was weak, very weak ~ later stronger ones, and finally, the will to have the horse bring you here~~<br>
<br>
&quot;If you didn't read Akethadar's mind, why the statue of River?&quot; Camille asked, so many questions bouncing around in her mind. &quot;How would you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~ah, the statue~~ Terris said, ~~it was here for the last year ~ where did you think your husband's soul went, to innoruuk? ~ in the end he chose me to worship~~<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.&quot; Camille said shortly, hurt in some undescribable way, unable to stop a pang of jealousy from striking her heart. Terris picked up on it.<br>
<br>
~~ah, you mistake the term worship, mithaniel's handmaiden ~ when faced with which plane his soul would reside in, he chose me, for whatever effect our business with end game had had on him ~ but, from the state of his dreams when he was here, he dreamed of you ~ only you~~<br>
<br>
Camille didn't know whether Terris had said that to appease her or was speaking the truth, but the words acted as a salve for her pained heart. But still her question was unanswered.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you erected a statue of him here?&quot; Camille asked, confused.<br>
<br>
~~no~~ Terris replied, ~~that was no statue of any rock known to man ~ that was a soulcasing, my own creation ~ you saw my gargoyles, they are of the same stone~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Soulcasing.&quot; Camille said blankly.<br>
<br>
~~yes, my other four worshipers, yes, only four, were all demons, and thus their likenesses as grotesque ~ the soulcasing can hold the living soul that exists after the body dies~~<br>
<br>
&quot;So when River died,&quot; Camille said, hope lighting her face as stared at Terris. &quot;He did not die?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~yes, and no~~ Terris said. ~~the soul if preserved will never truly die, so while his time among mortals was done, he lived on dreaming in the soulcasing i provided for him ~ in times of dire stress, i wake the dreamers to protect me, but river ~~~ would not ~ you saw that~<br>
<br>
&quot;I saw.&quot; Camille replied, recalling the dream.<br>
<br>
~~he suspected that i would eventually survive the attack, while promethian would not ~ even against his sworn enemy he would not attack with the strength the soulcasing would have lended him~~<br>
<br>
&quot;River didn't hate Akethadar.&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
~~but akethadar hated him ~ oh how he hated him ~ and grieg saw that, saw the statue in akethadar's mind, even as he died, and jumped on it~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Grieg.&quot; Camille said, seizing upon the name to change subjects to more of her questions. &quot;Where does he fit into this?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~grieg veneficus was a brilliant geomancer, the top of his class ~ long ago his studies with the magic inherant in stone and earth allowed for travel to luclin, where he brought the combine ~ when he failed to discover a route back in timely fashion, however, he was spurned, and forced into his castle to discover a route back ~ but luclin the deity was enjoying the new additions to her little world, and drove grieg mad in his home, and set up clever mind-altering guardians to guard both him ever leaving his castle and anyone entering ~ the insanity also had the unusual side effect of keeping him alive long after he should have died, as his body rotted and changed into a blobbish purple mass ~ grieg festered like an open wound in his home while others finally found a way to open a two way portal to the moon, and was forgotten ~ but he never forgot the outside world, or the wrongs they had suffered upon him~~<br>
<br>
Slowly Terris propped herself up into a sitting position, and continued.<br>
<br>
~~over the years of his imprisonment, grieg had still worked on his experiments, but now for his own dark purpose ~ one of these was the creation of a blue gem that he called the geomancer's stone ~ the gem was part prison, part battery~~<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Camille cut in.<br>
<br>
~~patience, mithaniel's handmaiden~~ Terris shhed her, then went on as Camille fell silent, more questions dying on her lips. ~~the geomancer's stone could act as a housing for a soul without a soulcasing, to preserve the soul, very similiar to what the statue of riverdane could do ~ and once a soul was inside it, could be used as a power source for mechanical devices, drawing on the lifeforce of the soul within, consuming it as it magnified that lifeforce to energy many many times the size of the actual soul ~ eventually, the soul would be snuffed out, but the power output would be astronomical~~<br>
<br>
&quot;My dreams.&quot; Camille said, face pale, &quot;River....is in that gem.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~yes~~ Terris confirmed. ~~when akethadar killed grieg, grieg tapped his mind and saw the statue, and knowing more about stone than any other living man, knew the soulcasing for what it was ~ he planted the seed of insanity into akethadar's brain, like a parasite, and then escaped with his own soul into the geomancer's stone, and waited ~ waited for akethadar's mind to be eaten away, and to answer the hypnotic order greig had placed in him ~ to deliver the statue to the moon ~ grieg's servants, local natives whom grieg's magic had bound and twisted, recovered the statue and brought it to the geomancer's stone, where grieg, powered with insanity and taking riverdane quite by surprise, forced riverdane's soul out of the soulcasing and took his place ~ river, having no other place to go, slipped into the geomancer's stone~<br>
<br>
&quot;River...&quot; Camille said helplessly.<br>
<br>
~~is trapped~~ Terris continued. ~~now grieg has a form that can move and is nearly indestructable in one on one combat ~ and riverdane is trapped in the geomancer's stone, unable to leave, with nowhere to go ~ and freedom is not the only thing grieg wanted ~ he is currently working on another experiment, and i suspect he intends to use river's soul to power it ~ grieg's mind is too twisted to read, and he does not dream, not for even a second ~ the insanity luclin placed on him ate any capacity he had for dreams ~ so i do not know what the madman is planning to do, only that river's soul is in great peril, and knowing grieg's insanity, so are a great many more~~<br>
<br>
&quot;River was trying to tell me something. YOU were trying to tell me something!&quot; Camille exclaimed, panic in her tone. &quot;What does 'Avenge' have to do with this? Avenge River? You?&quot;<br>
<br>
Terris stared blankly at her. ~~avenge?~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; Camille said with frustration. &quot;In the dream, River said 'Avenge', 'Venge'; you, YOU said 'Venge'!&quot; But Terris just continued to stare at her with no comprehension in her eyes. Then suddenly, Terris' eyes narrowed a moment.<br>
<br>
~~ahh, no, not avenge~~ Terris said. ~~it never fails to amaze me how you mortals hear things and don't hear, twisting things to suit what you think they mean ~ the word i wanted you to hear was vven~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Ven?&quot; Camille asked, confused.<br>
<br>
~~two v's~~ Terris sighed.<br>
<br>
Camille's mouth dropped open, as she began to understand. &quot;Vven? The enchanter that helped River during End Game?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~yes~~<br>
<br>
&quot;How does Vven figure into this at all?&quot; Camille asked, confused again.<br>
<br>
~~when your husband and his companions were here, i opened up his mind, to read his past and his intentions ~ his friends suspected i was also picking through their minds ~ and they were right ~ i remember a fragment from vven of a meeting at some point in his life with grieg, a flash in time, but i remember it ~ enough so for me to believe that vven psyphon may have more information on grieg's intent, even though the teir'dal may not realize it himself ~ seek him, and find answers~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Terris.&quot; Camille said softly, reaching out to place her palm over the goddess' massive hand. Terris allowed it, an odd look in her eyes at the woman's touch of sisterhood. &quot;Why? Why did you tell me all this?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~you love him~~ Terris said after a pause. ~~a year ago, riverdane wyldechylde helped return my love to me~i am repaying that favor~~ A pause and then, ~~and he was the only mortal other than demons to choose me~~<br>
<br>
Camille nodded, understanding. Then her eyes suddenly brimmed with tears. &quot;And the dreams, River talking to me, holding me....was that really him or...?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~that was me~~ Terris said sadly. ~~trace memories from him lending me script for the dream ~ i am sorry i made you think he was speaking to you~~<br>
<br>
Camille wiped her eyes as that sunk in. Knights don't cry. &quot;Thank you all the same. Even in a nightmare, it helped keep him alive for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~mount the horse, mithaniel's handmaiden~~ Terris said gently. ~~i promise you safe passage back to your home~~ She laboriously drew herself from her feet, and lifted Camille up like a doll to place her on the back of Brimstone, still clutching River's sword. Then Terris passed her hand in front of Camille's eyes.<br>
<br>
~~sleep~~ Terris intoned, and Camille collapsed weakly against Brimstone's neck, deep in slumber. Terris sent her magic out into the woman to keep her from sliding off.<br>
<br>
~~sleep, camille wyldechylde, and for your lost nights in my nightmares, dream of what you wish~~ Terris commanded the paladin in her nightdress, sword hanging from one limp hand. <br>
<br>
~~bring her safely back to the stables, brimstone~~ Terris said quietly.<br>
<br>
--YES, MISTRESS.-- the horse whinnied, unable to disobey. Terris slumped weakly to her knees, the whole conversation having drained more out of her than she would have preferred.<br>
<br>

<br>
Her nose wrinkled at the thought, as she lifted an armored foot out of the sand and plodded through the featureless desert of North Ro.<br>
<br>
Camille Stunqueen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eww.&quot; she said out loud. &quot;Appropriate but eww....&quot;<br>
<br>
A passing sand scarab clicked on by, and she regarded it for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need a surname!&quot; she mock plead.<br>
<br>
-clickclickclick- the sand scarab clicked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Clickclick.&quot; Camille tried. &quot;Sorry, Mr. Scarab, catchy but no.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was nineteen years old, and at the point of her training with the Knights of Truth in North Freeport was reaching the level where she could choose a last name. Easier said than done.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to be Camille Spelldancer all my life.&quot; she sighed, marching across the dunes. &quot;I'm not even a caster!&quot;<br>
<br>
True. Her parents were both pure casters, and were secretly, she suspected, horrified that she had decided to become a melee. But for most of her childhood, she had watched the Knights of Truth jousting and training with the look of hero worship in her eyes. And then into her tumulent teens, and the handsome blonde knights with their razor short hair and piercing blue eyes and shining armor. She had giggled like a typical teenage girl with her friends, watching the knights battle in training sessions. But then, when she hit sixteen, she stopped giggling, and started watching closer. Her other friends disappeared, as she began staying at home more, practicing with a stick feints and parries, to the growing distress of her parents. And a year later, on her seventeenth birthday, she marched into the recruiting office of the Knights of Truth and signed on. And her life changed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Bladeweilder.&quot; she tried lamely.<br>
<br>
Now she was one of those 'knights in shining armor'. And she learned something, being part of them, training with them. They were just boys, just like the others her age. Immature, some of them mean, some of them stupid. And they all treated her, during the training sessions, like a...well...like a girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Dlere.&quot; she tried. Double ewww. Wouldn't he just LOVE that.<br>
<br>
She quickly tossed away the thought of taking on the surname of one of Freeport's most talented knights, Lucan Dlere. He was excellent in training, but he was so....full of himself. He knew he was good, and didn't let any of the other knights-in-training forget it. And when she and he sparred, he let her win, every time, even though she begged him to make it a fair fight. But he just laughed at her, and would fall onto his rump and plead for mercy. He had it in his head to make her his wife when they were older, that she knew. But ever since he tried to touch her where he shouldn't a year ago at the May Festival, she had avoided him like the plague.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Weaponmis....&quot; she began, and then blinked.<br>
<br>
Sand straight ahead.<br>
<br>
Sand to the left.<br>
<br>
Sand to the right.<br>
<br>
Sand behind, and the sun having sunk down to the point where she could not tell where it had been.<br>
<br>
It was growing dark, and there she was, lost somewhere in the middle of North Ro.<br>
<br>
'Oh no...&quot; she whispered, distraught.<br>
<br>
She was lost again.<br>
<br>
Camille had never had a sense for direction, but with the sun to guide her, when the Knights of Truth had impressed upon her a mission to head to the first dervish outpost in North Ro and ascertain if a dark elf was indeed in charge of operations, she had readily set out. And now she was lost, daydreaming the day away and screwing up the first important task the Knights had asked her to perform. She sat down abruptly in the sand, looking helplessly around her, when hot salty tears suddenly found their way to her eyes. Frustration fueled her as she wept.<br>
<br>
&quot;What now, knights don't cry.&quot; came a voice from the side, startling her to her feet and surprising her tears to a halt.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't crying!&quot; she lied hastily, examining the young man who stood atop a dune looking down at her.<br>
<br>
He looked like no knight she had ever seen.<br>
<br>
Long black hair, as long as hers, fell across his forehead and down past his shoulder in the back. A straight handsome nose, with the shadow of hair underneath it, unshaven. Lips in an amicable smile, and eyes, eyes so black they seemed to look right through her. Long lashes, almost....pretty, she would wager, made those eyes something to behold. But his armor! No bracers or gauntlets, patchwork leather arms, a chain tunic with some of the links broken, leather boots, tarnished plate leggings, and a dented sheild. The only thing quality in his attire was the Knights of Truth regulation long sword, which was sheathed at his side. She recognized the insignia on the hilt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah,&quot; he said, eyes taking her in. &quot;Forgive me, miss. Must have been sand blown in your eyes.&quot; The fact that there was no wind did not escape Camille, but she took his opportunity for an out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; she said, removing a steel gauntlet and wiping her eyes free of tears. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You can call me River.&quot; he said. &quot;And you are...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille.&quot; she replied, curiosity in her rising. &quot;You carry a longsword from the Knights of Truth, yet I have never seen you in the guildhouse....River.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, this.&quot; he said, glancing down at the weaponry. &quot;A gift from my father for my twentieth birthday. Beats the old rusty short sword I used to use.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your father bought it from the Knights for you?&quot; Camille asked with a frown. That was unheard of.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; River said with a laugh. &quot;It was his, before he upgraded. My father is Dane, one of the Knights.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille surpressed a gasp. She had had a childhood crush on Dane that time had erased. But this long-haired ruffian looked nothing like the blonde, blue eyed Dane who did much of the Knights external affairs work.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did not know Dane had a son.&quot; she remarked casually.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not many do, my father is a private man.&quot; River said. &quot;My mother died in childbirth bringing me into the world, and he has kept to himself since.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Camille said truthfully, but the young man shrugged it off. Then more questions from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;So why have you not applied to the Knights?&quot; she commented. &quot;You could get some real armor and...&quot;<br>
<br>
River laughed suddenly. &quot;I don't think I would make a good Knight.&quot; he said. &quot;I make do with what I can buy or find. You don't like my outfit?&quot; And he turned, posing, self mockery on his face. She had to smile. &quot;Anyway, my father trains me at home, and as he upgrades, I'll get some of his old pieces.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what is that bit of dirt under your nose?&quot; she asked coyly, pointing at the unshaven hair above his lip.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, that.&quot; River said, face going red. &quot;That, my lady, is a moustache, if it ever grows in. My father says with my long hair I am looking more like my mother each day, so I am growing it to stop torturing him. I think he would prefer I cut my hair, but...no chance there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It IS an odd look for a man.&quot; she remarked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm an odd man.&quot; he grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have a surname?&quot; she asked suddenly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; he said. And left it at that.<br>
<br>
&quot;You do?&quot; she asked in surprise. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wyldechylde.&quot; he said, a little embarassed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wyldechylde!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How...odd.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm an odd man.&quot; River repeated with a selfconscious smile. &quot;My father used to call me that, remarking on my tendency to throw away the rules of combat when we sparred. I took it half as a joke, but....it seemed fitting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very bold of you, to take a surname with no formal training of a guild.&quot; she commented archly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ho ho!&quot; he laughed. &quot;I have all the training I need, Miss Camille...&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille laughed at him shortly. &quot;Oh really?&quot; she said. &quot;Things your father taught you? I cannot imagine they compare to the vigorous training of the Knights of T...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Spar?&quot; River offered, drawing his sword. Camille's heart raced. She loved to spar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gladly.&quot; she said, drawing her sword. Please don't just let me win, she thought desperately.<br>
<br>
He did not disappoint her.<br>
<br>
Swords locked, their faces close to each other as they pushed toward each other, and the spar began.<br>
<br>
Camille swung each swing, falling into the last two years of training naturally. And she was good, having learned her lessons well. But the young man matched every swing, parrying, feinting, riposting, blocking. They circled around in the sand like two dancers leaping into a delicate, deadly waltz.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're good.&quot; she commented breathlessly, dodging as he lunged forward, escaping the tip of his blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;So are you,&quot; River panted, ducking as she sliced high. &quot;You ARE holding back, yes, I would hate to bleed all over that shiny armor of yours.&quot; And then he swung low, knocking her sword up high.<br>
<br>
Reflexes kicked in, part of her training. Her eyes lit with blue light, and she murmured a short incantation, and a force of air slammed into the young man and stunned him off his feet and onto his rear in the sand. He blinked in surprise, as she swung over her head at him, but he rolled quickly to the side, leaving her sword half buried in the dune.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very nice, very nice!&quot; he remarked, swinging at her side as she brought her sheild between his blade and her armor. It deflected the blow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm surprised you haven't tried to stun me yet.&quot; she said, circling around him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't stun.&quot; River said, circling with her, the two of them like cats in an alley.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; she said in surprise. Block, parry. &quot;Your father has been remiss in his teachings then.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He tried.&quot; River replied, riposte, dodge. &quot;I can't catch on to it. But there are other ways to stop a caster. Is that sheild of yours for decoration only? You haven't used it except to block.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't need anything but my stuns.&quot; she said confidently, lunge, counter. Blast him, he escaped her blade again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, realllly.&quot; he singsonged, slowing his movement. &quot;Alright, Miss Stun. Try to stun me again.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped moving in circles, and faced him. &quot;Ok.&quot; she agreed, eyes lighting blue.<br>
<br>
SMASH. His sheild came up like a weapon, taking her by surprise, and knocked her flat onto her back, spell dissipating as she momentarily forgot the incarnation. Her head swam.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damned, sorry.&quot; he said honestly, reaching out a hand to help her up. She groggily accepted, as he began to pull her to her feet.<br>
<br>
With a wrench and a roll back, she yanked him off balance and tossed him over her into the sand. Then leaping to her feet, she turned and swung, but his sheild was up and blocking, even from his prone position on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Haha!&quot; he laughed, &quot;Nice try. Now for a bit of MY magic!&quot; and he said something in a gutteral language, and his eyes lit red. Suddenly Camille felt all the strength drain out of her legs, and she pitched forward, drained, unceremoniously landing between the man's legs across his body.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's ok, I just took some of your strength.&quot; he said softly, her faces inches from his as they lay in the sand. &quot;It will come back soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Their eyes locked. Her cheeks flushed red as her whole body grew warm in his half-embrace.<br>
<br>
Suddenly uncomfortably aware of the position they were in, she jumped to her feet, dusting sand off her armor and not looking down at him, sheathed her sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Draw?&quot; he offered, climbing to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Draw.&quot; she said shortly, embarrassed at both losing her balance like that and her body's reaction.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that spell you cast on me?&quot; she asked suddenly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drain strength.&quot; he said, sheathing his own weapon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drain strength? I've never seen any of the Knights use that.&quot; she said, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's because paladins can't cast it.&quot; he said, clearly uncomfortable with where the conversation had led.<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean you are not a paladin?&quot; Camille began, looking at him oddly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sooo...&quot; he said, changing the subject abruptly. &quot;What brings you to the Desert of Ro this fine evening?&quot;<br>
<br>
The mention of the desert brought her mission screaming home to her. She had almost forgotten it after meeting this strange young man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I almost forgot!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Can you point me in the direction of Derv One?&quot;<br>
<br>
He frowned. &quot;What is a young girl doing crawling around the desert at this time of night looking for Derv One for?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Young KNIGHT.&quot; she corrected, miffed at his tone. &quot;And it's guild business.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, young knight, forgive me.&quot; he said, pointing slowly to her right. &quot;You were close. It's about four dunes in that direction till you will be able to see their campfire, at this time of night. But perhaps I could accompany you to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, thank you.&quot; she said abruptly, wincing at her tone, but wanting to do this on her own. &quot;As you may have seen, I am more than capable of defending myself. Goodnight, River.&quot; And she began marching in the direction he had pointed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just be careful, milady.&quot; he called out after her. &quot;There are strange things afoot in the desert now adays....&quot; but the last of his voice faded away as she marched on.<br>
<br>
He was correct, she was not far off. As she topped the fourth dune she saw the campfire, and upon creeping closer, the three tents surrounding it. An orc was warming his hands at the fire in the cold desert night air, but other than some movement in one of the tents, she could see no other people.<br>
<br>
The dervs were an odd bunch, appearing serveral years ago in the desert of Ro. A nomadic people, other than for a few skirmishes over market prices when they ventured close to Freeport, they generally kept to themselves. But intelligence had caught rumors that a strange darkelf from the Nektulos was travelling from camp to camp, and it was feared that an alliance of some sort was in the works. So the Knights sent out all those they had in training to watch the camps, to see if indeed this dark elf existed, or if it was just a rumor. Her assignment was Derv One, but thus far, she saw no sign of a teir'dal.<br>
<br>
Slowly she crept around the dune, attempting to get a better glimpse at the occupants of the tents.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Dunestalker...&quot; she whispered nervously, making her way down the sandy hill.<br>
<br>
The cold steel of a knife to her throat from behind and an iron grip on the back of her neck stopped her dead in her tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's this, a pretty miss?&quot; came a harsh female barbarian voice from behind her. The grip tightened, and Camille's eyes watered in pain. &quot;Let's see yer weapon girlie, nice an' slow, and drop it where Weezer kin git at it.&quot; <br>
<br>
The knife at her throat decided it for Camille. She slowly drew her weapon and dropped it to the sand, where a ragged, filthy human, presumably Weezer, scooped it up and pranced, half dancing, toward the tents. The blade was removed from her throat and pressed roughly to her mailed back, and she was given a rough shove from behind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now march, missy, or I'll skewer ya like a pig, by gods.&quot; the woman said, pushing Camille again. Camille slowly made her way towards the tents. As she passed the orc, he looked at her chest hungrily and licked his lips. The orc fell in place behind her.<br>
<br>
The flap to the largest tent was thrown to the side and she was pushed roughly inside. <br>
<br>
There, across from her, eating a leg of mutton, was a teir'dal in full armor, blinking his violet eyes in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lookit here what I found sneakin' around in the sand, Dorn.&quot; the barbarian woman said, pushing Camille forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, a Knight of Truth.&quot; the dark elf, Dorn said, appraising her with his eyes like one looks at a bug. &quot;They have been spotted at almost all of the camps poking around. Silly asses think it is wise to spy in full plate mail. Such noisy noisy spies.&quot; And then, his appraisal over, he went back to his mutton. &quot;Varissa, strip her out of her armor.&quot; Dorn said to the barbarian, and then indicated the orc. &quot;And the give her to Grozz to play with.&quot; The orc clapped his hands together and began unbuckling his pants, tongue licking over his lips again. &quot;If there's anything left, toss it to Weezer, is time he became a man. Then we will discuss tomorrow's caravan from Oasis, and how we may relieve Freeport's taxes that are starving your people...&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille's stood still in shock, still feeling the press of the blade to her back, as the orc's pants hit the floor with a jangle of beltstraps. Three opponents, she thought. The armor may buy me some time. Horrible odds, but if I can get a stun off...<br>
<br>
&quot;Put your clothes back on, Grozz, before you catch cold.&quot; commanded a strong voice from the entrance. It was the voice of a leader. <br>
<br>
Grozz stood blinking, pants around his ankles. Camille turned to follow his stare.<br>
<br>
There was River standing in the doorway, one hand outside the flap, the other holding his sword drawn.<br>
<br>
Dorn leapt to his feet. &quot;Do not interfere, Riverdane.&quot;, he growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dorn B'Dynn.&quot; he said amiably, but his eyes were not smiling. They were cold, flat, emotionless. &quot;I thought I saw you sneaking around the dunes this afternoon. What brings you crawling out from under your rock in Neriak?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dorn's hand crept toward his sword at his waist. &quot;Business from the Fatherland, human. You may think yourself protected because you bear the Taint, but if you get in my way I will not hesitate to skewer you alive!&quot;<br>
<br>
River laughed. &quot;With what? That piece of mutton?&quot; he chuckled.<br>
<br>
That was enough for Dorn. With a roar, he threw the mutton aside, and drew out his sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss Stun, catch!&quot; River called, bringing his outside hand into the tent. It held Camille's weapon, wet with blood. Seeing River unmarked, she absently realized it must be Weezer's blood. She came out of her daze and caught the weapon midair.<br>
<br>
Varissa violently brought the knife at Camille's back up to her throat again, with the intent to cut her windpipe. But Camille, automatically, without so much thinking as just doing, reversed the sword as she caught it, and drove it back under her arm with both hands. She felt it slide home and then the sudden sticky wet rush of blood onto her hands. The knife at her throat fell uselessly to the ground, as Camille pushed the dying woman off her back and pulled her weapon free of her. Some part of her stomach revolted as she dimmly realized she had slain her first living person in combat, while another more primitive part of her cheered.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Dorn had rushed River, swinging wildly up over his head. River's sheild came up, deflecting the blow, but Dorn spun, countering River's riposte and slipping out the entrance as he danced past. River turned half in the entrance and half out, furiously exchanging blows with Dorn B'Dynn outside.<br>
<br>
Grozz still stood there with his pants around his ankles, at River's back. Then, coming to his senses, he grabbed a long carving knife from Dorn's dinner table and raised it, shuffling over to where River fought. He brought it high, intent on plunging it into River's neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;River!&quot; Camille cried, eyes flashing blue.<br>
<br>
-STUN-<br>
<br>
Grozz stood poised over River, knocked senseless for a moment by the force of Camille's stun, hand still gripping the knife but unable to move.<br>
<br>
Without turning into the tent, Riverdane's hand shot back, locking around Grozz's throat. And then something...peculiar happened. Grozz's eyes bulged as all the color drained out of his face, and then his skin....collapsed, falling in upon itself as Camille watched in shock. Within seconds, nothing but an empty husk remained. River let go and Grozz's empty skin fluttered to the ground like parchment. And then, blocking a swing from Dorn, River disappeared outside as he and B'Dynn battled.<br>
<br>
Camille came out of her surprise and ran from the tent. There to the side was Weezer's body, but his head...was nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, Riverdane and Dorn were locked in mortal combat, Dorn having produced a long parrying knife and dual weilding. River was good, but it was obvious with the way Dorn was handling his weapons that the teir'dal was the superior.<br>
<br>
Without thinking, Camille joined the fray, swinging without a word into the fight. But Dorn was good, damned good, holding Camille off with the parrying knife, as River and he exchanged blows. And then, Dorn's weapon slipped through River's defenses, cutting across the leather armor on his bicep and drawing blood in a thick line. River howled, and spun off, muttering something in a coarse language Camille did not understand.<br>
<br>
And then River's eyes pulsed green.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, in the air, tiny green skulls materialized and began to spin, as green light shot out of River's eyes and pierced Dorn's body. Camille stopped midswing, gaping, panting for air as she stared at the lightshow.<br>
<br>
Dorn dropped his weapons, screaming. But the scream was not one of pain....rather, one of terror. It went right through Camille as he turned, shrieking, and disappeared over the dunes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dammit!&quot; River growled, touching his fingers to the slice on his arm tenderly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you cast on him?&quot; Camille whispered in awe.<br>
<br>
River did not meet her stare. Rather, he began slowly unbuckling the leather and peeling it away from the wound. &quot;Fear. I cast Fear.&quot; he said softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fear?&quot; she asked, &quot;But I thought necromancers cast fear, but you're...you're no caster.&quot; Her head was a jumble of confused questions. &quot;And what did he mean that you have the Taint?&quot;<br>
<br>
River drew his eyes away from his wound, and looked at her squarely.<br>
<br>
&quot;My mother was Eleese of the Commons.&quot; he said intensely. Camille gasped involuntarily. Every girl who had ever disobeyed their parents were warned they would end up like Crazy Eleese, Madwoman of West Commons. It was a popular tale to frighten children with, since it was true.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you have heard of her,&quot; River continued, going on. &quot;She was raped by Innoruuk and left for dead. Dane found her and took her in. She gave birth to me. That...is the Taint. I am born of a mad woman and the seed of Innoruuk.&quot; He reached out, grabbing her hand, wanting desperately for her to understand. She felt she should recoil, but somehow, could not. &quot;That is why I can never join your Knights of Truth. That is why I can not learn the magic of healing, or stuns, or the rest of the code. I will never be a paladin, Camille. I am a shadowknight, the only thing I could be.&quot; He then suddenly brought her hand up to his lips, kissing the back of her hand, and glancing up at her sidelong. &quot;But I'm not that bad.&quot; he grinned, and released her hand, starting off for the dunes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fear doesn't last long, milady!&quot; he called back to her. &quot;I would be off before Dorn returns!&quot; And then, the dunes obscured him from view, while she stood dazed looking out after where he had disappeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Wyldechylde...&quot; she whispered softly, and then, clearing her head, made her way away from the camp.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 381<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 3:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> Camille awoke suddenly, body stiff. She blinked twice in surprise, not quite sure where she was. Pale light lit the stable, as she realized she was laying on a pile of hay. My gods, she thought, I slept till dawn. The memory of the dream was quickly escaping her the way dreams do, and she felt a pang of loss as the recollection of her first meeting River slowly faded away. It wasn't without its bad parts, the dream, but when his lips had touched her hand...<br>
<br>
She suddenly realized she was not alone in the stable. Grelin sat on his haunches, a silly grin on his face, watching her. When her eyes met his, he smiled wider, stood, and ran out of the stables. She rose, groaning to her feet. Brimstone was no where to be seen. Reaver was still gripped in her hand. With horror she noticed that it was covered in blood, as was the hay where it had laid.<br>
<br>
Grelin returned, with Rocsalt in tow. And slowing, limping severely, Talvarien entered the stable behind them, eyeing Camille warily and giving her a large berth.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry if I worried you, guys.&quot; Camille began, stepping forward. Talvarien scuttled backwards, terror in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cami,&quot; he said, panic in his voice. &quot;Put DOWN the sword!Down girl! Don't hurt the Talv....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; she asked, confusion in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Before Talvarien has an accident in his pants, I suggest you put down the sword, Cami.&quot; Roc suggested. &quot;He's already had enough for one day.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand,&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
&quot;You stabbed him.&quot; Grelin grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I WHAT?&quot; Camille said in shock, stepping towards Talvarien.<br>
<br>
&quot;DON'T HURT ME!&quot; Talv half-shrieked, pulling Rocsalt in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv!&quot; Camille said, slowly placing the bloody sword onto the ground. &quot;I'm sorry...I....what happened??&quot; She took two steps deliberately away from the sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;When we woke up and you missed breakfast, we started looking for you.&quot; Roc said. &quot;Talv tracked you to the stable, found you sleeping in the hay. He tried to wake you up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you tried to KILL me like a crazy woman!&quot; Talv wailed. &quot;Where's the love? None!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You sliced him in the leg, without even opening your eyes. And then you went right on sleeping.&quot; Rocsalt said, with a half smile. &quot;He screamed like a little girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It HURT!&quot; Talv exclaimed indignantly. &quot;It took three ranja heals to stop me from bleeding to death.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah.&quot; Roc said. &quot;It takes a full ranger heal to heal a mosquito bite. You were fine after Grelin popped a regen on you. And what's with the limp?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be a gimp for life.&quot; Talvarien predicted.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're gimp now.&quot; Grelin replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;No love!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, and was silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing.&quot; Camille apologized sincerely. &quot;I've had a....long night. And long day it seems. I missed breakfast? That means...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Roc finished for her. &quot;It's sunset now. You slept the whole day away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The whole day.&quot; Camille said, agitated. River was locked in that gem, and she was sleeping away what could be precious time. &quot;Let's get back to the guildhouse, guys. I need to get into some clothes and tell you what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
She picked up Reaver, and left towards the house, Rocsalt and Grelin at her side. Talvarien fell into step behind them, with a careful eye on Camille's swordhand, but the limp miraculously gone. He was as curious as the other two to where Brimstone had gone and why Camille was asleep in the stables.<br>
<br>
Grelin fixed a quick dinner as Camille detailed her meeting with Terris, the history of Grieg, the use of the blue gem, every little detail she could remember. They ate quietly while she told the tale, stopping every now and then to eat. She was ravenous. At the end she sat back, exhausted by the retelling.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what do we do now, head over to Greig's place and bust River out, powpowpowpow?&quot; Talvarien said, all thoughts of his little injury forgotten.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Grelin said, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You remember what Katarin said about that statue.&quot; Rocsalt added. &quot;Akethadar couldn't scratch it. It would be suicide to head in there just us four.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Plus Terris wanted me to talk to Vven first.&quot; Camille said, recalling how insistant the goddess had been. &quot;He may have some answers for us that will make some sense.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I haven't seen Vven Psyphon since.....since my arms got ripped off and they buried me during End Game.&quot; Talvarien said with a shudder.<br>
<br>
&quot;He stayed on in Hate, taking my place when Innoruuk demanded a soul be paid.&quot; Camille said, remembering back two years ago. &quot;I bet he is still there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then we need to get to Hate.&quot; Roc said, standing up. &quot;Which means...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We need a wizard.&quot; Camille finished. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 382<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 2:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Verdad, let us in!&quot; Camille called again, knocking on the door urgently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not home?&quot; Grelin suggested.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's home, I see candlelight in the windows.&quot; Camille said, knocking again. &quot;My mother was a wizard, she would never leave a lit fire in the house if her and my father were out. Wizards respect the power of fire too much.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Allow me.&quot; Rocsalt said, stepping forward. He rapped his knuckles on the door, hard.<br>
<br>
Inside, the sound of a door opening hastily, and then the locks clicking open. The door swung open.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in, A....&quot; Verdad began, standing in the doorway in nothing but black boxers decorated in bright red hearts. A half finished bottle of wine was in one hand. As he took in the four in his doorway, his mouth dropped open in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry to call this late, Verd.&quot; Camille apologized, &quot;But I need a favor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, bad time guys....&quot; Verdad began, finding his voice, turning his head to a closed door behind him nervously. The sound of falling water stopped, and Verdad looked back at them imploringly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice duds. Is that real silk?&quot; Talvarien said, slipping past Verdad into the room. Verdad turned with him, panic in his eyes, as the rest filed into the room. &quot;Wowowow, look at this place!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, taking in the lush couch, with the candelabras lit in all corners, half eaten cheese platter on the marble table, plush tigerskin rug. Outer clothing was scattered all over the couch, some male, some female. &quot;Is this an original?&quot; he asked, pointing to a satyr and nymph orgy scene framed on the wall.<br>
<br>
Verdad quickly closed the door behind them as they invaded his living room. &quot;Cami, heh, I would never close my door to you, I hope you know that, but your timing is a little....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Verd, I wouldn't have come if it weren't important.&quot; Camille said honestly. But Verdad was only half listening, still looking at the door from which the sound of water had stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any other time, ok?&quot; Verdad begged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good cheese!&quot; Talvarien said, popping another piece in his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to get to Hate.&quot; Camille said quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hate?&quot; Verdad blinked. &quot;Just get on that horse of River's. You still have it, don't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly the door swung open, and a redheaded highelf, dressed only a towel, walked out, facedown as she wrapped up her hair in another towel, water dripping onto the carpet.<br>
<br>
&quot;So where is this surprise you promi...&quot; she began, looking up. And then her mouth dropped open as she took in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jazzy...&quot; Verdad began, hands up in supplication as her face grew dark.<br>
<br>
&quot;THIS is the surprise?&quot; she exclaimed indignantly, anger rising. &quot;FOUR PEOPLE??&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We lost the horse.&quot; Talvarien answered for Camille obliviously, popping another piece of cheese into his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;HORSE??&quot; Jazzy shrieked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jazzy it's not what it seems...&quot; Verdad began, face crumbling.<br>
<br>
But she was not listening. She stalked over to the couch and grabbed up her robes. &quot;You sick perverted...&quot; and a string of colorful curses as she stormed into the bathroom and slammed the door behind her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, Verdad.&quot; Camille said, mortified. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're cramping my style!&quot; Verdad wailed, and then a knock on the door. Verdad's eyes went wild. &quot;Don't get...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I got it.&quot; Talv said blithely, swinging open the door.<br>
<br>
In the doorway, another, younger high elven girl stood with her eyes closed, wearing a long black trenchcoat. The moment the door swung open, she opened the trenchcoat wide with a smile. Underneath she was wearing two tassels, a skimpy loin cloth and.....nothing else.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wore it!&quot; she said brightly, eyes still closed. &quot;Where's my surprise??&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Surprise.&quot; Grelin said, grinning.<br>
<br>
The girl's eyes snapped open.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aiene....&quot; Verdad began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Impressive.&quot; Rocsalt commented, eyebrows raised, as Aiene hastily covered herself with the trenchcoat.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's no horse!&quot; Talvarien added emphatically.<br>
<br>
Aiene screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aiene...&quot; Verdad tried again, when Jazzy swung open the bathroom door, now fully dressed, and took in the latest addition in shock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my gods, you sick bastard!&quot; Jazzy exclaimed. &quot;Aiene too? She's only seventeen!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Today's my birthday.&quot; Aiene said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's legal now!&quot; Verdad tried desperately.<br>
<br>
&quot;And there's NO horse! None!&quot; Talvarien piped up helpfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perverts!&quot; Jazzy exclaimed, shooting Verdad a murderous look. He took a tentative step toward her, but her eyes narrowed and she disappeared from view, gating.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aiene...&quot; Verdad sighed, turning back to the girl in his doorway. She was fuming.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU RUINED MY BIRTHDAY!&quot; she screamed, eyes lighting gold. A white hammer materialized in the air, hovering for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not in the face!&quot; Verdad cried, as the hammer flew at him. He ducked.<br>
<br>
--SMASH-- the hammer hit Talvarien full in the face, breaking his nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ranja...down...&quot; Talvarien said weakly, slumping onto the couch.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aiene...&quot; Verdad tried again, but the girl blinked, and like Jazzy, gated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Verdad...&quot; Camille began lamely.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're KILLING me here, Cami!&quot; Verdad growled, looking distraught in his boxers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Verd, I wouldn't have come if this wasn't important!&quot; Camille pleaded. &quot;It's about River...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;River is dead, Cami,&quot; Verdad said, miffed. &quot;As I have been trying to remind you for the last six months...&quot; He suddenly tapered off, a nervous look crossing his face. &quot;Um, he IS dead, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes and no...&quot; Camille began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah dammit, Grelin, fix Talv's nose!&quot; Verdad exclaimed, noticing the ranjer groaning behind him. &quot;He's bleeding all over the damned couch...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy with the schnozz!&quot; Talvarien yelped, as Grelin touched his fingers, glowing green, to Talvarien's shattered nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what exactly did you wreck my life for?&quot; Verdad asked, shrugging into a robe and sinking into an easy chair.<br>
<br>
And Camille, for the second time that night, told her tale. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 7:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;This is unreal.&quot; Verdad commented, staring at Camille when she finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's real alright, Verd.&quot; Camille replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know,&quot; Verdad said, &quot;It's getting to the point where I'm afraid when I see a Wyldechylde.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you help?&quot; Camille asked, looking him in the eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;On one condition.&quot; Verdad said.<br>
<br>
&quot;And that is?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dinner when this is over.&quot; Verdad said, watching her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not a chance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, I'll do it anyway.&quot; Verdad sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Verd.&quot; Camille smiled. &quot;We need to leave at once.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, stone please.&quot; Verdad said, standing up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stone?&quot; Camille said blankly.<br>
<br>
Verdad sighed. &quot;Hate stone. I need a reagent to port.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille looked flustered, and glanced around at the lost looks of her companions. &quot;I...err..don't....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't bring a rock.&quot; Verdad finished for her. &quot;Ok, buckle up, we're headed to the Nektulos. I need to see a guy River turned me on to that can work the inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nektulos?&quot; Camille asked, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;The only place port stone to Hate are sold are in Neriak. There's a guy I use in there for potions and other oddities.&quot; And then, with a word in elvish, they shimmered and disappeared.<br>
<br>
With a flash of light, they found themselves on the flat-topped pyramid that was the wizard portal in the Nektulos Forest, which housed the teir'dal city of Neriak. Verdad started off, motioning for them to stay.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be back in about ten minutes.&quot; he said over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Talvarien glanced down at the ground and then looked up. &quot;Verd waitwaitwait.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Verdad asked, stopping impatiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm picking up....&quot; Talvarien began, running down the side of the pyramid and staring at the grass. &quot;One two three...ten...twenty? More. Over twenty guards in full armor near here, and not long ago either.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Over twenty guards?&quot; Verdad said incredulously. Not that he didn't believe him. They may be correct in doubting Talvarien could tie his boots without hurting himself, but when it came to tracking, they trusted the ranger's talents implicitly. It was just that large a force in the Nektulos was unheard of for a very long time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Talv said, looking up, &quot;And they're patrolling. They'll be back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I can send you all back to my place....&quot; Verdad began.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll go with you.&quot; Camille suggested. &quot;Grelin, Spirit of Eagle and Foilage Sheild please.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grelin nodded and began chanting. His first spell lifted them up in the air, levitating them, lending speed to their movement, and blessed their eyes to see the invisible. The second spell made them disappear from normal sight, though they all saw each other plainly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, while it holds.&quot; Verdad said, &quot;Let's move.&quot;<br>
<br>
They made their way double quick through the forest to the city of Neriak. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 387<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/03 11:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> Verdad turned to them outside the filthy hut deep in Neriak's Foreign Quarter, and mouthed, This is it. Camille nodded, and followed Verdad into the rundown shack, the others on her heels.<br>
<br>
She stopped dead as a dog began to growl.<br>
<br>
And then a loud whipcrack as something in the shadows passed wind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shhhh, Stinky!&quot; a decrepid voice called out from the gloom across the room. &quot;Don't growl at the dinner guests! Kekkekekkekkekekke!&quot;<br>
<br>
The dog's growl tapered off to a low snarl, but didn't stop.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soso?&quot; the voice asked, &quot;Who be here? Sound off, cause I can't see you yet!&quot;<br>
<br>
Verdad murmured something, and his hand began to glow with wizardfire, just enough to light the room for Camille and Rocsalt, his two human companions, with their weaker eyes.<br>
<br>
Across from them, sitting in the darkness stirring a large soup pot, was a disgusting troll. A filthy cur of a dog lay at his feet, hackles raised, looking at them dangerously.<br>
<br>
&quot;We see you now, Scurg.&quot; Verdad said, addressing the troll.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah you see me, but I don't see you, see? Kekekekkekk! Soup needed radishes!&quot; the troll laughed oddly, pointing up to his face. Both eyes were missing, leaving nothing but dark black holes in his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so going to be sick.&quot; Talvarien moaned.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you do, do it in the pot!&quot; Scurg suggested. &quot;So, I hear two. One voice I know, one I don't. But there are more yes? I hear your in out of breath! So who be you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille Wyldechylde.&quot; Camille offered, trying not to breathe in the stench.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talvarien.&quot; Talv said, shifting uncomfortably.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rocsalt. Di'Varr.&quot; Roc added, and able to finally make noise after their hushed trip through the city's outskirts, let go with his cough he had been surpressing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grelin.&quot; the druid finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Five! Old Scurg has five bless me, come to my home! Going to need more soup!&quot; Then he turned roughly in Verdad's direction. &quot;So, back so soon, paleface? Ran out of Scurg's Spirit of Rabbit already? Lady friends like it, yes? Thumpthumpthumpthump done!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Err...&quot; Verdad said, face turning red. &quot;I don't need any more potions, Scurg, thanks, I need...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I know what you need.&quot; Scurg murmured, stirring his pot. &quot;Scurg know lots of things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know Scurg is out of his freakin' gourd.&quot; Talvarien whispered to Rocsalt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kekekkkkekekkk, ranger boy!&quot; Scurg said loudly, turning his eyeless face directly to Talvarien. &quot;I threw my eyes into the soup, but not my ears! You may be right, you may be right, but it better to listen to a crazy man than to hear nothing at all, yesyes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot; Talvarien said, embarrassed he had been heard.<br>
<br>
Scurg continued to stir his pot. &quot;Yesyes, Scurg hear many things. Scurg see many thing, with or without radishes! Scurg see snakes slither across the face of the moon! Scurg smell a change in the wind!&quot; And to punctuate that, he farted loudly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scurg,&quot; Verdad said suddenly. &quot;There is increased patrols in the Nektulos. You know anything about that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, the darkies are up in arms!&quot; Scurg gibbered, nodding. All cities are increasing their watches! Something strange afoot, for lighties and darkies both! The books of passage are gone, poof, stolen!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Books of passage?&quot; Rocsalt asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sick one.&quot; Scurg said, turning in Rocsalt's direction. Roc gave another involuntary cough, almost on cue. Camille glanced at him nervously before looking back to the troll.<br>
<br>
&quot;What books of passage?&quot; Camille asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;He means the portal books to Plane of Knowledge,&quot; Verdad said slowly. &quot;Don't you, Scurg?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesyes,&quot; Scurg said, nodding vigorously, &quot;Young lion smart as he is virile! Kekkekekkkekekke!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hells?&quot; Verdad asked. &quot;Those books are fused to the pedestals they sit upon, to prevent theft.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But when the rock become soup, easy enough to pluck out the chicken!&quot; Scurg chortled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rock becomes soup?&quot; Verdad asked, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoever take the books, melted the rock!&quot; Scurg informed him, stirring the pot happily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Odd.&quot; Rocsalt commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great.&quot; Verdad moaned, looking at Grelin. &quot;Well, Grel, get ready for a ton of 'Hey dood, can you port to West Commons for 5 plat?'...&quot; Grelin nodded sadly. &quot;So, Scurg, I need a Hate rock.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, going up to see my old friend, aye? Tell him for Scurg things too quiet around here without him! Kekekekkkekke!&quot; Then Scurg reached down under his seat, looking for something. &quot;Hate stone, Hate stone...&quot; he murmured. &quot;Ah, here it be!&quot; And he withdrew something from under his chair and held it in Talvarien's general direction. It was a lumpy shape, brown, and had a foul odor. Talvarien took it from the troll and stared at it, holding it in his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Scurg.&quot; Verdad said, &quot;That's not a Hate stone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Scurg asked, snatching it back from Talvarien. He sniffed it once. &quot;So it ain't! Bad dog!&quot; he scolded, as the dog cringed. &quot;Bad Stinky! I told you, not in the house!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gah!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed in disgust, frantically wiping his hands on his leggings.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah well, flavor for soup!&quot; Scurg said, tossing the dog turd into the pot with a wet splash. &quot;Now where be it?&quot; and he went rummaging under hs chair again. After a short time, he brought up a black stone, looking very much like coal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah here it be, yes?&quot; Scurg said, holding it out.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not touching it!&quot; Talvarien cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it, Scurg, thanks.&quot; Verdad said, taking the stone from the troll. &quot;Put it on my tab.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That I will, that I will, kekekekekke.&quot; the troll chuckled. &quot;So....stay for dinner?&quot; he pointed to the pot.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll pass.&quot; Talvarien said weakly, still wiping his hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to go, Scurg.&quot; Camille said politely, &quot;But thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, another time, maybe!&quot; Scurg suggested brightly. Then he stared in Camille's direction. &quot;Give Scurg some time with Mithaniel's handmaiden, yesyes? I have secrets for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Grelin and Rocsalt said in unison.<br>
<br>
Camille blinked, hearing herself addressed by the strange troll in what she had thought to be a semi-private name for her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guys, I'll be fine.&quot; she said slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cami...&quot; Rocsalt began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you doubt my ability to fight, Roc? Or am I just River's wife to you?&quot; she said warningly, looking at him with an eyebrow raised. Rocsalt's mouth snapped shut and he said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave us a moment, I'll be right out.&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gladly.&quot; Talvarien said, slipping out the front door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be quick Cami.&quot; Verdad said, &quot;We'll be between the huts outside. We shouldn't be seen by the guards in this area.&quot;<br>
<br>
And, with a last look of disapproval from Grelin and Rocsalt, the men made their way outside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come closer, dreamer.&quot; Scurg chortled, stirring the soup. Camille obliged him and came closer to the blind troll.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, like a snake, he dropped his ladle into the soup and grabbed her right hand in both of hers. His grip was clammy but firm. Her first reaction was to strike him, but she kept that in check, as his grip was not for pain, but to emphasize his next speech.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember this, girlie!&quot; the troll whispered, his face up close a picture of madness. &quot;When you want to talk to the dead, they got no ears left when the worms finish with them! So, you wanna talk to the dead, you gotta speak their language! They say dead men tell no tales, but dead women got plenty to say! Heed the troll shammie! Scurg knows many things! And the Dane still got plenty to say, for a man with no tongue! Kekekkkekkkekekekkekekeke!&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille, body recoiling from his insane chatter, yanked her hand out of his grasp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you...&quot; she managed, making her way out the door, trying to make sense of his gibberish.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anytime, girlie!&quot; Scurg called out after her, &quot;And when it's all done, come for soup!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ready?&quot; Verdad said, seeing Camille appear in the alley.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did that crazy bastard say to you?&quot; Talvarien asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Later.&quot; Camille said distractedly, rubbing her hand absently where the troll had touched her, trying to get the clammy feeling out of her system.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be ready for anything.&quot; Verdad warned. &quot;I hear Hate has changed a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I love the place.&quot; Rocsalt said. &quot;I spent so many raids there I could pull it blindfolded.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not anymore.&quot; Verdad corrected him, starting to chant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; Rocsalt began.<br>
<br>
But then, the incantation done, they winked out of sight, as the slums of Neriak disappeared from around them.<br>

<br>
They appeared around a shallow well, one Camille had never seen before in her previous raids on the home of Innoruuk. Normally you would arrive in Hate in a small abandoned building, praying that you wouldn't be swarmed by patrolling mobs that milled without direction through the streets. Now, you were outside on the streets in a corner, with no instant flurry of action, since the streets were deserted.<br>
<br>
&quot;They removed the second floor.&quot; Rocsalt commented, glancing up. Camille followed his gaze. The low ceiling of the plane of Hate had disappeared, and the gothic buildings soared into the heights, arched and majestic, the architecture impressive in the pale blue glow that seemed to light the plane.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, the reports were right.&quot; Verdad said. &quot;Zone in is safe....&quot;<br>
<br>
Talvarien was inspecting the walls surrounding the well with interest, reaching out to touch the bricks. &quot;Wowowow, look at the stonework on this wa...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Who dares invade the home of Innoruuk?&quot; a spite golem growled from somewhere on the other side of the wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;More victims for the Father!&quot; cackled an unseen loathesome lich.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blerg blerg!&quot; cried an evil little imp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooops?&quot; Talvarien said lamely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Same old aggro problems.&quot; Rocsalt sighed. He took a defensive posture as Camille drew Reaver out of its scabbard and prepared.<br>
<br>
From around the corner came a crowd of Hate's denizens.<br>
<br>
&quot;So not good....&quot; Talvarien said nervously, drawing his bow.<br>
<br>
&quot;No chanters, I'm using areas...&quot; Verdad murmured, hands glowing. Grelin looked around helplessly at the dead end they were trapped in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Succor no good.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Verdad agreed. &quot;Probably drop us off right here again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Surrounded, the mob of liches, revenants, clerics, and other nightmares came towards them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cami! Verd!&quot; came a loud happy voice from the back. The rush of demons stopped as if frozen in place. &quot;Back, back to your camps, idiots!&quot; the voice continued, as someone began to move through the crowd. &quot;They're with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd of mobs parted, and out came a teir'dal with jet black hair and a big smile. He was carrying a clipboard and quill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I'll be damned!&quot; the dark elf said. &quot;Why the hells didn't you write you were coming?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice timing, Vven.&quot; Verdad replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all about the timing.&quot; Vven agreed, looking from Verdad to Cami. &quot;Cami, looking wonderful, amazing what a month asleep in Hate can do for the skin....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Vven.&quot; Camille said, smiling despite herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;And is that Talvarien? With ARMS?&quot; Vven exclaimed. &quot;I almost didn't recognize you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Vven.&quot; Talvarien said, wincing at the recollection of having his arms ripped off in the Plane of Nightmare.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Rocsalt, Grelin....&quot; Vven nodded. &quot;What, is Razor's Edge coming up for a raid? We're not open yet...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Razor disbanded after River died, Vven...&quot; Camille said quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I had heard River slipped in Velks.&quot; Vven said carefully. &quot;I would have come to the funeral, but I didn't think dancing on his grave would be appropriate...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You wouldn't have danced on his grave.&quot; Camille said, not believing the teir'dal for a minute.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, maybe just a LITTLE dance....&quot; Vven laughed. &quot;Boy was Inny upset when River didn't end up here...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You look well, Vven.&quot; Camille said, changing subjects.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hate has been good for inky.&quot; Vven agreed. &quot;I found my true calling, as an administrator here. So what do you think of the place? All my idea...&quot; He turned and gestured broadly to the buildings behind him with the clipboard. &quot;Hate 2.0!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Interesting...&quot; Roc commented, face not registering if he cared for the changes or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven, I came up here to talk to you about something....&quot; Camille began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure sure...&quot; Vven said, taking her by the hand and pulling her away from the well. &quot;Let's talk in the lounge. I can give you the nickel tour as we head over.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hate has a lounge?&quot; Rocsalt asked, nose wrinkling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Hate has a lot of new things.&quot; Vven said, looking at him sidelong slyly.<br>
<br>
And, as the others following the teir'dal and Camille, they made their way south into the streets of Hate. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/03 4:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;This first part of Hate is the same 'ole, same 'ole.&quot; Vven said, pointing to various buildings with the quill. &quot;Just with better scenery. You like it? Sorta like Katta without the fog machine.&quot; <br>
<br>
Various mobs were working their way in and out of the buildings, dragging in furniture, removing large sacks of trash, typical construction site. They paused for a moment as a spite golem crossed their path, pushing a large harpsichord into a nearby building. <br>
<br>
&quot;ANOTHER piano?&quot; Vven asked the spite golem incredulously. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, Boss.&quot; the spite said apologetically. &quot;Maestro's orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo old school.&quot; Vven sighed, steering them around the musical instrument. Then in a low whisper he added, &quot;Maestro has been pitching a fit ever since I took over operations in southern Hate. So since he was assigned Zone In, every other building has a freakin' piano. Ridiculous waste of money. What are we going to do, play classical music and BORE them to death?&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille just shrugged, not knowing quite what to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, so, here's Northern Hate, clerics here, spites there, yadda yadda...&quot; Vven said dismissively. &quot;Now, we're getting near my area. Cami, do you remember way back when, why Innoruuk didn't want to keep River in Hate?&quot;<br>
<br>
The answer was on her lips in a second. She still remembered the day she woke up from her long sleep in End Game like it was yesterday. &quot;He said because River would turn Hate into an amusement park.&quot; she recalled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right!&quot; Vven exclaimed, moving them along. &quot;So after you two left, I started thinking, Hmm, not a bad idea. Took me half a year driving Inny crazy but...&quot; He turned the corner and made a grand gesture. &quot;Voila!&quot;<br>
<br>
They stopped dead in their tracks and gaped.<br>
<br>
There, sprawled out before them, lights flashing, was a huge demonic....carnival. Booths lined the streets, with dozens of games. A rollercoaster roared in the distance. Ramps leading to different attractions were everywhere, complete with rulers protruding from the ground with height requirements for certain rides.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...my...gods...&quot; Roc blinked in disgust, and started coughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You like it??&quot; Vven asked happily, clapping his hands together. Fortunately, Roc at the moment could not respond.<br>
<br>
An abhorrant, stone wings flapping, flew up to Vven carrying a large box. &quot;The advertisments are in, Boss!&quot; the abhorrant exclaimed.<br>
<br>
Vven excused himself for a moment while they stared at the glitzy travesty before them and took one of the fliers out of the box. As he skimmed it, his face grew dark.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hells is this? 'Come to 'isnnyland!'....'ISNNYLAND?&quot; he barked. He rolled up the flier and rapped the abhorrant over the head with it. &quot;Idiot, do you even proofread this crap before you send it out? It's INNY'S LAND, not 'isnnyland, you moron! Get this back to the printers before they close!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Boss.&quot; the abhorrant said miserably, lugging the box back the way he came.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't find good help nowadays.&quot; Vven sighed, looking at them apologetically. &quot;Anyway, come, I'll show you some of the highlights!&quot;<br>
<br>
They followed him mutely, too amazed to say anything.<br>
<br>
&quot;The whole thing, you know, came to me in a flash. I mean, when I was adventuring with the rest of you saps down on Norrath, I used to think 'and THIS is what I get? Camp the Arch Mage in Guk for 8 hours for these crappy PANTS?'...risk vs. reward was more imbalanced than casters vs. melee in the Arena. Why bother? So, I figure, after you battle it out in Maestro's area, read:RISK, then you get to inky's area, read:REWARD.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my gods, I LOVE this!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed. Rocsalt just stared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok ok ok,&quot; Vven said, speaking at a fast clip. &quot;Over there you got the Pirates of Guntrak, over here you have Tolapmuj's Wild Ride, and heh here's a little game I had dedicated to Whizbang, that little punk.&quot; He steered them towards a booth with a board on it, with about half a dozen holes cut into it. Chained to the board on a long cord was a fist sized replica of Pedi, Whizbang's wife. A large sign over the booth indicated the name of the game: Whack-A-Gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehh,&quot; Verdad said. &quot;I like this one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Guarunteed to be a hit!&quot; Vven exclaimed proudly. &quot;Pop in a plat, and a little Whizbang pops out of anyone of these holes for a few seconds. The more Whizbangs you bonk with the Pedi Hammer here, the more tickets you get, till you win an Inny Doll! Whiz even goes 'Damnation!' when you hit him. Priceless!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I play now?&quot; Verdad asked hopefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Later!&quot; Vven said, pulling Cami and the rest deeper into the carnival. &quot;I want to show you my biggest brainchild!&quot;<br>
<br>
They paused as a new sign loomed. In large pink letters, they read 'END GAME GROVE'.<br>
<br>
&quot;...'End Game Grove' ..???&quot; Camille exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!&quot; Vven replied. &quot;I had some of my best laughs during End Game! So I dedicated a whole section of the park to it. Come, look!&quot;<br>
<br>
They walked under the sign, Camille still shaking her head, after Vven.<br>
<br>
In one section they found a rather large booth. On the counter, was mock pieces of a human being. Inside the booth sat a sad looking squid, dressed rather pathetically in a dragon costume. An ire ghast in a carnival barker's hat was sitting on a stool outside it. The sign over the booth read 'STARVE WUOSHI'.<br>
<br>
&quot;Starve Wuoshi!&quot; Talvarien replied in delight.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right kid, Starve Wuoshi!&quot; the ire ghast piped up, sensing a customer. &quot;Just 5 plat to try your luck! The object is to pick up these pieces of human meat and toss them past old Wuoshi there! If you can get three body parts past her without her catching and eating them, you can get this genuine imitation Shattered Emerald of Corruption, just like all the rangers want!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Imitation?&quot; Talvarien asked, smile fading. &quot;Doesn't the real Shattered Emerald of Corruption drop in Hate?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hheh, yeah kid,&quot; the ghast chuckled, rolling his eyes. &quot;Surrre it does.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hard as hells to win too!&quot; Vven added. &quot;See our Wuoshi there? Out of work squid-thing from the Plane of Water. Not much to look at, but the damned things got sixteen arms! Nothing gets past him!&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille took a good look at the pieces of 'human' on the counter. Her eyes came to rest on the head. Something about it was familiar. Long black hair, moustache....<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven!&quot; she shrieked.<br>
<br>
&quot;What??&quot; he asked, recoiling from the anger in her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are feeding this Wuoshi thing a dummy of RIVER?&quot; she yelled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok ok ok! Poor taste!&quot; Vven said as she bonked him. &quot;I'll have it changed to Verdad or something!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You better...&quot; Camille warned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take a picture with Ramluk?&quot; Vven said, trying to lead them away from the replica of Riverdane's dismembered body. A large spite golem in ogre battle armor stood looking bored against a pole.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogre.&quot; it said half-heartedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's OGGA!,&quot; Vven whispered fiercely, jabbing the thing in its side. &quot;You're making me look bad!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga.&quot; it said, shrugging its massive shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok ok ok.&quot; Vven said, eyes murderous, pulling them in yet another direction. &quot;This one's my favorite. Check this out!&quot; He dragged them to a large mechanical model, rather realistically rendered of a large tree, with the features of a beautiful elven woman etched into the bark. Above it, was a pretty sign that said 'The Tunare Tree'.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, stand back!&quot; he said, as a forsaken revenant ran up to him with a bottle of liquor and a torch. Vven took both and stood in front of the tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, I learned this trick from an old friend Momur....that chick makes me look like an amateur.&quot; And with that he took a huge swig of alcohol, holding it in his mouth. Then he quickly brought the torch near his face, and with a woooosh spit out the drink into the fire. A huge flame shot from his mouth, hitting the tree and enveloping it in fire.<br>
<br>
Immediately, two eyes in the tree opened up as it started to burn. The woman's mouth started opening and closing as the branches began flailing about. &quot;Oh no!&quot; she wailed. &quot;It's End Game! I'm burning! I'm burninggg!&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven wiped his mouth and stood back proudly. &quot;Gods I love that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille addressed the demented dark elf from a distance. &quot;Vven, this is...fascinating. But we really need to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok ok ok.&quot; Vven said, steering them away from the tree, which was still moaning something about 'The tear! The tear!'. &quot;Let's hit the bar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A bar in Hate.&quot; Rocsalt murmured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Vven said, stopping in front of a large building. &quot;Here it is.&quot; A large sign above named the bar. It said: JEERS.<br>
<br>
Vven pushed his way in. The place was packed with undead, drinking and having a rather good time. When he entered, they all lifted their mugs of beer as one. &quot;Vven!&quot; they chorused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey.&quot; he waved, then turned to his companions. &quot;Where everybody knows your name.&quot; he said, motioning to a large unoccupied table to the side.<br>
<br>
Sitting down, Vven finally slowed down, and looked at Cami.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Cam. What do you want to talk about?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
Cami took a deep breath, and said, &quot;What do you know about Greig Veneficus?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven's blue skin drained almost of all color.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh boy. There's a name I try not to think about.&quot; he said, twitching nervously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me.&quot; Camille insisted.<br>
<br>
And he did.<br>

Who's been talking to you about him, and why? Vindayyan? Dooma? Moelle? We had made a pact not to talk about it to anyone, but who can trust dark elves?&quot; He laughed ironically. <br>
<br>
&quot;None of them.&quot; Camille said, &quot;It was Terris.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Terris?&quot; Vven laughed, then stopped abruptly, searching Camille's face for a lie. Camille just nodded slowly. &quot;That bitch. She DID pick my head, then. I knew it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven whistled sharply towards the bar. Within seconds an ire ghast bearing a tray of six mugs of ale appeared at the table and set them before the party. Rocsalt and Verdad took their mugs up, while Camille, Grelin and Talvarien let theirs sit. Vven took his mug and drained in down in one long quaff.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, let's see.&quot; Vven began, staring at the empty mug. &quot;It was a while ago, a year? Year and a half maybe before the whole End Game thing. I was on a double date with my pal Vindayyan, this dark elf shadowknight I was was guilded with at the time. Sort of like River but blue and bloodthirsty. I was dating Dooma, this inky cleric, and Vinny was with this teir'dal wizard chick, Moelle. Both of us thought we were getting laid for sure that night, until the girls show up, and Dooma introduces her idiot cousin Randolf, a....hells, I forget his class. Probably didn't have a class, too damned stupid to learn one. The kid was sort of gangly and awkward for a dark elf, and...slow, I guess is the word. Freakin' moron, would laugh like an idiot, even if no one was saying anything. Me and Vinny exchange looks cause with Happy the Classless Dope with us, getting these chicks out of their gear and into the shadows was going to be more difficult than banking in Felwithe. But, we go out anyway, Vinny having brought two jugs of Black Poison, and the five of us head to the moon to see what trouble we can get into.<br>
<br>
Moe ports us into Dawnshroud Peaks cause she 'loves the wolves'. So we spend some time killing wolves, getting a little wasted on the Black, setting the wolves on fire and watching them run off howling, when this raid ports in. They're wearing a mix of armor, none of them looking like they could take on Crushbone with the way they're milling about and ignoring orders the leader is desperately calling out. We all are hiding, old dark elf trick, and none of them see us.<br>
<br>
'Pickup raid, looks like.' Vinny whispers to me, and I nod, smelling disaster. And then Vinny starts smiling all nasty like, and I'm smiling, and mouth 'Pickup raid' to the girls and now they're smiling, and Randolf, he's smiling cause he's an idiot, and then he starts with that stupid laugh of his, and Vinny kicks him till he shuts up.<br>
<br>
So, this raid finally gets its crap together, and we, too drunk to think twice about this, sorta mix ourselves in in the back. They don't even notice. And they start marching along a hillside, and end up in front of this old castle.<br>
<br>
In we go with the raid, and they are a freakin' mess. They have like three pullers and two tanks and the tanks are trying to plow by just marching ahead but the pullers are getting angry they aren't allowed to pull so they start pulling anyway, and pretty soon we're fighting mobs that we're walking into and mobs that are being added by the pullers and it's like a joke. At this point, just to keep US alive I'm mezzing like nuts, and Dooma is healing Vinny cause he's getting his hands in it, and Moe thank Inny ISN'T using areas for once. But it's pretty bad, and I'm pretty drunk. I don't know to this day how I was even able to cast, I was so gone from the booze. I was literally hallucinating. I'm looking at one of the tanks at one point and suddenly he looks like this minotaur, so I poke Vinny and point, and Vinny sticks him with the sword and he dies and then he looks like the tank again. Ooops, ah well. Black Poison is some strong crap, let me tell you.<br>
<br>
We stopped doing anything at that point, after we killed one of the raid, and just hung out in the back, watching. This raid would have wiped for sure if not for the size of it. And deeper and deeper into this place we go.<br>
<br>
Then we get to this one place where like four halls are intersecting and the raid is jamming in and I'm thinking, aggro city, they are gunna pull everything within 100 feet. So I grab the girls' wrists and pull them after me and Vinny into this one room we just cleared and wait. And Dooma's like 'Where's Randolf?' and Vinny sighes and rolls his eyes, while she goes off to find her cousin. After a moment she comes back with Idiot Boy, who's giggling and Vinny has to backhand him to shut him up, before the raid heard we were in the backroom and wondered why we weren't with the rest of them. So I pass around the bottle and we juice up, and wait. And sure enough after a few moments, we hear them start fighting and yelling add, add, add. I guess they lost their other chanter earlier or he gated or something, cause they keep yelling add add add and I just keep on drinking while they start screaming and this goes on for a while and then finally stops. <br>
<br>
After all the noise finished I invis up and check out the room. Everybody's dead, the mobs, the raid, everybody. There's more blood than when Vinny tried to pierce his ear with a dagger when we were kids. So I call in the rest of them to see, and Dooma goes 'Rezz them?' and I go 'Nah' and Vinny suggests, 'Loot the mobs?' and I go 'Yeah!'. So we start rummaging through the dead, but they don't have nothing, cept this one, has this key. And go figure, the room has a locked door. So I'm looking at Vinny going &quot;Key?' and Vinny's wasted enough to say 'Sure.' so we put the key in the door and click we're in.<br>
<br>
Nothing in the room cept this big glowing gem, the size of man. And Randolf that idiot goes 'Oooh, sparkly!' and touches it, and POOF he disappears. Dooma starts cursing and saying we gotta go get him, so we all against our better judgement touch the gem and POOF we go too, into this room where Randolf is running around like the dope he is with three mobs on him. Now, we have a chanter, a tank, a cleric, a wiz and a moron, and it's only three mobs, so mezz mezz chop chop boom we kill them. Then Vinny kicks Randolf and Dooma kicks Randolf and we look around and see there's only one way out, through this door at the other room and up these steps. I'm thinking, let's just have Moe port us the hells out of here, but Vinny wants to look up the steps, so up we go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven stopped speaking for a moment, lost in thought. Then he pointed to Camille's untouched mug.<br>
<br>
&quot;You going to drink that?&quot; he asked. Camille shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't mind me.&quot; Vven said, picking it up and draining it. Then putting the empty mug down on the table, he continued.<br>

And it's occupied. By this...blob of purple snot, just...gross. It's got eyes and a mouth, and two arms, and its sorta floating there, and we're getting sick looking at it when it notices us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Greig...&quot; Camille murmured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Vven said, looking up from his empty mug for a moment. &quot;The thing opens its maw and growls 'After all this time, invaders in the home of Grieg Veneficus! Prepare to meet thy doom!' or some flowery crap like that. But Vinny, quick as a whip says 'You Greg?' and the thing says, 'I am Grieg.' and Vinny says, 'Well you can thank us later, man. We just killed a raid that was on their way to kill you.' Randolf goes to say something but I just kick him, and he howls and shuts up. Probably the smartest move he ever made. And this Grieg thing floats over to us and it's like staring and I can hear Moelle starting to murmur an evac. And then the thing smiles, freakin' SMILES, the ugliest smile you ever seen, and says 'Thank you.' I almost fell over. Thank you!<br>
<br>
So Vinny, being the gentleman he is, offers the bottle of Black to this thing, and the thing looks at it for a second, and then takes it in one drippy hand, takes it to his lips, and CHUGS it. Chugs Black Poison straight, like it was water. We're just staring at this thing, half glad he polished the bottle off cause no WAY I'm bringing that bottle to my lips after he wrapped his around it, when he goes two shades darker purple and pukes all over the floor. Randolf the idiot starts laughing and someone kicks him, Moelle I think, and Grieg is sort of embarrassed and looking at Randolf like he wanted to kill him. And he's sorta wobbling now, and I'm thinking, this thing is as wasted as we are.<br>
<br>
So Vinny says, 'Why you in here all alone, man?' and the thing starts going off on Luclin trapped him there, and he wasn't strong enough in that form to get out, and how he hates her, and rambling on and on, cursing Luclin worse than some of the best teir'dal ranters I have heard. Then the thing starts, crying, and mixing in crying and cursing and we're all standing there looking at it feeling sorta disgusted. Then the thing looks up and says, 'You got through the traps, you can get me out of here!' and I'm thinking no friggin' way and say 'Yeah sure man, we'll get you out'. Vinny gives me this look but I just shrug but this thing is so happy Vinny just goes with it. 'Yeahyeah, no problem man.'. Well, the floating grape goes to leave down the stairs, but it's so wasted it crashes into the wall instead. &quot;You're too gone to go now.' Vinny says, looking at it trying over and over to walk through the wall. 'Let's sober you up a little, sit down, play cards or something.'<br>
<br>
'Cards?' the blob says. And Vinny nods and pulls out his old deck of cards he had intended to use for strip poker with the girls before the idiot cousin showed up, and some dice. He motions for us to sit down, so we all do, near the blob thing in a circle.<br>
<br>
'Let's play Pain/Fear.' Vinny says. 'You know what that is?' Old Teir'dal card game, played with a deck and dice. Grieg just says 'No.' so Vinny starts telling him the rules, five players, each gets so many cards, you can only play a card off the top of your deck on the player to your left, and you have choices, Pain or Fear. The guy you play your card on has to play the card off the top of HIS deck against you, and you have the option of Pain, killing his card if its weaker than yours, or Fear, sending his card to the bottom of his deck if it is stronger than yours, which is hard. Both players roll the dice, add the total to the cards value, compare, and the high total wins the hand. Fun game. Something to do. Hells, we were still wasted ourselves, somehow playing Pain/Fear with a purple turd didn't seem too odd.<br>
<br>
Well, Grieg gets this shifty look in his eyes, and goes behind the bed and pulls out this glowing rock. He comes back and sits down and drops the rock in the middle of us. 'There.' he goes, 'Now that will stop anyone using magic from cheating.'<br>
<br>
'What's that?' I ask, and he smiles all sly like.<br>
<br>
'Something I created.' he said looking all nasty. 'It puts up a radius that cancels all magic, in case one of you tries to alter what the cards look like.'<br>
<br>
Bah, paranoid bastard. Plus, it was exactly what I DID intend to do, so he sort of crimped my game style.<br>
<br>
Vinny starts dealing out the cards to Grieg, me, Dooma and Moe. Then Randolf is standing there, and goes 'hey I wanna play.' Like the idiot knows how to play Pain/Fear. Plus, it was a five person game, no room. We just laughed and called him names. We didn't let poor Randolf play in any Pain/Fear games. Vinny told him to watch and learn and Randolf grumbles and stands there, sorta drooling watching.<br>
<br>
'I hate kids.' Greig said, staring weird like at Randolf. Vinny's dealing, making small talk, saying 'Yeah me too, always playing on my damned lawn.' which starts Moe off laughing like a nut, cause there are no lawns in Neriak. <br>
<br>
'Are there many children like this one out there still?' Greig asks.<br>
<br>
'Kids?' Vinny says, dealing. 'No kids man, most of the children up here went back to Norrath after we figured out how to get back to the moon.'<br>
<br>
'The way back was discovered?' Grieg says, all shocked like.<br>
<br>
'Yeah man a while ago, how long you been IN here?' Vinny says, still dealing out the cards. But Grieg just starts mumbling crazy like again, and then says 'The children laughed and threw garbage at me, when they forced me in here. I hate them.'<br>
<br>
'You gunna jabber or play cards?' Vinny said. And Grieg mumbles something else, and then turns over his card. It's a ten. Vinny is sitting to his left, so turns over HIS card, and its a 7. So Vinny asks him if he wants to Pain or Fear. Grieg says Pain, figuring his card is already higher, that he'll be able to get rid of Vinny's 7 no problem. They both roll, and Grieg roll a 1 and Vinny gets a 6. That's Vinny, luck of the halflings. So they total at Grieg with an 11 and Vinny with a 13, and Vinny shakes his head sadly and tells Grieg to bury his card. Greig is sorta pissed but goes to do it.<br>
<br>
When SUDDENLY, Randolf starts braying like a damned donkey and pointing at Grieg and laughing, going 'He can't play Pain/Fear! He sucks!' an all sorts of stupid crap. And Grieg's face is getting more and more purple, and I want to kick Randolf but I'm sitting so he just goes on and on.<br>
<br>
Well, Grieg floats up and looks at Randolf, and he's mad. 'What am I, here for your amusement?' he yells, but Randolf can't stop laughing. 'What am I a clown to you? I'm here to make you laugh?' He's angry as hells, but Randolf isn't getting it, and the rest of us get real quiet, not knowing what to do. And Grieg is fuming, 'You think this is funny, you stupid moron?' Grieg is going, and Randolf must finally figure it out, cause he stops giggling and starts staring at Grieg, who's circling him at this moment. And something must have frightened him, cause suddenly, his pants get this growing stain in the front, and he just lets go where he's standing, pissing himself. And Grieg looks at the stain and smiles, and then all the anger goes out of his voice. 'Yeah, that was sorta funny, me losing like that, huh?' he says all nice like, and starts to laugh. Well, we're all on edge, and Randolf starts to giggle with him, thinking its ok. And then Grieg laughs some more, and damned if it wasn't infectious, all of us start laughing, I mean tears from your eyes laughing, Grieg laughing the loudest of all, Randolf right along with him.<br>
<br>
And then suddenly Grieg stops laughing and grabs Randolfby the arm and opening that big weird mouth of his, takes a bite out of the kid's neck. <br>
<br>
Blood gushes everywhere and w're just sitting there in shock and Randolf is making these gurgling noises and Grieg is just biting away, at the kid's face, arms, taking out huge chunks. We're all getting drenched as randolf's getting eaten and before long he's nothing but a piles of bloody flesh and we're all in a daze and Moelle is staring real hard at the glowing rock thinking the same thing I'm thinking....no evac with that thing cancelling magic.<br>
<br>
'Let's play cards.' Grieg says suddenly, as if nothing happened, and floats down again.<br>
<br>
'Um, sure.' Vinny says, trying to be cool, but his hands are shaking. It's not every day you see someone get eaten, you know?<br>
<br>
'Hate kids.' Grieg said again. 'I'd kill them all if I could.' <br>
<br>
'That's cool, man.' Vinny says, playing a card on Dooma, who's not even watching, she's just looking at her dead cousin.<br>
<br>
'I could you know,' Grieg rambles, 'When I get out of here I'm going to talk to a few creatures I know, and kill all the kids. On Norrath, they are now?'<br>
<br>
'Yeah yeah.' Vinny says, trying to tune him out. 'Dooma, you going to play or what?' but Dooma's still staring at the bloody cousin.<br>
<br>
'How you going to kill them?' Moelle asks timidly. I haven't ever heard Moe timid, but we were all a little rattled.<br>
<br>
'Drown them.' Grieg said.<br>
<br>
'That's going to take some time.' I said, poking Dooma in the side so we could get the game done and find some way out of there. Dooma came out of her stare and made a bad play and Vinny took her card, but I don't think he cared if he won or lost at that point.<br>
<br>
'I'll get them all in one shot.' Grieg nodded. 'Shift the moon off its orbit, mass flooding on Norrath, earthquakes, the works... lock up the portals to Luclin...let them all drown...&quot;<br>
<br>
'How you going to move the moon?' I asked, intrigued despite the situation.<br>
<br>
'Rockets...' he whispered. 'With some help...'<br>
<br>
Well at the time, this was before the gnomes and all started talking about rockets and jet packs and stuff, so I didn't know what the hells he was talking about.<br>
<br>
'Cool.' I said, playing a card on Moelle. But Moelle, eyes wide listening to Grieg, had a brainstorm, thank Inny.<br>
<br>
She stood up. 'Me and Dooma have to powder our noses. Excuse us.' And she grabbed Dooma by the hand and practically dragged her up the stairs out of the room. Me and Vinny caught the idea.<br>
<br>
'Um, yeah...' Vinny said, 'I have to go drain the weasel, I'll be right back.' and up he goes after the girls, leaving me alone with the Purple Blob from Outer Space. <br>
<br>
Grieg's not paying much attention, instead, reaching for the other bottle of Black Poison and starts drinking it.<br>
<br>
'I'm gunna smoke, if you don't mind.' I said, and then made a show of patting my pockets. 'Damned, Vinny has my smokes, I'll be right back.' Grieg just nods and keeps drinking, and I get up and hurry out after them. Then minute i get out the door, Moelle starts chanting and we port the hell out.<br>
<br>
I have never been so damned happy to be out of somewhere. Dooma is freaking out, saying 'How I am I going to tell Uncle Dvinn his son is dead??' and I'm like 'Ambassador Dvinn is your uncle??!' and you think you know a chick and all...<br>
<br>
Well Vinny suggests we just STFU and pretend like Randolf never came out with us. And after a while, Dooma sees this is a good idea and we agree to never mention this again. And that was the end of our relationship with THOSE two chicks.<br>
<br>
But me and Vinny, well we never said a thing to nobody after that. Until, now that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
And that being said, without asking Vven reached out for Grelin's untouched ale, and began drinking it down, the ghosts of his past fading from his eyes with each gulp. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 396<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/11/03 9:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Sooo...&quot; Vven said brightly, putting down the mug. &quot;Hookers, anyone?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hookers?&quot; Verdad asked, eyes lighting up.<br>
<br>
&quot;The finest female revenants Hate has to offer.&quot; Vven said, nodding. &quot;Inny and I were talking; they already dress like hookers, so why not put 'em to work?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How much?&quot; Verdad ask, standing up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Free, just tell them Big Inky sent them to you.&quot; Vven said, and then pointed up a ramp in the back of the bar. &quot;Up there, and to the left. Don't go right, that's Inny's room, and he'd have to kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Up and left, thanks Vven.&quot; Verdad said, hurrying up the ramp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Up and left, thanks Vven.&quot; Talvarien said, getting up.<br>
<br>
&quot;SIT down, Talv.&quot; Camille warned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does Verdad get all the love?&quot; Talvarien whined.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Vven whispered nastily. &quot;They're all diseased.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ack!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want, choir girls?&quot; Vven shrugged, &quot;This is Hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven,&quot; Camille asked. &quot;Do you think Grieg will do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do what?&quot; Vven asked blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shift the moon, drown Norrath.&quot; she clarified.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh, if that crazy bastard can, he will.&quot; Vven said, nodding. Then his brow furled. &quot;Wait, why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Long story, Vven, and we have to go.&quot; Camille said hastily, standing up. &quot;Tell Verdad thank you for the ride up, when he's done. And that Camille asked him to fill you in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He won't be out for hours, they probably have him handcuffed to the bed in a harness by now.&quot; Vven complained. &quot;What's going on? Is Grieg loose?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; Camille said, as her companions gathered around her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes??!&quot; Vven exclaimed. &quot;Oh boy...hmm, I wonder if that rocket-thing he wants to push the moon with can even be made...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's what I'm going to find out right now.&quot; Camille said. &quot;Grelin, you know where to go?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whack-a-Gnome?&quot; Grelin guessed, starting to chant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye. Ak'Anon.&quot; Camille confirmed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Punt the old geezer once for inky!&quot; Vven called, as the four disappeared. Then he glanced down at Talvarien's untouched ale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grieg is loose...people are so going to die.&quot; he murmured, and kicked back the last ale with a long draught. Then he turned to the loathsome lich behind the bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go tell the guys in the front to double time it.&quot; Vven ordered. The lich nodded and hurried off. Vven stared off after him, but his focus was elsewhere<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a feeling this place is going to fill up.&quot; he murmured. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 399<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/12/03 12:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> They landed at the druid ring in Steamfront Mountains with Luclin's crescent high in the sky. Midnight, from the look of it, or somewhere about there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will they even be awake?&quot; Talvarien asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;If they aren't,&quot; Camille said, &quot;They will be. This is too important, and if I know Whizbang, he'll want to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
They made their way down the path towards Ak'Anon, City of the gnomes.<br>
<br>
After a short walk, they came to the front of a tiny house. Other houses of similiar size dotted the area outside Ak'Anon. But while the other houses were dark and quiet, this one had every light in the house on. The sign on the mailbox said &quot;Dustyboots&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like they're awake.&quot; Rocsalt commented, looking at the house, which came up to his chin in height.<br>
<br>
Cami stooped over to knock on the tiny door. But before she could, she was suddenly grabbed from behind violently, two powerful arms wrapping around her and knocking all the air from her lungs, lifting her off her feet. Talvarien reacted instantly, dancing back, drawing his bow.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; her attacker roared in her ear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk.&quot; Cami gasped. &quot;Put...me...down.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kk.&quot; her assailant said, dropping her suddenly. She landed on her rump. A huge ogre beamed a smile down at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good Tunare, Rammie.&quot; Talvarien exclaimed. &quot;What are you doing sneaking around at night? Doesn't Whizbang let you in the house? I almost shot you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Powpowpowpow?&quot; Ramluk asked, looking ashamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, powpowpowpow.&quot; Talvarien said, already sorry he had snapped at the gentle ogre. Ramluk looked crushed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me helps Miz Cami up.&quot; Ramluk offered, grabbing Cami by the arm. With a yank that almost took her arm out of its socket, he dragged her to her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks, Rammie.&quot; Cami said, shoulder throbbing. &quot;I got it now, big guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Grelin.&quot; Ramluk smiled, recognizing the druid who would port in with treats Cami made weekly for him. Ramluk was formerly of Razor's Edge, and when the guild folded, ended up 'adopted' by Whizbang's wife Pedi, much to Whizbang's horror and dismay. Gnomes shouldn't keep anything larger than the house as a pet, he was quoted as saying. Shut up, his wife was quoted to have replied. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hi mister.&quot; Ramluk waved at Roc. Then he squinted, mouth dropping open. &quot;ROCSALT!&quot; he exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, ya big oaf.&quot; Rocsalt said amiably, as Ramluk grabbed him in a bear hug. Ram didn't let go until Rocsalt had a coughing fit, and then dropped him to the ground, and beamed at him. Roc landed with a little more grace than Camille, but barely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where Logi and Fang?&quot; he asked innocently, looking around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, Logi.&quot; Rocsalt said, getting control of his lungs again. How was he going to explain to this grown ogre with the mind of a child about death? &quot;Ah, Logi, Ram, is...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;...with River now.&quot; Grelin finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Kk.&quot; Ramluk said, face sad. &quot;And Fang too?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rocsalt gave Grelin a thankful look. &quot;Fang too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They be having fun with Big Momma.&quot; Ramluk nodded sagely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I sure hope so.&quot; Roc said quietly, and then didn't say anymore.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rammie,&quot; Camille said. &quot;I need to talk to Whizbang.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk leapt in front of the door suddenly and crossed both arms. &quot;No no.&quot; he said. &quot;No visitors allowed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille sighed. This was proving difficult. &quot;Rammie, it's really important. Whizbang will want to see me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gnome sleeping.&quot; Ramluk said. <br>
<br>
&quot;With all the lights on?&quot; Talvarien asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miz Pedi say!&quot; Ramluk said emphatically. &quot;No visitors! She say Ramluk be watchdog!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Rammie,&quot; Camille began again. &quot;Go tell Miss Pedi to wake up Whiz...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk, what is going on out there?&quot; came a woman's voice inside. The bolt was drawn and the door swung open. In the tiny doorway was an equally tiny gnome woman, hair tied up in a bun, with a thermometer in her hand. Pedi and her tinkered cleric tools. &quot;I thought I told you...&quot; Then she stopped short, taking in the crew on her doorstep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cami! You got my message, thank Brell!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Rammie, why is she outside? I thought I told you to let in Camille if she....&quot; Then she noticed the ogre looking down at his feet. &quot;You forgot, didn't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Ramluk said to his toes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Message?&quot; Camille asked blankly. &quot;What message?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't get it?&quot; Pedi said, face confused. &quot;I sent it this evening....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been away for the night, Pedi.&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then how did you.....&quot; she began, perplexed, then shrugged it off. &quot;No matter. Get shrunk and inside right away.&quot; She handed Camille a vial of liquid, and then fetched three more, counting the others. Camille drank hers and began to glow faintly, as the potion shrunk her down to Pedi's size.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, gentlemen, drink this if you intend to come in. But NO NOISE if you do.&quot; Pedi handed the potions out and waited for them to shrink. Then she turned to Ramluk. &quot;Ok, Rammie, listen if you want anymore gnome cookies tonight. NO ONE ELSE is to see Whizbang, even if the sky is falling, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Miz Pedi.&quot; Ramluk nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now let's go in, and hope he wakes up.&quot; Pedi said, pulling Camille towards the door impatiently. &quot;They found him awake, but he's been asleep since they got him to the house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who, Whiz?&quot; Camille asked, frightened by Pedi's urgency.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Whiz.&quot; Pedi said. &quot;Come come.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; Camille asked, alarmed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang had a heartattack.&quot; Pedi answered her gravely. &quot;And before he passed out, he was asking for YOU.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 400<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/12/03 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Heart attack!&quot; Camille exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; Pedi said,closing the door behind them as they entered and ushering them into the kitchen. &quot;I thought I lost him...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ped, you're a cleric.&quot; Talvarien pointed out. &quot;Just heal him or...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Heal him.&quot; Pedi repeated ironically. &quot;Yes, I could heal him. If he was ripped apart by wild dogs I could resurrect him and heal him as if he had never had a scratch. But Whizbang is old, Talvarien. Older than any of you realize. And with all of our power, all of our magic, the one thing we cannot do is alter time. And eventually, time gets us all. His heart, bless him, is bigger than anyone knows, but it is old. And when it wears out, there's nothing any healer can do for my old man except bury him.&quot; She said this matter-of-factly, but her face bore lines in it Camille had never seen before. Whizbang wasn't the only one growing old.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did this happen?&quot; Camille asked gently.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was found in Greater Fay, at the spires.&quot; Pedi replied, putting on a pot of tea. &quot;A wizard from Lucid Chimera ported and heard him groaning off the path close by. He recognized him and brought him to me.&quot; Suddenly she dropped one of the teacups she was gathering, hands shaking, and it crashed to the floor, shattering. She looked up from the broken porcelin with tears in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was trying to get home.&quot; Pedi said, trembling, fighting back the tears that insisted on coming. &quot;He was trying to get back home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille wrapped her arms around the woman and let her sob quietly into her shoulder. After an uncomfortable minute, she wiped her eyes with her apron and smiled lamely at the striken foursome.<br>
<br>
&quot;Strong heart, my man has.&quot; she said. &quot;He's still with us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where was he before this?&quot; Camille asked, when Pedi had finished drying her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Bazaar, on the moon.&quot; Pedi said. Rocsalt and Grelin exchanged a quick glance. &quot;He was at our stall, selling the gadgets he tinkers. Was trying to get enough money to buy me Hand of Virtue for our anniversary.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The moon?&quot; Camille echoed her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Pedi said. &quot;The wizard who found him said he wasn't talking, just moaning in pain. And then, just before he passed out, he said 'Wyldechylde', or at least that's what the wizard thought he said, with that rebreather on his face. Then he was out, and the poor wizard thought he was dead. But the rebreather was still pumping its gills in and out, so he rushed him back home to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Rebreather?&quot; Camille asked, confused. &quot;Whiz was wearing a rebreather?&quot; Rebreathers were tinkered masks that provided the wearer with air, used in underwater exploration. Why Whizbang would be wearing one in the Bazaar struck her as odd.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, he has a whole wall full of them at the stall.&quot; Pedi said. &quot;So, I'm not really sure if he was calling for you, Camille, but since River left us, you're the only Wyldechylde I know, so I had you sent for. Do you have any idea why he asked for you? Have you done any business with him lately?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Camille said honestly. &quot;I haven't really left the house much since River died. Grelin runs most of my errands for me, and I've pretty much kept to myself. I haven't seen Whiz since...the funeral.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Odd.&quot; Pedi said. &quot;Well, maybe the wizard was wrong. Maybe he said something else.&quot; She bent down to sweep up the broken cup with a small brush and pan. &quot;With a mask over his face, he could have said...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WYLDECHYLDE!&quot; came a garbled cry from another room. The voice was recognizable, but the name was cried in horror. And then another noise, beep beep beep, getting louder and faster. Pedi dropped her brush and pan and ran off into other room, Camille and the men following her.<br>
<br>
Whizbang was awake.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 401<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/12/03 10:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Damnation, woman!&quot; Whizbang cried from the bed as they poured into the room. His skin was a sallow yellow, and he looked older than Camille had ever remembered him looking before. One of his thin arms was encircled by a metal cuff, which in turn had a heavy metal cord attached to some gizmo. The machine was making the beeping noise, which doubled in pace as they entered the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang, calm down...&quot; Pedi began, as the beeping increased.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I made you this damned thing,&quot; he barked, pointing his free arm at the machine. &quot;I didn't expect you to test it out on me!&quot; His bald head was turning red, a common Whizbang moment when he got excited. Each shade it went, the machine beeped more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz, you had a...&quot; Pedi tried, nerves frayed. Camille could hear it in her voice.<br>
<br>
Whizbang's eyes found Grelin first. &quot;Grelin, druid, good. Listen, boy. Get your ass to the Jade Tiger Inn and find my man Thallas. Tell him Whizbang said to start spreading the news to STAY AWAY FROM LUCLIN!&quot; The machine's beeping increased, beep beep beep. Whizbang tried to undo the cuff from his arm, but he was still weak, clawing at it inneffectively. He looked back at Grelin. &quot;I said GO boy! Tell Thallas to move as fast as selos will take him, and to tell the other bards, NO ONE IS TO PORT TO LUCLIN!&quot;<br>
<br>
Grelin did not hesitate a moment longer. With a word, he disappeared in a flash of green light.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz, STOP pawing at the pulse machine!&quot; Pedi yelled, as Whizbang attempted to free himself again. &quot;I got Camille like you asked! Now stop before you give yourself another...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille is here? Where?&quot; he said, looking frantically. Then he found her with his eyes across the room, seeing her for the first time. <br>
<br>
&quot;Camille!&quot; he exclaimed, trying to get out of the bed, then cursing as he realized the machine had him tethered on a short leash. &quot;Damnation get me OUT of this thing woman!&quot; But Pedi did no such thing, just tried to gently push him back onto the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Camille!&quot; Whizbang cried again. &quot;River, you cremated him yes? You burned the body?&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille was struck dumb by the question. But the frantic look in his eyes made her answer. &quot;Yes, Whiz, you were at the funeral. We spread the ashes in Kithicor River....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what in hells...&quot; Whizbang said, as the machine once more increased the beeping. He started to pitch forward, and then pulled out of it. 'Then it wasn't him, or it was, but it wasn't...DAMMIT WOMAN GET ME OFF THIS MACHI...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;GO TO BED!&quot; Pedi demanded, cold-cocking him across the chin, hard. Whizbang dropped like a stone back onto the bed, unconscious. The machine stopped making noises so frantically and settle to an even pitch. Pedi nursed her knuckles as she looked down at her husband. &quot;There, better.&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo,&quot; Talvarien said, inching slowly behind Rocsalt. &quot;If I join up with Walkers, this is the medical plan?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice right hook.&quot; Roc said, eyebrows raised, impressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;His chin is as hard as his head.&quot; Pedi said, &quot;It's his heart I'm worried about. And what in the world was he ranting about, about River and porting to the moon?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Something's going on up there.&quot; Camille said. &quot;It sounds like Whiz got caught in the middle of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know what he's talking about?&quot; Pedi said, fixing Camille with a look that demanded more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Pedi.&quot; Camille said. &quot;It's a long story. It's why I came...&quot;<br>
<br>
Then a knock at the door. Pedi hurried to answer, and came back in with Grelin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Message delivered.&quot; Grelin said.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Rocsalt burst out coughing again. Pedi grabbed him by the hand and dragged him from the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Open your mouth.&quot; she ordered.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's ok, Pedi, just a thing I picked u...&quot; Roc began.<br>
<br>
&quot;OPEN YOUR MOUTH.&quot; she repeated.<br>
<br>
Rocsalt looked down at her, looking up at him from just below his belt, and decided the wisest thing to do was to comply. He crouched down in front of her and opened his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, Roc, but no one goes near Whizbang with a possible cold.&quot; she said, drawing out a tongue depresser from her apron and applying it to his tongue.<br>
<br>
&quot;S hok.&quot; Roc said.<br>
<br>
&quot;This cough, flemmy?&quot; she asked, staring into his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nuh.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Swollen glands?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yuh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Runny nose?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nuh.&quot;<br>
<br>
She withdrew the depresser. &quot;Near the root of your tongue, your skin is turning yellow. I've never seen that before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I got a mouthful of spores from some shroom on the moon.&quot; Rocsalt explained. &quot;Yellow? Really?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really.&quot; she said. &quot;It doesn't sound like a common cold, but when you're in there with Whiz, you wear this, from now on.&quot; She handed him a white gauze mask. He didn't argue with her; just tied it around his face covering his nose and mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Furthermore.&quot; she said, &quot;I want you to come back to see me tomorrow. I don't like the looks of this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes ma'am.&quot; Rocsalt said dutifully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pedi,&quot; Camille called from Whizbang's room. &quot;He's coming to.&quot;<br>

Pedi and Rocsalt hurried in to join them.<br>

The beeping started kicking up almost instantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grelin, did you find Thallas?&quot; Whizbang asked, spotting the druid. Grelin nodded. &quot;Good.&quot; Whizbang said said, and the beeping started to stabilize again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, before I send everyone home, you are going to relax, Whiz.&quot; Pedi warned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrrrumph.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Easy for you to say. What the hells happened to me? Heart attack?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you old fool.&quot; Pedi replied. &quot;And you almost gave yourself another one ten minutes ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Heart attacks, bah.&quot; Whizbang grumbled. &quot;I suppose I am staying in bed for a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot; Pedi said. &quot;Or you'll wish you were dead.&quot; She gave him a warning look that made his mouth frown.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz,&quot; Camille said. &quot;I need to talk to you rather urgently. Is this ok, or do you need rest?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And I need to talk to you too, Camille.&quot; Whiz said. &quot;And then you better stock up on shrink potions woman,&quot; he said to Pedi, &quot;because a lot of important people are going to be coming to see me, I imagine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Talk to him now Cami.&quot; Pedi said, &quot;But if his beeper gets going like it did last time, I'm hitting him with a bat and sending you home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation woman!&quot; Whizbang exclaimed, glowering at his doctor. The machine started beeping faster. &quot;I can control my own...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Beep beep beep.&quot; Pedi said, looking around the room. &quot;Hmm, no bat. Talvarien, give me your bow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation.&quot; Whizbang muttered one final time, and then made a concentrated attempt to lay back and relax. The beeping slowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; Pedi said, nodding. &quot;Now you two talk, and keep it steady like that. Let Camille talk first, so you don't rile yourself up again. Stay nice and calm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice and calm....&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;So, what do you need to tell me Camille?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Camille said, trying to decide where to start, &quot;A few nights ago, I had this nightmare....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's nice,&quot; Whizbang interrupted. &quot;A few hours ago, I blew up the Bazaar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You WHAT?&quot; Pedi exclaimed.<br>
<br>
Beep beep beep beep.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no.&quot; Whizbang said smugly, face grimacing as the machine kept beeping. &quot;Go on, Camille.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You...blew up the bazaar?&quot; Talvarien asked, mouth open.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe Whiz should tell us this first.&quot; Camille said slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea.&quot; Whizbang said, making a deliberate effort to steady his breathing. The machine slowed down again. And Whizbang began to speak. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 403<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/13/03 6:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;I was up at the Bazaar, at my tinkering stand, trying to sell some of my surplus inventory for...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For Hand of Virtue for you and Pedi's anniversary.&quot; Talvarien finished, nodding. Whizbang favored him with a scowl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you like to finish the story, ranger?&quot; he growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shutting up!&quot; Talvarien said hastily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. For Hand of Virtue for Pedi for our anniversary.&quot; Whiz continued on. &quot;Typical day in the Bazaar. People are selling every piece of junk they could find in their neighbor's garbage. And its slow,, everyone is selling, no one is buying. To make matters worse, my stall location is right on top of the stables, so I get to listen to those idiot casino people while smelling horse crap all day. This is doing nothing to improve my mood.<br>
<br>
On top of it, it's hot and getting hotter. I don't ever recall it being that hot in the Bazaar, and I've been there when it was packed to capacity. It's like all the air vents intot the place were blocked or something, no ventilation at all. So I'm starting to sweat, the casino people are driving me nuts with their ridiculous odds and non-stop pitches, and I'm gagging as the heat is doing wonders for the horse crap....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you blew up the Bazaar!&quot; Talvarien exclaimed, caught up in the moment. &quot;So harsh!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whiz's beeper started up again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talv...&quot; Pedi warned, as the top of Whizbang's bald head started to go red.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shutting up!&quot; Talvarien said again, closing his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep it zipped, half-breed!&quot; Whizbang snarled, and then looked over quickly to Grelin, the other half-elf. &quot;Sorry Grelin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sok.&quot; Grelin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Whizbang continued. &quot;The smell was horrid. So, I took down one of the rebreathers from the wall and strapped it on. At least being able to breathe again helped lighten my mood a bit. I'm still sweating, and I can't drown out those damned casino people, but at least I don't have to smell what Mrs. Brown's nag ate for dinner.<br>
<br>
The day continues, and the air is getting warm enough to the point where I'm going to complain. I get up and go to the Nexus side bank, and stand in line, fussing with the straps of the rebreather, which are giving me a problem.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, and if I wasn't so close to the ground I would have never seen it, this metal canister rolls across the floor from the Nexus entrance. Looked like part of an aqualung, that tinkered crap I used to make before I learned how to do rebreathers. Just rolls across the floor, hits the bank wall and stops, clink. I glance over towards the exit to see who dropped it, but i don't anyone there. I turn back to the bank, and way across the Bazaar, I see another of these canisters roll out from the Shadowhaven entrance, to hit the bank over there.<br>
<br>
Now I'm curious, as I see yet another little air tank roll in on the Shadowhaven side, and then almost trip over two more rolling in from the Nexus side. It's odd, but was also, menacing, in some strange way. I didn't like what I was seeing at all, and, forgetting all about my difficult rebreather and its snarled fasteners, I leaned over to pick up one of the cans.<br>
<br>
I never got the chance. Suddenly, one by one, the valves at the end pop, and a faint faint green mist starts to seep out. Rapidly. And as the mist hits air, it starts to...billow or something. Like it was reacting with the air and expanding as it hit oxygen. Pretty soon the whole front of the Bazaar is in a light green haze, in...seconds, it seemed. And it was just getting bigger.<br>
<br>
I'm alarmed now, and open the door to the bank to alert the Bazaar officials. And tripped over a body. Everyone in the bank was dead, or dying. One banker was clawing at his throat, eyes bulging out of his sockets. He saw me in my rebreather and tried to pull it off my face. He didn't even reach me before he was down dead. I climbed up on a stool to look out onto the Bazaar, and it was the same across as far as I could see. Everyone was dead. I mean, EVERYONE was dead. We lost at least five Walkers up there, the Bazaar was in full swing. And all dead. Except for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille was staring at him wideeyed. &quot;All those people dead. And you were spared....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;....because of horseshit, yes.&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;No wonder you had a heartattack, Whiz!&quot; Pedi exclaimed. &quot;Seeing all those people dead....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!&quot; Whizbang replied. &quot;Takes more than mass-death to turn off my ticker. I've had your mother's cooking...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't equate my mother's cooking with a gas attack on the Bazaar!&quot; Pedi warned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever been around Ramluk after you toss him her leftovers?&quot; Whizbang rejoined.<br>
<br>
Beep beep beep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go on Whiz.&quot; Pedi said sweetly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Err...&quot; Whizbang said, slowing down his rapid breathing. &quot;Ok, where was I? Ah, everyone was dead. And then, what should come into the Bazaar, into the green clouds as if it were air, from both the Shadowhaven entrance and the Nexus entrance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Rocsalt said, intrigued by the entire story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shissar!&quot; Whizbang exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;The snakemen?&quot; Roc said in shock. &quot;From Shadowhaven?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; Whizbang confirmed. &quot;They poured in two by two, more and more, till the place was swarming with them. And yes, I realized the implications of how they entered. If they came through Shadowhaven and the Nexus, then Shadowhaven most likely had suffered a similiar fate. They started picking through stalls, filling sacks with items. That's when I realized I was standing like a target on the stool, and jumped down and pulled one of the bankers bodies over me while I worked out what to do.<br>
<br>
Just in time too. Two shissar parked themselves outside the bank and started talking. They were talking their own language, but fortunately I learned shissar two weeks after we got to the moon, so other than some accent difficulty I had with it, I could understand them.<br>
<br>
'Is the Nexus disabled?' one said to the other.<br>
<br>
'Yes, Captain.' the other said, 'And he took care of the book there as well as the rest.'<br>
<br>
'Good.' the captain said. 'And the ports in?'<br>
<br>
'The cat outpost in the forest gave us trouble until the Grimlings overrode it, but it's secure now. Dawnshroud has been secure since two days ago, and Twilight was locked when Katta fell. We have the areas surrounded with that rock and set constantly in flames. Anyone porting in will find themselves trapped and burn to death.'<br>
<br>
'Excellent. Katta we will leave to the Coterie.' the captain said, and my skin is crawling now. Katta! The Geerlocks! Old friends, now gone. The death toll of people I knew was growing. If they had the force to take Katta, who knew if Seru was safe?<br>
<br>
'Seru was bloody, but over.' the lesser officer said, almost reading my mind.<br>
<br>
'Our people will maintain Shadowhaven and Seru.' the captain said. 'The Coterie will maintain Katta and the Grimlings can have Shar Vahl.'<br>
<br>
'They were to swarm Shar Vahl when we entered the Nexus. They outnumbered the cats ten to one, so I doubt there was any problem, sir.'<br>
<br>
'Good, good.' the Captain hissed. 'Now to the business of paying him for his help with keeping the outworlders from assisting.'<br>
<br>
'What are we to give him? So many things in here.'<br>
<br>
'He is to get every tinkered item, every piece of ore, every gem, every sheet of metal we can find. Also, meltable weaponry, anything not so infused with magic as to render it useless in a forge.'<br>
<br>
'Would simply be easier to impress the Grimlings to mine the ore he needs from acrylia...'<br>
<br>
'It was suggested.' the captain said. 'But that would put his project 'back a month'. So he insisted on all the metal from here. The Emperor agreed, so start on the Shadowhaven side, and sweep this area with your soldiers.'<br>
<br>
'Yes sir.' the lesser officer said, and then, louder. 'All you men, you know what to collect. Follow me to the Shadowhaven side, and we work towards Nexus.'<br>
<br>
His voice grew fainter as he drew away from the bank. I waited till I couldn't hear their hissing anymore, and climbed out from under the banker. I invised myself, and thought about gating out to warn people. I had no idea who this 'he' was that the two snakes had referred to, but apparently 'he' had masterminded the plan, locked out Norrath from the moon, selling out all the good people of Luclin for this roomful of metal. That pissed me off to no end.<br>
<br>
So, my decision was made. I quickly, invisibly, made my way back to my stall.<br>
<br>
I didn't waste any time, not knowing how long it would be before the snakes worked tehir way to my area. I stacked three cases of fire water and opened a fourth. Filling up a bowl with more fire water, I dropped a long coil of the twine I use for fuses for fireworks into it and let it soak. Then I took yet another bottle of fire water and poured it all over the unopened cases. Then, after doing a little math and calculating the best area of effect compared to other tinkers' stands, as well as the few people that liked to sell booze or fireworks, I shifted the boxes over 5 feet to the right. I then grabbed my soaked twine and fed one end into the whole mess, and snuck my way out of the Bazaar through the Nexus exit, laying the string down behind me. Finally I was out of string, but I was in the Nexus around the corner from the entrance.<br>
<br>
O'Keil's Embers was never put to better use than at that moment.<br>
<br>
The string caught fire instantly, and like the moons biggest firecracker, the fuse began to burn quickly. I turned to run to Netherbian Lair, to make sure it went off. They may have taken out every civilized area on the moon, but I was taking mess of them out in return.<br>
<br>
I turn to run, and smack face first into a human. But what armor! I felt as if I had run straight into a brick wall. Even with the rebreather over my face, my head throbbed. The human picked me up like a ragdoll and hung me in front of his face.<br>
<br>
'What are you doing, gnome?' he growled at me. The voice sent a chill right through me. But the visual was worse.<br>
<br>
It was River.<br>
<br>
Gods strike me dead if I am lying, but Riverdane Wyldechylde was holding me up as if I weighed nothing and looking at me with the most violent look I have ever seen on his face. And his face! His hair! All grey, as if he had painted himself the same shade of gray from head to foot. But his eyes, they showed no recognition of who I was, just hatred....and something else. Madness.<br>
<br>
So I'm swinging there, trapped, as the fuse burns its way back to my bomb in the Bazaar. I'm struggling, but River begins to shake me. And that's when I felt something like a hand clamp down on my heart, and my left arm starts getting this shooting pain.<br>
<br>
And then boom my supply of firewater goes up.<br>
<br>
Then boom boom boom as other flammables and explosives start to blow, pieces of the wall falling down as the smoke begins billowing from the Bazaar. River drops me and turns to gape at the smoking entrance, and I start trying to run, staggering as the pain becomes unbearable in my arm, knowing the big explosion I calculated hadn't happened yet.<br>
<br>
Then...<br>
<br>
BOOM. A tremendous ground shaking explosion, and I see the ceiling starting to fall onto the Bazaar, the Nexus. And meanwhile, my breath is growing short and I think I am going to pass out. So as my consciousness is going, I try to manage to gesture through my Greater Fay port, while the Bazaar is buried under rubble, and River begins cursing at the entrance like a crazy man. Just as I'm finishing the spell, and ready to die from the pain at this point, he turns to me. A rock falls from the ceiling and strikes him across his grey forehead, but he shrugs it off as if a fly, moving toward me with hate in his eyes. <br>
<br>
'YOU!' he says, reaching for me.<br>
<br>
But poof, I was gone.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;He certainly didn't act like the River I knew, but the likeness was too precise for me to be mistaken.&quot; Whizbang said with complete faith.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was Grieg the Geomancer.&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
Whizbang blinked. &quot;Greig Veneficus?&quot; he asked, disbelief etched on his face. &quot;Grieg Veneficus died locked in his castle on the moon many many years before River was ever a twinkle in Innoruuk's pants...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Camille interrupted, shaking her head. &quot;That's why I came here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your turn, my girl.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Why exactly DID you come here, other than my wife mistakenly thinking I was calling for you. I'm glad you came, but I was referring to River with 'Wyldechylde'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; Camille said, &quot;and maybe you can make some sense out of all of this, but you have to promise to stay calm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He promises.&quot; Pedi said, fixing him with a look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I promise, just ask Pedi.&quot; Whizbang said, settling back.<br>
<br>
And Cami filled Whiz in on every event that had transpired from her first nightmare.<br>
<br>
To his credit, Whizbang only sent the machine into convulsions twice during the entire tale, which Pedi excused, considering by the end of Cami's story, her own heart would have given her sick husband's a race.<br>
<br>
&quot;So that's why I'm here,&quot; Camille finished. &quot;CAN such a machine be built?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang's brows were furrowed as he contemplated her question. &quot;Well, obviously Grieg thinks so. And considering that he helped effectively seal off the moon, trapped River into a power source, broke free of a goddess' prison, I'd have to say we must assume he can and will. Fortunately, my little stunt in the Bazaar may have bought us time. Mining the ore through the Grimlings will put his 'project back a month'. Digging out the Bazaar will take about as long, if what I saw falling onto it continued to fall. Let's assume he will have to go the mining route now, which gives us a month and whatever time he needs to build this...thing that will move the moon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he shook his head, thinking on everything Camille had said. &quot;Amazing. Haunting, or possession, from my understanding, is usually a very personal thing, but somehow Grieg has figured out a way to actually bind a soul to this Geomancer's Stone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Camille said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, haunting comes in a few forms, but is usually from lifetimes of creating a bond with a place or object. When a person dies, according to most theologians, and backed by studies or talks with deities themselves, the spirit is free from the body. If the body is repairable, it has roughly three hours to be repaired and 'resurrected' through the aide of a cleric. That's all resurrection is...the cleric, or very skilled paladins, acting as a guide to bring the confused and lost soul back to its body, which your healing powers has restored. Druids, shaman, other healers can restore the body, but it takes a spiritual faith to guide the soul back. Clerics and paladins are taught those techniques, tho they think of them as more of a gift from their god, than the science it is. The mere force of their belief is what makes it possible. The other healers are focused on other things, the animal world, the world of nature, etc. and don't have that pure faith that they can raise the dead, so, lacking the conviction, also lack the strength to do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi frowned at how neatly he had turned her gift into some sort of act of zeal, but they had had that argument many times in the past, and she wasn't going to stop him now, while his beeper wasn't beeping.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, then we have those souls who move on, no longer able to rejoin their body. Some get old unoccupied bodies, like my guildee Bonlainy did, but these instances are extremely rare and more freak occurances than what would be considered the norm. Some other spirits would linger in their old homes and residences, bonding to a location and 'haunting' it. Others yet would bond to a nearby personal object. Lockets have been haunted by former possessers, even one lost spirit went so far as to haunt his old suit of armor and marched up and down the halls of Kaladim, driving the dwarves there to distraction until they were able to 'exorcise' the spirit out.<br>
<br>
Others, most spirits, would seek the god they worshiped, and then would be in that god's possession. In some cases, there would be a form of paradise, or hell, awaiting them, depending on that particular god's whims. In some cases, like Vven's, they continue on in spirit form, aiding their god. Others, like River, are sent to dream (a paradise? a hell? only River knew) until woken to protect their god, or godess, in this case. In River's case, the need to be able to protect his goddess put him into a physical form, in this 'soul casing', a living rock that could be powered by a soul. Similiar to the possessed suit of armor, except it is much much stronger, needing a raid force, if the battle you told me about was accurate, to destroy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille nodded, recalling how long it took Promethian Order to take down the four gargoyles in Terris' lair.<br>
<br>
&quot;So now Grieg is in possession of this living statue, and River is going to be consumed, soul gone, in.....a month? Two, at most, I'm thinking, in order to power this engine Grieg is going to use to move the moon. But Grieg's plan is flawed, very flawed, and will mean his destruction as well. He is foolish to not see that, but I have the feeling he knows, and his madness prevents him from caring. But his revenge is going to affect many many more than just the children, tho they will undoubtably suffer the most.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz,&quot; Camille asked, overwhelmed by the enormity of all of this, &quot;What can we do? CAN we do anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
The question hung in the air pregnantly. Every eye in the room watched the gnome, whose eyes were at the moment closed in thought.<br>
<br>
Then they blinked open, tired, but clear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; he said. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 405<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/14/03 1:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> &quot;We must keep this a secret.&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Secret?&quot; Talvarien exclaimed. &quot;Why not get CC, EA, Triality and the other guilds together and go in powpowpowpow and take back the moon? If PO alone could take on four of those gargoyles and Terris, it should be no prob...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because,&quot; Whiz said matter-of-factly. &quot;No matter how strong the ubers think they are, almost all of their power derives from magic. How many of them do you see walking around in fine steel plate? And with Grieg having discovered, for lack of a better word, these null stones that cancel magic, many of them would be walking into a slaughter. The Nexus is shut down. The portals are awash in fire, and anyone porting in will not only face that, but being stripped of all buffs and their magical items becoming mere useless trinkets. And even if they send the casters and melee bound on the moon, those few who still are, where would they end up? Most of them in the Bazaar, buried in rock. Or if not the Bazaar or the Nexus, spread out thinly over the face of the moon. No, Luclin is closed to us. So, instead, word will leak here, and a panic will begin.<br>
<br>
There are enough intelligent minds to know, just among the casters alone, what will happen if the moon shifts. The tides are controlled by the gravitational pull of Luclin. When Luclin grows closer to Norrath, the seas will rise up, swallowing the lower lands. People will flee to higher ground, but by then, earthquakes will shake the grounds, volcanos will rise and spew molten rock into the air, the world will be covered by ash. The ash will cloud the world and the suns rays would never touch it. Or, if the moon ends up in the wrong position, it may block the sun entirely, sending us into perpetual night and an ice age that will make Ice Clad look like a tropical paradise. Meanwhile, and this leads me to believe Grieg's allies are unaware of his plans, the same thing will be happening on Luclin, as the moon feels a greater tug from Norrath's pull. They will slowly draw toward one another, until they collide, and that will be the end of both worlds.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But they'll have time!&quot; Talvarien countered, &quot;Flee to the planes! Run away, port!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, the planes.&quot; Whizbang said gravely. &quot;Yes, that will be their last recourse. And with the books gone,they will have to mass port, and quickly. And what will happen then? Well, all the children and people of insufficient experience in their craft will be locked into the Plane of Knowledge, unable to enter the higher planes. With no way to formally train in the Plane of Knowledge, they will never advance high enough to enter Tranquility and beyond. Eventually that small Plane of Knowledge would fill, with no food imported, and no room for livestock and farmland. The planes that do not have hostile environments may be used for farmland, but all this would do would be to limit the living space. Sex of any kind would be made illegal, for fear of bringing more children into the world, more mouths to feed. Races would lose their heritage, having no homeland anymore, and the new nations would become the individual guilds, us and them. And all those souls that die on Norrath! The planes occupied by the gods would be filled to capacity! Eventually, as things become more desperate, guild would fall upon guild, as civilization breaks down and it becomes a contest of the strongest vs. the weak. Guild clerics would be the first targets, and the paladins, and even the necros, with their artificial way of resurrecting the dead. And then with lack of resurrection, life as we know it would eventually dwindle to the few strong, and then...die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mithaniel help us...&quot; Camille prayed out loud, picturing the destruction Whiz laid out and seeing plainly how possible it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, that's exactly what we'll need.&quot; Whizbang said, hearing her whispered prayer. &quot;Let me tell you my plan.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 407<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/16/03 1:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wake (Mithaniel's Handmaiden, Breathe III)</span><hr size=1> I will stall the guilds here. Whizbang  said, Tell them the Shissar, Coterie and Grimlings have formed an alliance and have driven out the Norrathians.  I will explain the situation with the portals and hope they arent too pigheaded to listen.  Ill let them know we have people on the moon working on remedying the situation.<br>
<br>
People, what people?  Talvarien asked.<br>
<br>
Whizbang raised his free arm and pointed at Camille.  You, Camille.  And the rest of you.<br>
<br>
Whiz Camille began.<br>
<br>
Hear me out. The gnome said, cutting off her protest.  We need to get Grieg taken out.  He is key to all of this.  You know what to look for.  You know the Geomancers Stone.  You would recognize Grieg.  Knowing your husbands eternal soul is at stake, you will have the will to go on where others may falter.  You have a tracker, a healer, and a puller.  You have a porter at your disposal.  And keeping it small, you have stealth, which is the most important thing.  Grieg must be separated from Rivers soul casing.  And the Geomancers Stone must be taken from Griegs possession.  Would you trust anyone else with Rivers soul, Camille?<br>
<br>
No. Camille said.<br>
<br>
As I expected.  Whizbang nodded.<br>
<br>
But Whiz, Camille said, It took Promethian Order with a full raid almost as much time as it took to down Terris to destroy those other statues.  How are we going to even touch Grieg?<br>
<br>
Thats where your little prayer is going to help us.<br>
<br>
Mithaniel Marr? Camille asked.<br>
<br>
Aye. Whizbang replied.  Paladins, as a class, have an almost obscene number of quested swords available to them, and only them.  The Soulfire, the Fiery Defender and Avenger, are just a fraction of the paladin-only weapons Marr with his obsession with honor through combat has created.  There is a little sought after weapon, covered by some obscure lore, by the name of  Earthcarver.  Have you ever heard of it?<br>
<br>
Earthcarver? Camille blinked.  No, never.<br>
<br>
I didnt think you would have.  Why it was ever conceived in the first place always seemed a mystery to me.  It is a weapon singular in purpose, and so fragile in its construction it can only be used once.  But its power, simple as it may be, is exactly what you need.<br>
<br>
What does it do? Camille asked.<br>
<br>
It can cut through anything.  Whizbang said.  A finishing blade, one that will not be hampered by shield, armor.or stone.  One swing and it destroys itself, but it cuts through anything like a hot knife through butter.<br>
<br>
Earthcarver. Camille repeated.  Where can I find the blade?<br>
<br>
You do not find it. Whizbang said apologetically.  You make it.<br>
<br>
Make it?<br>
<br>
Go to Mithaniel.  He will provide you with the instructions to construct the blade. Whizbang said.  The lore does not explain its creation, just that it is a quest given by the god Marr himself.<br>
<br>
Whiz, you havent covered another issue. Rocsalt said through the gauze covering his face.  How do we, once we create this blade, get to the moon?  Grelin porting in to Dawnshroud will just result in us burning quicker than if Solesek Ro himself lit us up.<br>
<br>
Yeah! Talvarien exclaimed.  Ranja Extra-Crispy is NOT on the menu!<br>
<br>
Brimstone, Whizbang said.  When we couldnt port during End Game, River used the horse to travel.  Terris took back the horse, but could you persuade her to let you borrow it for this?<br>
<br>
Whiz. Camille said, shaking her head doubtfully.  When Terris was directly commanding it, it bore me.  But the horse has tried to kill me for a year.  Even when Terris commanded it to bring me to her, it tried to shake me.  It bonded with River, but otherwise, its a willful creature, and I think it hates me, jealousy maybe over Rivers attention on me.  It was mutual.  I doubt if Terris gave it to me that I would be able to control it.<br>
<br>
Hmmph. Whizbang said, brow furled.  Then ask Mithaniel your best course on how to access the moon.  If the gods were going to get involved in this they would have, is my guess, so we have to assume we are on our own here.  In fact, I would imagine some, fearing when we finally break into the Plane of Time, would see the destruction of both worlds as a blessing.  Mithaniel is the God of Honor.  He may not help you directly, but I expect he will not hinder you either.  If he offers no solution, maybe I will have one tomorrow.  Now, Im tired.<br>
<br>
Its three in the morning. Pedi observed.   You need your sleep, and so do I, old man.<br>
<br>
And I. Rocsalt said.  Talvarien nodded as well.<br>
<br>
I slept all day. Camille said, You guys go back to the guildhouse and Ill head to the Halls of Honor.  Its best I go alone anyway.<br>
<br>
No argument there.  Rocsalt replied, nodding.  Ive destroyed enough white suits to put me on the most wanted list there.<br>
<br>
Ill take you. Grelin said to Camille.<br>
<br>
Thank you Grelin. she replied.  Whiz, can I come by in the morning when youve awaken?<br>
<br>
Aye, Whizbang said, eyes heavy.  In the morning.<br>
<br>
And you, Pedi said, pointing to Rocsalt.  Come with her.  I want to talk to someone about your cough.<br>
<br>
Will do. Rocsalt said, self-consciously touching his throat.<br>
<br>
Hey. Talvarien said suddenly, Do we take Ramluk with us?<br>
<br>
I said stealth, not go in with a ten piece band.  Whizbang said.  No, Ramluk would be more of a problem than a help.  Its bad enough we have the ranger that shoots off his mouth more than his bow.<br>
<br>
Hey! Talvarien cried, insulted.  I dont shoot off my mouth<br>
<br>
Prove it. Whizbang said automatically.<br>
<br>
Talvarien opened his mouth to speak, and Whizbang just raised an eyebrow.  Talv closed his mouth without another word.<br>
<br>
Ok, Grelin. Camille said.  Lets get these two home, and thento the Planes.<br>

<br>
White marble floors, white marble columns, white flying buttresses and arches, white stretching west, for as far as her eyes could see.  The only other colors black and green; the green of the hedges flanking and the walkways and the black of the unoccupied suits of armor standing sentry at the entrance.<br>
<br>
You look tired. Camille said to Grelin, who stood blinking in the bright light of the Halls of Honor.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Grelin said.  Long day.<br>
<br>
Go back to the guildhouse and get some rest.  Ill find a way back. Camille released him.<br>
<br>
Grelin simply nodded, murmured something arcane, and disappeared.  Camille turned back to those inanimate suits of armor and prepared to walk through them.  She would be safe here, she hoped.  But she could not help but shiver.  Somewhere in this white architecture, not too long ago, one of her friends and his dog had stained the floors red with their blood.<br>
<br>
Fall out! she heard someone say deep within.  And then the sound of men in armor marching, in perfect time, left right across the marble floors.<br>
<br>
The Halls of Honor.  One of the two planes desired to be the resting place of any paladin.  For the less aggressive paladins, this was their final destination.  For those of a more warlike nature, there existed the ongoing battles in the Plane of Valor.  Camille had long ago dreamed of spending her final time here.  Now it just seemed cold.  She would have chosen to stand as a statue opposite her husband in the gloomy recesses of Terris Thule without a moments hesitation.  But now, even that was taken from her.<br>
<br>
She began to make her way through the two jet black suits of ornate armor.  Suddenly the left one advanced toward her, drawing its sword.  Reaver whisked out of its scabbard.   So it was to be a fight after all.<br>
<br>
Leave her. came an empty voice resonating from the other suit.  He says to let her pass.<br>
<br>
The advancing suit stopped, turned perfectly in time and marched back to its previous post without a word.  Camille nodded to the right suit, sheathing her weapon, feeling a little foolish acknowledging an empty suit of armor, but knowing at one time it had been a living paladin, one of her class, and had had the same drive to bring light to a dark world as she.  And into the plane she marched.<br>
<br>
It is now time for the changing of the guard! another voice said from somewhere within the statuary and hedges.  And westward she walked, passing men in beautifully wrought armor going through vigorous training, and one pen full of creatures that resembled some hybrid cross between a lion and dog.  They were babies yet, mewling for milk or playfully tumbling, swatting at each other with paws that had yet to develop claws.  But even as infants they were the size of a small bear.   She could only imagine the size of their parents.<br>
<br>
After some time she came to the base of a mountain, with unscalable walls.  A large portal was erected, the face of it alive with lightning, electricity running along its columns, up and down.  Two human knights stood guard to either side,  standing at seven feet, almost two heads taller than she.  High up on the mountain, she saw a similar portal, tiny in the distance.  She realized she was to walk through the lightning to reach her destination.<br>
<br>
Steeling herself for a shock, a burn, something, she strode forward.  Both guards saluted her with perfect precision, but she kept her eyes ahead, and stepped into the light.<br>
