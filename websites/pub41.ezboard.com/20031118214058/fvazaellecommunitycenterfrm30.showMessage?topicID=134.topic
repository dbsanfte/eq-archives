There is no new rift.  What we are dealing with is that the Europeans, as they have done many times in the past, avoid dealing with problems until they become so huge that they can no longer be ignored.  They wait until the problem is on their doorstep and will actually affect them, as they tend to be isolationist and not give a crap about other people around the world.  The fact that the US now deals with these problems before they show up knocking on the doors of the Europeans reinforces the Europeans' idea that these problems can be ignored and they just go away.  It's much like the 10 year old living with his mom.  He can throw laundry on the floor, and just ignore it, and it will end up washed and folded and in his drawers clean.  However, it's not that dirty laundry cleans itself, it's that someone is there (the mom) to clean the laundry when the 10 year old ignores it.<br>
<br>
The United States has not taken the isolationist view that Europe has (in recent years).  We have come to realize that a stitch in time saves nine, and we are not afraid to use our military might when necessary to spread freedom and democracy around the world.  We learned in WW1 and WW2 that Europe cannot be left alone to handle their own problems, they inevitably fail to handle situations and need us to bail them out.<br>

<br>
Let's see, for the US, I can think of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq 1, Iraq 2, Somalia, Kosovo, Grenada, Libya, Panama, ...  I'm probably forgetting something.<br>
<br>
I will grant you that we played isolationist to a large degree in WW2, and we were as much a part of the problem as all the Europeans that pursued the policy of appeasement towards Hitler.  The difference, in my opinion, is that we learned our lesson that burying your head in the sand doesn't make the problem go away, no matter how much you want it to.<br>

Not having to worry about security, locally or globally, has made pacifistic ideals work in there own isolationistic sphere.  <br>

<br>
It's only in the last decade that Europe has started to come back into it's own economically.  Some of them enjoy the blanket of protection the US provides, while others want their old power back in the world. *cough France cough*<br>

Let's face it thou, when there is a problem in the world, people don't call the Ghostbusters or Europe, they call the United States.  Although the Ghostbusters being a stronger military deterent than Europe might be a debatable point.<br>

<br>
Military, the US is much stronger than Europe. As a result, in most peacekeeping missions and such the US provides most of the troops, I give you that. But, Europeans go on these missions just as well. I don't see how the US is any different in this regard than Europeans, except that they provide more troops when there finally is a decision made to intervene.<br>
<br>
US is just as afraid as other countries to burn its fingers. Whenever the going gets tough, you withdraw. Peacekeeping missions is okay, but fullscale war is not something any country is willing to risk; except if there is something else to gain / defend.<br>
<br>
Let me comment on some of the conflicts you mentioned (the ones I don't mention I don't know enough about).<br>
<br>
Iraq1 - The US certainly wasn't alone in this, my country even sent some boats (who probably arrived when the war was over) !<br>
<br>
Somalia - Didn't you withdraw after the Black Hawk incident ? I must confess I don't know much about this.<br>
<br>
Kosovo - Sure, there were some troops. Although nobody was prepared to do what was necessary to stop the genocide, in fact the airbombing campaign is what triggered the genocide. If the countries involved were willing to do what was necessary and send groundtroops, the genocide might possibly never have happened.<br>
<br>
Iraq2 - Well, I don't have to comment much more on this. The reason most European countries are not there, is because we don't believe in the war there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Europeans will just appease evil_dictator04 so they don't have to intervene.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why you are in Iraq now, I don't know. But it's certainly not to free the Iraqi people from their evil dictator. That was just propaganda. If the US was really worried about those poor Iraqi's you would AT LEAST have stopped diplomatic relations with Saddan when he gassed at least 100,000 Kurds.<br>
<br>
Don't kid yourselves, the US isn't any different than any other country in willingness to intervene where it is necessary. Peacekeeping missions are fine and dandy, but when the going gets too hot, the US is out of there like any other country. This self righteous &quot;we are the do-gooders of the World&quot; is misguided. And that is putting it mildly. <p>---------------<br>

Of course your country cannot produce an army as large as the US, but you could have one proportionally as large.  That's your choice to not have one, and thus you cannot use it as an excuse for not participating in military actions.<br>

Other than the British, the europeans only send token troops to voice support.  The military support of all of the rest of Europe is nearly useless.  Take Iraq1 for example.  Look at the troop breakdowns.  Your country sent a mere fraction of what the US sent, even if you scale for population.<br>

We make the decision to intervene while the rest of you sit on the sidelines.  Then we send all the troops that actually do anything, while the rest of you send a few rowboats and guys with cap guns.  Of course you can't send what we do, but you could send a hell of a lot more than you do, and shoulder your fair share of the burden.  You don't though.<br>

That's not true.  The US is far less afraid, although some wars we've decided not to enter.  We avoided war with the Soviets, but most people would argue that was the right thing to do as the price (possible annihilation of the human race) outweighed the benefits for all involved.  I've listed multiple times when we've used our military to solve international problems, you can't think of any that you have used yours for (except debatably Iraq1, when you sent at most a token force).<br>

The real problem here is that the operation was initiated by Bush at the very end of his presidency (in what we call the lame duck period, after he lost the election, but before the next president is sworn in).  Clinton was a wuss basically, and didn't have the stomach for it.<br>

I don't know what planet you were living on, but there were massive reports of genocide well before the air campaign (several years before it), and the air campaign brought an end to hostilities.

<br>
As far as I can tell, a military willing to spend half what we spend would be more powerful, not less, as we pursue extreme high tech options in order to reduce the possibility of losing human life.  The US doesn't have that many people, so we must leverage our population with our wealth and technology.<br>
<br>
Either way, the argument isn't relevant if you make the assumption that the proportionality is drawn from existing military strength and not from military budget.  If one nation has one tenth the military might of another, regardless of the cost of this, they should be expected to participate to one tenth the degree.<br>
<br>
Then again, I might not be following you completely.<br>

<br>
What you're talking about is the greater conflict early to mid 90's. After airstrikes somewhere in the mid 90's after the Sgrebrenica massacre (this is all from memory, I didn't bother to look it up - so there might be some errors) there was finally some opportunity for a diplomatic solution. The former Yugoslavia was divided into smaller countries and a peacetreaty was signed (Dayton). Dayton however, did not address the situation of the Albanians in Kosovo, which came/was under control of Milosovic. <br>
<br>
In 1998 (or close) they revolted against Milosovic, who responded harsly, murdering entire villages. The international community responded by airstrikes, hoping Milosovic would yield like he did after Sgrebenica. He responded however by driving the Albanians from their homes and killing them on a large scale. After months of bombing, he finally was willing to sign a peacetreaty. So, when I say Kosovo, I mean the genocide in 1998 (or close).<br>

I agree actually. I think my country should have an army that is capable of more than just participating in peacekeeping missions. However, I am not talking about the Netherlands here.<br>

<br>
Europeans were involved in Rwanda, Yugoslavia during the 90's, Iraq1 in the last decade. That's what I can think of at the top of my head. Whether it was a token force or not, I do not know. <br>
<br>
I do grant you that Europe is far less capable than the US military. Whether that should change, I do not know. Until Iraq2 I was under the impression that Europe and the US was able to come to some understanding regarding military action.<br>

<br>
Oh yeah, I agree wholeheartedly. Europe agreed fairly quickly that something should be done there, but nobody was willing to burn their fingers.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I think the whole world is unwilling to do what is right. The USA certainly has more military involvement in issues. This is mostly because since WW2, Europe has grown dependent on the US, I do grant you that. <p>---------------<br>

We have engaged in other military campaigns for strictly humanitarian reasons (Somalia for example).  Whether we would have gone into Iraq solely for humanitarian reasons I cannot say, but I certainly believe it was a contributing (and important) factor.<br>
