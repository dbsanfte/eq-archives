FIRST OF ALL, this is how the siuation sums up.  I was in LS group for a bit and our cleric had to leave, no healers LFG in zone and we spent a good half hour trying to find one so i decided to log off for a bit to study for my final exam.  i came back about an hour later seeing that a group had formed with a shammy as healer and 4 other players from the time i had logged and 1 new person. so i asked the chatner since he was leader of the group if anyone was on list and he said no and i was the first one. at that time the chanter had to leave and we were talking in open chat about the list and he said no one but me was on the list. they needed someone to replace the chanter and asked if i would wait i said well ofcourse because the group cant function with a shammy as healer and no chanter. so they invited a 59 cleric to join. i had been up talking with a few friends that were in the US group.<br>
i wanted to go check the siuation with LS to see if a spot was opening up in the near future. surely enough one did and i see Gronk log in and he joined the group. at first i thought what was going on if 2 people were leaving or what. apperantly the new list holder forgot or didnt know about my being on the list. and she said her guildie gronk had been on the list for a while. i had been sitting in LS with LFG tag on for most of the 6 hrs i was waiting for join LS.  I talked to gronk about the situation and asked if i could get my spot back (he had just joined the group at this time). and his response was &quot;i didnt steal shit, my guild member called me up cause i was playing an alt and a spot had opened&quot;. so i talked to the new list holder and she said she didnt know i was on that list and it isnt her fault for mis communication between new and old list holders. sure i had been angry that after waiting for 6 hrs someone steals my spot and i wanted to resolve the situation. since gronk had just joined the group and he had been playing an alt i askled him politely if i could get my spot back and his response was again &quot;i didnt steal shit why are u accusing me of this shit&quot;. my question is how u got this &quot;he was ranting on for about an hour about it&quot; i only talked for about 15 min at most and half the time u wouldnt even respond to me and kept on pulling. so i talked to hamfist the new leader of the group and had asked if anyone would be leaving soon and he said that he himself would be leaving ina bit. so i thought to myself i can wait a bit cause i didnt want to argue more with gronk. so after about like 40 or 45 mins hamfist had left and Gronk took over as leading. i was finally happy that got my spot in the group and didnt care what happened earliar i just wanted some xp. for a while about 45 min to an hour we got along pretty good but most of the time he was asking why the pulls werent coming. (our monk had gone LD and 5 times within this hour) our cleric was gtg and i saw a spider alone so i went to pull it, no one complained they just killed it, so i went to pull another. i pulled a few until our monk got back. gronk had been continuously saying &quot;where are the pulls guys, i want some xp&quot; so thats why i pulled when our monk was LD. after the monk came back i guess his isp finally started to cooperate and he didnt go LD for a while so he was pulling. the group wanted to chain pull for more xp so the monk would dump off the mobs and pull another at about 40% hp now all this time gronk hadnt been taunting or anything and i asked him why not because a rogue tankin puts strain on the cleric and its not very efficient. and he explained his &quot;slide show&quot; situation as he put it to me and this is what he said to the group &quot;by the time i drag my mouse over and get it on the taunt button the mob is already dead&quot; now i thought to myself does this guy not know how to make a hotkey or whats going on here. the later few mobs i guess it was ok the cleric didnt have to heal me as much and we were having fun. im not sure how long later but another spot opened up and a high lvl warrior came into the zone LFG so i said to group why dont we get him. this whole time the list keeper wasnt referring to a list, she was taking people as they came which was weird to me because she had said gronk was on the list for hours but if she was taking people as they came in LFG then why would she make an acception for gronk other then the fact they were both in EA. i had a friend who was LFG and i had told her to put him on list but i guess she forgot aswell. after i said &quot;lets get the warrior&quot; gronk said &quot;pffft warriors are pathetic&quot; and i said jokingly &quot;at least warriors can taunt =p~&quot; (exactly like that) and then he disbanded me. the whole time iwas in the group no one had said anything or commented on anything that i was being an ass to the group. and where did u get this &quot;i was pulling when cleric is lom&quot; and getting people killed in the process. THE ONLY REASON SOMEONE DIED IS BECAUSE U DISBANDED ME AND THE CLERIC LEFT AS A RESULT OF THAT, thats why einny died. and i apologized to her after for her death and she forgave me she just hated how her time was wasted (waiting for rez etc). so i said in open chat &quot;gronk why cant u take a joke man i was only kidding&quot; he didnt respond at all or anything and he invited someone else. after that i decided that without a cleric and a chanter to rez i wasnt going to even try to get back into that group.  about 15 min later i was called up to US for a possible spot so i headed up, on the way up i had turned a corner and ran into a hunter and he saw thru my hiding. so as usual i was rather high up and i jumped down to try to zone quickly befor the mobs got down, i had hoped to jump directly to the bottom but landed on the second level of mobs and the spider there ad stunned me, now i was thinking to myself should i just stand here and die or try to make it to zone and i chose to attempt to make it to zone and ran. i made it to zone but didnt know if the mobs made it to LS so after zoning to GD i quickly zoned back into velks. when i entered i see this disgusting /ooc from gronk saying &quot;that asshole kristophen trained the LS group on purpose that dirty dog&quot; and some other insults. i ran down the ramp at zone to see what had happend, to my disbelief the train made it to LS before i zoned and the same chanter had died again. he managed to put up another /ooc messege insulting me and how im an asshole etc etc before he zoned.  after he came back in he ranted on about he and the entire group petitioned me for intentional training and i thought to myself what kinda shit is he trying to pull. at this time einny was angry for her 2 deaths and i explained to her what happened and even pointed out the hunter that saw me and after a bit of chatting she forgave me and realized that it was an honest mistake. now gronk was trying to get the entire group to petition me.  he was trying to get others to believe what he thinks happened even tho he had no idea of the hunter up there. furthermore he he had thought i logged and starting say shit about me in /ooc again, &quot;hey look everyone kristophen logges after he intentionally trains the LS group, that dog deserves to die and rot in hell etc etc&quot; and ponrath said for gronk to stop it and keep it in tells only.  the ironic thing is that i hadnt logged and heard everything he said which was kinda amusing and i laughed at it. i was sick of this so i went to go kill dorfs for faction. a day later i noticed a post on EA boards which i had previously applied for because i thought they were all nice people... guess not, all but one. and he says revenge is a dish best served cold and i wondered what he was talking about because i didnt even do anything to him. and never did i think or imply i was gods gift to melees i just didnt want to be the one tanking. practically everyone i have ever grouped with knows that i play for a better group and want to have fun and that im enjoyable to have in the group.  it was nice that u posted all the so called stuff that i did, was also nice u didnt mention the stuff u did gronk, what a pity. and just cause he is in a respectable guild everyone believes him. well i cant do anything to chagne who u believe or dont its yur call. reprehensible, foolish, ignorant, untrustworthy? i tranfer stuff for friends all the time, i had one friend who asked me to transfer and whole buncha stuff for him CoF, fungi etc except he gave me a lore item which i had already, i dont know how but when the trade cancelled all those bags fell on the ground and i managed to get 2 while he got one and i had told him that i got it and everything was ok. and ignorant?, while in KC i was with a fun awesome group getting xp and everyone was enjoying it so i split 1k with the group just cause they were such a nice bunch of people, and every day i give away stuff in EC to lowbies hoping to make thier life better, now how can u call that greedy or ignorant or a DICKHEAD!?<br>
<br>
gronk i applaud u on the ability to fold the truth to the shape u see it as that took lots of skill. and thanks for calling me a newbie asshole that was nice of u, notice that people with a higher intelligance dont need to insult others on forums to get their point across but somehow u have done it well. the group was working well and was fun for everyone up to the point where u disbanded me. and its sad u had to say those lies to other people that were in velks and here on the forums and now leaving me with this crap to deal with. buts its ok... if u guys wanna believe him and everything he says go for it, if being unguilded for the rest of my life becasue of this shit is what i get then whatever. those friends that i have made throughout the years make playing eq all the worth guild or no guild. sure i might not get my epic or get any phat lewt but thats not the issue for me, friends and fun and being nice to people outweigh anything that eq can offer. after quitting for 3 months and coming back i had no items or anything, this lowbie gave me 11pp it was all he had and a week later i gave him 1k back even tho i had only a few items on me, i did it because it was the right thing to do.  i remember a few days back this one guy trained LS 3 times in half an hour because he ran by the same hunter 3 times and ofcourse our group was mad, but we knew it was an accident and we didnt petition him and we didnt flame him on forums, but if thats the way u settle tough situations then u should atleast do a good job explaining the actual truth rather then putting up a few sentences saying im an asshole etc.  even tho im somewhat angry at this post u made, i am willing to apologize for the accidental train i made and to any of those who died in it and for the jokes i said which i guess u didnt get were jokes.  honestly gronk that few minutes that the group was fun i thought u were a nice guy but when u asked the group to petition me for some thing i didnt do =intentional training.... man i lost all respect for you. i know EA has lots of nice people and i know lots of EA people that think im a nice guy and still do. thats all i can say in my defense so peace~ people believe what u wish.<br>

The guy was legitimately (and moderately intelligently) explaining his version of the story and you'd think the fact that the thread made it three pages, it would indicate someone was at least interested.<br>
<br>
Of course....it doesn't fit well with the theme of rants and flames, but is flaming so much more fun/important than not trashing someone's reputation for what seems a legitimate misunderstanding?<br>
<br>
But these are words from a lurking newb again though, so take em for what their worth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/19/01 4:58:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=644.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ugh</span><hr size=1> Just type about how you crush or punch a mob for 12-70 damage instead so I'm at least used to skipping over it.<br>

And don't let a person's opinion bother you. Anyone who decides that this Gronk person is now the steward for determining who can or can not get into any guild on the server is an idiot. Pursue your game relationships they way you wanna, not every guild in the game is dumb enough to care about your reputation with another random spiderkilling slacker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uadeathfistorcpawn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>a deathfist orc pawn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/19/01 5:07:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=644.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I think youre all missing the peak of this thread</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

That being said, we have done both upper and lower dog camps before.
