Until I talked to a friend of mine that was in the group I was under the impression that we had been there first and rather than talking to us about getting a camp after AE was called in a camp check you were just heading to disco whether we liked it or not.  But when talking to my friend afterwards I found out you were the group that was there before us and somebody in you group just called out a different camp than you were actually heading to.

<br>
<br>
Aarc, you're a dickhead. So what if a member of your AE was in the zone first... the other group had assembled, buffed, and begun moving in long before you did. You don't complain when somebody leapfrogs your raid, so why the hell are you complaining when somebody leapfrogs your AE group?<br>
<br>
On more than one occasion, I've bailed on an AE group with you, Aarc, because you show little regard or respect for other people who don't or can't AE. I've seen you say more than once that if another group became a problem for your AE group, you'd just &quot;train 'em np~&quot;. It was a matter of time before somebody petitionned you. It's dickheads like you that make me happy I'm playing NWN now instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
And this ain't about class envy. Lest ye forget that I'm also a 60 wizard with a bunch of AA and a pretty much full (pre-luclin) spell book. This is about you being a major sheissekopf, and fucking proud of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In response to Milvas... when AE people are considerate, they make awesome exp without pissing off other groups. Depending on where they AE, they can also make awesome loot... personal record, over 2kpp worth of peridots for a night of AE (manaskin takes a peridot to cast... 700pt rune, use if don't have epic), and I still walked away about 5k richer. That's probably exactly what Aarc was doing in Sebilis, and exactly why he's being such a dink about it.<br>

The only people that have posted here that concern me are Klyptix and Benoir.  Klyptix, sorry to dog out your guild mate (and maybe your friend) Quarken.  I don't really know him from Adam in-game...only met him once in fact.  I was just trying to flame him as good as he flamed me.  It's just VCC...nothing serious about it (except for a couple real retards /wave Silver the Wizard.)  Hopefully you guys don't let VCC affect your in-game friendships.  I know I never do.  VCC is just a fun waste of time for those of us who like to read good and original insults (even if they are targeted on ourselves.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I still have you both on friends list, and hope we are still cool.  No, Klyptix, I did not have some kind of breakdown and undergo a personality change when I posted here.  I was just using my VCC-I-wish-I-could-rant-as-good-as-Ganndon-or-Saalron personality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugrainthe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grainthe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 1:36:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1653.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hey wow</span><hr size=1> Please!!<br>

Do you dipshits that post here actually read what other people say before responding to it?<br>
<br>
In 2 posts so far in this thread (my original post and my first response to it), I listed the reasons that I love playing a lvl 60 wizard.  One more time, they were:<br>
   -The ability to port myself, invis myself, levitate, etc...basically the ability to travel freely to and around most zones in the game.<br>
   -The ability to solo in dungeons or outdoor zones including quad-kiting.  This is not the way that I prefer to grind out experience, but if I only have an hour or so to play this is decent solo experience.<br>
   -The ability to AE for very good experience grinding.<br>
   -The ability to Manaburn.<br>
   -The ability to get into fun experience groups in places such as CT, UP, Ssra, etc.<br>
   -The ability to be useful on raids and, therefore, the ability to join a high-level guild that raids during hours that you are online.<br>
<br>
For all of these reasons, I stated that I was glad to be a lvl 60 wizard.  I also stated that I was not a &quot;better wizard&quot; than anyone else that I'd met on the server.  Furthermore, I stated that I was sure my gear was gimp compared to any wizard in CC, PO, EA, and probably Fantasy.  However, I stated that even if my gear were more gimp than it is, I'd still rather be a lvl 60 wizard than Bobino.<br>
<br>
Having said all of this, notice that some things I did NOT say were:<br>
   -I am Uber<br>
   -I have good or great or uber gear.<br>
   -I can Manaburn for more damage than some other wizard.<br>
   -I have killed the Emporer or been to Vex Thal.<br>
   -I am a God of AE.<br>
   -I am a first-rate wizard.<br>
   -I am in the 99th percentile of wizards.<br>
   -I think I'm GODLY for AEing Seb.<br>
   -I have lots of FT gear.<br>
<br>
So, let's analyze some of the &quot;responses&quot; that you fuckwads have come up with.  I use the term &quot;responses&quot; loosely, because you people are responding to shit that was never said.  Here goes:<br>
<br>
Shwiggy said: &quot;So once my gear is better than yours if it isn't already on my little 4 month old server does that make me better than you?&quot;     Ummmm....where do you get that from my post?  WTB Adult Literacy program for Shwiggy.<br>
<br>
Rayoflamme said: &quot;Rayoflamme Burnafew (much less than Aarcanus i m sure /sarcasm mode ON)&quot;    OK...you got me!  You can do more dmg than me on a manaburn and you have better gear than me.  So what?  Please reference &quot;reasons aarc is glad to be a wizard&quot;, listed above.<br>
<br>
Rayoflamme also said: &quot;Want to speak about DPS of wiz wooooot what u know about DPS? did u fight emperor, any Hight End Bosses in Ssra or VT or u just wanna speak about raw Dps on a 3 stops run in Seb?&quot;  Ok, Rayo.  I now know about your language barrier here.  Therefore, I'll just once again say to you in SIMPLE ENGLISH that I never claimed to be more powerful (or even as powerful) than any other lvl 60 wizard in EQ.<br>
<br>
Quarken said: &quot;Unlike the way you feel, which is inadequate to like the population of level 60 wizards on the server (see 17th percentile maybe?)&quot;  OK.  Please reference &quot;reasons aarc is glad to be a wizard&quot;, listed above.  Then see if what you said here makes sense or applies to this thread in any way.<br>
<br>
Silvir the Wizard said: &quot;what cracks me up is all of these self-proclaimed gods of ae getting their asses warned and getting all angry for being fucking morons&quot;  Silvir...you may not have been referencing me, but since this thread is about me AEing and getting warned I assumed you were.  Therefore, please post a link to any thread where I have proclaimed myself a god of anything.  If fact, I'd like to see you find a post of mine where I state that I am better at doing something than any other wizard of my level.  Good luck.<br>
<br>
Brack01 said: &quot;I can't get over people thinkin they're GODLY for AEing Seb&quot;  Hahahaha, Brack.  I would also have a hard time getting over people like that.  It would be about as funny as someone thinking they were GODLY for sitting in Velks for 78 straight hours killing the same spiders over and over.  AEing is mindless exp grinding, but it is still the best exp in the game for a wizard.  If you can find a post where I claimed to be GODLY for AEing Seb (or for any other reason), please do so.  Otherwise, please take your seat next to Silvir, Shwiggy, Rayo, etc in the Adult Literacy class.  Three words: Reading Is Fundamental.<br>
<br>
Aeth said: &quot;Aarcanus, my gear is as good as yours on a 4 month old server with only half my stuff equipped. Yah, you win&quot;  Congrats, Aeth.  You have good gear and I am a lvl 60 wizard.  I am happy about this for the reason listed above.  I win. Have a nice day.<br>
<br>
Audacity said: &quot;Rofl Aeth!  Only one Problem though, you have like12FT, hes got like 3.  So therefore you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arcanus&quot;  Not that it matters, but I have gear worth FT8.  However, even if I had no FT gear, what does that have to do with this thread?  For the hundreth time, I would rather be a lvl 60 wizard with FT 0 than a Bobino with FT 15.  Why, do you ask?  Because a lvl 60 Bobino with a full set of uber Bobino gear from Vex Thal and 245 AA points cannot do the things that a lvl 60 wizard can do.  I ENJOY being able to do those things (see the list above of things a lvl 60 wizard can do), and therefore, I am glad that I am not Bobino.<br>
<br>
<br>
I tried to go slowly here and repeat myself as many times as possible.  I even used small words.  Maybe this time, those people with poor reading skills will understand and can frame their responses accordingly.<br>
<br>

  As far as banning anyone from a ae group i dont think any one person no matter who they are have any say in the matter lord knows i dont i love aeing with everyone.I think this whole situation could have been avoided but someones ego got the better of them that night we as AE groups need to be more respectful of other groups and not pull through them but instead pull around or in this case rebuff get mana and pull disco before they get there.<br>
