had their say.  That doesn't mean that IV couldn't make a credible post in their defence.<br>
<br>
In no way has it been proven, in my eyes, that &quot;whatever a member of IV says&quot; will be flamed.  <br>
<br>
I wasn't there that night but I do have a character on Vazaelle.  The future of the server is important to me.<br>
<br>
However, when I hear Malathor say that he can't believe people are discussing morality over a video game and soliid trying to make Alyen look like he shared something in confidence, when he clearly didn't, I sometimes think maybe it was a good idea for IV to remain silent.<br>
<br>
IV does for the most part have a good reputation on the server and I like most of the people that belong to the guild.  I just wish this server could be more civilized and everyone have fun.  IV has the power to set the pace.<br>
<br>
How many times has IV helped any of us in game?  I distinctly remember IV pulling my old guild's (PO ) collective arses out of a bad fear break because it was attempted too quickly due to rushing for the Shissar.  I distinctly remember many times, past and present when IV has helped someone drag their corpse out from under Wuoshi and many other severely dangerous places.<br>
<br>
As for individuals within IV, I can't tell you the number of them that have helped me personally with questions or help obtaining an item.  I can't tell you how many times I have heard someone else relate a story in which IV has helped them.<br>
<br>
I'm appealing to everyone that has been affected by this to shake hands and remember why we play, to have fun.<br>
<br>
Hopefully in future encounters like this, the guild leaders (ultimately it is they who are responsible) will use a calmer approach to dealing with these situations.  <br>
<br>
As far as not responding to what the community thinks on the message boards, that is a mistake IMO.  There are 1,134 registered VCC users.  Yeah, maybe only half are active and maybe only half of them use the board regularly.  Thats still around 300 people playing EQ who will develop an opinion, whether you post or not.<br>
<br>
The message board is THE only legacy of this server.  It is a written history.  Ignore it but it will not ignore you. <p>Herder

<br>
Kead, We had planned our PoA raid a very long time ago. We also rescheduled it almost as soon as we learned of your intent to go. We don't normally peruse the VCC calendar section because it's not relevant on this server but somebody did and mentioned our conflicting plans. Serafina approached you trying to work something out. You didn't know about our intent to go to PoA. Why would we approach you and mention our raid if we were trying to screw you over? Plus how could we have made it a joint raid? you can only reasonably bring up 24 people at a time. <br>
<br>
We didn't beat you to the punch Kead. We went up early enough that you would have respawns by the time you came up. We were honestly concerned that your self-proclaimed inexperience would hamper us if we came up after you, as *you* yourself suggested to Serafina. We've sprinted through Sky before and knew we could do it again. We know how to make Sirran despawn so that isn't an issue at all. All of this was done so that no one would get screwed over and both guilds would be able to enjoy a nice raid on Sky. Serafina told you all of this, yet you still insisted on cancelling your raid and proclaiming Agony a bunch of assholes. If we had really wanted to just take the plane from you, we could have just gone up an hour or 2 before you. We didn't Kead. <br>
<br>
In all reality, you could have gone up into Sky and had a great time. The only thing holding you back was your anger, your ignorance, and maybe your pride, I don't know. Remember Kead, Agony didn't cancel your Sky raid, you did.<br>

I would say &quot;why not make some sort of a reservation system?&quot;, but the more I play on Brell the more I learn to hate it. Yeah it sucks that u guys got the shaft but thats just the way it is on some servers. Maybe a reservation system wouldnt even be bad for Vazaelle if u restrict it to Fear/Hate. And if CT is up then IV/CC will just have to wait until the current raid is over to go in and take him out. Thats the way it is for some servers and I know on Brell that SR always waits til 2 or 3am just kill CT. Maybe they dont like doing that but the point is that they respect others and wait. just my 2cp <p><a href="http://members.home.com/eqmaximus" target="_blank"><img src="http://members.home.com/eqmaximus/sigs/itarki.jpg" border="0" alt="visit the maximus homepage"></a>

<br>
They did a lot of that back on our server of mt and it just made people lazy, and overall results in less spawns of the mob...yeah something like that...although I think that was my way of saying sharing sucks. ^^<br>
<br>
Clearly is not going to happen here. =)<br>
<br>
Although as long as inny continues to drop that uber shit I would not be against a reservation system for hate. =P <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>
