<br>
first off the black entertainment channel. what? im not good enough to watch it just cuz im white? oh dont give me that crap about ABC etc... where do you think the cosby show got its start, and for that matter do these black entertainment channels use ebonics in all their programing? why not? how can all those ebonics speaking people understand their own channel, yes i know some &quot;african americans&quot; speak perfectly good english, at least until they see joe white walkin down the street askin for directions outta town, the racist bastards.<br>
<br>
now dont get me wrong, they have every right to have a black entertainment channel and speak in ebonics only to white people, but damnit, im tired of being the most discriminated against type of person in america, im a right handed middle class single white male, yes there are colledge scholarships available for left handed people<br>
<br>
as for the speak english if you wanna sell me something shit... damn straight.. how can you run a good buisness unless you have some method of communication with your customers? you think im gonna go back to a store where i had to ask 15 times to get the right brand of smokes? hey if you wanna not speak english in a job where you arent dealing with a 95% english speaking public all day long, speak aincient swahili for all i care, just dont sell me smokes while you do it<br>
<br>
guns dont kill, bullets do, and hey guess what all you liberals, bullets arent constitutionally protected, so cut it with the constitution crap if yer gonna attack it on one front with yer gun banning crap and attack me for &quot;attacking&quot; it on the other<br>
<br>
i could go on, but thats enough politically incorrect material for you to not read and rant against anyway for now, so have at it, i expect to be laughing my ass off at your responses, lame or otherwise <p><img src="http://oz-bits.com/easig/larssig2.jpg">

<br>
Some of the women were completely outscored in tests both physical and mental, but still got it because of affirmitive action.<br>
<br>
So who cares if this woman that cheated her way into firefighting couldn't carry a hose over to the hyrdrant to stop your house from burning down, or she couldn't carry your injured grandparent out of a burning house because they didn't have the physical prowess to do these things, right?

<br>
--***--<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I like big cars, big boats, big motorcycles, big houses, and big campfires. I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some governmental stooge with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts for squirting out babies.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
-Big cars, boats and motorcycles, eh?  That's one of the big ways we got in our current environmental mess, especially in cities like Los Angeles, but more importantly it's our absolute reliance on these types of vehicles and unwillingness to change that makes us so willing to be friendly with oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, etc.  I suppose it's fine to &quot;like&quot; these things, but unfortunately our inability to &quot;like&quot; alternatives is morally rotting our nation to the core.<br>
<br>
-That money you make... sure it belongs to you but its not like the government isn't using it for important things.  You like having National Security, pay your taxes.  You like your children having access to education, parks and public events, pay your taxes.  You like having roads to drive your gas-guzzling big car on, pay your taxes.  You like having legal recourse for when you get screwed, pay your taxes.  As for the pork barrel and inefficiency of government, firstly it varies hugely from location to location and organization to organization and secondly its from YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS.  The government exists to enable the people, not repress them.  And, I'm sorry, but American taxes aren't that bad at all.  Look at how incredibly high the American standard of living is compared to the rest of the world.  A lot of poorer countries and have little to no (fully enforcable) tax codes and they sure seem to be great... more Papua New Guinea if you don't want to pay taxes and then  pray the UN will be responsive to your needs as a citizen, because the Papuan government has not the means.<br>
<br>
-Crack-whores squirting out babies... So you're assuming all people on unemployment or food stamps are crack whores?  As an exmaple, both my parents have been on food stamps before at some point in their lives and are now PhD professionals.  One of the great things about modern Western governments is we don't cast-off our unfortunate into an eternal underclass.  It's that very social responsibility that keeps the American dream alive, especially if your, for example, your submarine factory closes due to government budget cuts.  Yes, there are people who take advantage of the system but the vast majority do not.  And though I don't have much sympathy for the genuine crack-whores themselves, what about their children?  Should we cast them off?  Obviously their mother isn't making the kind of money necessary to support them on her own.  The only other humane option is some sort of foster care, which is essentially doing the same thing, albeit in a more indirect way.<br>
<br>
-As for me, I like fuel-efficient and alternative energy cars, like keeping my money but realize that government with good oversight actually is a wonderful place to invest money... assuming I like things like infrastructure.  Economy of scale lets the government do it more cost-effectively than developers.  I support social welfare programs with proper government oversight.<br>

<br>
-Guns don't make you a killer, but they sure as hell facilitate you if you are one... and they make it damn easy to accidentally become one.  Guns kill.  It's what they're designed to do (even if their chosen target is a deer).  Baseball bats and cars are not so designed.  To be perfectly honest, though, I've never understood this country's obsession with fire arms so I can't really make an argument against something which, to my point of view, doesn't even have an internal logic to argue against.<br>
<br>
-I don't own a gun.  I don't ever intend to.  I lobby against handguns.  Facilitating the unwise is not my cup of tea.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I believe they are called the Boy Scouts for a reason, that is why there are no girls allowed. Girls belong in the Girl Scouts.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
-I'll agree on that point.  However, gays are still boys and lesbians are still girls and these organizations, as long as they're using government lands and facilities, can't be homophobic by policy.  Homosexual people have just as much need for community and the lifeskills taught by the scouts as heterosexuals.  However, they are private organizations, so as long as they're not using my tax dollars (by using public facilities) to do their business, more power to them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think that if you feel homosexuality is wrong, it is not a phobia, it is an opinion. I don't think being a minority makes you a victim of anything except numbers. The only things I can think of that are truly discriminatory are things like the United Negro College Fund, Jet Magazine, Black Entertainment Television, and Miss Black America. Try to have things like the United Caucasian College Fund, Cloud Magazine, White Entertainment Television, or Miss White America and see what happens. Jesse Jackson will be knocking down your door.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
-Homosexuality:Thinking homosexuality is wrong is an opinion.  It may also be a phobia.  I frankly don't care so long as you're accepting of different people in your community and not, for example, burning crosses in their lawns or raping or murdering them.  But remember, all men (and women) are created equal in this country, so you've got no high horse or soap-box on this issue and, as members of the American community, they have all the same rights and privelages you do.<br>
<br>
-Minorities: It's too bad the US isn't culturally to the place you are where people are not discriminated against because of a race, religion, sexuality or gender.  It's intolerant and bigoted people that make minorities so caudified and seperated from the American community at large, so unless you've got a way to stop that then being a minority is gonna have to do with a lot more than numbers for a long time to come.  Basically, I agree with the general point of the author, but somehow I don't get the impression he's looking at the whole picture.<br>
<br>
-Discrimination: And why shouldn't these organizations and media exist?  There sure seems to be a market for them in our free-market system.  Perhaps these minorities have needs they're better able to address in-house.  These just has to do with your short-sighted definition of 'minority'.  Computer gamers are also a minority and they have their own media and, yes, even beauty pagents.  Scholarships exist purely for people interested in math or 1920s Yellow journalism.  Not all minorties exist along easy, phenological lines and frankly, being in a cultural minority helps your refine who you are and your place in society.  Phenological minorities are just one expression of this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have the right &quot;NOT&quot; to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird, or tick me off. When 70% of the people who get arrested are black, in cities where 70% of the population is black, that is not racial profiling, it is the law of statistics.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
-Your rights, huh?  I'm sorry, you don't have the right not to be tolerant if the people who are pissing you off are your fellow Americans.  You don't have to like them.  You don't have to hang out with them.  But you damn well better be tolerant.  If you are violent or defamatory towards them you are outside the law.  Your preferences don't elevate you as an individual over someone else.  Everyone of voting age is equal in this country.  Period.  And they must all be treated with respect and dignity.<br>
<br>
-Minority profiling-There are very few major cities where African-Americans are in the majority, especially at a 70% level.  In a country where you're technically innocent until proven guilty it's odd that certain minorities seem more likely to be arrested in the first place... implying a perversion of this rule.<br>

My father and grandfather shouldn't have to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come over and disrespect ours.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
-We don't have a national language.  People are free to speak whatever they want.  If you don't like going to a private business where English isn't the language, take your business somewhere else.  Speaking English has nothing to do with being an American citizen.  Hell, German almost became our national language (and I don't mean during the 1940s).  Being an American citizen is about carving out your niche in a the many varied community of the States and participating in the political process.<br>
<br>
-You relatives-I'm sorry they died in war.  That sucks.  However, other people's freedom of movement likely has little to do with their deaths and does it them a service that America is still such a free country that people can immigrate and continue to mold our cultural values and viewpoint.  Freedom isn't about choosing one thing as 'right' and sticking to it, it's about having the ability to change.  You personally don't have to change, but you can't take away the rights of others to change or be different.  And if you want to get into the whole &quot;disrespecting nations&quot; issue, Americans don't come from a very strong arguing point... especially when it comes to the Americas, the Middle East and East Asia.<br>

-I think the above martial law comments mostly handle this issue.  As for English, not the official language, so that's not the case.

You might want to look into learning some Spanish in case your xenophobia backlashes and the Hispanic majority pushes through an official change to Spanish as our national language.<br>

-Constitution should be capitalized.  Well, hmm, the Constitution -is- a living document and is certainly open to all interpretations.  We don't have to agree, but that's not the point.

-Gates does have the rights to his money.  He does not, however, have the rights to monopolize the industry, squash competition and destroy the free market in his sector while extorting and robbing consumers.  Anti-monopoly laws are there to protect the capitalist way of life.  Monopolies, by definition, make it extremely hard (nigh impossible) to bring competition, even vastly superior, into the market.

-&quot;Raising a child right&quot; is a very subjective thing, but violence certainly isn't the answer.  It is, however, well proven that all a child's social interactions effect their development, so the more healthy your commuity (or village, if you prefer) the better the odds the child will come out well.  Anyway, I don't see why anyone wouldn't want a healthy community.<br>

-Okay, I won't pretend--I will know--that if I get a tattoo that says, &quot;Anarchist&quot; that it is a political statement.  What I define as political speech may be completely irrelevant to you, and that's fine.  Bear in mind that's a two-lane street.

-I dye my hair.  Often with political intent.  Usually it's just a radical color to show my objection to mainstream America.

It's a bit harder to keep track of that if you're stolen from your village and sailed across the ocean and sold into generations of slavery.  Call people what they want to be called.  Is that so hard?  Different people value different aspects of their heritage and I just don't see how it hurts you to be sensitive to that.<br>

It's their right to run their store how they want.

Even if we were to drill every single -potential- oil field in the United States we wouldn't have enough oil to meet the needs of the American economy.  Do we have oil?  Yes.  Do we have enough?  No way in Hell.  Sooner or later it's going to run out anyway.  So here's an idea, how about we kill a few birds with one stone by developing (or in many cases simply implementing) alternatives to fossil fuels so that a) we are a world leader in the coming new energy economy, b) we can avoid environmentally dangerous aspects of the current economy, c) we are done with our reliance on questionable foreign leaders for oil, and d) we can finally stop arguing dosmetically about this crap.<br>

There's a couple problems here.  First, it's very hard to seperate the life-long deadbeat from the unlucky or disadvantaged.  How would you make that judgement and more importantly how would do it fairly and equitably?  Second, as disgusting as it sometimes seems to provide lifelong deadbeats minimal support, it prevents them from falling into even more desperate situations like permanent homelessness and helps limit their inclination to commit crimes.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way.  We support the people in our current form or something near it--relatively, it's rather cheap, and from time-to-time even permanent deadbeats have jobs and make other contributions to the economy.  If we don't support them this way, odds are many will end up sleeping in your lawn, or, if that pisses you off, in jail.  It's very expensive to house someone in jail, we already don't have enough space and funding in our prisons and what was a minimal chance of this person making contributions or even a full return to the economy is now nil.<br>
<br>
Both options suck, but to my mind one is clearly superior.<br>

<br>
There's an odd and completely unfounded belief that fuel-economic cars are unsafe.  This is totally unfounded.  Many of them, especially because of the market they currently target (left-wingers and corporations, for the most part) are extremely concerned about safety for personal and liability reasons.  Most (but not all) aren't particularly sporty or gutsy, but for everyday driving that's not a big issue.  <br>
<br>
And hey, maybe if we got over this SUV trip we're on in the States right now, people will start driving normal sized cars and not be worried about one of the gazillion SUVs hitting them and killing their children.  After all, it's not like that SUV is gonna be much better if you get hit by a semi.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is a free country, so drive what you like.  I won't force you into a Prius or a smart.  I just believe there are so many good arguments for changing our current trajectory that I don't see how anyone can look at all the information available and not see the sense in a change.<br>

Perhaps if guns weren't legal you couldn't get one at every single pawn shop if you were a criminal.  Yes, connected and hardened criminals would still be able to find firearms if they were illegal, but if you simply couldn't buy them, anywhere, it would be more difficult for some random &quot;punk&quot; to acquire.  Illegal firearms means less access for everyone, including criminals.<br>
<br>
Necessary herd trimming is, by the way, an entirely different issue and it pisses me off when gun lobbyists try to paint it as the same picture.  To me, it's another argument for another time.<br>
<br>
And the Constitution, my interpretation of it (or the Ten Amendments if you want to be precise) doesn't hold with the right of individuals to bear firearms.  The language is ambiguous.  I'm not saying my interpretation is the right one, but it's one I'm willing to argue on.  For the sake of brevity, I will not go into it in-depth right now, though.<br>

I have three (and rarely four) votes in Congress.

Everytime the House or Senate makes a vote, I am voting.<br>
<br>
This is democracy which means that the government is not a seperate entity from the People as in a, for example, monarchy.  The government taxes and holds the public's money in trust that it can provide for them certain things.  It's like the government is a large company and all voters have 1 share.  We elect a board to run our nation (in the forms of elected officials) and we give them input throughout their tenure.  If they piss us off, we fire them and replace them.  Though we don't always have direct control over what occurs, it is always OUR money.  We have to organize to be heard sometimes, but that's fair as a single person in a nation of near 300 million shouldn't be able to determine its fate alone.<br>

You think BET, Oxygen and Lifetime don't get tons of shit and condemnations?  They still survive because there's a market for them.  If you want to make Caucasian Entertainment Television, feel free.  Despite the condemnations if there's a market for it you will succeed.  However, the likely reason you would not is because most mainstream television is still aimed at the American majority--whites.  All the major networks are, if you will, Majority Entertainment Television.  If there was a real need for a caucasian network to speak to the needs of caucasians in ways the mainstream does not, I'm sure it would appear.<br>

<br>
Disregarding the presidency issue (very few people I think really want to be president), all eligible people of voting age are equal.  They have one vote.  Government workers (and some others) do indeed have certain restrictions on the outward voicing of their views but in the end there's only one physical manifestation of a view in American politics, the vote, and in that regard all are equal.<br>
<br>
But even those without a political voice are generally guaranteed the same, if not similar rights (illegal immigrants, temporary and permanent residents being the primary exceptions).  My point, however, was that when it comes to respect and dignity in treatment, everyone deserves it.  It's an unspoken belief of the American way and is evidenced by the vote, which in theory is completely ignorant of race, gender, sexuality and culture.<br>

Actually, exact policies differ very much from institution to institution and though while professor/student relations are generally frowned upon, they are not universally forbidden.<br>
<br>
In the end it's about the power dynamic.  Because the superior has control over certain aspects of the inferiors' life, there is a question of true consentuality and quid pro quo.  These are legitimate concerns, however, they are not necessarily always problems.<br>

FIGHT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS<br>
because it doesnt exist, its an oxymoron and their is no such thing in this world as a politcally correct city/town/real life instances.  This whole thing where their is a: white male/female asian/black baby/ and gay black guy married to a Mexican guy and they adopted 3 kids white/black/asian is just ubber bullshit.  So dont say political incorrectness or political correctness, its all fake, wannabe BS.  Besides who would wanna live in a political correct world? They are trying to achieve this &quot;political correct&quot; society which would SUCK if you thought about it.  Its not meant to be, so leave it be.<br>

One thing, you have every right to have white pride and so forth, theres no law against it.  Its true many people would disapprove of it, are you asking for the right to approval?  If so how does this jive with your right not to approve of all the things you say you dont approve of?  It sounds like you are just whining bc you wish your views were more popular since its perfectly legal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufallenidol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FallenIdol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/23/02 9:26:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1642.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hey 1 more thing</span><hr size=1> mb the person posted it is not white...but hes got some points right... <p><b>~*Evakarye 32 Darkelf Sk*~</b>
