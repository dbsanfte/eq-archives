Had our enchanter not charmed him and perhaps summoned a pet, what would have been the difference?  Well after an ae or two and a few ripos, the ench pet would be dead, not even taking into consideration the far greater damage output of Irak compared to an enchanter pet.<br>
<br>
So we used the one that would server us the most, and for the record Irak lost about 20% of his hp that fight eventhough he did get summoned once, and I'm betting most of that damage was from ripo.  It's our enchanter's job to keep us updated on its hp, and, sorry, I was watching.<br>
<br>
Sorry it looked like Irak was tanking because Aegir lived through defensive tanking him solo, maybe that was because our clerics know their shit? <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

OK, so what you're saying is pulling the sebilite protecter does not give you a claim for trak right?  Clearing POF doesn't give you a claim for (1 shot) CT?

Even CC is light years ahead of u guyz. - Mr. Befb<br>
<br>
The original post that prompted the response seen above: <br>
<br>
But, you have to understand, there are other guilds coming up now, and they will be fighting spawns that you guys have had a monopoly on. <br>
<br>
<br>
What I am saying is an undeniable fact. Guilds are getting stronger. They will be killing mobs that only IV has been killing. When did I say any guild was catching up with IV? I am not that cocky, or dillusional, to say that TE is anywhere near 'catching up' with IV, as far as spawn competition goes. For whatever reasons our guilds don't seem to get along, we are 2 guilds on 2 completely different agendas, with just a few mobs as an exception.<br>
<br>
<br>
I just said that cause Quark seems to have no idea of the position of the 2 guilds. If I wanted to say I'm the best I woulda said something like &quot;I am the best&quot; don't u think? - Mr. Befb<br>
<br>
No, you wouldn't just say &quot;I am the best&quot;. because you know, as well as I do, that when you are the best, its alot funner to stick it up the &quot;not best's&quot; ass with rhetorical comments, witty one-liners and, gloats of accomplishment.<br>
<br>
I think the idea of the /guildwar is pretty funny. But, since we all seem to agree that genralizing an individual under his/her guildtag is wrong, it makes 0 sense. I'm hoping an idea as lame as guildwar was a joke, at least I took it to be. But, you can just /d people on an individual basis for the same primal satisfaction. <p>Quarken

Pnp basicly assumes that both people are able to kill the mob, and going in after a failed raid guarentees that one of them cant.

<br>
The way this game is structured makes loot items essential for progressing to more difficult encounters. And, since the loot is not plentiful, it means that the same MOB that drops the loot items desired must be repeated. How many times would Trak need to be killed by a guild if he dropped specifically 1 of each class BP and 30 teeth each time he was killed? Definitely far fewer times than how the loot table is set up where between 0 and 2 random BPs drop along with around 4 teeth. Since the loot tables are what they are, it creates competition for limited resources.<br>
<br>
Procax, it would be nice if things could be solved through tells courteously or even in /ooc, but we've slipped way to far into the abyss to have any hope of reconciling the differences that are growing among the high level guilds. It does not help when people come in and seemingly purposefully stir crap up when they are not a member of the organizations being discussed.<br>
<br>
Breill, I think you're confusing me with Zvezda. She played a half-elf druid with the same facial graphics as my character. And after Slivers folded, I think she applied to join IV, but was turned down. To refresh your memory, I was the ranger that main-tanked for Soliid, you, Vehnn and Kyrana in Sol B upper BnB when we were around level 49 or so. As for the rest of your post, I can only conclude that it's meant to be dis-information for those people who are probably following this thread and making judgements about the guilds since they do not have first-hand knowledge of the events or the people who were there. Members of Endless and the leader of PO have both posted accounts of what happened at that VS spawn that differ substantially from what you have stated.<br>
<br>
And I owe an apology to at least some people within IV. I made a comment that stereotyped all members. That was inappropriate since I've had fun grouping with some members of IV in the past, either before they joined IV or once they joined IV. Heck, I had fun with Endren, Xarr and Atro this past weekend at upper spiders in Velketor's Labyrinth. Especially when we LD's Xarr's xp-sucking-AFK (&quot;just for a couple minutes&quot;) troll butt. But definitely, that apology does not extend to Vehnn, Plumpkin or Befb. See my comment above about people stirring crap up as to why.<br>

I don't think there is a good way for me to answer any of it. I can only say that it's sad that someone resorts to calling me a &quot;skanky she-male bitch&quot; and a &quot;spineless coward&quot;. If I somehow missed the fact that I have a pair of nuts and a penis, please let the me and the rest of my family know. Did it make you feel better to belittle me?<br>
<br>
Cure has asked the question in his other post. Why was IV there so late at night when they knew that Sacred Fires and The Endless were having a joint raid? Raif said he was bored; Rhyu says it's because they could; Malathor says that being moral is boring, and that it's just a game geez; Ghol was there to kill a god. So I'd like an answer from the 29 other present members at that raid. You must have seen that what we were attempting was something new and something that was almost unthinkable a month ago. So why were the rest of you there?<br>
<br>
Why is Endless being flamed for using CotH to get down to a raid? We're being flamed for breaking down to Trak (not the Agony thing) with 10 people, when the origins of this thread are about how IV uses a break team to get to a safe spot to CotH people down to the raid.<br>
<br>
What has happened here is basically what a couple people have been saying all along. That we should not be friends with IV, because they are friends with us to leech members, to make us their feeder guild. It's easy for someone in IV to send me a tell insulting me on how our guild can't do shit on our own, and yet is it recognized anywhere that The Endless members were there to help with Gorenaire, Dain raids, Cazic raids? No. Amadar and Devast helped with Gorenaire. I know at least Nukuki and Thynn were on Dain raids. Nukuki took 7 deaths on a IV Cazic raid. And then one day, The Endless wanted something that IV had to have. And gosh darn it that seriously pissed them off. Suddenly we were jackoffs and selfish greedy people who were SO gay as to call of the hero people down to the shrooms area. Endless members helped out IV on many an occasion, and yet when the way is reversed, you guys act in an exact opposite manner. And you wonder why some people in The Endless don't want to port, group, or rez you guys. <br>
<br>
I have stated officially that the choice to deny services to IV or Agony members is an *individual* choice. And I have said that if someone wishes to deny such members services, they are to do so in a cordial manner. If they haven't done so, it's because they as individuals are too upset to listen to what I suggest. If several members of TE have refused to offer you a service, that is their right. I agree that judging an entire guild by their tag is unfair, but when those people are standing there doing that deed that pissed you off with that guild tag on, how can you fault them for holding a grudge?<br>
<br>
Okay, my epics. I don't have to defend myself, but I will. I would have thought that of all people, Menexia would understand that the majority of the druid epic is done by the druid. I asked for guild assistance on two occasions, one for Ulummp, and another for Faydedar. I was the highest level druid in the guild and I was ready for Faydedar. My guild was happy to help me.<br>
<br>
Those in The Endless know that Gurgu is not my &quot;alt&quot;. I have two primaries, and I leveled both of them so that they could be of maximum use on guild raids. Gurgu is 58, Kaminya is 59. Up until the time Blaque joined the guild, Gurgu was the highest level warrior and up until Quarken stayed up for 50+ hours, she was the second highest level warrior. Another warrior got our first indicolite breastplate. Blaque, who had only recently joined, got the first warrior epic in The Endless. How many of you would have passed the epic you were being built up for to someone who had recently joined? And as it has been stated, the previous loot system of TE was a voting system. Where every member had a vote on who they felt was most deserving of a certain epic piece. Gurgu won the first hand of maestro by a guild vote, and no one can ever vote for themselves. Back then Maestro was a big deal to us, and people voted knowing that whoever got the hand would most likely be the first with epics should the day ever arrive. As ready as I was, with Blaque having NO golem ball, I passed on the Ancient Blade off of our first Queen raid. Three vermiculated tunics have dropped, and Kaminya does not wear a single one of them. Quarken and Slambam got our dual cobalt breastplates. It was hard, but I wanted them to be happy. Yes, I wear ES greaves, but I was the only druid present at the raid. So go ahead and talk some more shit about how selfish I am. I'm sure the bad stuff you've heard about me come from sources who couldn't milk our guild for what they wanted.<br>
<br>
I don't really understand what Kaziqueal is saying, is it that he thinks we gave Cazic the star ruby earring?<br>
<br>
Vulp, I didn't appreciate the BE bp because it was an empty offer in attempt to save face. Tell me honestly, would Krimzin have walked over and handed Nukuki a Donal's breastplate?<br>
<br>
Menexia, we ganked Sev without giving Agony a first shot? Tanth was yelling at people to stay back at camp, that we were not to interfere with Agony's attempt in any way. Quarken got an earful for trying to see what his health was at when Sev came within fearing distance of us. None of us could even SEE Sev when Agony began fighting.<br>
<br>
This comes from the other thread, but I fail to see the similarity between a game of Starcraft and a situation in EverQuest seeing as how the sole objective of a Starcraft game is to eliminate your opponent. And yes, I know how Starcraft is played, I played on Kali for well over a year. Actually, nevermind.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are likely more issues I'd like to address, but it's 5 am in paradise and I've gotta head off to bed. So good evening and good morning to you all.<br>

Oh and Cuminya answer my question please - since its OK in TE's book to pull a mob and kill it when another guild is pulling its guards, its OK for us to kill trak when you pull the protector right?  Its OK for us to kill cazic when you have cleared the plane and are finishing up the temple pull?  I think krim and the other people who killed CT the other night were pretty FUCKING courtous to even give you one shot after what you did to us at VS.  I really like how you respond to one little thing in my post but ignore the real issue.

We made a good first attempt, failed, and IV came in and killed the mob.<br>
<br>
Now.  I really have nothing against what happened.  While I may personally have liked to try CT a few times, getting angry at another guild for doing *essentially* what every other 50+ guild on this server does on uber mobs is childish and selfish.<br>
<br>
In my observations, IV did nothing in /ooc or /shout that would lead me to believe they were *hounding* or *pressuring* SF/TE to fail.  On the contrary, Krimzin was the lone IV member in zone and I have no problem with that.  (SF/TE had a few members watch IV's klling of CT afterword).<br>
<br>
People talk about how having IV at the portal is a distraction. Well to this I say that it is only a distraction if you allow it to be.  Personally I am unaffected by the presence of others.  It is unfortunate that some will get wrapped up in their own imagintations, excitement, and fears.  This leads only to heightened emotional states where logic is lost and what is left over is a general angst that is directed at the nearest individual or party.  <br>
<br>
It would have been nice ot have a second try, but IV, SF, CC, TE, Agony, and PO are all, in the end, going to do what they need to do to progress to the next step of their agenda.  I can tell you this though. Comments like yours mori will do nothing to further positive guild relations, and I'm a bit shocked at your callous behavior on this board.  They lead to comments like those of Befb's which are also inappropriate. (however if you shoot someone, expect to be shot at).<br>
<br>
This leads me to my final point regarding all this.  IV.  As not only the premier guild on this server, but perhaps on of the premier guilds in the game, there is a responsibility that I feel you automatically face.  That is the example you set not only by the # of mobs you kill, but how you handle kiling them.  I'm not suggesting you change the way you view Uber mobs (which I see no problem with) moreso dealing with the petty flames.  If something is insignifigant and stupid, why go through the bother of stirring the shit?  Unless I'm wrong, IV's goal is to progress through the game, not live in immortality on the rant boards.  <br>
<br>
Continue focusing on your goals, and when paths cross handle them with intelligence and as adults.  Iv'e seen just as many examples of guilds compromising as guilds racing and pissing each other off.  Too bad noone talks about those positive instances anymore. <br>
<br>
Why yesterday, PO and SF were both wanting to go to hate.  Kead and Firanel worked something out, both parties got closer to their goals and left reasonably satisfied.  Let's try to see more of that mmkay?<br>
