So where better than here? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>By his own mother's testimony in the above article, this guy was a basket case before he ever set eyes on EQ.  Let me pick her apart point by point. (all quotes Copyright Milwaukee Journal Sentinal 2002)<br><br>&quot;It's like any other addiction,&quot; Elizabeth Woolley said last week. &quot;Either you die, go insane or you quit. My son died.&quot;<br><br>Let's see...out of 400,000 (the oft-quoted membership of EQ unverifiable since AO and DAoC came out and they clamped off the population numbers) 399,999 will quit the game and do something else <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> eventually,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> no one has gone insane (he was there to begin with) and one is dead.  I'd say that makes EQ safer than say, eating vegetables (choking hazard.)<br><br>&quot;Sony Online cites its privacy policy in refusing to unlock the secrets held in her son's account.&quot;<br><br>Damned straight.  That's why it's called a Privacy Policy.  And you were his freaking mother, WTF didn't you monitor his play if you were so worried?<br><br>&quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures were because of stints on the computer.&quot;<br><br>Too bad you couldn't be dragged away from your soap operas to intervene after oh say, seizure 3 or so?  Useless cow.  What clued you in that there was a problem?  Oh, and it's called a Refresh Rate, if you cared about your late son's health you would have set it to 85hz like most people.  Monitor probably flickering like a strobelight in the evidence room even now.<br><br>&quot;Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.<br><br>'This fed right into the EverQuest playing,&quot; Woolley said. 'It was the perfect escape.' &quot;<br><br>Good thing you have VI to sue, you might have to confront your fractured DNA.  Hard to sue yourself though.<br><br>&quot;Jay Parker, a chemical dependency counselor and co-founder of Internet/Computer Addiction Services in Redmond, Wash., said Woolley's mental health problems put him in a category of people more likely to be at risk of getting addicted to online games.&quot;<br><br>Enter the Lawyers, who had probably been stalking the Wooley's since they first moved to the neighborhood.  I mean why would you even found a company like that if it wasn't to cash in on the latest social catastrophe of our sad age.  But I digress, this man is just out to make a buck from Liz, bully for him.<br><br>&quot;The manufacturer of EverQuest purposely made it in such a way that it is more intriguing to the addict,&quot; Parker said. &quot;It could be created in a less addictive way, but (that) would be the difference between powdered cocaine and crack cocaine.&quot;<br><br>I take it back, this man is obviously a True Believer.  'Scuse me, computer games are supposed to be boring and dull so people won't like them so much?  Communist!<br><br>&quot;After playing the game for 36 hours straight, he (some unrelated college senior) had a psychotic break because of sleep deprivation, Parker said. 'He thought the characters had come out of the game and were chasing him,' Parker said. 'He was running through his neighborhood having hallucinations. I can't think of a drug he could have taken where he would have disintegrated in 15 weeks.' &quot;<br><br>OK, I amend my previous statistics, 399,998 normal people, one nutcase, one corpse.  Now rated only safer than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> most</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> vegetable consumption.<br><br>&quot;Parker said that any traumatic setback to Shawn Woolley's character in EverQuest could have traumatized an already vulnerable young man.&quot;<br><br>If VI's lawyers don't yell &quot;Pre-existing condition, move to dismiss&quot; within 5 seconds of the start of the trial, they should be fired.  That was Wooley's own lawyer saying that shit.<br><br>&quot; 'The social component is big because it gives players a false sense of relationships and identity,' Parker said. 'They say they have friends, but they don't know their names.'<br><br>Elizabeth Woolley remembers when her son was betrayed by an EverQuest associate he had been adventuring with for six months. Shawn's online brother-in-arms stole all the money from his character and refused to give it back.<br><br>'He was so upset, he was in tears,' she said. 'He was so depressed, and I was trying to say, 'Shawn, it's only a game.' I said he couldn't trust those people.' &quot;<br><br>Everyone gets ripped off once.  They usually don't kill themselves over it.  And I have spoken on the phone to members of my Guild.<br><br>&quot;A game without end<br>How does it pull people in?<br><br>One key component is that the game can be played indefinitely, and there are always people populating the online world. EverQuest and other online games also have a social structure.<br><br>'The graphics are absolutely thrilling. They just haul you in,' said Parker, who has treated several people for EverQuest addiction. 'The other piece is that it takes time to leave the game. You have to find a place to hide to get out, and that makes people want to play longer.' &quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> reading this felt forced to stay in the game for days at a time because they couldn't find a safe place to /camp??????  This guy must have truly sucked.<br><br>&quot;David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and the Family in Minneapolis, said many EverQuest players refer to it as 'EverCrack.' &quot;<br><br>Damned straight!!<br><br>&quot;John Kircher, a professor at Marquette University Law School and expert in personal injury law, said a negligence action might be won if plaintiffs could successfully argue EverQuest's publishers 'should have foreseen an unreasonable risk of harm, that people could potentially hurt themselves.' &quot;<br><br>Another Lawyer.  VI obviously decided to create a killer app <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that kills</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (Bum-Bum BAAAAAAA.....)<br><br>The above has been hacked and snipped to make the people in the article appear that they have their heads further up their asses than they actually do, but sue me Bizatch.
