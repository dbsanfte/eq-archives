Recently duo'd with a ranger outside Paw at the spires, and it worked beautifully. He sow'd us, snare-pulled the mob, melee'd for a second, I then blasted it twice causing it to start running towards me. I sit down to encourage this, because before it gets to me the ranger has it hurt enough that it starts &quot;running&quot;, read as standing there fighting snare. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
How to Write a Post On How To Fix Rangers <br>
Step 1: Establish your credibility. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Hello again, I am a level 12 ranger with 2 days played and I have been playing since October and I've been to Qeynos and Qeynos Hills and Surefall Glade so I know everything there is to know about my class and how to play EQ and the high end game because I have a lot of friends who are like level 85 rangers and they taught me all this stuff so all the things I say here are absolutely right and you don't have to doubt them ever one bit. I also have 5 people on my friends list and a GM answered my petition in under 45 minutes once so I am clearly well-respected on my server. <br>
<br>
Step 2: Identify the broken skill/ability/item. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: I think archery does way too much damage, because sometimes I hit a moss snake with my Hunting Bow and it dies instantly. Whereas a level 3 rogue with a rusty dagger had to hit the moss snake 5 times before it died. Clearly this is broken and unbalancing to melee skills, because it is manaless and aggroless damage. Also, in 39 more levels I will be able to get the ability to do double damage to mobs that are not moving and not rooting. This is precisely four times the damage I am doing now if the damage I am doing now were cut in half. <br>
<br>
Step 3: Provide data supporting your claim. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Here is my parsed data supporting all of my claims, based on a sample set of a single mob: <br>
<br>
RANGER DAMAGE: 16 <br>
ROGUE DAMAGE: 4 <br>
<br>
Also, here is parsed data I got from a level 34 wizard on a completely unrelated mob: <br>
<br>
WIZARD DAMAGE: 540 <br>
<br>
As you can obviously see, damage from archery on a single mob, which is a totally useful sample set for my comphrensive statistical analysis is four times greater than the level 3 rogue with a rusty dagger. Also, wizard damage is way too uber and they need to be nerfed. <br>
<br>
Step 4: Identify who is getting the shaft based on your findings. Be sure to use the phrase &quot;a slap in the face&quot; to stress the level of injustice. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: This is a slap in the face to poverty-stricken starving children in Ethiopia who can't afford bows and arrows. <br>
<br>
Step 5: Proactively propose a solution for Verant <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: I propose a reasonable fix for the unbalancing archery is to reduce the damage we do by half while fixing line of sight issues and having Stanos just hand out Rogue epics when you hail him, probably only removing about 2 hours of work from the rogue epic as it stands now. Also, to balance the damage we are already doing too much of with archery, Endless Quiver should use 50 mana per arrow and we should get self-ports and Octo-Attack with dual wield at level 5. I feel that this would be the best solution because unlike the rest of the ranger community, I don't use archery so I feel completely justified in proposing this re-balancing of the entire ranger role. <br>
<br>
Now let's put it all together... <br>
<br>
Hello, I play a level 23 ranger on Xegony and I've watched Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves three times and I have Lord of the Rings on DVD. I'm an officer of the guild &quot;Impending Corpse Retrieval&quot; and I once soloed Gnasher Furgitt in Qeynos Hills but it took me like 17 minutes and I had to root him a lot. I also own a Ford RANGER in real life and Walker, Texas RANGER is my favorite TV show. Needless to say, I am completely in tune with the ranger community and I'm thoroughly familiar with EVERY aspect of the class, including the high end and low end games, and I even played a ranger in Ultima III for the Commodore 64. So I'm clearly well-versed in all things rangerly and I implore you to listen to my words of tremendous wisdom as I explain to you my proposal to fix something that his horribly broken and unbalancing with our class. <br>
<br>
Our ability to do damage with both melee and spells throws the entire game out of balance. It is obvious that Verant never intended us to have dual wield, double attack, the privilege of wearing chain armor, AND a 99-damage nuke at level 39! Also we get to heal, which steps on the toes of druids, shamans, clerics, and paladins. All this, AND we get a phallic helmet and we get to have massive archery damage with ONLY 45 AA points!!! Isn't it already enough that we tank slowed mobs marginally better than enchanters 15 levels below us?! This godly class Verant has created is ruining the entire game and we must be fixed. <br>
<br>
Here are some parsed logs that support all of my claims: <br>
<br>
Ranger melee damage: 9 DPS <br>
Careless Lightning damage: 99 DPS <br>
<br>
The data is from a sample set of one gnoll over a time horizon of one second. Notice how ranger spell damage is 1100% of my melee damage... tell me how that's not completely broken! Also, if we compare these numbers to this number: <br>
<br>
3 <br>
<br>
You can see that I am doing 33 times more damage than that completely unexplained 3 I just typed. <br>
<br>
Not to mention our sow spell is a slap in the face to female pigs everywhere. Shadowknights are truly getting the shaft on this because &quot;ranger&quot; has fewer syllables than &quot;shadowknight&quot;. Why should a ranger be able to both MELEE and CAST SPELLS when paladins can do the same thing but no one ever wants them in groups. But the class that is being screwed most of all by these ranger abilities are the druids, whose usefulness is in jeopardy because a ranger twice their level can cast the same buffs they can. And rangers get Tolan's Breastplate which ports them... clearly a rip off from the druid's defining class ability of porting everyone where they want to go all day long. <br>
<br>
My proposal for Verant is to completely remove melee from the list of ranger abilities. This would re-balance us with the rest of the casters, who are not able to deal significant amounts of melee damage. But in order to keep us up to par with the rest of the melees, we should get more types of Snare spells, such as Tangling Snare, Enveloping Snare, Super Snare, Comphrensive Snare, Ridiculous Snare, and Call of the Snarer. Also, we should get a Snare Mastery 1, 2, and 3 AA skill set, along with Endless Snare and Snaring Fury 1, 2, and 3. And our level 65 spell should be an upgrade to Flame Lick which, after casting it on a mob, would take an entire guild full of AE Taunt warriors to get aggro back off us. <br>
<br>
Hopefully you all agree with me, because I really don't use weapons all that much, I just run around and snare kite things like a druid anyway, so I hope Verant takes my suggestions and completely gimps the entire ranger class for the rest of you all because I made a horrible choice in deciding what class I wanted to play and now I'm going to make you all suffer for it. <br>
<br>
<br>
There you have it... a complete guide on how to construct these sort of posts for yourself. Enjoy!<br>
<br>
