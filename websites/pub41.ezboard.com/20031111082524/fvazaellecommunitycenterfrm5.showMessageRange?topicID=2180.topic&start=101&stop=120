That's retail sales (which I definitely wouldn't recommend), selling stocks to mom and pop etc. There isn't a lot of money in that line of business (caps out in the low 6 figures) and it's really sleazy. &quot;<br>
<br>
I worked the overseas market for a year and half, 3 pitch cycles, and did wonderfully.  The mom and pop stock sales are beat, simply because of our current economy and every idiot's genius comments &quot;the stock market sucks right now!&quot;.  I pitched primarily European clients, lead sources taken from such sources as corporate directories (fun schemes to get these) and high end university alumni directories (easier to get).  It's all about the target you choose.<br>
<br>
The setting in Boiler Room was exactly that - a boiler room.  It was a bullshit office selling bullshit stock.  But the fact is that whether you're pitching mom or pop or a multimillion-dollar businessman, the same tactics apply.  Pitch, close, rebuttal, close, rebuttal, close, etc.  Sales are sales, this just happens to be the rawest form... your style of sales will determine how lucrative you can make it.  Your reference to capping out at low 6 figures is really inaccurate, as it STRONGLY depends on the broker.<br>
<br>
Regardless... sleazy?  Aren't you the one who talked about working while you had strippers walking around on the business floor, and how the job wasn't for the easily offended?

There is nothing wrong with nudity.  It doesn't hurt anyone and I have no moral issues with it.  I couldn't care less if some woman wants to take off her clothes for money.  If one person likes to watch it, and another likes to pay for it, then it's in both of their interests to execute the trade.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, churning stocks and selling stuff you know is crap to mom and pop, who are putting their retirement savings in you hands, is sleazy.  You're hurting someone.<br>
<br>
Granted, there are good retail brokers who really do help their clients, but for the most part, they don't make nearly as much money as the sleazebags.  You make more money by executing more trades (churning).  In reality, mom and pop are almost always better off buying a few stocks and holding them until they are retired because 1) the markets are efficient, and unless you have inside info, you have a random chance of success on any stock at any time and 2) the tax consequences of frequent sales dramatically limit long term returns.<br>
<br>
Actually, mom and pop are almost invariably better off in a mutual fund as few people have the cash to diversify effectively.<br>
<br>
As for salaries, the guys I worked with were generally making 2 million+/yr (the 30+ crowd).  It's pretty simple really, doing a trade with a fidelity or with John and Jane Smith take about the same amount of time.  In the first case, you might moving 20 million dollars of securities at a time (or more even).  In the second, you might be moving 2000 dollars worth.  Commission is based on how much you move, so of course the retail guy isn't going to make nearly as much.<br>
<br>
Personally, I never worked in retail, I only did institutional sales.  To some degree, sales is sales.  If you are good at selling, you're good at selling almost anything (usually).<br>
<br>
Boiler room is just NOTHING like what I did or what most Wall Street professionals do.  Those guys were scum, preying on innocent people.  I'm not saying all retail sales are that bad, that's not my point.  However, Boiler Room is a really bad example of what digo might be doing.  It's just not at all typical of the industry.  In fact, it's an inaccurate stereotype that the industry has to fight against.  Most Wall Street professionals provide valuable services for their money.<br>

When I was an undergrad at Dartmouth College, we used to have to pay something like $900 bucks a term to get $700 of DBA (Declining Balance Account, the money we could use to buy food).  This was to subsidize food services cause they couldn't make a profit.  Even with the subsidy, they lost money.<br>
<br>
The question was, why?  They charged more than local businesses for food, and it wasn't as good.  The hours were less convenient.  Students made $5.55/hr to start.  The reason was that the completely unskilled workers with no education were making $25-$30 an hour.  That's just ridiculous.  I have an aunt with a masters in nursing who is a manager who makes $22 an hour.  My mother is educated and is a Catholic school teacher and makes less than this (a lot less).<br>
<br>
I just don't know where people that have essentially no education get off thinking they deserve to make $30 in a completely unskilled job, when the guys at McDonalds do the same work for $6 an hour.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with someone who is skilled making that kind of money, even without education (a carpenter, plumber, etc.)  However, someone doing completely unskilled labor shouldn't really be making much over $10/hr imo.<br>
<br>
The Yale workers have some nerve striking and demanding more than $19 an hour.  I'd fire them all, put the wage at about $12/hr, and hire new ppl.<br>

No offense intended (really) - but have you ever actually been to Wall Street?  <br>
<br>
Yes – It's true that there are firms filled people who spent years and years and thousands of dollars at places like Dartmouth College.  These are the same firms where you work your ass off making someone else money until you're 50-60 and you become a partner and feed off people who were in the same position as you in the beginning.<br>
<br>
Yes – It’s true <br>
<br>
“There is nothing wrong with nudity… …the other hand, churning stocks and selling stuff you know is crap to mom and pop, who are putting their retirement savings in you hands, is sleazy. You're hurting someone.”<br>
<br>
Seriously… boo fucking hoo.  If someone is going to be a chump, then I would have gladly made them my chump.  Trying to make a point to specify the line between white and wrong is so pointless when your own statement sits in the gray.<br>
<br>
The fact is this - If you’re out to make as much money as you can as fast as possible, then sometimes you have to be ruthless.  If you want to work a job that helps you sleep at night, go tutor religion at your local church.  If you want to work a job where you go to sleep at night next to a couple of models on a pile of cash, then hey – get over the fact that your gain is coming out of someone else’s pocket.  Welcome to America… are you a salesman or a consumer?<br>
<br>
Yes – I agree that going after Moms and Pops is pointless, which is why I specified the clientele that I worked with in my previous point.  It’s just a matter of the targets you choose in your mission to get rich… but hey you can go fishing in your toilet if it makes you happy.<br>
<br>
“there are good retail brokers who really do help their clients, but for the most part, they don't make nearly as much money as the sleazebags.”<br>
<br>
Exactly my point.  What you see as a sleazebag is what I call a ruthless businessman.  You mentioned in a previous post about going to school for your series7 license?  You can study for your series 7 in 3 months while working a full time job and pass the test your first time.  (November 1999 for me).  If you want it, you’ll go for it.  And if you have it what it takes, the end result is a guarantee.<br>
<br>
“If you are good at selling, you're good at selling almost anything (usually).”<br>
<br>
That’s something I agree with you 100%.<br>
<br>
***!!! HUGE DISCLAIMER !!!***<br>
<br>
I believe everything I’ve said above.  However, my “downfall” is that I have a strong conscience and a strong set of morals.  No price is worth selling that part of me, so I stepped down from this path.  (long story – not really appropriate to get into here).  I don’t have anything against it – It’s just not what does it for me.<br>

Yep, worked on Wall Street for years.  I've done both sales and trading and investment banking (structured finance).  I never did the small time stuff like retail brokerage though.  I wouldn't have wasted my time with it.  It's chump change.<br>

<br>
There is some truth to that, but the payoff is way before 50.  Most people in institutional sales and trading who don't suck are making 7 figures in their 30's.  The vp's and up do feed off the associates and analysts to a large degree, but this is the nature of all business really.  Sales and trading is based more on skill than banking.  As soon as you're on the phones, what you make is strongly tied to how much you sell.  There is usually no cap on your income.<br>

Having no conscience at all can at times be helpful.  I don't think what I did was so wonderful or that I saved the world.  I didn't.  I made money, and that's about it.  However, I didn't spend my time hurting people either and I felt no guilt doing what I did.  I provided a valuable business service for which I was well compensated.  Anyone who does retail brokerage wasn't good enough to play with the big boys so has to scam people to make a mere fraction of what they make in the big leagues.<br>

What are you talking about?  I don't know of any school that teaches you how to take a series 7.  I did it when I was working, like pretty much everyone else I know.  I studied for a weekend and passed.  You join a company, the compliance dept sends you some books by interoffice mail, and you schedule the exam and go take it as soon as you can.  Dartmouth considers its education department too &quot;vocational&quot; and doesn't even have departments in subjects like marketing, communications, or finance.  Certainly they wouldn't teach ppl to take the series 7.<br>

Most of the people on Wall Street who really make money are pretty much amoral.  Note that I said &quot;amoral&quot; and not &quot;immoral.&quot;  They aren't generally the idealistic type that are out to save the world, but they aren't evil either.  Retail brokerage crap is small potatoes and not worth wasting one's time on.  Institutional sales has no moral implications either way for the most part and you make a crapload more cash.  <br>

to me everything i am about to say is common sense and i am stating the obvious. i apologize for that, but i feel it needs to be said anyway so i will.<br>
<br>
first of all, no you aren't the only person who gets sick of hearing people &quot;brag&quot; about sleeping around. people like sex, we get it. and yes it does get annoying to have to listen to crap shoved in your face all the time when you don't want to hear it. but yeah, just learn to put in your earplugs and give them the cookie they are craving.<br>
<br>
you also are not the only person who wants more out of sex, than just the sake of having sex. its a stupid stereotype that pisses me off, because people buy into it that shouldn't. a person shouldn't have to feel like there is something wrong with them because they don't fit into someones description of normal. and i guess that is why this gets to me. because it is all BS.<br>
<br>
a guy is not a &quot;pussy&quot; for having emotions / morals / expectations involved in the things they do. especially when it comes to sex.  so there are a lot of guys out there that could care less and just fuck some girl they don't know for the sake of fucking, but i also know there are a lot of people out there that like to give that impression - regardless of what they really are thinking or feeling... because of people like here, telling them they are gay or need to &quot;be a man&quot; and be like how they are suppose to be.<br>
<br>
you expect him not to preach, which i agree with, but he has a right to explain himself or be annoyed at someone telling him he needs to be a man and go get some, when he has no interest in the idea. people usually don't like others telling them what to do/feel. it didn't exactly sound one sided, sounded more like an argument/discussion. or two way &quot;preaching.&quot;<br>
<br>
i know enough guys that have had sex with girls they didn't care for, just to get some. and i know enough look back at it and think they were stupid for it, or even &quot;disgusted&quot; by it to some degree (i'm sure that depends on the experience). i realize not all guys are like this, but it is hardly unusual for a person to have regrets in this area.  <br>
<br>
i know guys who fucked some girl they barely knew from an &quot;instant attraction&quot; ,  and ended up getting emotionally screwed up from it just the same. they aren't pussies, they are human.<br>
<br>
there is NOTHING wrong with not wanting to just have empty sex with someone, or wanting to wait until you find someone you care about. god, that is such BS. so a lot of guys wouldn't be able to turn down some naked girl in front of them offering sex, but that doesn't mean there aren't some who wouldn't be able to. and it doesn't mean any of them wouldn't feel &quot;dirty&quot; for it not being with someone they care about instead. <br>
<br>
no matter what anyone says.  and you have no reason to have to explain yourself to anyone. if people want to brag about their sexual lives like they are the coolest person in the world for sleeping around, let them, or try to distance yourself from them if you don't like being around people who can't keep it their own business. just know you aren't the only person out there that feels that way.<br>
<br>
let's kill another stereotype while we are at it. not all girls want &quot;bad boys&quot; - that is so not true. i know me personally, it is a huge turn off if a guy is a party guy , or has no issues with having sex with someone he has no feelings for. i don't care if other people do it, but it is a turn off for me to get involved with someone who is like that. or treats me like a jerk. no thanks. <br>
<br>
i would much rather prefer the dorky loner &quot;nice guy&quot; , &quot;emo pussy&quot; over the party sex crazed stereotypical male any day. that is just how i am. but i know i am not the only girl who feels this way.... for sure. <br>
<br>
no doubt there are girls who are attracted to the &quot;bad boy&quot; image, obviously, but it is just lame to make it out like that is all girls want. it isn't.<br>
<br>
about &quot;clingy&quot; guys. i think that is kinda BS too. if there is one thing i know girls like - its ATTENTION. i know a buttload of girls expect the guy they are with to fawn over them.  including myself. if you are with some guy and he doesn't show interest in what you are up to, or wanting to hang around you a lot, or hold your hand in public, whatever itis you call &quot;clingy&quot; - you are going to feel like something is wrong and wonder why he isn't giving you the attention you want. <br>
<br>
the thing is, even if you don't actually want the affection/attention - you still want HIM to want to give it..  self esteem will suffer if you are not with a clingy partner to some extent. girls expect it. you know it. they just need to knows when to give some space as well.<br>
<br>
and i know there are guys out there who feel the same , and like/want &quot;clingy&quot; girls when in a relationship too. omg! ask danny bonaduce if you don't believe me! :P  stereotypes are nothx. i have experienced it, i don't mind it.  <br>
<br>
i have been friends with enough guys to know there are plenty looking for love. not all guys are just about sex, its a lame generalization. just not all guys are going to talk about it openly.<br>
<br>
in fact i can't really think of any guys that i have been friends with that have really just been all about sex. most guys are snuggle bunnies deep down, you know it. but i guess it depends on the kind of people you want to hang around with to define what you see as normal anyway...<br>
<br>
it's all personal preference. it has nothing to do with &quot;right&quot; , or &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;normal.&quot;<br>
<br>
for every girl out there that wants nothing but hot monkey jungle whatever sex from guys that treat them like dirt, there is another girl out there looking for a nice guy that doesn't have a list of 1000 girls he's fucked hanging on his bedroom mirror. if you're lucky you'll find one that wants the nice guy and the monkey sex. hoo hoo hoo.<br>
<br>
so yeah, to sum this all up<br>
all girls like sex with whoever wherever whenever.  all guys want flowers and romance. generalizations are fun.<br>
<br>
goodnight crazy people. <br>
<br>
<br>
anyone wanna make out ? zzz <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hawkyhawke>Hawky Hawke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/15/03 8:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~</span><hr size=1> that's the answer i was looking for - thanks<br>

For the most part, they don't.  However, if they are treated too well, if the guy is too nice, they get almost suspicious.  I think that it basically comes down to people wanting to get a &quot;desirable&quot; mate.<br>
<br>
Essentially, people fall into different levels of desirability.  These are based on lots of factors, including physical attraction, social standing, money, power, personality, etc.  Men and women value these traits differently.<br>
<br>
I'd say for men, the number 1 thing is physical attraction, which is why there is so much pressure on women to take care of their looks.  Women on the other hand, in my experience, are most attracted to confidence, social standing, power, authority, etc.  They look for someone that is successful in his career, prominent in social situations, etc.  This, imo, is the biggest turn on for women.<br>
<br>
Some guys fall into the trap of thinking that if they are nice enough to a girl, she'll be interested in him.  They basically cater to every whim of the woman, and that's not what the woman wants.  This man comes across as weak (or as others have said, pussy), and the woman feels like he must be beneath her level if he is treating her so well.<br>
<br>
Both sexes, to a certain extent, like a challenge.  They like someone who is a bit hard to get.  They don't want someone who follows them around like a sick puppy begging them for attention.  They do want someone that they feel is a bit above their own level, and if the person is a bit above, he/she will recognize the position, and not beg for affection.<br>
<br>
In the dating world, nice guys do finish last to a large degree.  You need to be assertive and confident.  You need to not try too hard.  Make it seem like you are worth pursuing, and you might get pursued.  Don't make it seem like you're so desperate that you'll do anything, or you won't get anywhere.  No one wants the desperate people.<br>

<br>
It's interesting to watch women change their views as they get older.  A lot of them go for the bad boy thing early on, get married, and realize that they married an asshole...  Then they get divorced.  Sometimes it doesn't take marriage, but just a few bad relationships.<br>
<br>
A lot of people loook for the &quot;dorky loner nice guy&quot; that you mentioned the second time around (or just later on for those that don't marry the &quot;bad boy&quot;).  It seems that after being burned once by the &quot;bad boy,&quot; they go for the other extreme in an attempt to avoid their first mistake.<br>

I would say 99% of women are at least somewhat attracted to the bad boy.  Those that say they aren't are fooling themselves.  Deep down, the renegade, prince of thieves, James Dean, swashbuckling, against all conventions, Brad Pitt in Fight Club, heroic male (with a secret soft side he only shares with YOU) appeals to ALL women.  All men want to BE that man.  This is natural.  Genetics dictates that we are attracted to the best mate.  <br>
<br>
At the most basic level, women want strong men who will be good providers and protect the family.  <br>

I agree with digo completely on this.  If a guy is clingy, the woman will generally feel that if he is that desperate, he must be beneath her,i.e. not in her league, and she will move on and look for a better mate.<br>
<br>
Women hate clingy guys.  I haven't ever seen an exception to this.<br>
<br>
Not being clingy doesn't mean ignoring a woman and not paying any attention to her.  It means giving her space and not appearing desperate.  The guy that pretends he doesn't care is more likely to succeed than the guy that shows how bad he wants a girl.<br>
