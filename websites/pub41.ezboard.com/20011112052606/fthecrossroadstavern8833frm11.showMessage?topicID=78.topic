That goddamn forum is so censored there is no way in hell this will ever get posted, so I edited it so it would still be directed at them. And yeah, this is kinda a flame so I am posting it here.<br>
<br>
How the f*** is it possible to exploit some bug in the aggro code when using charmed mobs as pets?<br>
<br>
Its not like you have total control over your pet. You barely have limited. Your pet either is attacking, or not. You can't tell it to push to the wall; you can't tell it to to bash or kick ONLY when the other mob starts casting a spell. You tell it to attack, and it does it's thing. It's not like we can tell our pet /pet exploit aggro bug. <br>
<br>
Since the realease of SoV a select few mobs have been Flurrying. End of story.<br>
<br>
To say that charmed mobs flurrying generate too much aggro is lame. &quot;Flurry&quot; Doesn't generate any special aggro. Just the massive melee dmg output normally generates that much aggro. How is this an &quot;exploit&quot;? Is VI saying charming a mob; in which all mobs are more powerful than a PC within comparable levels; and having it fight for you is an &quot;exploit?” Then they need to reconsider the spell charm and or just remove it from the game. <br>
<br>
Mobs ARE more powerful than any pet of equal level. Period. And when charmed, they become powerful tools. But. Charm is limited, and charm generates an insane amount of aggro. Insuring that if the enchanter or bard is not maintaining charm, they will get beat up when it is resisted/drops, and yes, in the case of enchanters, the tanks usually will be un able to taunt the mob off the enchanter in time for the enchanter to receive a heal.<br>
<br>
Lastly. The introduction of this change, and the announcement by LoS of the second killing of the Avatar of War are far too close to be considered coincidental. Its funny how this nerf, for that is what it is, DIRECTLY inhibits LoS's ability to utilize their tactic to defeat the AoW. Which means, that VI doesn't want LoS, or anyone, to spank their favorite pet.<br>
<br>
VI’s evasive tactics are faulty.<br>
If they can adequately explain HOW this bug occurs then none can say that they are simply inhibiting charm as a reflexive action to protect their pride in their pet mob. They won't explain how this bug works because it DOESN'T EXIST. Hitting in melee for 2000+ in a single melee round WILL generate massive amounts of aggro, which is what flurry does. And this is how charmed pets in kael are exploiting some &quot;bug&quot; to maintain aggro on themselves over a mob. A Protector of Zek (I think these are the lowest flurrying mobs, can't remember) Hit for around 240 x 8. At least, thats what they hit me for. If it flurries, thats 1920 points of damage, plus Bash AND Kick (which every mob can do BOTH of). While your average warrior with epics, on an average quad is doing 80 x 4 for a net of 320, plus bash OR kick. Um hello? Of COURSE the chamed mob will maintain aggro. It hits for an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE more damage. JUST AS FAST.<br>
<br>
And its not like disclosing the aggro issues will make everyone start “exploiting” this bug, for charm is disabled on mobs that this bug can be utilized with, therefore there will be no repercussions by divulging such information.<br>
<br>
But VI won't say anything, because they’re guilty of nerfing charm to protect their pet mob. The only way to disprove such accusations is to show us how this was in fact a bug, and not some concoction derived to validate their desire to protect the Avatar of War.<br>

Pissed off at this blatant act of reprisal to protect their stupid pets mobs.<br>
<br>
p.s. Has anyone else ever gotten a post replied to or posted on the forums? It seems they only reply to the /hugglez posts or the really poorly thought out ones where they can manipulate to hide facts.<br>
<br>
p.s.s. We've all seen mobs that are completely 100% immune to magic. When are we going to see mobs that are completely 100% immune to melee damage? thx, plz pull through<br>

Any chance there will some explanation of why giants in Kael can no longer be charmed? Seems odd that the zone would come down out of the blue and giants no longer charmable. Crowd control? I personally think it was a bad move since giants cannot be charmed... and I have an idea it was due to Avatar of War being killed, but I'm sure if a comment was mad it would clear things up.. Thanks!<br>
<br>
I'll do my best to explain the situation.<br>
<br>
Most of you are aware that there is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the aggro code. In Kael there are a lot of NPCs that can be charmed that are significantly more powerful than any pet. Some folks were using this combination of bug and situation to make encounters much more trivial than they were intended to be.<br>
<br>
Fixing the bug will require a full patch, and a largish one at that. We weren't willing to make a large emergency patch, taking down all the servers and requiring all that downtime for our customers to fix a bug being abused in one zone.<br>
<br>
This left us with pretty much three options.<br>
<br>
1) Allow folks to continue to use the bug to their advantage.<br>
2) Begin punishing people for using the bug until it could be patched.<br>
3) Remove the ability to use the bug in the situation where it was most abusable, Kael, and then fix the bug with the next patch and remove the temporary fix.<br>
<br>
We chose the third option.<br>
<br>
We don't want people using bugs to their advantage. We feel that it harms the game integrity and the gameplay of those that don't use bugs to their advantage. We couldn't take option one.<br>
<br>
We could choose option two, but policing such things requires resources, and banning people isn't something we like to do. This is a new bug, and perhaps people were unsure that it is indeed a bug. And in most circumstances this bug only changes the play style of some people. Only in a few circumstances does this bug become abusable. So fixing the specific circumstance is better than giving warnings to players.<br>
<br>
I know the next question, and let me answer it right now. This is a new bug, and it could be argued with some conviction that players using it to their advantage were unaware that it wasn't purposeful code change. In the case of the abuse of safe zones, it is well known that using such locations is against our rules. It can't be reasonably argued that any player with a character over 50th level doesn't understand that.<br>
<br>
In any case, we plan to fix the bug with the next patch. Until then, the NPCs in Kael will probably remain uncharmable. We understand that this adversely affects single and double group raids in that zone, and for that we are sorry. But things should be back to normal soon. Assuming anyone knows what normal is anyway… <br>

<br>
Here are the details...<br>
<br>
10 giantsbane casting wizards will do insane damage to Tormax.<br>
<br>
5 clerics will keep pet alive<br>
<br>
5 enchanters will keep pet charmed and fighting<br>
<br>
Everybody binds, for the moment charm breaks and wipes everybody on the hate list (wizards first hehe).<br>
<br>
Yep, the core component to a successful Tormax slaying would be 20 people.  For the Tormax fight itself the extra damage dealers (melee) are purely optional.  The wizards each doing 30k dmg will inflict 300k dmg total on Tormax.  This does not include the damage inflicted by the pet, who will stay ahead of Tormax health regen.<br>
<br>
I will agree the pet aggro situation was out of hand.  I disagree with &quot;yanking the rug&quot; out from under us.  At least they finally formulated a response to the situation.<br>

This didn't happen as a direct result of the AoW dying.<br>
<br>
Do I agree with the current fix?  Hell No<br>
Do I realize there was a pretty big problem?  Hell Yes<br>
<br>
Think about it, no matter what zone you're in this is a bug.  Yeah kael sticks out and is where it was most abusable because of the massive number of undercon Giants.  Right now you can still go test this and see there is a problem.  You could literally have a Necro pet tanking an uber mob with little to no effort at the moment.  Yeah, the giants were doing tons of damage which would cause them to gain agro, trouble was that the giants gained the agro (were tanking) before doing hardly any damage at all.<br>
<br>
Take for example you charm a giant and send it at Vindicator first, it's tanking then you send in your melees.  Your warriors have been beating on Vindi for a while when your charmed giant dies, so you go charm a new one and send it in on Vindicator.  Keep in mind, at this point your warrior has probably done around 5k in damage or so.  You're charm giant hits Vindicator like 2 rounds and is already tanking.  That's right, after doing only 1k damage or less your charmed pet is already tanking over your warriors who have done over 5k damage now.<br>
<br>
This alowed extremely low numbers take on big mobs.  This also allowed you to kill big mobs with no tactics (other then charming stuff).  I don't agree with the fix, although it's temporary, however there was a pretty obvious problem that was being abused. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uelmasoulseer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElmaSoulseer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(8/7/01 9:19:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just because I am an SLR, do I look that stupid?</span><hr size=1> What I am saying is that the charmed pet maintaining aggro has very little to do with the increased pet aggro code. Hell, I can't get my own damn chanter pet to keep aggro on a mob when the only thing I'm doing is casting a damage shield and beserker strength on it.<br>
<br>
The SOLE reason the charmed mobs maintain aggro, and the reason you can ONLY do this trick in kael, is because of FLURRYING mobs that hit normaly for 240 (well, hit me...) with a delay of around 15 to 20. Doing around 3500 every 10 seconds froma SINGLE source, AND still taunting (charmed mobs can taunt) and consistently doing the 3500 with out need of mana or casting time (re:giant bane spells) Will keep aggro on the pet. Wizards can only dish out 2000 ever 16 seconds, while the charmed pet will do 6000 (if it doesn't flurry) over the same period of time.<br>
<br>
Thats how they maintain aggro. Now, sick 2-3 Charmed mobs of this power and you will NEVER get aggro off them. Your not even in the same LEAGUE as them, let alone dmg output.<br>

lol, once again, Alan doesn't even respond via email to me, nor post. /sigh<br>
<br>
And yes I know its a temporary fix. I doubt its going to get any better after the patch. I am pretty sure they are going to disable charm in this zone like they disable levitate in SG, ToV and Velkators, Just like they disable CoH in PoS, and Gate in VP and PoS. <p><div align=center>

Two ways to fix what you're describing I don't know that anyone would like either:<br>
<br>
1)  Fixing the con on these mobs, they probably should be level 60 anyways<br>
<br>
2)  Lower their power so it's reletive to their level, you know, so level 55 giants aren't flurrying or hitting for 275 x 4 per round.<br>
<br>
If they did the first thing, stuff wouldn't be charmable, if they did the second stuff wouldn't be worth charming (or at least that's what some people would say).  Anyways...this wasn't/isn't just a problem in kael I assure you, kael was just the zone that it was most exploitable in.  I'm sure we can agree that being able to kill Vindicator with 3 groups and Tormax with 4 isn't something that should have been happening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uertai123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ertai123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#333333>(8/8/01 11:33:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just because I am an SLR, do I look that stupid?</span><hr size=1> I think the easiest way to fix this problem would be to not allow charmed NPCs to be CHed....either just by PCs or NPCs too.<br>
