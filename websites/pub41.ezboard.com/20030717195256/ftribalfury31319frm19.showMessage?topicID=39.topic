<br>
We hit kedge.  2 groups, we knew Phinny was up.  We invised to the mermaid area, then plowed from there to phinny.  we single pulled phinny's guards down behind the ledge.  Then, with one guard remaining, we tackled Phinny.  Grats to all those present as the first official take-down of Phinny by TF had only one casualty.  After seeing that guys..how did you feel?  What could we have done differently?  Tanks:  Do you think we should have charged as I suggested, or was trying to pull him a better idea?  Phinny dropped no epic items whatsoever.  He did drop a rod of malaisement, shaman-only.<br>
<br>
after we dropped the People's Elbow on Phinny, it was time for the Tainted/Corrupted Seahorse for rasta.  we evaced from phinny's room (btw, after killing Phinny, its best to &quot;quickly&quot; boot over behind the ledge to avoid repops) and went down to the searhorses.  Again, kedge was bent to our will and Rasta cleaned up one more epic piece.<br>
<br>
Next up was KC for Kung.  We went there with a full group, and a mage-rogue team.  we plowed down to the warlord room, and set up shop.  After a couple cycles, Rhiat, our newest TF rogue (who was his sponsor btw?) had to leave.  Then there was 7.<br>
<br>
Fadari got Donal's Boots of Mourning and Kung got his metal pipe from the pawbuster.  all was well in the night for TF.<br>
<br>
To all those who got drops yesterday, a big GRATS!  Only one thing I like seeing more than getting an epic drop, and that is getting multiple epic drops. =)<br>
<br>
To all those that attended, I want to say thank you very much.  I want to list all those that attended, but didn't make a list, and won't wing it for fear of missing someone, so you know who you are if you're reading this, THANKS!!<br>
<br>
To all those that are thinking of maybe getting to know kedge a bit better, I would love to take an XP group there anytime, as it IS the highest XP-bonus dungeon in the game (yes, more than the beloved Hole.) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Gratz on the Karnor things.<br>
<br>
But back to Phinny and the charge approach.  I do not think that would be a good approach (this is just my opinion, yours may vary by mileage).  You got two groups (just an example) and there are 4-5 seahorses and Phinny.  You charge in.  Get all sorts of happy little aquatic creatures that are so pleased to see you, that they want to rip out your heart and show it to you.  Poor enchanter is going crazy mezzing stuff and hoping that everything goes well and they don't get major aggro when stuff starts waking up.  Lets say that the chanter can't mez things and then have to fall back on the tank mez method.  Now in a normal place, it'd probably be somewhat doable, but in Kedge with the whole underwater thing going on, and the vertical motions going on, it's not going to be easy.  Tanks are getting damage like crazy, clerics are getting nervous getting the healing off and not getting aggro, and Drannor's little Vebartik is rumbling all over the place (and mainly I'm wondering how Drannor is making them shrill whistles in an underwater zone....).<br>
<br>
Again, this is just my thoughts on the matter.  Considering that last night was the third time I had been in Kedge and the first time that I had ever even seen Phinny, I'd say stick with the pull approach.  If there are more people present than last night, maybe a charge (with a tank/cleric combo for each seahorse and Phinny perhaps?) would be a better approach.  Then again, I'd still be hunting moss snakes if they gave me exp still.  I like being safe and I think that it was a safe way to handle it last night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xaznor>xaznor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Bastid</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/2/03 12:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: From Kedge to Karnors....</span><hr size=1> her is the list that went to kc<br>

Lemme rephrase what i said.<br>
<br>
AFTER we single pull all of his guards, and there is only Phinny and MAX one guard remaining.  WE were having the discussion of charging in on Phinny, or trying to pull him.  As it turned out, we had to charge him anyhow, since he wasn't very cooperative.  My question was this:<br>
<br>
in that scenario, what would have been the best course of action?  My first run at him, there was a single group of four of us, one cheal druid, 2 warriors and me.  We owned him (granted those three were from triality hehe.)<br>
<br>
Personally, (not that I saw kung die, but I think it went down like this, plz chime in kung to give us the low-down) I think if we had charged in when I had suggested it, after all but one of Phinny's guards were removed, I think we could have avoided Kung's death.  I want to make our Phinny runs flawless....which would seem more difficult to me if I hadn't been in a 4-man group that owned him.  With less than a full group, with no mezzing, he was doable.  So with the troop we had last night, it should have been tit.  It was pretty close to flawless tho, one death is not bad, but we are capable of perfect with him.  We take on 60's....phinny is only 50-51ish.   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Told you I was a little slow on the uptake there Drannor.  I thought you just wanted us to all rush in and tackle the seahorses and Phinny all at once.  That would have been fun, a little bit foolish but still fun.  But if what you meant by charging in was what happened last night (running in and beating up Phinny and one of the guards) then I'm cool with that.  It was done and all was well.  Just I'll go and curse the EQ Gods up and down a little for making the other peoples epics so gosh darn hard.  I really feel for others if they have to deal with crud like that.  A nasty spawn that stands a slight chance of dropping something you need.  And if it don't drop what you need, you gotta go back.<br>
