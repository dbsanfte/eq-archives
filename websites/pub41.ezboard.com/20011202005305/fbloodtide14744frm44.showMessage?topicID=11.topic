I want to extend that discussion.<br>
<br>
I'm outraged at these lawsuits:<br>
<br>
* $3B awarded to a smoker because Philip Morris didn't do enough to warn him of the dangers of smoking<br>
* A burglar in Southern California won a negligence lawsuit against a homeowner; there was water on the kitchen floor and the burglar slipped and fell.  He subsequently sued the homeowner and won monetary damages.<br>
* A McDonald's customer sued because through her clumsiness, she spilled hot coffee on herself.  The coffee was hot???  Oh my God!  Who would have thought!<br>
* A market downturn causes stocks to drop.  Immediately, all the class-action ambulance chasers quickly file class action lawsuits against every company whose stock dropped 5% or greater.  They have no plaintiffs, but file the cases anyway &quot;just in case&quot;.<br>
* The government suing tobacco companies on behalf of the people of the United States of America, claiming that we've all been swindled and that despite that plain-English warning on the packs that have existed since the 1960's, we were led to believe that smoking was good for our bodies?<br>
* The Department of Housing and Urban Development under Clinton/Gore suing gun manufacturers for creating the high crime rate in their low-income housing projects.  It's rather funny -- I went to a high school where 55% of the students were absent during shotgun deer season days, yet we didn't seem to have any gun crime problems.  But it's those evil gun manufacturers!<br>
<br>
The winners:  Lawyers, and only lawyers.<br>
The losers:  The public as a whole.  Lawsuit capabilities that exist today create far too much of a risk, prevent companies from entering markets, etc.<br>
<br>
So where do you draw the line?  How do you draw the line?  How do you ensure that remedies are available but at the same time control them?  1 person, $3 Billion in damages?  The guy's potential lifetime income probably came nowhere near $3M, much less a thousand times that.<br>
<br>
I'm all for ensuring that remedies are available as a last resort, but lawsuits today are just like the lottery.  Find something to sue for, and hope you hit it big!<br>

The court system is an imprtant and vital part of a libertarian society. It allows all personal rights violations to be handled without additional laws and restrictions.<br>
<br>
For example Speed limits,<br>
<br>
IMO not necesarry, if you drive in an unsafe manner you should be sued by the people you injure or whose property you damage. That should be reason enough to encourage people to drive safely.<br>
<br>
EPA<br>
not necesarry, If someone is negligent and pollutes your land you have every right to sue them in court for damages done.<br>

<br>
Because companies like Netcom and such were pulling the plug on UNIX shell services in favor of direct PPP &amp; web, I decided to provide a service that was relatively stable for friends and people I thought I knew relatively well.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the thanks I got was in the form of 2 subpoenas and 1 2703(d) (investigation order) for three different defendants (apparently I didn't know my acquaintances all that well) and had to retain counsel.  I wasn't happy with the fact I had to shell out thousands of dollars to provide assistance in investigations -- this wasn't even to defend myself -- all to the lawyers.<br>
<br>
Until the system is changed such that lawyers no longer are the only winners, the court system is more streamlined, the awards are more in-line with the damage done, and a common person can defend himself, I can't believe that suing is the right remedy for anything.<br>
<br>
It's very clear that the 12 jurors in the Philip Morris case were not thinking very clearly when they gave ONE PERSON an award of THREE BILLION DOLLARS.  That's a complete outrage, in my opinion.  How do you fix that?  No one wants to be judged if the outcome can be as unpredictable as that.  That's why required binding arbitration is becoming common in everything from employment agreements to software licensing.<br>
<br>
Note that I'm not a smoker, although I used to smoke cigarettes.<br>

Is a person entitled to punitive damages beyond those compensatory damages that were felt as a result of a violation of rights?

But lets be honest here.  An attorney has to have a client.  Voters elect lawmakers who enact the legislation.  Jurors have to make damage awards.  So who is the culprit--not the lawyer, but our society.  Time for everyone of us to be held accountable.<br>
<br>
And the exception to the rule is not the rule.  You cite aberrational cases.  The 3 billion dollar cigarette case will be reversed or knocked down considerably.

There are good ones but they are not the ones you hear about.  To find a good honest attorney they almost are required to be family.<br>
<br>
And I would like to point out your use of the saying "don't throw the baby out with the bath water."  Lets analyze where that comes from.  The saying originated in a much less sanitary time, when people took yearly baths.  At that time, the man of the house went first, and got the clean water to bathe in.  He was followed by his wife, then children in order of age.  So when you got to the end, there was extremely filthy water that was almost pure mud for the baby to be cleaned in.  When they were done, the muddy water would be taken out and thrown out.  Due to the extreme blackness of the water, it was possible to actually not see the baby in the water.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at what you applied to.  You are saying just because the system is totally screwed up and completely appallingly filthy, it should be left alone just to avoid harming the "baby."  I find this a completely appropriate thing to say, since the good case far more often than not seems to be the exception.  Maybe it's not really the exception but since you never hear about the normal cases on the news, you have to go looking for them, REALLY CAREFULLY or you might miss them entirely.  Just like you had to really carefully search thru that filthy water to find the baby.<br>

<br>
The system is not screwed.  Isloated incidents are not indicative of a global problem.  Our justice system needs reform to keep pace with society and technology.  Then again, most systems within our country needs reform, from government, to the medical profession, to the insurance industry, etc....<br>
<br>
Unless and until you can provide specific examples of endemic problems withing the justice system, you are simply parroting the  RNC who continually attack attorneys because of the support the trial lawyers have for the Democratic party.  And, by the way, you need to make a distinction between "plaintiff contingency trial lawyers" and the legal profession in general.  Two different beasts entirely. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

Just because you are a good one does not mean all are good, just like the fact that there are bad ones does not mean all are bad.<br>
<br>
What I was saying is you must LOOK for the good to find it.  It won't be dropped in your lap as a front-page headline.  It probably won't even make the news or the papers at all.  It is out there.  And it's probably a whole heck of a lot more prevalent than most people probably think.  But it's not trumpeted out on the 5 o'clock news.<br>
<br>
This is true about many many other things as well, but I don't feel like getting into that right now.<br>

My point is that you really do not have to look so hard to find a decent, reputable and ethical attorney.  Our society is a media driven society.  Human nature is such that we crave the provocative news stories, not the benign news accounts.  By definition, the only news accounts you will generally view/read are those that are aberrational.  You simply cannot judge a profession or any segement in society based upon media coverage as it is slanted to bring the sensational stories to the readers/viewers.  All I am suggesting is that unless and until you immerse yourself in studying an entire field or profession, the perspective you get from the media is artificially false.  By the way, I am not attributing any evil intent to the media--they cater to their audience.  But we as a society look for the sexy and controversial stories.  No one wants to hear about the every day Joe or Jane that goes to work every day, does their job and goes home to their families.   <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

<br>
The media blasted outrage over a confessed murderer who had his conviction overturned &quot;due to a technicality&quot; -- he didn't have his constitutional rights honored by the police who had him in custody.  Of course, you would have had to spend a lot of time and effort to learn that the murderer wasn't really set free, he was retried again -- and he was convicted again.<br>
<br>
Much outrage was again spewed through the media when some stupid woman recovered BIG BUCKS from McDonalds when she purchased hot coffee in the drive-thru and spilled it in her lap.  Of course, no one bothered to report that McDonald's happened to serve their coffee at a temperature much higher than the industry, OR that the coffee was so hot that the &quot;stupid woman&quot; had to have skin grafts to repair the burns, OR that this &quot;stupid woman&quot; was not -- by a long shot -- the first person to have been seriously burned from spilling McDonald's coffee.  Also, the stupid woman merely wanted some help with her medical bills, but McDonald's was so outrageously assholish that a jury was ultimately offended.<br>
<br>
Often large damage awards are prompted by a jury wanting to punish bad behavior.  Recall, if you will, how ludicrous the damage awards seemed (at the time) in the Ford Pinto cases.  In the recent tobacco cases, I believe juries have been reacting to evidence that tobacco companies intentionally manipulated the nicotine content of their products to ensure that people who tried tobacco products would get addicted to them.  The issue stops being about the smoker's ability to quit and starts being about the tobacco company's bad behavior (in knowingly striving to addict people while simultaneously testifying that smoking is not addictive).  The tobacco cases increasingly remind me of the asbestos litigation.<br>
<br>
It's so easy to be shocked and outraged by high damage awards and ridiculous judicial decisions; after all, it is the job of our media to grab your attention by appealing to your emotions.  But, if the rights afforded by our judicial system and laws do not apply in the hard cases (for example, when a criminal &quot;walks&quot; due to a &quot;technicality&quot;)  then they won't apply in the easy cases -- when YOU are unjustly accused.  <br>

My sources of frustration come from several sources:<br>
<br>
* The fact that these stupid lawsuits even make it through the courts or that a jury, supposedly of my 'peers', feels a need to punish. <br>
* The fact that in civil cases, lawyers are encouraged (through their percentage 'fees') to seek and drive for outrageous sums of money from a jury instead of asking the jury to be realistic<br>
* The fact that it cost me thousands of dollars in legal fees to cooperate with law enforcement investigations to ensure that I was covering my butt and they were acting legally.  I was neither plaintiff nor defendant.<br>
<br>
Lawyers get the money from all sides; they're encouraged to drive up their fees.  The _person_ behind the lawyer may not be bad, but their firm pushes them.<br>
<br>
There are some good lawyers who believe in their causes.  Until the system is reconfigured such that they don't receive significant amounts of money regardless of outcome, we're going to continue to see stupid lawsuits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uphebos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phebos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/01 2:17:24 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits...  where the system fails.</span><hr size=1> We can only hope for a time when the lawyers realize that their richest source of income is each other, and will sue themselves into a legal frenzy, billing themselves outrageous sums of money for time spent on the case.<br>
  Our present legal system has some serious flaws with it. My friend recently was called for jury duty.  He was a juror in a sexual harrasment case.  He clearly felt that the womans was wrong in claiming sexual harassment, especially given that she intitiated much of the alleged harassment (something along the lines of: I can make any man orgasm in under 6 minutes(I laughed at this point, commenting that that isn't that much of an accomplishment)).  But since the other jurors felt bad for her, he went along with them and they recommended an award of $60,000 to her.  All because he didn't want to argue the point and delay the trial, or to result in a hung jury.  Also look at the fact that the people on juries are usually the people that couldn't find a good enough excuse not to serve on them. (Though if I get called I actually would go, it is my duty, tedious though it may be)<br>
  Part of the problem with many of these cases in which highly technical(or not so technical) terms are used, is the fact that many jurors do not even begin to comprehend what these facts mean.  OK the coffee is brewed very hot, but what temperature is it when it reached her?  The hotter the coffee the faster it cools. ( Now I am not saying the the coffee was not in fact too hot, but if it was as hot as they claimed she should not have been able to drinkt he coffee much less hold the cup (which may be what caused her to spill the coffee, assuming that it was too hot)).<br>

 Also why does no-one sue the makers of Tab cola?  have you ever read the warning on that stuff? Cigarette labels say that it *may* cause cancer, Tab states that its ingredients *cause* cancer in lab animals.<br>
 I firmly believe that the right to bear arms was put in place intentionally, I believe that it was intended for the populace to overthrow the goverment if and when it has to.  the founding fathers realized that goverment is not perfect, and greedy and corrupt individuals could and probably would try to subvert the rights of others if they got the chance.  Our entire goverment system is designed to balance itself, putting in a check from anyone group from getting to powerful, it was also set to be very limited, mostly (IMHO) to protect us from other countries, not from ourselves.<br>

<br>
Your friend is at fault.<br>
<br>
Our system is based upon the fact that 12 people must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt _unanimously_.<br>
<br>
Your friend's capitulation even in the face of his belief (just to get out of there faster and push it through) is exactly the kind of thing that erodes the system.  It's why we have hung juries and not just 66% or simple majority rulesets behind juries.<br>
<br>
If I were on trial and just ONE of my 'peers' believed that I was innocent, I'd want him to work it out until he was convinced.  If he had the slightest bit of doubt, I want him to fight for it, not simply say &quot;well, I can get to the Lakers game tonight if I just say 'guilty'&quot;.  If it means a hung jury or re-trial, so be it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bbloodtide14744.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cinadanbeetlesmack>Cinadan Beetlesmack</A> at: 6/13/01 2:24:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uspioctor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spioctor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/13/01 4:03:03 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.donorlaw.com/spio4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits...  where the system fails.</span><hr size=1> We finally agree Cinadan.  With all due respect to your friend, he alone was at fault--not the attorneys nor the judicial system.  Also regardless of what the jury concludes, the Judge could set aside the Judgment if there was no factual basis for it.  I suspect for the case to make it through the entire trial to verdict, there was some evidence to indicate that the harassment was non-consensual. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

If you feel you were harassed you are considered to have been harassed by the law, and it is very difficult to prove otherwise, how do you prove that someone didn't change their mind, or that they didn't really want to be asked out, even though they gave many generally socially acceptable signals that they would in fact like to be asked out.

A conversation like the one you described would not be the basis of a sexual harassment lawsuit.  For an employer to be liable for a "hostile work environment" claim like that, the employer would have to have failed to take remedial action once notified about the incident.  In other words, the woman would have to go to her employer and tell them that the behavior of the "harasser" was unwelcomed.  The employer must investigate and take steps to prevent a future incident.  If they do not take the appropriate steps and the harassment continues, then a claim will lie.  Simply asking someone out 1 time and being rejected is not grounds for a claim by itself.<br>
<br>
As for evidence in these cases, there generally are witnesses, tangible evidence (cards, receipts, gifts, voicemail, etc...) and a documented history in a personnel file.<br>

  The cases probably wouldn't get very far, but if I can actually get a trial it would be possible for me to sway a jury if I am a good enough actor.<br>
  but anyway I am getting away from the point I was trying to make about the problem of haviong juries... regardless of whether my friends feelings about the case were true or not, the fact that he voted with everyone else is a very frightning prospect to me, especially if someone is accused of a crime that warrants an instant hate factor (child molestation, rape, racial predjudice) that if some of the people have a big enough grudge they can sway the others to convict, even if the person did not commit the crime. For example look at the people being released from death row after new DNA evidence proves they were not the person that commited the crime.  eyewitness testimony is about as credible as a confession beat out of someone.  <br>
<br>
 but I will elave that for lawyers to deal with, since I tend to not get accused of anything <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzincy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zincy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.watson.org/~tesla/zincy.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/01 2:03:43 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.watson.org/~tesla/eq/pics/Z.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits...  where the system fails.</span><hr size=1> &gt;EPA<br>
&gt;not necesarry, If someone is negligent and pollutes your land &gt;you have every right to sue them in court for damages done.<br>
<br>
<br>
What if they are polluting the air?  Or the water?  It can be very time-consuming to track down enough evidence to be able to sue them.  So we pay the EPA do it.  It's a full-time job for alot of people; and I don't want to spend all my time on it, personally.<br>
<br>
I agree with you to some extent on the speed limits.  However, I think the idea is that I _don't_ want to sue them after they crash into me, I want to keep them from crashing into me at all.  Sure suing them will discourage them in the future, but it doesn't do me any good if I'm dead.  So I hire the police to stop unsafe drivers and fine them.<br>

Most "exessive" jury verdicts get reduced, settled for less to avoid appeals, or overturned on appeal.  Also, the Judge has the discretion to set aside a verdict or even take it out of the jury's hands if as a matter of law, the Plaintiff has not met their evidentary burden.  So there are many safeguards in place to deal with the runaway jury or the panel that engages in jury nullification. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>
