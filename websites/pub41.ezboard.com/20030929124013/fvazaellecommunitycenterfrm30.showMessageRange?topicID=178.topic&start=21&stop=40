Example:  Flonase... you can probably guess what that does.  Or a bunch of kids running in a field sneezing with flowers and pollen floating in the air... you can probably figure out what that's an ad for too.<br>

It's essentially companies trying to get around the FDA.<br>

Personally, I think the FDA is a bunch of Nazis.  They do more harm than good by preventing people from getting medications they need and trying to suppress dissemination of knowledge because they think people are morons.<br>

Such uses are called &quot;off label&quot; uses.  For example, Neurontin is an analog and competitive inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which functions to control threshold potentials in neurons.  It's FDA approved for use as an anti-epileptic medication.  However, probably 95% or more of the prescriptions written for Neurontin are written for non epileptics.  It's used for everything from psychiatric conditions to depression to pain control (the latter actually being the most common).  These off label uses are completely legal, a doctor can prescribe any FDA approved medication for any reason (with a few restrictions being involved on controlled substances).<br>
<br>
If you notice, medications like Claritin, Allegra, and Vioxx are actually marketed for the conditions they are approved for (allergies and osteoarthritis).  Many drugs are marketed this way, but some are not.<br>
<br>
Also, there has been some loosening of restrictions over the last several years regarding exactly what you can and can't say.  Laws used to be more restrictive.<br>

<br>
I work for a 4 hospital system that, due to a change in the way medicare pays for services, went from being $6 mil in the black to $24 in the red.  When this was announced, it resulted in layoffs and slight downgrading of services to the communities we serve.<br>
<br>
Another hosptial in the same county, this one managed by the Sisters of Mercy, closed the doors on the Neo-Natal ICU, and the Crisis Center.  This same organization closed the doors on a hospital in a community which had a near 100% paying customer base a year ago.<br>
<br>
So..when people talk about changing to a socialized health care system, I start thinking about a new job.  Don't get me wrong, I love my job.  I love being able to help people and do my part to provide care and comfort to people.  I am not, however, willing to sacrifice my own life to do it.  Guarantee me that I won't have to take a pay cut, nor risk layoffs, nor see a downgrade in services or patient care, and I'll support Socialized Medicine.  I have as much of a right to maintain my standard of living as someone working in a non-health care field.  Maybe I'm sounding selfish, but I know I'm not alone in that thought process.<br>
<br>
I agree with the statement &quot;Keep what works, fix what is broken&quot;.  Use the Medicare money smarter, investigate a more cost-efficient way to use the available funds to provide more care.  Tear down medicare as we know it and restructure it into something that actually works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=janusshadowsong>JanusShadowsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/19/03 11:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Those Without Healthcare Obviously Don't Want It</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>there's plenty of healthcare available to anyone, some people just don't make it a priority in their lives to figure out how. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Hey that works!

<br>
1) Those who simply choose not to buy insurance: This includes a lot of young people who think they are invincible and can't get sick (like my sister).  Well, these people make their choice and have to live with the consequences.<br>
<br>
2) Children: I think they should all be covered.  I'm not sure exactly how to do it, but I would suggest providing some sort of vouchers so that they can afford to purchase insurance, ideally through group programs with their parents' employers, but if not, then privately.<br>
<br>
3) People who are too poor to afford it: Well, this group should be small.  The very poorest members of our society qualify for Medicaid.  It's possible that the income limit for Medicaid is too low, in which case it should be raised.  People above the income level where they cannot afford insurance fall into group 1).<br>
<br>
That's how I'd divide it up.  People in group 1 who could purchase insurance but don't, well, to hell with them.  It's their choice.  I think it's a bad choice, but who am I to tell them what to do.<br>
<br>
Maybe I've overlooked some group of people.  If that's the case, then please let me know which group I've overlooked.<br>

<br>
More and more we see especially in the US, every political decision eventually coming down to a discussion about money, and if the struggle to maximise profits is raised to a point where it is seen as the single, almost holy goal of all human activity, then it makes perfect sense to talk about a nation as if it were an enterprise.  Of course, every right-thinking person understands that a country, with its history, its culture, the great diversity of the people who live, work and play within its borders, is infinitely more than a profit-making corporation.  In reality, privatisation, which has become the de-facto creed throughout much of the world, is an ideologically inspired shift of property to the private market. Nothing is spared, with even basic services such as social security made into objects of profit. Privatisation is a process through which the state becomes increasingly powerless, able to exert ever less influence on the quantity and quality of essential services, abandoning its role as social driving force. This is not only bad government, in the long term it isn't even good business over all.<br>
<br>
The negative attitude of conservative politicians to the state's capabilities and their pleading for the introduction of the market system to ever more areas of policy - even those which have traditionally been the province of the state - is first and foremost short sighted. These politicians fail to appreciate that the state expanded in the first place precisely because people believed that there were many things which could be done better, more quickly and more cheaply if they were done together, rather than everyone fighting for their own interests. In addition, the state is able to take account of the long term and can, in the general interest, act out of an awareness of the broader context. To take a simple example, a person whose interest in the disposal of chemical waste is motivated by profit is more likely to be tempted to cut corners than one whose prime duty is to dispose of it in a socially responsible fashion. <br>
<br>
Once again, health care provides the best illustration of the folly and irresponsibility of believing that the market is invariably the best basis for the organisation of any system, whatever its purpose. In country after country, to one extent or another, under the guise of encouraging `personal responsibility', more and more aspects of our social organisation, which were until recently addressed collectively, are now given over to the individual. While many Americans come to Europe to see for themselves the socialised systems of health care which were constructed after the war, European governments are looking increasingly to the United States to see how these same systems might be dismantled.<br>
<br>
The problem to which conservative critics of collective health care provision invariably point is that, as a result of both the aging of the population and the introduction of new techniques, costs are rising. Yet is this necessarily a bad thing? Surely it would be bad only if the additional money were being thrown away or used inefficiently. If that is happening, then of course it must be dealt with; but that is not, in fact, what the conservatives are trying to do. Their goal is simply to reduce costs, whatever damage may be done to the system; and spending targets are increasingly fixed with no regard for either structural or temporary increases in needs. The British Labour Party even pledged to stay within Conservative spending targets for the National Health Service, before it had had the chance to study the relationship between needs and available resources. And despite the fact that the Tories themselves had declared that their figures were guidelines rather than unbreachable limits. The results of such attitudes, which are reproduced internationally, are clear. In the socialised or predominantly socialised health care systems of Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the UK, Canada, Australia and many other countries the same complaints are heard. Lengthening queues for vital operations, introduction of or increase in point-of-service charges; specialists forced to substitute inferior materials for those which their professional judgment tells them are more suitable; doctors, nurses and ancillary staff working dangerously long hours. Such `savings' have almost invariably to be paid for later: cheap artificial hips are in use which have to be replaced after five years instead of ten, expensive equipment is left idle in empty operating theatres while waiting lists grow and people suffer unnecessary pain and even death.<br>
<br>
Yet is there any evidence that such a move would make health care any cheaper? On the contrary, the evidence points so clearly to the opposite conclusion that the argument can be dismissed. The Americans spend 14% of their Gross Domestic Product on health care, the Netherlands 9%. Despite this, one in every four Americans is underinsured or even completely uninsured and thus cut off from the most basic provision. Many health insurance schemes are linked to people's jobs: become unemployed and you lose your rights. <br>
<br>
So how do Americans manage to spend so much money on such a wretched system? Firstly, because healthcare is not inadequate for everyone. The rich can afford enormous luxuries, a fact which is as true when they are ill as it is when they are well. Their hospitals are veritable five-star hotels in which patients are looked after in minute detail, their every whim pandered to. From face lifts to breast enlargement, to a range of treatments for which no medical need exists, nothing in the land of unlimited opportunities is too crazy, provided you can pay.<br>
<br>
Another factor is the enormous bureaucracy the system of private health care brings in its wake. Following an operation you can expect a bill from the surgeon, another for the hire of the operating theatre, another from the test laboratory, still more for food and nursing care, all of which you have to pay yourself before lodging a claim with your insurers. The insurance company will then query and negotiate each bill separately before it is persuaded that nothing is overpriced. The bureaucracy that all of this requires costs enormous amounts of money, money which is therefore unavailable to be spent on care. Disputes between insured and insurer are common, sometimes involving lengthy hearings, hearings that must also of course be paid for. Nor does it stop there. Because patients have to pay so much for medical services, they want quality. If it hasn't quite reached the point where people expect to demand eternal life, it requires only the slightest problem to send the patient scuttling towards the judge to demand compensation.  The number of actions against hospitals and doctors has grown by a factor of 300 over the last twenty years. The exorbitant sums which are sometimes paid out as compensation and damages to plaintiffs have led to a situation where all doctors are obliged to insure themselves against this risk. Premiums can amount to as much as $50,000 a year, a sum which is obviously passed on to the patient.  All of this results directly from the shunning of a general, collective system of health care in favour of one that is owned and controlled by commercial interests.<br>
<br>
Collective provision can only continue at a high standard if the whole society can be seen to benefit from it: take better-off people out of the equation and you will be left with an under-funded, unloved, stigmatised ghetto for those who can't afford to go anywhere else. This can be clearly seen in America, with its Medicare for the old and Medicaid for the poor (both of which are hopelessly inadequate forms of assistance) and its religious and charitable `public' hospitals.<br>
<br>
The most tragic aspect of this situation is its sheer irrationality. The American approach is both more expensive and socially divisive. Following logically from the idea that every individual is of equal worth, and given the fact that we are all vulnerable to illness and therefore that it clearly makes sense to share the risk, the inevitable conclusion is that what is needed is a collective arrangement. One in which (a) everyone can claim a right to necessary care which (b) is paid for by the state and for which (c) the state can demand a contribution from the citizen, in the form of taxation or social insurance premiums, concomitant with his or her ability to pay.<br>

Health care is, on the whole, a heck of a lot cheaper in Canada than it is in the US, largely because doctors simply can't command the exorbitant rates that they charge in the US. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1853<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/19/03 2:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those Without Healthcare Obviously Don't Want It</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>More and more we see especially in the US, every political decision eventually coming down to a discussion about money, and if the struggle to maximise profits is raised to a point where it is seen as the single, almost holy goal of all human activity, then it makes perfect sense to talk about a nation as if it were an enterprise.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's not that our goals are only to maximize profit.  The problem is that you cannot spend what you do not have, no matter how noble the goals.  We currently operate with a deficit of about $450 billion per year.  If we raise taxes any further, our economy will go to hell and revenues will probably decrease, leaving us even more unable to support those causes we consider important.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In reality, privatisation, which has become the de-facto creed throughout much of the world, is an ideologically inspired shift of property to the private market. Nothing is spared, with even basic services such as social security made into objects of profit. Privatisation is a process through which the state becomes increasingly powerless, able to exert ever less influence on the quantity and quality of essential services, abandoning its role as social driving force. This is not only bad government, in the long term it isn't even good business over all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not about profit.  It's about getting the greatest services for the same amount of money.  When there is no competition, there is no efficiency.  Our government, and yours too if you take the time to look at it, is riddled with stories of 500 dollar hammers and 5000 dollar toilet seats.  The government has no incentive to save money, so they don't.  That means that dollars that could be used for important programs, deficit reduction, or tax cuts instead line the pockets of people that are ripping off the government.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The negative attitude of conservative politicians to the state's capabilities and their pleading for the introduction of the market system to ever more areas of policy - even those which have traditionally been the province of the state - is first and foremost short sighted. These politicians fail to appreciate that the state expanded in the first place precisely because people believed that there were many things which could be done better, more quickly and more cheaply if they were done together, rather than everyone fighting for their own interests. In addition, the state is able to take account of the long term and can, in the general interest, act out of an awareness of the broader context. To take a simple example, a person whose interest in the disposal of chemical waste is motivated by profit is more likely to be tempted to cut corners than one whose prime duty is to dispose of it in a socially responsible fashion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The use of the state to run programs is a massive failed experiment.  It was called communism, and caused more human suffering than any other philosophy in the history of mankind.  We have learned through trial and error that states cannot efficiently run programs because without competition, people simply are not motivated to do a good job.  Now there are a few programs that have to be run by governments, for example national defense.  In these cases, we choose to sacrifice efficiency for security, but we do lose efficiency in the process.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Once again, health care provides the best illustration of the folly and irresponsibility of believing that the market is invariably the best basis for the organisation of any system, whatever its purpose. In country after country, to one extent or another, under the guise of encouraging `personal responsibility', more and more aspects of our social organisation, which were until recently addressed collectively, are now given over to the individual. While many Americans come to Europe to see for themselves the socialised systems of health care which were constructed after the war, European governments are looking increasingly to the United States to see how these same systems might be dismantled.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Americans, overwhelmingly, do not want socialized medicine or really socialized anything.  Europeans are realizing that America is a superpower because of our tendancy towards privatization, and they want a piece of it.  We are seeing a global trend towards privatization because it is proven that it works.  It creates economic prosperity, efficiency, and provides superior quality of service for less money.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The problem to which conservative critics of collective health care provision invariably point is that, as a result of both the aging of the population and the introduction of new techniques, costs are rising.

<br>
It's not a bad thing that people are living longer, but the fact that it will cost us more is a very real problem that we must deal with.  One cannot simply ignore it and hope it will go away.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Surely it would be bad only if the additional money were being thrown away or used inefficiently.

<br>
In the United States, we routinely go well beyond what we can afford.  Just look at our deficit, it's now $450 billion dollars, larger than our entire military budget.  That means our military and quite a bit beyond it is paid for every single year on borrowed money.  We have to attempt to control spending, or the nation will collapse.  You cannot simply spend arbitrary amounts of money that you do not have.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The results of such attitudes, which are reproduced internationally, are clear. In the socialised or predominantly socialised health care systems of Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the UK, Canada, Australia and many other countries the same complaints are heard. Lengthening queues for vital operations, introduction of or increase in point-of-service charges; specialists forced to substitute inferior materials for those which their professional judgment tells them are more suitable; doctors, nurses and ancillary staff working dangerously long hours. Such `savings' have almost invariably to be paid for later: cheap artificial hips are in use which have to be replaced after five years instead of ten, expensive equipment is left idle in empty operating theatres while waiting lists grow and people suffer unnecessary pain and even death.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a problem, but not for the reasons  you are stating.  The reason that these problems exist, and that there is so much human pain and suffering, is because socialization of medicine removes competition and creates such massive inefficiencies that care simply cannot be provided.  We don't have these problems in the United States simply because we have privatized the system.  If you privatize your medical systems, you won't have these problems, and much unneeded human suffering can be avoided.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet is there any evidence that such a move would make health care any cheaper? On the contrary, the evidence points so clearly to the opposite conclusion that the argument can be dismissed. The Americans spend 14% of their Gross Domestic Product on health care, the Netherlands 9%. Despite this, one in every four Americans is underinsured or even completely uninsured and thus cut off from the most basic provision. Many health insurance schemes are linked to people's jobs: become unemployed and you lose your rights.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In all cases, the unemployed can carry their coverage for 18 months after leaving their job.  They can transition to a private policy during that time and not have to deal with a preexisting condition exclusion.  This is more than enough time to join a new plan.  We spend more on health care because our health care programs are so vastly superior to those of Europe it's not even funny.  Every other day you see a foreign head of state travelling to the United States for medical care because he knows he'll get the best quality of care here.  The quality of care in Europe and around the world is vasty improved because of the money the United States spends on research.  That knowledge is essentially disseminated for free, and the vast majority of biomedical research comes out of universities in the United States.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So how do Americans manage to spend so much money on such a wretched system? Firstly, because healthcare is not inadequate for everyone. The rich can afford enormous luxuries, a fact which is as true when they are ill as it is when they are well. Their hospitals are veritable five-star hotels in which patients are looked after in minute detail, their every whim pandered to. From face lifts to breast enlargement, to a range of treatments for which no medical need exists, nothing in the land of unlimited opportunities is too crazy, provided you can pay.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, first of all, I have no problem with elective procedures (breast enlargement, face lifts, etc) not being covered.  These are not needed services, and people should pay for them themselves if they want them.  These are rarely, if ever, covered by American insurance plans.  The truth is that the rich do not get substantially better coverage than everyone else.  America is really divided into two categories, the insured and uninsured.  All of the insured receive care that is dramatically better than anything else in the world, those that are uninsured receive care that is lacking.  Thus, the way to fix the system is to bring up the quality of care of those who are uninsured to at least the level of the rest of the world, and leave the quality of the insured where it is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Another factor is the enormous bureaucracy the system of private health care brings in its wake. Following an operation you can expect a bill from the surgeon, another for the hire of the operating theatre, another from the test laboratory, still more for food and nursing care, all of which you have to pay yourself before lodging a claim with your insurers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not true, most bills are paid directly by the insurance company to the care provider.  You then receive a bill for the deductible that you owe, if anything.  Large bills need not be paid and later reimbursed.  The inefficiencies of the bureaucracy of private healthcare pale in comparison to the inefficiencies of a government run program.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Disputes between insured and insurer are common, sometimes involving lengthy hearings, hearings that must also of course be paid for. Nor does it stop there. Because patients have to pay so much for medical services, they want quality. If it hasn't quite reached the point where people expect to demand eternal life, it requires only the slightest problem to send the patient scuttling towards the judge to demand compensation. The number of actions against hospitals and doctors has grown by a factor of 300 over the last twenty years. The exorbitant sums which are sometimes paid out as compensation and damages to plaintiffs have led to a situation where all doctors are obliged to insure themselves against this risk. Premiums can amount to as much as $50,000 a year, a sum which is obviously passed on to the patient. All of this results directly from the shunning of a general, collective system of health care in favour of one that is owned and controlled by commercial interests.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The tendancy to sue is more of a general problem in America than one related to our health care system.  It pervades every aspect of American society.  There are problems with it, but moving to socialized medicine would make the problem worse.  Longer hours and lower pay for professionals would mean more malpractice, and more lawsuits, not less.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Collective provision can only continue at a high standard if the whole society can be seen to benefit from it: take better-off people out of the equation and you will be left with an under-funded, unloved, stigmatised ghetto for those who can't afford to go anywhere else. This can be clearly seen in America, with its Medicare for the old and Medicaid for the poor (both of which are hopelessly inadequate forms of assistance) and its religious and charitable `public' hospitals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
People on both Medicare and Medicaid receive better care in the United States than people do in foreign socialized medicine programs.  There is no rationing of care in either program, as is common in most socialized medical programs around the world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The most tragic aspect of this situation is its sheer irrationality. The American approach is both more expensive and socially divisive. Following logically from the idea that every individual is of equal worth, and given the fact that we are all vulnerable to illness and therefore that it clearly makes sense to share the risk, the inevitable conclusion is that what is needed is a collective arrangement. One in which (a) everyone can claim a right to necessary care which (b) is paid for by the state and for which (c) the state can demand a contribution from the citizen, in the form of taxation or social insurance premiums, concomitant with his or her ability to pay.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There are lots of problems with this.  First of all, I don't believe health care is a right.  In short, I think that nothing you would not have in the absence of society is a right.  I do think it's desirable to provide care to all people, but not necessarily at the same level.  I would like to exceed the standards of socialized care that exist in Europe and Canada for all of our citizens, which we could do with a few minor tweaks to the system.  The standard of care in Europe is abysmal and would decline dramatically in the absence of American research.  Secondly, I think an individual should be able to refuse health care and take a chance, and keep his money in the process.  I respect the right of an individual to make that choice for himself.  Many of the uninsured in America are making just that choice, and the vast majority who do it benefit from it.<br>
<br>
Americans are very aware of what socialized medicine offers, and we want no part of it.  We don't want the inefficiencies, and we don't want to lower the quality of medical care for the vast majority to raise the quality for a small number of people.  Most Americans think that our system is imperfect and needs work, and I agree with this, but the solution is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  We have the best system in the world as it is, we don't want to downgrade, we want to keep what works, and fix what is broken.<br>

The government with those stories of $500 hammers and $2k toilet seats are generated from budgets.  A government agency gets a budget to do what they need for the year.  At the end of that year, they are evaluated.  If they don't use thier budget...the monies will be reduced.  So what do they do?  Overspend in the last quarter so their budget won't be reduced.  In the government jobs i've had (incuding the military), this practice is not hidden.<br>
<br>
I for one don't think a corporation would run very well with this policy.  Our government is too large and bulky to manage our health system.   I also do not think that Joe Layer_0234343234 should have a say in medicine of which he knows nothing about.<br>
<br>
For once I agree with Ammelen ENTIRELY, 100%.  If you can't afford health care, you need to learn to budget.  And it's not like it's a death sentence if you don't....just can't get that knee replaced or for some odd reason get anti-biotics for your cold (/BOGGLE!!!).<br>

Also you have somewhat of a crisis in terms of the labor market for healthcare providers in that working conditions are being reported at the same level as wages as determining desirability of the field. IE, the nurse you pay 40$ an hour and wonder why you don't have a flood of resumes for when he\she quits, is more interested in patient ratio and the respect they get from coworkers than sheer pay as indicated by wage level. OF COURSE, there is also the issue that many patients will begin to complain of when foreign health care providers are imported to the US en masse and their ideas of what &quot;good care&quot; constitutes conflicts with patient expectations based on local culture.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=626910" target="top">Chopstiks Kungfoey</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1864<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/19/03 8:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those Without Healthcare Obviously Don't Want It</span><hr size=1> Doctor and nurse pay is at historical lows right now (relative to other highly trained professionals).<br>

General practitioners where I live are now making under 100k/yr.

Now they owe 120k, and they can't even start working until they are 27 or so.  Then they make about 30k/yr for the first 3-4 years working 3 40 hour shifts per week and being treated like crap.

On top of it, 22 year old investment bankers with BA's who just graduated from school are making 150k+.  We cannot continue to abuse doctors like this and expect them to perform at the level we expect.  They need to be better compensated so we can attract the very best.

I'm sure it is often more efficient to let a person die rather than provide them care.  There are some things in society that should not be left to the mercy of the free market.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=178.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=178.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=178.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=178.topic&start=81&stop=98>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showPrevMessage?topicID=178.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showNextMessage?topicID=178.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.threadControl?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm28">Technical Support<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm27">Artistic Endeavors<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm30">The Real World<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30>The Real World</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
