Both of you disappear for a long period of time and conviently post right after each other in the same time periods.  You're both obviously smart and twist things well.  Zozz's net persona as a &quot;really nice guy&quot; is clearly extremely important to him, so he uses genobi to say the crap that he wants without hurting his image - and I for one know that zozz is not a &quot;really nice guy&quot;.  There's a lot of anonymous surfing sites like surfola that can protect you from IP traces - seeing the recent posts/climate towards anons on this board you are risking a lot to post now.  Basically if you are using an anonymous IP forwarder to post, genobi, then I think you are zozz for sure - its the only person that makes sense; there's a couple other regular posters it could possibly be, but the more I think about it there's really only one choice.  If you are not using one then there's 2 choices: 1) someone who was in PO/CC, but never or rarely posted here under their character's name, or, most likely you are just a nobody - someone who plays or played on vaz for a while, never got to a very high level or in a guild that accomplished anything.  Not like I give a rat's ass anyways, but gotta entertain yourself at work somehow.<br>

<br>
Outside of your superficial observations I don't really see where you draw the conclusion from, but I certainly haven't been doing anything to dissuade you from that idea. <br>
<br>
Vehnn thinks I am not a nice guy.  Well...  ouch, man.  Can't say I ever cared much for you either.  Although, I have come to respect you more lately. <br>
<br>
Too bad that you equate &quot;really nice guy&quot; with someone who is afraid to flame other people using their real name.  Attacking people directly using profanity isn't my style.  Not with Zozz or any other online account or in real life for that matter.  This is probably hard for your mentality (more effective flame = more effective usage of homosexual references) to handle.  I have never been afraid to post what I think of people in the Vazaelle community as Zozz.  Not the board admins, not my ex-guildies, not even people who flame me, usually.  The fact that I don't usually flame anyone isn't because I am in love with a nice guy image, it's because there usually isn't much to flame about.  Although it is a nice diversion from time to time, it isn't all that productive.<br>
<br>
Hate to disappoint you and all the other hopefuls out there, but genobi is actually someone other than me (unless of course, I suffer from split personality disorder and should be committed).<br>
<br>
Of course, there's no reason to take my word for it. <br>
I kind of like the whole idea of a conspiracy theory growing up around me.  It appeals to my megalomaniacal personality.<br>

That was my thoughts though and it makes sense on many levels.  Zozz my impression of you is that you care very deeply about what others think about you, and you do your best to portray a persona that is not based on your actual personality.  I mostly think this because you were an unmitigated prick to me in our first &quot;contacts&quot;.  I'm not saying &quot;you're a bad person because you don't flame people&quot;.  I'm basically saying you are deceptive - which fits in with the genobi thing.  More than one person has agreed with me on this privately as well.  You &quot;don't care for me&quot; because I'm the antithesis of your online persona.  I could be wrong, hell I probably am - whatever, but I think you're more like me than you like to admit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubiship.showPublicProfile?language=EN>biship</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 635<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/25/02 2:36:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zozz you charlatan!!!</span><hr size=1> Whoa Vehn came back with the classic<br>

I actually don't put much effort into portraying someone who I am not.  I think that would take far too much effort on my part and I don't have the patience for it.  <br>
<br>
What you get here on the message board from me is essentially me.  I prefer to be liked by people rather than disliked, but if it turns out that there is some gulf of incompatibility between me and someone else, I don't see any problem with expressing that.  Of course, it might be that I am just  so good at deception that I have somehow fooled myself into thinking that I actually try to be nice to most people.<br>
<br>
I have interacted with many people on this server.  Most of those people realize that I speak my mind and do what I feel is the right thing.  I try not to compromise my idea of the way I think things should be just for convenience.  I also give people the benefit of the doubt (in most cases, although I am not perfect in being unbiased). Those things contributed to the fact that I was a level 60 guildless enchanter with all of my gear stripped by someone I thought was a friend.  <br>
<br>
As far as our first meeting, I don't remember it.  I don't regret being a prick (if I was) because you have borne out the rationale as time went on even if it hadn't been crystallized at that point.  I am not saying that we are not cast from a similar mold in real life, Vehnn.  People have told me that I should cut you some slack because you were actually a pretty cool guy to get to know.  But if that's the case, then you are the deceptive one here, playing asshole of the VCC.  <br>
