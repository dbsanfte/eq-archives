(grats run on sentence)  But down the road the basic human traits of corruption/stupidity/fanatacism end up spoiling a good thing.  I personally lean toward the teachings of Buddhism, I don't really consider it a religion, more of a way of thinking and perceiving life and yourself.  You don't see Buddhists going around trying to shove their beliefs down others throats, be it by burning an abortion clinic, flying planes into buildings, or knocking on your door early Saturday morning while you sleep off that hangover.  They believe that every single living person on the face of the Earth has the ability to acheive Enlightenment by following it's teachings.  There are no &quot;miracles&quot; involved, no walking on water, no miraculous Ark in which somehow every species on teh planet was loaded up and successfully kept alive for forty days and forty nights until the flood waters receded and then miraculously repopulated the Earth with a single pair of each species /boggle.  I believe it is a lot more relevant to modern times than these ancient religions that believe explicitly the mythological crap that was written 2 thousand years ago when man thougt the world was flat and the Earth was the center of the universe.

<br>
I would like to elaborate on two of your points.<br>
<br>
First:  Miracles<br>
<br>
Actually, what contemporary people call 'miracles' appear quite frequently in Buddhist traditions.  My former kickboxing trainer is actually a Taoist priest and spent a great deal of time in Southeast Asia.  He has seen levitation, telekinesis, laying on of hands, and other acts which are simply manipulations of chi.  Western science is very quick to dismiss this as hooplah because it can't be quantifiably measured.<br>
<br>
This is an exercise in imagination:<br>
1) Pretend that CHI, or some other power like it exists. (the force even)<br>
2) Pretend this force is in everything and makes up everything.<br>
3) Now, pretend that this force can be manipulated, just as modern physics allows us to manipulate the laws of physics.  Who would have thought a 100 ton piece of steel could fly through the sky?  <br>
4) Pretend that this invisible force can be manipulated by educated &quot;chi-scientists&quot; who understand the nature of this force, just like regular scientists understand the nature of atoms, quarks, and particles.<br>
5) Now, pretend that given enough knowledge and practice at it, these &quot;chi-scientists&quot; can manipulate the force and create effects which we would call miracles.<br>
6) Pretend that by chanting in a particular tone with repition, and the proper bodily and environmental conditions, this force stuff could be channeled into something, such as creating a ray of blue light, curing the sick, or causing something to levitate.<br>
<br>
This exercise in imagination is to provoke the idea that the possibilty of 'miracles' is REAL, and that modern science COULD explain them, given enough time, and a proper mindset.<br>
I firmly believe that the universe is ordered by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> GOD</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and his physics, and that humans are well on our way to understanding these physics, as evidenced by modern technology.  God himself performs miracles by manipulation of these physics, albeit on a level we can't quite understand.  In this sense, the universe is JUST LIKE a big software program, following a set of coded rules.<br>
<br>
My second point: On The Ark<br>
<br>
Myths are a set of stories that communicate ideals and traditions of a society.  They are not to be taken literally, although they may contain elements of truth.  The myth about the ark, the myth about Abraham sacrificing Isaac, the myth about the tower of Babel, these are all stories with a COMMUNICATION value.  They tell about a society's values.  <br>
<br>
The Catholic Church has never had a problem not taking Bible Stories literally.  Being very well educated, yet deeply pious and devoted to God at once, they recognize these Myths to teach us HOW we are supposed to live our lives and why.  <br>
<br>
In 1996, the Pope declared that evolution possesses enough scientific evidence that it demands our attention, and is worthy or study and consideration.  He did not say we should accept it or deny it, merely consider it as possible truth.  Catholicism is not the archaic stupid institution that American youth love to make it out to be.  People really ought to learn more about it before they flame it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwyndigomoonhowler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyndigo Moonhowler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 6:01:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bleh</span><hr size=1> Ayiar, it's ok for people to discuss religion if they can handle it and not start flaming or threatening each other.

<br>
Want a universal truth about theories:  The theory which is the simplest, all other things being equal, will yield the most explanatory power. <br>
<br>
The same might be true about religions. So much diversity exist in the practice of religion. Diversity that ends in simplicity, I believe, is of the most service to people. It enables them to explain more about their lives and how reference and perspective can be gained before death. <br>
<br>
On the flipside, religion which seeks to cover souls with a shroud of guilt and which are not enabling theologies, often have elaborate and extremely complex &quot;teachings&quot; which obfuscate basic truths and therein lies their basic weakness:  Their complexity. <br>
<br>
A lifetime can be consumed in the minute study of individual religions. I have always tried to step away from the specific in the case of religions and examine the general topic of &quot;religion&quot; from a holistic perspective. Ask what functions religions perform and then see which religion has theoretic constructs that are simple and elegant in their form. <br>
<br>
It's like judging a house from the outside when you accept as a given that the simplest designs yield the most shelter and comfort for the occupants. 8-)<br>

You might find this interesting as well:<br>
<br>
The Catholic Church is based on 2 perogatives<br>
<br>
1) Pastoral Ministry - that is, taking care of its members and attending to their needs, both physical and spiritual<br>
<br>
2)  Maintaining its authority- in order to continue to exist and carry out function no.1<br>
<br>
So, the Catholic Church, in all of its &quot;obfuscating&quot; theories and teaching, (I would have to agree with you, I think), is caught in a paradox.  Will it cease to give sacraments and pastoral care and comfort to the woman who violates Catholic policy and takes birth-control?  No, probably not.  It will continue to administer to her needs and love her just the same, even at risk to its own authority.  <br>
<br>
Despite this paradox and dilemma, it continues to be the largest and most powerful religious organization in the world, providing comfort and meaning for millions.  <br>
<br>
My point is, even the most complicated and seemingly EXCLUSIVE organizations can be the most successful, even if their theology confuses the hell out of you.  <br>
<br>
Wyndigo<br>
<br>
PS- If you disagree with me about organized religion giving meaning and comfort to people's lives, or criticize them as weak and unenlightened, please, inform me what makes you so special?  What gives you comfort and meaningful existence?  And PLEASE, don't give me any of that existential bullshit that you get from listening to too much TooL.  <br>
<br>
PPS-  I love TooL, but you have to admit, they aren't very educated when they rant about religion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 6:28:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bleh</span><hr size=1> Wyndigo, I completely agree with you concerning Chi and the possibility of such an energy and people that can control/use it effectively.

<br>
1) What you observed about Catholicism is true. No question about it, however I would add a #3 and specify that guilt is a extremely formidable tenet of Catholicism and it gives rise to a need for Catholics to assume an affirmative stance vis-a-vis people classified as heathens because of their ignorance of guilt as created and laid upon the soul by St. Augustine's conceptualization of man born into the world with an &quot;original sin&quot; imprinted upon him. Of course Catholics are absolutely not alone in their convinction that they have a moral duty to prosalytize(sp?) others who are ignorant of the implication of the idea of &quot;original sin.&quot; <br>
<br>
2) I neither approve or disapprove of individual religions. <br>
<br>
3) In connection to #2, I do however, enjoy examining religions from a rigid epistemological viewpoint and hence my comments on how theoretical constructs themselves are important. <br>
<br>
I can give you some good references on books to read if you want more insight into #3. It's been 12 years since grad school for me but I think could stratch them up fairly quickly. <br>

1) Religion - living for your diety<br>
2) Procreation - living to preserve the species<br>
3) Selfishness - living for yourself and your own desires<br>

Religion is too often influenced by finaticism and used as a means to control people.  That's human nature I guess, wanting everyone to behave to your standards for the better of the community.  But sometimes people just need to back the fuck up and stay the fuck out of your business.  Its ok to talk to God, but if he starts talking back, I think you should see a psychiatrist, not start writing about what he's saying and trying to push it on people through force.  That's where civiliziation fucked up with religion imo. <p>-Brack<BR>MOFIA4LIFE</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urueanger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rueanger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 7:09:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~tpaull3/rue_sig.jpg WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=138></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bleh</span><hr size=1> That was the most intelligent thread i've read yet(imo)<br>

Some find faith in logical science, but that is flawed too whereas infinity exists between every number and peice of a number there is. and some continue to argue that science is absolute law even though it is based on a flawed principle and theory.<br>
i find my faith in god or the beuaty and incomprehensiveness of nature, where can a universe based upon principles of entropy produce a butterfly or my son. Noone knows the answers, we must find our own within ourselves.<br>
