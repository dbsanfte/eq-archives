Keep in mind that the English, Spanish, and French had been usurping folks out of their countries for centuries, and if you remember your high school history class, the French even owned a massive swath of the US at one point too.  Conquering happens, espically in that time period, and the people at that time had a completely different value system, and that was perfectly acceptable to them.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, let's crank back a bit in the topic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If we killed/destroyed all that equipment and personnel, hell, half of it... hell one fourth of it during the very short campaign with 123 casualties, then it was a FUCKING SLAUGHTER.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Why yes, yes it was.  There's a story in a recent magazine, I think it was Time, where a story was told about an incident during an advance to Iraq where two Bradley's setup an advance checkpoint on a highway.  A large group of Iraqi regulars in pickups decided to attack the unit, and basically charged down the highway at the Bradleys.  Of course, this was mid-day, in clear skies, in the open.  Guess what happened?  The Bradleys blew up something like 3 dozen pickups and killed well over 100 men.  The pickups never even got close, they were essentially slaughtered.  <br>
<br>
The US spends more on defense than the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>rest of the world COMBINED</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  One naval carrier group has more military might than the entire military capability of every non-nuclear country on the planet - and we have 7 carrier groups.  If we decide to attack a country in an all out offense, the question isn't will we win the war, it's how many days will it be before it's over.<br>
<br>
So, yes, us invading Iraq was tantamount to a hot knife through butter, but don't discount the fight - had it not been for our advanced technology and equipment, we would have lost many, many more people than we did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't you get it?<br>
<br>
One fourth of their standing army is 80,000 dead to 123 dead US personnel, slightly more if you count reporters, MUCH less if you discount friendly fire.<br>
<br>
Yeah, Iraq was a threat and needed to be invaded immediately. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->At the risk of this being seen as a 'cheap shot' on my part, it would be fair to point out that it only took 18 people to bring down the WTC towers and kill over 2,800 civilians.  They were equipped with nothing more advanced than box cutters, but still caused grevious damage to our country.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not trying to equate the events of 9-11 to Iraq, but the key problem with Iraq was 2 things:<br>
<br>
1)  They developed, manafactured, and stored NBC weapons<br>
2)  They supported and had relationships with terrorist groups<br>
<br>
We already knew Saddam was psychologically imbalenced, that he had no qualms about invading or attacking neighboring countries, was a vrutal dictator that cared very little for human life, and that he had deployed and used chemical weapons against his own people.<br>
<br>
Combine all of that together, and you have a mix of ingrediants that set the stage for a potential attack on the US that could results in massive, unfathomable loss of life.  Using history as a guide, we decided to take out this psychopath of a dictator in an attempt to avert a larger disaster with a pre-emptive attack.  <br>
<br>
You are correct though, the Iraqi army did not post a direct threat to the US, I'm sure getting their tanks and troops to the East Coast would have been just a wee bit of a technical complication for Saddam.  It's the indirect threat that was the problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=herdervazaelle>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2131<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/17/03 11:17:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Anika</span><hr size=1> Anika, attacking Iraq and occupying it is going to create more indirect threats and a utopic outcome to the handling would mean, possibly, slightly less indirect threats.  <br>

If G. Bush turns Iraq into a paradise for the Iraqis, a long term result could be a lessening in Terrorism. Long term as in years.

<br>
You're right, I'm sure they are indeed plenty of people that are pissed off at the US, and that's never really gonna change.  What we have done though is demonstrate that we aren't afraid to go in and lay the hurt on someone that threatens us, and for the moment, that seems to have given pause to many countries.<br>
<br>
Ironically, our good information minister friend actually helped us - by lying about the defense of Iraq and the advance of US and British forces, he sort of provided the 'shock and awe' to much of the arab world which was actually buying into his story up until the end.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If G. Bush turns Iraq into a paradise for the Iraqis, a long term result could be a lessening in Terrorism.

They are a lot of other dictators and monarchies in the arab world, but they aren't stupid enough to raise the ire of the rest of the world.  Still, a functional democracy, assuming it's successful, could cause an Iraqi/Arab rift much like the Tiawan/China one.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the odds of establishing a stable democracy in Iraq are somewhere between slim and none, so it's likely a moot point anyway.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Our borders remain porous, we're trying to cut vet's benefits, Osama Bin Laden remains on the loose, the US has busted our credit limit (yea, read about it, we just upped it though, to be paid for later, by us no doubt), guerrillas still operating in Afghanistan and opium production peaking there, Venezuela accusing the US of a coup attempt, protests around the world, horrible Public Relations war, funding for state and local terrorist response units not available, gaping holes in our airline screening system, corruption in our corporate sector......<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Not disagreeing with any of that.  We break our bugetary 'credit limit' all the time though, did it like 4 times during Clinton's term, so it's not like it's anything new.  Sure would be nice to pay off the national debt, but there's no way to get any politician to do anything that won't have a positive return before their re-election comes up.  Short term heartache for long-term benefits looks crappy on campaign TV ads.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, the freedom we enjoy in the US makes it impossible to really protect ourselves from terrorrism.  The only way to do that is to wall off the boarders and institute a totaliarn police state, but hell, that would just cause a massive rebellion and an overthrow of the government.  It's a catch-22.  Until the continental US is hit with a terrorist-caused disaster of biblical proportions, we'll continue out lazze-faire approach to life.<br>

Not only that, but if the arabs can see that we are not out to take their land or oil and actually did this to help them, as I suspect our actions will show in the near future, we can expect much warmer arab/American relations.<br>
<br>
You choose not to believe it, but the Iraqis are downright thrilled about the whole situation right now.  They are throwing flowers at the troops and shouting out praise of George Bush.  This is only going to help us with the arab population.<br>
<br>
Finally, arabs tend to respect power.  They respect the fact that we came in and took out Saddam.<br>
<br>
I feel a whole lot more secure now than I have in a long time.  The only relations we really hurt were with Europe and Hollywood.  The first we won't go to war with, the 2nd we won't either though we probably should.<br>

When you are talking about how our immense success is somehow the result of our &quot;values&quot; when its obvious that it has alot to do with our resources as well, I dont think its at all valid to draw a line that if respected makes it seem like those resources just magiced themselves into our coffers.  You cant just claim victory for values by choosing to ignore the evidence that anything else played a role.  Britian is a world player today because of its imperial system, if you were to draw a line in say 1950, its position would also be hard to explain without an appeal to something nebulous like values.  <br>

I think that right now the Iraqis are not completely sure what to make of it all.  I think they are thrilled Saddam is out, yet I think because of all the propaganda they have grown up with, they also fear that America will be a long term occupying power.  Many are cautiously optimistic that American will leave and let them form their own govt as they choose, while others are more pessimistic and think they will end up like the Palestinians.  In a year or so when they see that the Americans will leave and let them rule their own country the fears will dissipate and Iraqi/American relations will be very warm.  These are my predictions, we'll have to see if they are true in a year or so.<br>
