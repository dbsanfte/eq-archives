I certainly support the idea of smaller government, as most of you know by now.  However, I cannot continue to support tax cuts in the absence of corresponding spending cuts at this time as our deficit is just out of control.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I'd like to see tax cuts and spending cuts.  However, if we can't get the spending cuts through, I think we have to wait on the tax cuts.<br>
<br>
I do believe in the Laffer Curve, but I'm not convinced that we are at a point on the Laffer Curve where cutting taxes will increase total government revenues.  (I think we were at such a point when Reagan cut taxes.)<br>

Not sure I quite understand the significance of that statement.  Are you supporting the absurd spending and consequent huge deficit that Reagan put the country in with no regards to the future?  <br>
<br>
George Bush Sr. did a good job in stabilizing the economy after Reagan was out of office.  I hope you aren't supporting Reagan in his actions, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treeslover>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1613<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/15/03 12:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow that's a big ass deficit</span><hr size=1> They're reducing taxes to get votes for both sides, nobody wants to fight a tax cut, you look like the anti-christ.  Unfortunately none of the Reps or Senators are willing to give up their Pork Barrels to reduce the spending.<br>
<br>
I was watching a neat little show while playing trivia at the bar the other day and it listed the various pork barrel politics on both sides of the aisle that were just absurd.  I found most of the ones they listed and a few more on the CAGW website.  It's an interesting read if you ever have the time to peruse it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The funniest to me were:<br>
 - The $500,000 issue to each Rep/Senator for sending postcards to constituents.  <br>
 - The $3000-6000 raises for themselves, they've done such a good job why not vote another cost of living increase.<br>
 - 1.4 Million Dollars for a Kennel Complex (That's for dogs if you were unaware) at Elmendorf Air Force Base.<br>
 - $202,500 for a National Peanut Festival into economic development appropriations.<br>
 - Appropriators from the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State diverted millions away from the war on terror to fund pet projects, such as the First Tee Program, which dedicates $500,000 toward the construction of new golf courses for &quot;young people . who have not previously had exposure to the game..&quot;<br>
 - Hidden away in the recesses of the 2002 Defense Appropriations Bill, was a $3 million deal to lease 100 fuel tankers from Boeing. The General Accounting Office estimates that the six-year lease will cost taxpayers up to $30 billion. GAO reported that it would cost approximately $23 billion less to upgrade the current fleet.<br>
 - Tucked into the 2003 Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Bill was an $800,000 gift to the Grammy Foundation for music and arts education.<br>
 - Appropriators handed out $500,000 to the International Coffee Organization, whose professed goal is to stimulate the coffee economy. <br>
<br>
In addition, many on both sides of the aisle are fighting against resolution, S. Res. 173, would allow any senator to raise a point of order against appropriations earmarks.  Such items are not specifically authorized by law, and also skirt the competitive process.  Introduced by the Senate’s number one pork-barrel critic, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), and co-sponsored by Sens. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), the resolution would require 60 votes to keep an earmark in a bill.  S. Res. 173 would give all senators the opportunity to object to provisions inserted by members of the Appropriations Committee into the spending bills and subject them to a separate vote.<br>
<br>
Basically this bill would allow senators to zap shit like the Peanut Festival and Dog Kennel, but the number one critics of the bill are yes.. you guessed it.. the people who are chewing on the pork.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the only way to get rid of these momo's who keep passing this shit is to vote them out of office.. and do you think the guy who just got a job building the new Elmendorf AFB Dog Kennel is going to vote out of office the guy who just got him a job? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
What's increased steadily over time is the National Debt.  It dropped briefly during Clinton's second term, but it's pretty much been steadily increasing as well ever since a massive increase post-WW2.<br>
<br>
Nobody really turned the economy around since it hasn't been going down for a while now (During vietnam were the last substantial recessions), Clinton just had a bit more effect in cutting the pork, and Reagan was considered a direhard Military guy who increased spending substantially.  Not 100% sure this is all accurate, but it's pretty much what I remember reading about when growing up.  Carter was a bit before my time. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I stated the terms in the correct manner but I didn't make it more obvious to a person that doesn't know what I meant by it.<br>
<br>
Ayiar pretty much nailed it.  Reagan was a huge spender and didn't do a very good job with the budget.  This is independent of the economy.  For the most part, the economy was pretty stable while he was in office, although it never really moved forward either.  His problem was his overspending started the deficit moving in exponential increases.<br>
<br>
When Bush Sr. took office he controlled spending better although he also did put a lot into the military.  The deficit still rose but it was a bit more controlled at this point, whereas with Reagan it was pretty hard to predict how it would move.  Bush Sr. did a better job with economics than Reagan although some could say he was aided by the war, which is another debate altogether.  <br>
<br>
Clinton came in and did a good job with the budget, for some reason he was very skillful at maniuplating it and did a better job with it than the last few Presidents before him.  As far as the economy, he did a decent job with it although a lot of the credit has to go to the steadily building-up from Bush Sr.'s term as well as the international market changes due to new technological powers.  The strengthening of the currency of nations outside of us was a nice boost in our imports and exports and surely contributed to where we are today.  Clinton deserves some credit, yes, but not all of it.  <br>
<br>
Since then the economy has hit a large recession, whether it be Clinton's fault, Bush's fault, or neither's fault, it doesn't really matter at this point.  What does matter is that in times of recession, government spending should, theoretically, go up, and currently it seems like it's only being done at levels with little to no return.  This isn't a knock on Bush, as we have no idea yet how things are going to change in the next few months.  Hindsight is 20/20 and there's never any way of knowing exaclty how an economy is going to react to changes.  If it were that easy, we wouldn't have people debating it.  Historically, we're supposed to go through ups and downs, the only reason this recession hit us as hard as it did is because we had such an extended time of prosperity beforehand.  The longer the time between recessions, the harder the fall when they come.<br>
<br>
The resources for economists nowadays are so much better than they were in the past, so I have trust that the Reserve and the government will make the right choices in getting this country back on track.  I think the role of the President, in general, in controlling the economy is slowly starting to diminish and the role of foreign policy is beginning to take center stage.  The future of the world appears to be taking a turn towards amicable dependency, so its imperative that our next few Presidents take tenacious grasps onto relations with the other powers of the world to work together.  There will never be world peace but I'd venture to guess that whoever coined the term would be satisfactory with applying it to the current situation of the international community, and hopefully it should improve.<br>
<br>
In brief summary:  I don't think the deficit/economy are so much a reflection of the President's anymore as they are of the international market, the Reserve, and the current peace/wartime affairs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aurianne>Aurianne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mana Whore</span><br>  Posts: 1653<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/15/03 1:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow that's a big ass deficit</span><hr size=1> Huh.

<br>
I think Ayiar hit the nail on the head here.  We all look at the big programs when we want to cut spending, but we could save a hell of a lot by cutting all the little useless stuff like peanut festivals and bear dna sampling.  The problem is that the pork barrel spending is good for the individual state economies, even though all the states would be better off if we did away with all of it.<br>
<br>
As far as Reagan, despite the fact that he ran deficits, I think he is basically responsible for the huge economic growth we've seen over the last 22 years.  Taxes were so high back then that they removed incentive to work, and under Reagan, tax revenues actually went up after the tax cuts were enacted because of the massive effects on the economy that reduced taxation produced.  In Reagan's term, we really were at a point on the laffer curve where cutting tax rates (which were over 90 percent at the top) increased revenue.<br>
<br>
The deficits did spur the economy and gave us record growth, the problem is that the deficits were meant to be a temporary situation, not a new way of life, and unfortunately, they have become a way of life.<br>
<br>
Clinton's success in balancing the budget came from the soaring stock markets.  As people took profits on their stock sales, they paid taxes, and federal revenues went up.  He didn't actually do much to control spending.  If we go into a period of great economic prosperity soon, the deficits will likely shrink substantially.  However, I'm skeptical that that can erase $450 billion of deficit.<br>

I could at least show respect to both the republican and democratic parties.  Arguing that the Democrats did nothing while the Republicans did everything merely pushes your points to the verge of falsehood as it shows a lack of objectivity.<br>

<br>
I'd be alot happier if the morons on capital hill could balance a budget and actually reduce spending, but I think that's asking too much.  I'm pretty much of the opinion that the national debt is more a problem for congress to address than the President.  It's usually their pork that's overflowing it with crap that causes the problems.<br>
<br>
I'm also pretty much of the opinion that neither the democrats nor the republicans various &quot;economic&quot; solutions really mean jack shit in the grand scheme.  You can push our economy and you can nudge it certainly, but to give a person credit for our economy is a bit much I think.  If I can think of any one person to thank for the stability of our Economy for the longest time, I'd have to point at Alan Greenspan and his council. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Reagan made major changes to both.  Bush Sr. didn't really do much either.<br>
<br>
Reagan made the most sweeping changes to our system of taxation in history.  The top tax bracket was cut from like 92% to 36%.  That's pretty fucking huge.  There just wasn't anything Clinton did in his term that can hold a candle to it.<br>

<br>
All things being equal, shouldn't Canada's debt and defeceit be roughly equal to 1/10th of the US's, then?<br>
<br>
Except that things aren't equal. The US has a *much* larger trade base, and collects *far* more than 10 times what Canada does in annual taxes and tariffs. Also, a larger user base lowers the cost to everybody to maintain the same level of service. (*) For the same budget percentages, you should be able to provide a significantly higher level of service than we do. So why is the US defeceit so much larger than Canada's? Considering that Canada has free health care, much more federal and provincial subsidies for post-secondary education, etc....<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides... we don't give you our wood any more. We export bad actors now, haven't you heard? Though... I suppose Christiansen's performance in Star Wars: Attack of the Clowns could be considered wood....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(*) - I'm basing that assumption on the cost of actually buying the hardware. Take a hospital. $100,000 in equipment... It's much cheaper per person for them to treat 5,000 people with it than it is for them to treat 500. Once the facility is paid for, the cost per person is roughly the same, but by spreading out the cost of the facility among more people, the net cost is cheaper per person. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1443<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/15/03 3:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow that's a big ass deficit</span><hr size=1> The answer is simple Auri.
