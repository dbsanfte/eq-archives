Cure.<br>
Cure annoyed my ass off once upon a time and was essentially on my /ignore list. Then Cure actually talked to me and Cure made sense. A lore more sense than so many of the dumbfucks that play this game. So Cure, HUG.<br>
Barsh, yer cool. You're so right. It's totally why people get upset and leave the game. It's cool if you say upfront that all you care about is loot. Yet many fucktards like to pretend it's about something other than the loot, that it's about the people. Fuck that, LOL. It's not about the people. Most of us figured out it's not about the people. Some people adapt. Some people get sick of the BS and lies and leave. I don't think most people have a problem with people stating upfront that all they care about is the virtual loot, because in EQ with virtual loot comes virtual respect. They do feel bad though when they're told over and over that it's not about the loot, it's about this or that, and yet the actions totally contradict every word uttered. <br>
IV had some cool people in there. Most of them changed though, the one that didn't has left long ago =). HUGS to him. Anyway, LOL. I saw the list of names Cure posted, that's so funny. So fucking predictable. Have fun pretending! I mean, LOL, I fail to see the point of always telling people about your scrupulous principles if all you're going to do is act in direct opposition to them. This is for the select few that actually bother. The others it was always obvious that EQ is your whole identity. I'm talking about the people that actually tried to pretend it wasn't. Tried to pretend they were capable of individual thought, of seeing beyond virtual reality. Didn't work I see. You can't disguise what's not there =). <br>
Yada Yada Yada, continue BS-ing. I hope when you're old you'll be able to look back upon the formulative years of your youth and say ... WOW, I was soooo powerful in that hit virtual game EverQuest, son, I know I don't do shit in RL, but hey, in EverQuest, &quot;I was the man!&quot;<br>
ROFL, someone actually already speaks like that. LOL.<br>
I also love people who post pro-IV but completely irrelevant messages. Like you're not already transparent enough as it is. =) What, afraid you won't get an invite to the next IV raid? LOL! Wouldn't that just break your heart! No EXCITEMENT in your life anymore now that you can't raid COOL EQ zones =)<br>
At least take a fucking stand.<br>
<br>
To sum it all up for people who can't read: LOL @ IV cuz IV SUX. =)<br>
<br>
You should just stop defending yourselves 'cause you know you say one thing and yet do the opposite. Repeatedly.<br>
<br>
Dope!<br>

I especially like this post by Ahliana who probably has more of a brain than I previously attributed to her:<br>

<br>
People came to Vaz for a variety of reasons.  No reason is any more important than any other, as long as people play within the rules.<br>
<br>
I would say that a very large percentage of players who were on Vaz for the first month were there to be uber, or at least more prosperous than they would have been/could have been on their old servers.<br>
<br>
You can twist anything to sound negative.  I could meet a girl, fall in love with her, marry her, and you could say that I was merely depriving other men of her love.  Technically, it's true, but I don't think there's anything wrong with that.<br>
<br>
When you eat an apple, you forever deprive someone else of the chance to eat that apple.  When you get a job, you're depriving someone else the opportunity to work at that position.  If you're camping the ghoul lord, you're depriving other players of the opportunity to camp him at that moment.<br>
<br>
This is a difference of philosophies.  You think EQ should be played one way, other people think that it should be played in another way.  Who are you to tell anyone how to play?  <br>
<br>
Joe came to Vaz to be uber. Jack came to get away from people like Joe.  Mark came to mess around with a new class.  Tom came to be a merchant god.  No reason is more valid than the others.  <br>
<br>
Norrath is a land of opportunity, it is what you make it, and if you want the same thing as someone else, you need to want it more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugaladriiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galadriiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/31/01 11:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=165>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  PO large sized 50+ guild, who could if pressed result to zergling tactics and upset the balance, or make life hard on any time zone.<br>

PO might not have the experience IV has but they are also playing by a different set of rules I think. I doubt they are as loot driven as encounter/fun driven. Had they wanted to be jerks they could have made the fear situation rather interesting. They have the bodies to fill the zone and make LD issues for anyone enfringing on their fun, etc... But did they? NO, they are playing the game, not letting the game play them. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
