As the GM stated, Vazaelle did surprisingly very well for a 2 month old server. If the team had been given more time to mass up better equipment, Vaz mighta won.<br>
<br>
Great job anyways guys. We'll get em next time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If he is a FoH member after all, oh well. /shrug. Doesn't bother me any. I personally don't give a rats ass about FoH. Not my server, never was, never will be...so I don't care about em like some people do...<br>
<br>
Heh don't get me started on what I think about guilds like FoH...that would be something best saved for the rant section. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </font><P><table align="center">
