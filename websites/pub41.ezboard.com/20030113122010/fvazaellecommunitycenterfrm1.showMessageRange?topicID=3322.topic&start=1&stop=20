In the beginning, i had no idea why i was being invited into the "fellowship of fire", but it sounded cool, and once I had joined (gladstone), I had a whole new aspect of the game open up for me.  I started finding out where to group, what sites to visit, what skills were important, what classes could do... it was informational.<br>
<br>
a few months later the guild halls were empty and lacking people to group with, I found "sacred legions" a middle tier guild where everyone gained from grouping and leveling together.  I spent my 20-40 levels in sacred legions before that guild went the way of the dodo, and was recruited into "Storm legions".  This was my first access to kael, and some of the higher end zones.  I would see sebilis, chardok, and had the resources to explore most zones in the game with a guild group.  I attended my first raids, and learned alot from the raid leaders.<br>
<br>
As most of those guilds, storm legion suffered, and still suffers from attrition at the top.  There is no shame in it, people leave to raid the upper end content, and for that they need a guild geared to doing that.  It is unfortunate for guilds like Storm Legions that our friends continue to leave and move to more favorable ground instead of sticking around to lift their friends to the top.  We are certainly not the only guild that experiences the problem.  I assume it is a flaw in the foundation that prevents those people from lifting the guild.<br>
<br>
What makes a guild special?  Is it the content you get to see, or the people you meet along the way?  For me it has always been about the people.  It is sad that the people equation invariably changes, and that you loose the bonds of the people who move to new guilds.  You are left to constantly rebuild again.  Content is obviously important as well, because people leave for exactly that reason.<br>
<br>
if I had to come up with a list of things that I think might make a guidl successful I would choose these:<br>
<br>
1) narrow band of level range.  55-60.  The reason for this is that people will not outlevel you, and no one in the guild channel would ever be too much of a drag on an exp group.  The only place this can work is at the top end of the level range.  This alone is probably why people are unable to ever lift their guilds to the top.<br>
<br>
2) timezone centric.  Recruit only players commited to a single timezone and window of playing.  This is to foster cameraderie between members.<br>
<br>
3) Class distribution.  Need to be balanced, but I don't know how you can ever really accmpolish this.  Should a guild ever be "full" for your class?  If that is the case, I would think you would deguild a person for lack of attendance?<br>
<br>
4) Raids - I think in the end this is the biggest reason to have a guild.  The alliance does a nice job of grouping multiple guilds together to raid, but organization is cumbersome and requires more lead time and planning.  <br>
<br>
5) Social - The second biggest reason is to see your friends when you log in.  Make sure that you help each other with epics, and other progression in the game.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that those rules do not favor the casual player.  When I look at guilds that have been successful for a while, I wonder if they have any casual players among them.  is it possible to make a successful longterm guild of casual players?  What do you think makes a guild successful?<br>

Casual Gamers are the exception , not the norm in high end guilds.   You cant survive on casual gamers , you need hardcore players that make 90% of the raids to be really succesful or else the hardcore will become frustrated to be working hard for the guild and seeing the other sonly log in on saturdays .   They will then leave and try to find a guild with players who play the game the same way they do.<br>
<br>
You wont do much if your 5 clerics all log in on different days of the week.  <br>
<br>
Also it depends on how you define a Succesful Guild .  If it raiding high-end content , then hardcore players will be mostly responsible for your succes because without them there would be like 1 raid a week and those craving raid would leave.   <br>
<br>
Also a strong and fair guild leader will have a big impact on the succes of a guild.  Some people seem to be made to be guild leader , it comes naturally to them.<br>

<br>
In my book, if you can answer "Yes" to the following questions, your guild is a success.<br>
<br>
Does your guild make the time you spend on mindless exp camping more enjoyable?<br>
<br>
Do you want to log on and spend time with your guildmates?<br>
<br>
Are you achieving your goals as a player with your guild?<br>
<br>
Are you helping your guildmates achieve their goals?<br>
<br>
That's what it boils down to, really.  <br>

What makes a guild successful?<br>
<br>
Finding good people behind the characters who know how to play their class. Not just clicking heal buttons, but people who strive to better themselves at their class. <br>
<br>
Finding people who want to focus on achieving things before loot interests. Sure, boss mob X has $$$ loot, but just remind yourself that you'll get it eventually and /grats whoever gets it before you if they do. <br>
<br>
Finding people that patient and loyal. Not people that join your guild to get their epics and then 2 weeks later leave to join the 'uber' guild with barely a thank you. <br>
<br>
Finding good people to take the lead as officers in such a way that others will listen to them and they get things done. These are the people who talk/listen and research mobs, strats, info, etc to make raids successful or at least they learn and adapt in order to get better each time. A good officer is something very special to a Guildleader and their efforts are appreciated.<br>
<br>
Avoid recruiting 10 clerics just cuz they're clerics. Same for any needed class. Find SKILLED people. Just cuz you have a high amount of clerics, rogues, warriors, wizards, etc doesn't mean a thing if they are idiots. 30 very competant people can do the job of 50 morons almost every time. <br>
<br>
People should have a friendship with their guilders inorder to create that bond to where people dont want to leave. Help others with quests, XP groups, epics, etc. Think about the people who you'd drop everything to help - why is that? Cuz those are the ones who have done the same for you. <br>
<br>
Avoid growing too fast in an effort to compete with guildX or guildZ. Keep things going steady and they'll progress. But if you're trying to create a guild of lvl 40-50ish people, there needs to be split time for raids and XPing and Epics. But if it's more for 55-60 levels, then do what you can to keep people busy. Schedule raids appropiate to you guild's abilities but also others to at least attempt so people can strive for goals. <br>
<br>
Don't strive to be the next CC or PO or anyone. Strive to be the best your guild can be. Many of us can remember when Fire Giants was a guild raid, or Phinny ) <br>
<br>
Enjoy the game. Sometimes that's easier said than done, but it's the purpose of it all. <br>
<br>
/shrugs   just some thots I had to the question, hope it helps<br>

Though it may hurt us to see some people leave we should sometimes try to see it from their perspective (something I've yet to be able to do).<br>
<br>
Just depends on the person really. I agree with Tuvan about the things that make a guild a good thing but the reasons he listed are more something an individual would consider, whether the guild is right for them etc. I guess if everyone in a guild can answer yes to Tuvan's questions then its a success but I don't imagine such a guild exists most of the time as a single event can totally change a persons opinion of things.<br>
<br>
I doubt there's any true formula for determining guild success but I think what Tuvan posted is what it pretty much boils down to after all a guild is made of nothing if not individuals.<br>
<br>
Some people see others in this game merely as slightly more intelligent NPCs who are there to see them achieve their goals, others are in it for the family thing. Either way its up to everyone to judge whether they think their guild is a success and choose whether to fight to make it better or to bail on their friends.<br>

<br>
There just is no simple answer because what makes a successful guild successful is completely dependent on what you define 'a successful guild' as being.<br>
<br>
My guild was formed little over a month ago, and I consider it successful.  That being said, others likely will disagree.  For instance, when I created my guild a month+ ago, I left a guild that was doing semi-high end content (not uber content, but getting close).  The guild I formed does low end content like Kaesora on alts for fun.  We have about 20 members, and we all play at our leasure which means that we oftenly are not all on at the same time.  To most people that play EQ, this is a very UNSUCCESSFUL guild.  But, to me and my members, this is one of the more SUCCESSFUL guilds that we have ever been in.  We just enjoy the game for what it is... entertainment.<br>
<br>
So basically, what I am trying to say is that you need to make the decission on what success means to your guild if you are the leader.  Those people that leave your guild because of what you define as the goal of your guild were not meant to be there.  There is nothing wrong with those individuals moving on.  It will take time, but eventually you will get the kinds of people in your guild that like your goals, and then you will really start to enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
Have fun.<br>

<br>
The gnome equation probably holds up as well.  Jordangw did make the guild for a while there :)  We probably need to increase the gnome count...<br>

I've seen way too many guilds torn apart by the careless use of gnomes to think they are harmless like everyone says. <br>
<br>
In any case, if I were to offer some suggestions for what makes a successful guild I would have to include:<br>
<br>
1. people who log on everyday for at least 5+ hours a day<br>
<br>
2. lots and lots of skilled clerics<br>
<br>
3. a good puller who isn't reliant on ShowEQ<br>
<br>
4. selflessness where loot and fellow guildmembers are concerned. <br>
<br>
5. a capable leader who logs on regularly and knows what is going on within the guild interpersonally.<br>
<br>
6. active witty banter in guild chat. or disgusting vile suggestions and innuendos. Either works wonders for morale.<br>
<br>
There are probably more but these 6 are the fundamentals, I would venture. <p>Prybutok Agonista<br>
