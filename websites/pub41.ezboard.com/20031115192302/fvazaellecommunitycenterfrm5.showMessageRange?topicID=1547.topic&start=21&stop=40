What people are attacking you for is the fact that you're actively camping shards for Vex Thal yet you've progressed no where near that stage.

If a guild, any guild, can kill Rhag 2, THO, Grieg, and clear NToV (Including Vyemm and the triplets), then fine, start farming your Emporer keys.  If a guild, any guild, can kill Creator, Arch Lich, Cursed, or High Priest, then fine, start farming your shards.  Short of that, in the 6-12 months it will take for you to reach that point, PoP will come out, and VT will be tossed onto the steaming once-uber pile of time sink crappiness, just like VP and PoM before it.<br>

Thats a simple fact, time is NOT on your side, the days and months are clicking away and you guys are far from close. Once your members have level 60, all the shards, and their emp key all that work is going to make them apply for PO or CC where they can actually use all that stuff they camped so long and hard for. It has happened before and it will happen again.

<br>
CC/PO people want shards now.<br>
Alliance people want shards for the future. They also want to gear up, and work towards getting to the point where they would be in a position to eat Emporer and have a use for shards.<br>
<br>
The solution here is very simple. Plat. A shitload of plat. If you want the shards fucking buy them from Alliance people before they loot them.<br>
<br>
CC/PO has raced to get the mobs in the end game before anyone else so they can have no competition. And now you despair over competition for shards? Great. Either share with everyone, or fucking pay up. How many tormax daggers have you had for sale or rotting in the bank, and how many shards are they worth? How about spells and other tradeable items?<br>
<br>

Or how about not. How about we instead just bring in a group of level 60's in NToV gear or better, enact FFA rules, and kill 10-1 of the shard dropping mobs? Seriously why the hell should we have to pay huge amounts of plat to the Alliance for shards? They have some kind of a lock on all those spawns now? Forget about it. We will plow the spawns and get the shards. If the Alliance wants to kill the mobs as well that is their right as per Vazaelle policy.<br>
<br>
Nice idea Saalron, lets set a precedent that low level people can make loads of plat camping key pieces and then raping the higher level people with insane prices on the shards.

Attempting to put one persons actions forward as alliance policy is just ridiculous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uslassh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slassh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 3:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1547.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i have a solution</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;CC/PO people want shards now.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think we are missing 10 keys out of 63 active members. And I am sure this will change with the recent Emperor Kill.<br>

Unsure what you consider END game.<br>
PO and CC rarely race. Its all a matter of Timezones<br>

No she isnt. Not at all. She is informing an Guild/s of the true extent of their plans.<br>

Members of the alliance have exactly the same right as me or any other *uber* player out there to camp shards. EverQuest content is there to be experienced by everyone, I just don't personally believe that you will enjoy this part of the content and I'm saying so and giving a realistic reason why you should not do it. If you persist I won't care, it doesn't affect me.<br>
Come back when you've camped the Maidens Eye shard, it took 80 hours to get for one of our members. Not to mention that Maidens Eye exp sucks monkey balls. <p><center>

As far as competition for shards etc.  I have been camping shards for others now for about a month now and don't believe they are to hard to get for a group of level 60's.   Hell last night in FG we got 3 shards in about 2 hours and I know that is not always common.  We got one in Akheva and than none in Acrylia.  Farming these fucking shards ain't that hard and I don't think that with the levels you all have that the Alliance is really a threat to you.  Now the flip side to this is not everyone can camp these things.  It is not hard for a group of level 60 that know what they are doing.  I haven't seen to many people camping em yet cause I don't think most people can do Seru guards or Katta Cents.  I do understand that CC is the only guild in VT right now and it will remain that way for some time.  The two other guilds respectively which would get there soon PO has been camping  shards but even they have work to do to get there still.  Yes it is kinda lame to camp shards unless you are applying to PO or CC and that is the simple fact since they are the only ones likely to hit it.  Bottom line is I like the idea of camping shards at 60 cause it gives my endless grinding some purpose.  I also like to see people get these things that need em cause they are a pain in the ass to get.  I really don't see shards as being competition in all the camps I have been at, but that is just been my experience.    I have also been at camps where I have not seen any drop in weeks.  Mostly the ME camp, which has been a bitch for Bruennor.  Some of em are pretty easy to get and hence people may sit on those camps well good luck.  All I know is if you can help a 1st tier guild in reaching a goal that they need, I think the benefit would stand that they would help you in your time of need.  And I don't mean taking advantage of them either.  Exploiting drops for cash is fucking lame in my opinion.  I would say ok well lets say a level 60 in your guild needs a spell, but you all can't do it.   One common item that people can't get is the crown for the mage epic in Air.  Well if you assisst uber_guild01 they may just have something you might be able to buy.  Thus making you more effective in game and everyone wins.  Pulling shit like we are camping these get out is ghey and taking the right away from someone to camp anything is ghey.  Furthermore bitching about it is lame cause it doesn't really solve much.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uammelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 6:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1547.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Keys</span><hr size=1> I wouldn't say anything is impossible.  I remember all the IV people saying that PO would never kill vindicator or cazic, and they have since moved quite a bit past those mobs (even well before luclin).  I would say that probably greater than 95 percent of guilds now existing will never kill the emperor, just as the vast majority of guilds on vazaelle have never killed and will never kill phara dar.  Are you one of those that will or won't? I don't have the ability to see the future, only time will tell.<br>
<br>
The issue is more that it will simply take massive effort and a very long time to do it.  It took CC over 1.5 years to move from where you are to where we are now, and the average CC member plays about 4 times as much as the average alliance member (guessing).  That means that at the same rate of progress, you're talking 6 years to kill emperor dedicating 100 percent of your online time to the cause.  Now add to that that the server is increasingly competitive, that you are more likely to lose uber members to uberguilds, and you are looking at a very long time frame for emperor.  Will eq hold your interest that long?  Most likely, by the time the alliance can kill emperor, there will be other content in the game that is more appealing to you and has better rvr.<br>
<br>
However, in your favor is the tendancy for expansions to gimpify older content.  VP is not what it was, even NToV is a lot easier now with luclin gear.<br>
<br>
I would never say it's impossible that the alliance will do emp.  However, it's certainly a long, long ways away, and people like Elaenya are just trying to help you get a feel for the difficulty of the encounter and help you to best use your time.  She is providing the benefit of knowledge she has from first hand experiences in the endgame.<br>
<br>
As far as shard camping, no one has the right to tell you you can or cannot camp shards, and I'm sure you know it.  Personally, I don't care.  I've already camped shards for both Ezelar and Ammelen, and Boradek has 8/10.  I just think it's a bit like planning where you will go on vacation in 2034.  A lot can happen between now and then.  Sure it's possible you can go to xxx place, but I'd be more worried about planning my vacations for the next few years first.  Of course, if you want to plan your vacation for 2034, it's a free country, go right ahead and do it.<br>
<br>
BTW, it's not like tov where you can farm zone in mobs and get nice armor drops.  You have to be able to plow the boss mobs to get any loot, only the named in VT drop anything at all.  The trash is just that... trash.<br>
