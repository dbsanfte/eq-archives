Without going into all the gory details, let's just say that Zozz tries to make us think the way he wants us to think, not by showing us evidence and reasoning with us, but by understanding how to push our emotional buttons. Given that many lives have been lost to Maoism, isn't it obvious that his teachings serve only to safeguard his own power and privilege? Propagandism and elitism are not synonymous. In fact, they are so frequently in opposition and so universally irreconcilable that I myself oppose his half-measures because they are amoral. I oppose them because they are featherbrained. And I oppose them because they will encourage and exacerbate passivity in some people who might otherwise be active and responsible citizens before the year is over. I have a tendency to report the more sensational things that Zozz is up to, the more shocking things, things like how he wants to rewrite and reword much of humanity's formative works to favor misoneism. And I realize the difficulty that the average person has in coming to grips with that, but his prophecies will have consequences -- very serious consequences. And we ought to begin doing something about that. To oppose chauvinism, we must oppose ruffianism. To oppose solipsism, we must oppose oligarchism. And to oppose Zozz, we must oppose uncouth fogeys. <br><br>Zozz, do you feel no shame for what you've done? Last I checked, statements like, &quot;His litanies have a crippling effect on science and technology&quot; accurately express the feelings of most of us here. He must think that the world has no memory. Excuse me; that's not entirely correct. What I meant to say is that I'm willing to accept that Zozz's pleas are in conflict with accepted morality. I'm even willing to accept that he has the gall to think that churlish drug addicts aren't ever unbridled. But he possesses no significant intellectual skills whatsoever and has no interest in erudition. Heck, he can't even spell or define &quot;erudition,&quot; much less achieve it. <br><br>Lest I seem like a hypocrite, I should tell you that griping about Zozz will not make him stop trying to leave a large part of this country's workforce dislocated and disillusioned. But even if it did, he would just find some other way to rally for a cause that is completely void of moral, ethical, or legal validity. He demonstrates a terrible, inaccurate, even vapid, misuse of history with his mumpish bromides. Interestingly, he doesn't seem to care about that. If he gets his way, none of us will be able to put the kibosh on Zozz's modes of thought. Therefore, we must not let him infiltrate and then dominate and control the mass media. I feel that writing this letter is like celestial navigation. Before directional instruments were invented, sailors navigated the seas by fixing their compass on the North Star. But Zozz's histrionics are not witty satire, as he would have you believe. They're simply the loquacious ramblings of someone who has no idea or appreciation of what he's mocking. <br><br>We must educate, inform, and nurture our children instead of keeping them ignorant, afraid, and in danger. Then again, that notion has been popular for as long as nihilism has existed. Although this has been overlooked or ignored by the established scientific community, that fact is simply inescapable to any thinking man or woman. &quot;Thinking&quot; is the key word in the previous sentence. <br><br>Anyway, the consequence of all this is that the objection may still be raised that cultural tradition has never contributed a single thing to the advancement of knowledge or understanding. At first glance, this sounds almost believable. Yet the following must be borne in mind: Given the amount of misinformation that Zozz is circulating, I must indubitably point out that he is thoroughly gung-ho about stoicism because he lacks more pressing soapbox issues. Zozz says that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. Wow! Isn't that like hiding the stolen goods in the closet and, when the cops come in, standing in front of the closet door and exclaiming, &quot;They're not in here!&quot;? I may be opening a Pandora's box by writing this, but I proudly adopt this stand. Think about it, and I'm sure you'll agree with me. <br><br>Here's an idea: Instead of giving Zozz the ability to make clueless, self-centered calumniators out to be something they're not, why don't we spread awareness of the dodgy nature of his scare tactics? If we do, we'll then be able to embark on a new path towards change. He says that he is beyond reproach. The inference is that Zozz is a perpetual victim of injustice. I'm happy to report that I can't follow that logic. <br><br>More often than not, the picture I am presenting need not be confined to his orations. It applies to everything Zozz says and does. Many people respond to his judgemental stratagems in the same way that they respond to television dramas. They watch them; they talk about them; but they feel no overwhelming compulsion to do anything about them. That's why I insist we draw a picture of what we conceive of under the word &quot;pharmacodynamic&quot;. To say merely that the use of long run-on sentences, bad metaphors, multiple misspellings, and inappropriately placed $5 words like &quot;counterexpostulation&quot; does not help Zozz's cause at all is an understatement. Zozz practically breaks his arm patting himself on the back when he says, &quot;It takes courage to go down into the muddy trenches and sully a profession that's already held in low esteem.&quot; As if that were something to be proud of. <br><br>This is not Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, where the state would be eager to burn our fair cities to the ground. Not yet, at least. But to get even the simplest message into the consciousness of the worst classes of contumelious morons there are, it has to be repeated at least 50 times. Now, I don't want to insult your intelligence by telling you the following 50 times, but the pen is a powerful tool. Why don't we use that tool to serve on the side of Truth? Do Zozz's apparatchiks bring strength to our families, power to our nation, and health to our cities? No, that would be the correct and logical thing to do. Instead, they allow federally funded research to mushroom into a loathsome, grossly inefficient system, hampered by besotted stupid-types and crazy bimbos. <br><br>Zozz is totally mistaken if he believes that women are spare parts in the social repertoire -- mere optional extras. If I withheld my feelings on this matter, I'd be no less deluded than Zozz. Isn't it true that there are some pigheaded chuckleheads out there who care nothing for you or your cherished contrivances? If that's not true, tell me why not. Ostensibly, he does not intend to waste taxpayers' money, but in fact, some people are responsible and others are not. Zozz falls into the category of &quot;not&quot;. Why does he want to manipulate everything and everybody? Because by using bombastic language and selective quotation, he is able to put a high-handed spin on important issues. That's not the only reason, of course, but I'll get to the other reasons later. <br><br>Although I can no more change the past than see the future, it's safe to say that I try never to argue with him, because it's clear he's not susceptible to reason. What a cunning coup on the part of Zozz's hangers-on, who set out to place stumbling blocks in front of those of us who seek value and fulfilment in our personal and professional lives and got as far as they did without anyone raising an eyebrow. Not surprisingly, one can consecrate one's life to the service of a noble idea or a glorious ideology. Zozz, however, is more likely to make his epithets a key dynamic in modern unilateralism by viscerally defining &quot;epididymodeferential&quot; through the experience of nugatory racialism. And that's what writing this sort of letter is all about. It's a way to begin a course of careful, planned, and coordinated action.<br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www-csag.ucsd.edu/individual/pakin/complaint">www-csag.ucsd.edu/individual/pakin/complaint</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=durid>Durid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/20/02 8:48:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zozz you charlatan!!!</span><hr size=1>  tropics you are on drugs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubackorz666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Backorz666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/20/02 9:00:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zozz you charlatan!!!</span><hr size=1> ahaha i got to the 3rd line and stopped reading <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uamadar75.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amadar75</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/20/02 9:26:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zozz you charlatan!!!</span><hr size=1> You got farther then I did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uatro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/20/02 9:39:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zozz you charlatan!!!</span><hr size=1> OMG THAT'S NEVER BEEN POSTED BEFORE! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=durid>Durid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/20/02 9:52:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=768.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zozz you charlatan!!!</span><hr size=1> P&lt;MG? whats never been posted?
