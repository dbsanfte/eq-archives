Introduction<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The continent of Faerûn houses a myriad of races and creatures. Of all these, the elves are best known. They have prospered since the dawn of time and continue even to this day. Their cities are wondrous works of architecture and their musical talents are rivaled by none. For this very reason, many bards and virtuosos tend to add Elven phrases and use Elven instruments to enhance their performance. Elves are highly skilled at harnessing the magical weave of Toril and do so in the form of spells and enchantments. Some of the most famous wizards and sorcerers have Elven roots in their heritage.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The physical makeup of Elves is similar to Humans and yet infinitely different. An average Elf stands from four and a half to five and a half feet tall and weigh more or less a hundred pounds. Elves are very graceful, possessing heightened natural dexterity but are frail and cannot take much of a beating. The majority of elves are pale-skinned with dark hair and emerald green eyes with the exception of the drow. Elves enjoy simple, comfortable clothes that do not interfere with their agility. A misleading thought that some folk believe is that elves need to sleep. This is not entirely correct because elves do not sleep; they go into a meditative trance for four hours or so. This is enough to gain the benefits of the eight hours of sleep that humans require. However, the one thing that makes them so different than human beings is the fact that an elf can live indefinitely if he is not slain in battle or diseased. This is quite rare and a good deal of the elves that do live on eternally are Kings and Sages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The story that you will read now details the life of one who surpassed his earthly limitations and finally found true immortality amongst the gods of Toril.<br>
<br>
<br>
Prelude<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Lenasan Nightstrider, roughly translated in Common. I am a ranger, a keeper of nature if you will under the service of Elhonna. In my life I have fulfilled many deeds worthy of heroes; slain masses of foes, saved innocents from the jaws of death, helped many a one in their personal quests and even vanquished a god. I had many friends during my mortal life; Laeaddil Truthbringer and Telemachas Trueheart; Protectors of Heironeous, Emmie Nemz; Enchantress of Boccob, Bangito Burito; Priest of Moradin, Mardesan Entregan; Thief of Olidammara, Cyanravyn; Arch Druidess of Elhonna, Atmu Dakhor; High Druidess of Silvanus and more with names that I could not possibly translate from the perplexing language of Sylvan.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was destined to be a ranger, the seers said. In the city of Rantartus, my life began.  My parents looked upon me with pride as they taught me the ways of nature during my youth. My father was the blade master of Rantartus, a master with blades and a rather good tactician as well. My mother was a Druidess, one of no small importance in the city who could focus nature’s will as easily as you can breathe air. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The city of Rantartus was located above an unknown, massive tunnel network that reached deep into the Underdark. It was not till much later after the city was built that they discovered the tunnels and what lied within.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter One - The Drow Assault<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I awoke from my meditation to a strange odor hanging in the air. Instantly alert as my father had taught me to be when danger was near, I cautiously inched toward the window of my home. As I peeked outside, I saw metal glinting in the moonlight; darting to and fro. A crossbow bolt whizzed past my head and bounced off the  nearby wall, ejecting a black liquid. Recoiling from the attack, I grabbed my weapons and quaffed a potion I had bought from the city alchemist earlier. Silently slipping out the back door and taking cover I viewed the scene of carnage that lay before me. Dead bodies of my peers and mentors lay scattered about everywhere and shadowy forms raced about. Taking great care not to be noticed I moved about, searching for the one who had fired the envenomed missile. I found him crouching in a dark corner, with his crossbow trained on the street. Upon first observation, he seemed to be a wood elf as well but his armor was misleading. As the figure removed his helm briefly to adjust it the illusion faded and I saw his true form. Drow. I quietly cursed and moved behind the vile being. My eyes glowed with vengeance as I sliced his head clean off his shoulders with Flamesong, my magnificently crafted scimitar. At that point my magical invisibility had faded so I propped up the body and hid behind it while I contemplated my next actions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As fast as a wolf, I raced towards the Druid Grove to alert my mother of what had transpired. To my ultimate horror my mothers body lay pinned against the great oak, Sirius, with a jeweled dagger impaled in her heart. Waves of emotion throttled through me but I remembered the raiding party that still inhabited the city and took control. I stood over her and softly chanted a prayer that she had taught me, a prayer for reincarnation. A spider crawled out of the corpse’s mouth in front of me before the body disappeared. Remembering what the Loremaster had said about dark elves, I slashed hard at the arachnid and found that my weapons were reflected by an intangible force. Slowly, the spider transformed into a dark elf woman, wearing web emblazoned robes. “You are Lenasan, are you not?” She asked in a dark. brooding voice. “Why should I answer to the likes of you?” I answered spitefully. “You will answer because if you do not, I will kill you ibillith.” She said coldly. The woman held up a gem. It sparkled a rainbow of colors and as I looked at it I felt my body droop, gradually being taken over by the enchantment of the stone. The dark elf began to recite an incantation, one that I had never heard before, and just before she finished, a crystal blade burst out the front of her chest. The charm broke and I felt a fleeting moment of nausea. She uttered something in Dark Elvish and vanished. “She will not get far. ” Said my father as he sheathed his blade grimly. He stood still for a second, listening. He grabbed my arm and flung me into a portal that had opened nearby as a fireball roared into the grove.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I readied my bow and drew and arrow as the portal closed behind us. “You are late.” Cyanravyn said, with a smirk. “Its all the way you look at it.” My father said cooly. “Do not worry about your mother Lenasan, she is in good hands.” Cyan said motioning towards the Moon. “I will explain it to you later, now it is time for some hunting of my own.” Using my gift of infravision, I spotted the wizard who was having the time of his life with his wands of fire. I fired my nocked arrow at his figure and its electrical enchantment wracked the wizard for a few moments while I nocked and fired another. Now there is one thing you ought to know about drow and wizards. It is rare that you will find this combination but if you do, you are up against one who channels his raw fury into spells that could eradicate a titan. However, I was quite surprised that my arrows even got through to him with the barriers that most spell casters erect around themselves in battle. An apprentice... I thought to myself and grinned. Suddenly a wild surge of energy barreled through the air and the wizard fell limp in the air, being pelted to death by gemstones. A wild mage, even better! I chucked to myself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But the worst was yet to come. After As I did a perimeter sweep of the city, an ugly bulbous form emerged from the shadows and the air rippled as a blast of psionic energy slammed into a few soldiers that had banded together slaying drow. Only one resisted the attack and his brain was devoured shortly after by the infernal creature. I felt something materialize next to me and quickly spun about forming an optical weapon shield. Cyanravyn, the Arch Druidess flicked her hand and I froze in place. “It is good that you are eager to banish these drow back to their abyssal home but, please do try to further detriment our cause.” She said with snicker and ended the time stop spell. Cyan then began an incantation and the mind flayer fell over dead, insects crawling from its corpse. Polymorphing into the primal hunter, a scaled black wolf, she went in hunt of dark elves. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remembering the scroll library in Myrist, the great library, I sprinted towards the building. Just before I reached it, the ground was briefly covered in a slick, sticky fluid and I slipped; crashing hard on the pavement. The solution disappeared instantly and a slender form appeared before the locked portal to the Library. “Finally! What took you so long?” Kimmurel said and yawned. “The darkies were starting to get the idea of the inertial barrier I have set up around here...” “Forget the password again?” I asked with a sly grin. “Oh you know me, all teleportation.. No brains hehe.” Standing in front of the door I traced an arcane rune into the mithril and breathed upon it. It glowed red and with a light whoosh, the door opened. We stepped inside and the metal reassembled behind us. “Gotta love those magic yippies,” Kimmurel said with a laugh and shadow stepped into the scroll room. If you had not already guessed, Kimmurel is a psionically gifted individual whos main focus is psychoportation or the bending of the fabric of space using mental power. I skipped among the thousands of shelves searching for just the book that would solve this disaster. Being the ranger I am, I can’t remember any complex summoning rituals that are needed to bring divine light and needed the manual. It sat between “Legacy of Neverwinter” and “Planar Travel for Dummies” (a fine book if I do say so myself). Returning into the main room, the pedestal of conjuration loomed before me. Stepping up to it, I inspected the surface. Grooves and sockets were carved in an ornate design all over the stone plate stared up at me. The entrance opened and Cyan skittered in firing flame arrows out as the door closed. “We must hurry, there is not much time!” She shouted and opened a vault that holds components for major summonings. Kimmurel appeared in front of me holding a fist full of dorjes, slender crystal wands imbued with psionic properties. He placed one in each corner of the stone and Cyanravyn placed diamonds, rubies and emeralds into the grooves. In the center, she placed her holy symbol; a unicorn head carved from the finest ivory. “Alright, form a circle and we will begin the metachant.” “Arithnus... Tarlantin... Krithat... Eriatsæ... Mefluvious!” Strands of light lept out of the stones and condensed into a rapidly spinning globe about the symbol. The wands then glowed bright purple and merged with the sphere, which now was twirling even faster. In the ceiling of the chamber, a hole opened and a beam of divine light surged from the unicorn into the globe. Cyanravyn then began a chant and it rose out through the hole in the roof. I was awestruck as it exploded, sending streaks of holy light across the city, obliterating all evil in its path. We exited the building to find one Dark Elf standing there, eyes gleaming with malice.  “You shall pay dearly for this, fools! The Order of the Onyx Spider will destroy you all!” Just as he finished, his head turned black and melted into a pool on the ground. Emmie, the adventuring phantasmist,  stepped out from behind a pilum, twirled around her wand and grinned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm28">Legacy of Ykesha<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm27">Artistic Endeavors<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm30">The Real World<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27>Artistic Endeavors</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
