I'd say that it's a FAIR assumption he is a fiscal conservative.<br>
<br>
I think Arnold has surrounded himself with good advisers, and would likely make a good governor. I normally go with the fiscal conservative/social liberal in any election, and he seems to be the best fit there. (I wish Feinstein had run for Governor, though....it would have made it hard to decide who to vote for to replace Davis)<br>
<br>
I did vote yes on the recall. Gray Davis is one of those uncharismatic and slimy career politicians who has shown through his behavior and campaign tactics throughout his career that he is despicable and has no class.<br>
<br>
When asked why he thought Gray Davis was corrupt, former Governor Pete Wilson said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Gov. Wilson: When he first came to office, he said, &quot;I'd appreciate your counsel.&quot; I said, &quot;I will give you one bit of advice that is of critical importance: You as governor, with the power that the governor of California has, are the only thing standing between this utterly irresponsible legislature and financial ruin for this state. That is not exaggeration. If you don't stop them, and you can, by just refusing to sign a budget or vetoing a bad one, if you don't make them fiscally responsible, then don't expect that they will. They will instead spend through the multi-billion dollar surplus that I have left you, they will spend through every penny of revenue, including what clearly looks like a windfall, and then they'll spend money they don't have. But you can stop that — you have the power to do it, I did it every year for eight years. You'd better set them straight early, or else you're going to wind up in desperate trouble.&quot; Well, he has.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Pete Wilson left the state with a SURPLUS in the billions of dollars. And this is AFTER the disaster that was Governor George Deukmeijian....<br>
<br>
It's funny how here in California you never hear the same people that are STILL complaining about GWB's tax refund go off on Davis for squandering the state surplus. <br>
<br>
Then again, I wonder how many of those people are in the 9.3% tax bracket here in CA. <br>

<br>
Ultimately, it's the Governor's responsibility to sign or veto the bills regarding state spending and the budget sent to him by the legislature.<br>
<br>
I think the point Pete Wilson was making was that Gray Davis did not keep the legislature in check. <br>
<br>
As far as I am aware (it's been a LONG time since I had any classes regarding the way California is governed) the only thing the Governor doesn't have that kind of control (veto/table veto power) over are the Referendums put on the ballot by public petition, and the things that go up for public vote like Referendums usually have some statements of research done by the State Controller (iirc) regarding the potential fiscal impact of said Referendums. <br>

<br>
But increasing taxes is a lightning rod it seems. I'm sure Davis feels like he was in a catch 22 situation. But George Bush I showed that worse thing a politician can do is nothing.....which is what Davis did. /shrug Now he's paying. <br>
<br>
Ahhhnold will split the GOP and hand the election to the opposition. No big deal imho...whoever wins will have to DO SOMETHING about the shortfall.
