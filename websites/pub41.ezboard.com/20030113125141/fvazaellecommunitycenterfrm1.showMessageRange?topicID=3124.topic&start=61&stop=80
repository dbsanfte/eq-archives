I'm impressed that VI was able to create encounters where CH isn't used in the same old way. Encounters where everyone has a more active role. Mobs that require teamwork and skill to take down. I'm glad that people like Ammelen and Baldrik can enjoy encounters where the guild with better tactics/skills can kill a mob, where a guild with just more members cannot.<br>

Can you think of any other spell that starts off at roughly a 4-to-1 effect-to-mana ratio (1600 hp for 400 mana) and becomes a 25-to-1 ratio (10000 hps for 400 mana) at the end? That is why I think CH is flawed. Any DDs that increase in effectiveness at such a scale? Also, since I'm too lazy to find out on my own, pre-manaburn, what was the most damage that a single nuke could do?<br>

<br>
I personally was one of the people that started up the entire conversation on the FoH board regarding how ridiculously borked CH has become over the years - relatively speaking everything in EQ skillwise, equipment wise, spellwise - is eclipsed by something else in some regard. This is an important part of the game known as CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. (if any of you are currently in college and planning to go into game development remember those words - they're really important, trust me) <br>
<br>
Whereas with a Warrior or a Wizard you will acquire a new weapon or spell or whatever to improve upon your character, the cleric class stays relatively stagnant once CH becomes efficient(around level 50 or so w/ today's equipment) - new buff here and there and better &quot;secondary&quot; heals. <br>
<br>
How would you feel as a Wizard, if Manaburn was a vendor spell that you got at level 39 and cost 400 mana w/ a 10 sec cast time and no recast delay(and fundamentally the same otherwise - damage the same as current so as to overshadow all other spells)?<br>
<br>
That is EXACTLY what CH is to a cleric... it's like Ding! Woohoo, 51, I can scribe Remedy finally so I can spot heal better when I screw up and wait too long to CH... Or wow, a new piece of gear that is 1/10th of a CH upgrade to my old gear. (and yes, I said that exact thing a few times ^_^)<br>
<br>
Is it too late to fix? More than likely... with so much being balanced based on it there would be months of retuning lots of content, doesn't mean they couldn't do blanket changes to mob damage output/mana etc. - In XP and raid situations both, of course - but most likely it would be a financial mistake for VI to do at this point. (Most people fear change, even for the better)<br>
<br>
What CH should have been if they hadn't been lazy when they were coding it in the first place is a spell with a scaling mana cost based on the amount it heals(simplest coding method probably being mana cost based on the level of the target)<br>
<br>
And Pigboy/Haels and anyone else who thinks CH Chains are difficult in the slightest (And I mean to do from the standpoint of an individual cleric, not to figure out the appropriate interval for a mobs damage output and latency - that certainly takes a level of skill to determine), I'd really recommend trying out another class all the cleric class boils down to is timing and efficiency - if you can't handle one of the two fundamentals you're a shitty ass cleric.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for those that can't imagine an EQ w/o CH, imagine all these things that could have existed since they currently can't due to CH trivializing them.<br>
<br>
1. Much Higher AC cap.<br>
Nothing quite like the farce which is monk tanking v. warrior tanking - pretty much the same mitigation and significantly higher avoidance for monks - if only they had a few more HP and some form of a taunt skill they could just scrap the warrior class all together.<br>
<br>
2. Less ridiculous Mob Damage Output.<br>
Sure extended encounters are fun so the HP/AC could stay relatively high(although in some cases, the AC is obviously a &quot;tad&quot; overboard), but where is the fun in being a nonmelee annoying a mob for ONE ROUND and dying. Dying isn't fun - Doing the same thing precisely the same way everytime gets boring. (Catch-22 anyone?)<br>
<br>
Hell, I could prolly think of even more stuff, but I'm growing tired of typing this... so this will draw to a close here... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukassarastilfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kassara Stilfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 8:06:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Honestly, there is no game there.

Course, after you do something over and over again, anything becomes routine.  It took EA 5 shots before we finally killed Aaryonar the first time.  Now he's dropping like Fippy, and yes, it's starting to feel routine.  There's no way around that.  Learn a mob, learn a routine.  If mob dies, routine is successful, repeat next time.<br>
<br>
Whether or not the mob requires a Cheal chain or a spamming of spot heals, when the routine is figured out, that's what you're gonna use.<br>
<br>
This would happen whether or not cheal was in the game.  Once you learn how to beat a mob, once you learn the timing, the resists, the debuffs, the whatevers... it'd become routine.<br>
<br>
Cheal just makes a convienent target.  Perhaps the only *reasonable* argument I've heard is that clerics dont' get heal upgrades.  (1000hp, 2000hp, 3000hp...).  Verant would still make mobs around the spells.  Now that warriors have defensive, VI makes mobs around that.  VI has stated that FD has got abused.  Monks shouldnt' pull.  Yet they've designed encounters that basically require breaking.<br>
<br>
It boils down simply to the fact that players are more clever than any team of designers.  I remember reading an article about the old days of text based muds and one of the main upgrades to one game in it's early days was the addition of an axe as a new weapon.  The playerbase was thrilled, and went out to look for trees to cut down, but none of the designers ever put in a tree.<br>
<br>
Is it our fault it's flawed now?  Or is it Verant's?<br>
<br>
Makes ya wonder...<br>
<br>
Well...makes me wonder at least  (-8<br>

<br>
I'll start off by saying that compared to the top-end gameplay of action oriented games like Quake, nothing in EQ that I've witnessed requires very much skill.  Most of what does currently require traditional gaming skills in EQ is found in PVP play or in EQ's past, when the game was younger and tougher.<br>
<br>
When I say that cheal chains require skill, I'm speaking subjectively within the context of EQ.<br>
<br>
There is not a lot of skill required to merely do a cheal chain.  However, with the chains that I've seen, and the chains that I've been part of, there is a lot of room for an individual to do his/her job well and for the clerics to work off of each other and coordinate as a team.<br>
<br>
I believe that a big difference between a guild who can do mobs with a minimal amount of resources and a guild that needs to zerg is smart, efficient healing.<br>
<br>
Because of the nature of cheal, it does require more timing and thought than any other heal.<br>
<br>
Would SOE do heals differently if they had an opportunity?  Of course.  They would redo countless elements of the game differently.  They never envisioned Cheal as a battle spell and don't like it.  This is true of much of the game such as FD pulling, camps, etc..  The players have really defined EQ gameplay, and I always felt that this pissed the hell out of Brad.<br>
<br>
But, players making use of available tools tools in unconventional ways helps make EQ fun.  If people did everything the way Brad had intended, the game would be very boring.  Tactics are fun, and people not only enjoy coming up with them, but implementing them.<br>
<br>
As for character advancement, well, I liked to use all of my available heal lines.  I always understood that cheal was self-scaling, and was effectively upgraded with each expansion. A more varried top-line heal would not have made the class any more enjoyable, and certainly wouldn't have the epic feel of cheal.  Clerics don't have the advancement enjoyments of other classes, but I think that comes with role specialization in EQ.  Clerics envy Druids for diversity, Druids envy clerics for specialization.  Shrug.<br>
<br>
The balance of the entire game is out of whack.  To blame cheal for that is wrong, to single out cheal is pointless.  Cheal chains weren't necessary and weren't really used until mobs with massive HP's in SOV, and AC obviously was going to be capped in SOV whether players came up with cheal chains or not.  Much of EQ has evolved past its original design documented, and much in EQ has reached caps of some sort at some point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 886<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 8:41:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Tenken,<br>

<br>
Cheal is a single spell, but it is akin to its own spell line.  At level 39, cheal is only going to be healing 800hp or so, in VT it's going to heal for 1-5K.  It's not really a 10K heal, in terms of practical use. If you look at it as its own spell line, I can think of a lot of lines that, if removed, would certainly break EQ -- mez and slow for instance.<br>
<br>
Items and spells are akin to equipment.  Take haste items out of EQ, the game is broken.  You can go on and on with this line of thought.<br>

Ok, although my 1600hp at level 39 is assuming a somewhat twinked warrior's max hp, the average CH on a 39 warrior would be 800 to 1000 if you are playing safe. Your VT example is based on a CH chain healing 1000 if few hits land, to 5000 at worse case (any more and the MT is dead). But in an XP group, at full main assist health, the cleric can basically go /afk, take a smoke, get a drink, etc., come back and use 400 mana to recover 6000hps. At level 60, with top gear, that's maybe 10, 15 percent of the cleric's total mana to heal 80 to 90 percent of the warriors health.<br>
<br>
FD is another ability/spell that's flawed, but if it was removed, it would take much less effort retuning the game than if CH was removed. Defensive, probably easier seeing as it's used mostly on high-end encounters, much less to adjust.<br>
<br>
What I'd like to see is a replacement to CH at level 39 that has a similar cast time and mana cost, but heal a max of 1600hps. Then at level 49, an upgrade with a slightly higher cost, same cast time, but heal for 2400 or so. Then at level 59 you get a modified Complete, with the 10 second cast, but a variable cost based on the level of the person healed, maybe level * 10, minimum 400).<br>

I much preferred the days of the old EXP groups when clerics had to heal frequently. This is a gameplay issue, not a cheal specific issue.  A cleric was very busy in an exp group before the masses got a hold of 45+ AC BP's and such.  Before SOV equipment became common, not many people would consider having a monk/rogue/ranger tank, but they can do it perfectly effectively now.  Back then, you wouldn't want to cheal them actually, because their health went down too fast and it just wasn't mana efficient.<br>
<br>
Cheal isn't more broken or out of whack than the rest of the game at this point.  <br>
<br>
And no, I don't see anything wrong with a self balancing spell.  It's the same as having (generally):<br>
<br>
39 cheal 1 400 800<br>
49 cheal 2 400 1200<br>
55 cheal 3 400 2000<br>
60 cheal 4 400 3000<br>
ancient cheal 400 5000<br>
<br>
Yes, the mana stays the same, but it's the ratio that's important anyway.  I don't think that those ratios are totally out of whack for a spell with a 10 second casting time for a class that is specialized. [edit: especilly when cheal isn't helped by casting time mod items]<br>
<br>
You asked if the removal of any other spell can break the game, and I countered with other abilities that, with their removal, would break the game just as much.  You couldn't do high end encounters without defensive, for instance.  Sure, you could rebalance the game to compensate, and you could do the same for cheal, if the need was there, but it's not, not without a complete game redesign.<br>

What makes cheal great is that the more capable the cleric, the more capable the spell is.  If you have the balls to wait 5 seconds longer, you're more mana efficient, your group is better.  This may not matter in a single group with neo-gimp tanks who have 1300AC, but again, that's all gameplay. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A> at: 8/10/02 11:18:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upigboyph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PigboyPH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1303<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 10:39:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Complete Heal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'd really recommend trying out another class all the cleric class boils down to is timing and efficiency - if you can't handle one of the two fundamentals you're a shitty ass cleric. -Vaclav<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That's basically what I'm talking about when I say Chains are difficult.  Timing isn't even that big of an issue, and counting to 4 isn't even that big (I've heard a lot of people gripe about how some clerics can't seem to get the count to 4 thing down).  The difficult thing in a Cheal Chain is the variables, and how the 3-5 Clerics in the chain react to these variables and how they flow together.<br>
<br>
Shit, I totally agree that if someone can't time a fucking heal in a normal xp group that maybe, just maybe they need a different class, but that wasn't my point when I said Cheal Chains are different.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it would be wierd playing the game w/o Cheal, but as Kassara said, everything becomes routine once you get the encounter down. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221" target="new">Haels~</a> - Uber Gimp Cleric<br>

OK this is true, but the reason this happens is because mobs have no AI to speak of. They dont think and once you kill a mob one way that EXACT same fight will happen the exact same way every time. Give Aary some smarts and allow mobs to alter their fighing styles as they start losing to a routine and a new challange arises at every fight. Of course Aary atm is far too buff to actually make intelligent, CC and PO combined would get wiped out by Aaryonar if he was being played by a human. He would have to be altered.<br>

<br>
Right now for EA in ToV that is true. That whole zone is about fighting single mobs with differing strategies to each, once you know each mob the whole zone is trivial. I would argue though that something like the Grimling war never becomes routine. I would say a Shei fight has alot more of a chance to be a little different each time. The HP fight can be quite different between times you fight it. And why? These are not single mob encounters, once you get more then one mob into the equation the chances of thing being unique and happening different each time increase. I would like to see the primary mobs weakened and alot more guards and such and that brings me to feign death.<br>
<br>
Feign death should be nerfed so that mobs dont lose agro ever until they are all at their spawn point. AKA if you break a spawn and 2 mobs run at ya and you feign the mobs will start back to where they came from. Now if one mob reaches the spawn point while the other is quite a ways away then only the one that has not reached the spawn point will come back and the spawn is broken and therefore trivialised. What should happen is if 2 mobs come and you feign then the mobs will start back to the spawn point. The ONLY way that you should be able to get up is if BOTH mobs are back at the spawn point. If even one mob is still not at the spawn point and you get up then all mobs you had agroed should return. This makes Feign Death truely just a life saving spell and removes it from benig a pulling spell other then to test new areas to see how many mobs are going to come on a pull.<br>
<br>
Mob1<br>
Mob2<br>
<br>
SK casts on mob 1 pissing both off<br>
<br>
Mob 1 and 2 come running<br>
<br>
SK feigns<br>
<br>
Mob 2 walks back towards spawn point<br>
<br>
Mob 2 reaches spawn point<br>
<br>
Mob 1 starts walking back<br>
<br>
SK jumps up and still has mob 1 agro<br>
<br>
Mob1 shouts &quot;Shit! this SK is still alive mob 2, lets kill him!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mob1 and mob 2 are still after SK.<br>
<br>
The only way you would lose the agro is if BOTH mobs were back at the spawn point.<br>
<br>
By doing this to feign death you make it so that multiple mob fights are not so easy to break for a SK or a monk and therefore trivialise content that was meant to be a war. In wars where there are a ton of mobs CH is alot less effective due to the agro caused on mobs that may not be tanked and taunted at that exact moment therefore bringing more thought and thinking back into the fight.<br>

The problems you state I covered in my parenthetical.. yes, figuring out that sort of stuff is mainly an issue that should fall to the brass - leaving it up to too many people to guesstimate the appropriate interval leads to confusion and confusion leads to hesitation, etc. <br>
<br>
I guess knowing when to CH out of the normal sync because of someone lagging can be difficult depending on your tools available - I had a nice little kitchen timer I had velcroed to my monitor to crutch me with that.<br>
<br>
Ceros-<br>
<br>
My standpoint fundamentally comes from affecting people's opinions to mold future concepts, not to effect EQ too much - I still find EQ related properties an interesting read, but the gameplay itself means little to me personally as I no longer play.<br>
<br>
Do you think the effect of CH on EQ has been something that future MMORPG titles should share? My answer to that would be a definite no - unless there is an AI compensation. (For example, in a PVP heavy game it could work, as long as all &quot;teams&quot; had equal availabilty to it - and, erhm, that's technically not AI but it's the only good opponent intelligence I expect to see for at least a decade or so ^_~)<br>

EverQuest has succeeded on a level few games have, but that doesn't mean that the formula itself had flaws in it.<br>

- it is more effective in the hands of a skilled/smart player<br>
- its use in a chain creates a sublevel of teamwork within the over-all teamwork of a raid<br>
- its effectiveness is dynamic, based on the HP of the recipient<br>

I may not want to include complete heal as it was included in EverQuest, but I would certainly try to implement spells of all types that share those characteristics. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A> at: 8/10/02 3:47:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujoseydm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Josey DM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 4:35:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> As a level 59 (wont get to 60, cuz Clerics are too darned boring to play) Cleric, I also agree that Cheal should be removed.  <br>

I'm of a similar thought in your 3 concepts above, but I'd much rather it be an intellectual quality vs the timing game there is with CHeal. (No offense to you with the following ^_^) This falls into the realm of Quakishness(Quakerness? Amishness?) and my Vision(tm) of MMORPG's involves reasonable accessibility to everyone including reaction time based issues. Truthfully though, I don't know how much of the general public feels the same as me in that regard however - I'm usually pretty open-minded before forming an opinion but Quake proved to me 1000 times over that mousing skill is more important than strategy - and anything w/o much strategy tends to hold my attention for very little time.<br>
<br>
Even something basic and simple like a 2-3 sec unconsciousness time pre-death would help account for that somewhat(say around half what the average heal used is).<br>
<br>
So yes, your 3 concepts there are certainly valid, but I think the overall package that CH got in EverQuest is not something which should be repeated in future MMORPG titles. Not how it is... long recast, short range w/ extreme taunt - all sorts of things could change it to something more &quot;balanced&quot;. in my opinion. It's too late to change EQ1 around, but I hope at least some people see the possibilities for the future....<br>

<br>
If I were to develop a game (have toyed with the idea abit) I think I would have a wide array of types of heals that would suit different situations. You talk of that &quot;one&quot; best heal but I would not have it so simple. Wizards have varying nukes which are best used in different situations based on different elements doing the damage. People get injured in different ways in battle and if a game developer really wanted to spend alot of time thinking about that they could come up with a very intriguing roll for the various healing classes. I have not thought much on it, it would take alot of time and some very imaginative people to come up with a truely interesting injury/healing system but it could be done. Think about a person that has been stabbed and is bleeding to death from punctures, or that person that has been slashed across the throat, maybe a person that has their skull crushed by a mace, how about that person that is poisoned, or diseased. There would be varying ways to heal people of what ails them, not just the one cure all spell.<br>
<br>
Thats just my opinion on things though. The lack of distinct healing practices for different injuries and the pressence in EQ of the wonder drug called CH really limits what Verant can do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 892<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/11/02 12:52:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Tropics,<br>
<br>
No, cheal doesn't limit what Verant can do, the design of the game limits what Verant can do.  EQ was not designed to have the depth of injury you crave.  Cheal is completely incidental to this.  More diverse injuries could be added if they really wanted to, and cheal isn't stopping them -- in fact, it could be their path away from cheal dominance in raid situations.<br>
<br>
There are different types of injuries and cures though: poison, disease, curses, stamina loss, and of course typical hp loss.<br>
<br>
There are more diverse heals in EQ too, away from the cures to the above, you have regens and heals over time which are widely used in the game.  Let's not forget necro healing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't see popular mmorpg's giving you the diversity you like, though.  Complicating healing more will not go well with the masses, and really, a wider range of heals would just add tedium in my opinion -- this is why we don't see more variety in EQ.<br>
<br>
Vac,<br>
<br>
FPS gaming requires more than mouse skill.  Dexterity is helpful, but so is quick thinking and on-the-fly strategy.  This was especially true in teamplay FPS gaming like Team Fortress where strategy and teamwork were paramount.  Even mere deathmatches in Quake and other FPS's rely heavily in strategy in the high end gaming scenes -- with a prerequisite of dexterity.<br>
<br>
Strategies are needed and used in EQ, but their value is diminished because information is so quickly disseminated.  If you complicate things, the masses will follow the most effective paths found by only a few.<br>
<br>
We take a lot for granted in EQ.  The way the modern game is played today was not obvious to people right away, but is accepted as such now.  It has evolved dramatically, and as they've slowed the single group gameplay down, the game has become more accessable and much more tedious.  EQ was fun when you were on your toes throughout a night, when mana was low and keeping everyone alive was really tough..  or when you had to make a hard choice on an over-pull and know that someone had to die, and you had to make the choice who.  <br>
<br>
That's gone now, and it sucks.  And no, before someone says that's because of cheal, it's not.  It's because the game has been made easier by countless class, weapon, equipment, spell and skill upgrades, especially through expansion.  However, while they made equipment better in each expansion, they kept the mob difficulty the same, trivializing encounters.  Cheal has been upgraded with equipment, yes, by it's nature, but it's not the cause of the problem, just part of it.  Characters have been upgraded vastly, while mobs have not.  Players know the game better than ever and the AI is mostly unchanged. <br>
<br>
I don't know when mmorpg AI will see significant improvements, simply because of server  constraints.  EQ servers are already powered by server farms.  Increasing AI to that of even something like Half-Life is currently impractical -- servers would need way too much memory, internal bandwidth, processing power to be cost effective.<br>
<br>
In the future, when advanced RTS AI can be implemented on an MMOG scale, then you'll see more interesting encounters.  That's probably 4th gen though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utenkenofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tenken of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 681<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/11/02 4:52:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.hawaii.rr.com/kcsystems/ten/domo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> MMORPG Generations</span><hr size=1> Well, according to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/index.html">Raph Koster</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, Creative Director on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/">Star Wars Galaxies</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, we are in the 3rd generation of MMORPGS.<br>

1st gen: the original MUD and its kin. Item collecting scavenger hunts, text-based, based around gaming systems. Starts around in 1978.<br>
<br>
Some commentators, such as Jessica Mulligan, insert a generation here for the many games that thrived on the pay networks such as GEnie. A lot of these games were significantly distinct from muds.<br>
<br>
2nd gen: social games which allowed player creativity. These kick in slightly in 1985 with Habitat (which was graphical) but really hit in 1989-1992 with MUSHes and MOOs.<br>
<br>
3rd gen: graphical takes on design retreads of 1st gen games. 1995-6 is when these started out in development, and the first out was Meridian 59 in '96. We're still in this generation.<br>
<br>
4th gen: will probably recapitulate the development of player-contributed content, and will focus, I think, on better service, and distributed worlds. You probably have five+ years to wait.<br>

Obviously with every expansion the previous world gets trivialized.  It's simply how these games work.  Normal in Diablo 2 is trivialized when you hit Nightmare.  Now we're posed with the problem of simply adding material.<br>
<br>
This, of course, has it's pros and cons.  You can't really add stuff without making existing stuff trivial, but you can't have a static world either.  Which is worse?<br>
<br>
In my book, having things static.  With new gear, we've been able to have more sporatic groups.  Back in the days of pre-velious Kunark, you'd never consider having a monk tank in a seb group.  You'd need the holy trinity (war/enc/clr), with a shaman, monk and wizard/druid or whatever probably simply because the mobs demanded it.<br>
<br>
Now, though, we can diversify more.  Have classes tank that normally couldn't.  Not rely on finding those elusive chanters free for a group cause every dungeon xp group required one.  Is this a bad thing?  Depends on personal perspective.  I'd say no.  It lets people group more in dangerous places with non-standard groups with a reasonable chance of survival.  Sure, it cuts down on the adrenaline rushes, but maybe that's because you're not finding the right places to fight in.<br>
<br>
There's only so many things you can give an NPC before you have to just give up and throw more AC/HP/SV on it, that's hardware limitations.<br>
<br>
And another point, you can't really overhaul the entire world with every release.  When PoP comes out, VI can't really say &quot;Well, now we've really trivialized Trakanon, let's give him 100khp, rampage, balance and a mana drain&quot;.  But they can't really go &quot;Hmm...let's make the Tribunal unbeatable so it won't be a trivial fight until the next expansion&quot; either.<br>
<br>
Sure, it's always fun to think about the good old days, but there's no way to go back.  All you can do now is try to find new spots to relive them.<br>
