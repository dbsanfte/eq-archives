Everybody else seems to go through a few characters before finding the one that's right for them.  Me and Thorokin was love at first sight, though.  Being a halfling warrior just suits me... I've tried other classes and other races, but nothing else feels right (although my rangerling is pretty damned thx).<br>

When EQ first went live, I wanted to be a necro, and I made a DE.  Well being a complete newbie to EQ, this was a rather steep learning curve and I quickly got discouraged with him and decided to try a mage since I always saw them doing well and thought their pets looked cool.  I played a gnome mage for quite a while and enjoyed it for the most part but got bored after a few hours on him at a time.  I decided I was ready for a bit more of a chalenge but didnt want to be KOS yet, so I made a gnome chanter which was also fun for a while and I enjoyed being able to go just about anywhere with illusions, and I spent a lot of time doign miscellaneous quests like the stein of mogguk.  Then Kunark came out.  I wanted to be try an Iksar, and they could be neither mages nor enchanters, and I was already hooked on having a pet, so I decided to have a go at trying a necro again.  This time, I knew more about the game and general playing and leveling strategies, so it was not a painful experience to start with (gettign used to beign KOS everwhere did take some time tho).  At the same time I made Jabartik on nameless, I also made Zeludrax there as a shaman because I was always impressed by all that the things shamans in the guild I was in at the time could do and wanted to try one.<br>
<br>
When vazaelle went live, I decided to remake both my necro and shaman here.  Since then, I also remade my mage and enchanter, and my newest creation is my Gnome SK.<br>
<br>
I made him becasue, I like gnomes and I hav'nt realy givin a mele class a fair try before, and I've got a week to kill during spring break here.  So far hes a fun lil bundle of evil to play, but my shaman is still my favorite character.<br>

Oh, let's not forget that with kids the fact that I could fd and walk away at any time was a definite plus. And the solo skills of a monk fit well with my limited playing time (if I could only be on an hour, at least I could get some xp...not be LFG the whole time).<br>

I specifically chose a barb war because it's the strongest &quot;good&quot; race available, had an innate CR boost which would be useful later on for raids, slam ability comes in very very handy for interrupting spells (up until 55 when kick will do that), and they just look cooler than all the other human based races. <p><table><tr><td>

<br>
5 druids<br>
1 warrior<br>
1 ranger<br>
2 necro's<br>
2 shadowknights<br>
1 mage<br>
<br>
Started my first druid on bertloxxous Pre dot/kite nerf (long time ago)<br>
<br>
after playing numerous classes I tried out a warrior on TP. Leveled it up and was like bleh hitting attack and pressing kick gets kinda old. <br>
<br>
So when vaz popped a few of us decided to call this home and I made yet another druid. Took em to 22 and said no more of this, tired of playing the same ole class.<br>
<br>
So after that I made the SK and fell in love....... till 51<br>
Just think they are shit when it coms to their upper spells and such. Like trops said, a shadowknight should be way more then what VI makes them.<br>
<br>
Always loved my necro's, just fun imo<br>
<br>
tryin ranger now. Duel wield/spells/bow/tracking<br>
 <br>
its fun but who knows <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueqjetx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ JetX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://eqscreenshot.homestead.com/files/icon57.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1199<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 12:36:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cderekrun//MOVIETHANG.gif Height=200 Width=105></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> God Fiido like hit it on the spot too lol. My friends and I were all druids on lanys but when vaz opened we were all going to make certain classes. One friend of mine was going to do Warrior/Druid, his friend was going to be  the enchanter (he never got past lvl 20), my friend was going to be the cleric, and I remember Lweas aka Soliid telling me that Soul Assassins (Conquest) needed rogues and I was messing with a bunch of rogue alts on lanys so I took that role on vazaelle. Plus dat whole assassin/ninja thang ;p<br>
<br>
Of course the only one of us left on vaz is the cleric and I would say hes doing quite well ;p. /wave Ryoko <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udecktriplakado.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DeckTriplakado</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 1:45:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2202.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So why did you pick your class?</span><hr size=1> I made a monk for a few reasons, one was image. I'm a fan of the martial arts/eastern type class in rpg's, they're fun. I like /disc voiddancing or /disc whirlwinding and imagineing the matrix fight music playing and dodging and riposting blows like mad, its sort of a running joke me and my RL eq friends have had going <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Another reason was one of my best RL friends was a monk on innoruuk who I hung out with all the time with my main at the time, a druid who is now on this server. We had a lot of good times together and I always admired his pulling and how much fun it seemed he had. This is also where I got my surname, he was Parth Triplakado <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Thirdly I wanted to have an exciting/important role at the raiding end of the game. I wanted to be the one out doing the work and bringing the mobs to the raid, I wanted a challenge. It's been a lot of fun in raids and out so far, glad I made the choice.<br>
