There's been so much talk and unfortunately I haven't been the one doing any of it. So, I'm going to talk now, and it would be nice if the haters, doubters, and straight up newbies looked really close to what I'm about to say because I'm going to try and address all the questions, and assumptions right now. Sorry if i get all &quot;teacher on you&quot; I know some of you don't need nagafen and Vox fights explained to you and I really don't feel like doing it, but if I don't some dribbling watermelon head momo is going to be like &quot;nah-ah them dragz claw for 7 gabillion damage and ae nuclear waste&quot;. So stick with me if you can.<br>
<br>
Overestimation &amp; underestimation is the reason for all this. You over estimate these dragons and you underestimate me. But you know what the common element is? Estimation, which is all you dumb fucks do, estimate. Try calculating for once and you'll be surprised at the results. I didn't use ballpark figues and hunches to do my shit, I took some numbers and added, subtracted, divided and TIMEZD them to see what I needed to do this. Then I looked through some items, checked stacking issues on Lucy, found out what target type shit is etc etc...something half of you were too lazy or slow to do.<br>
<br>
First off, those screenshots, you know the one's of Tecknoe in front of the dragons that are dead because he beat them up? Those were taken in fullscreen and the /w of Teck being the only one in the zone was on a different screenshot and cut and pasted onto the fullscreen ones. I can't belive I need to explain this shit /sigh. Some dumb bastards were like, &quot;That's a window that's been shrunk to hide other text!&quot; You should be sentenced to chew on glass for the rest of your life for being so dumb in such a public format.<br>
<br>
There was issues of the location of th dragon's corpses, these dragons not unlike pretty much everything else in EverQuest runs at 10%, Teck's dps i impressive for his level but he doesn't kill THAT fast, when the dragons run they can get some distance. Lady Vox tries to run out her door, but she's too fat cuz she sits home watching Ricki Lake and eating frozen Barbarian men and gets no exercise. So she, to nobody' surprise, has stupid pathing that makes her get stuck on those rocks and sometimes you can't even hit her, you just hve to wait for her to warp back to bind spot, sometimes she regens a few % of hps whatever, then kill her as she continues to try and run away. Nagafen used to just try and run out his door but again, he's too fat, so you just rape him from behind as he tries to run away not unlike what the Magus Rokyl does to him those late nights where nobody else is in solb. I forget exactly when this change occoured but I'll assume it was with the pathing changes: Go in Naggy's lair and look at his door, to the left you will see a tunnel in the lava that eventually leads to the draw-bridge area. He tries to run down that, so the location of his corpse might look odd to anyone that has never seen him do that. And for all you really dumb people, Teck wasn't standing on lava, he was using levitation. Like I said I use a druid and warrior to clear ever giant but 1, and I loged the druid in after to port out Tecknoe and I casted Levi on him so I could get a screenshot where Tecknoe isn't being melted to death, there's just no way to look badass being fried in lava going, &quot;yulp, gah, gah, yulp, burp!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So how did you do this?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The popular question from my friends, some guildees, random ppl on my server and even more random crossserver tells, and let us not forget the legion of 'no-thinkers' and flat out 'HOAX' callers. But you know what? When people asked me, I told them! I have nothing to hide. <br>
<br>
First of all, if you suggested EQ-Emu, you are wrong. Secondly, if you suggested EQ-Emu go drown yourself in a bathtub. Also, if you suggested/think that I was the last person in a raid full of people to leave the zone and made this big clever joke, you probably quad-kite Cobalt Scar with dreams of the big life. Because that's the most newbie shit I ever heard. I know you've probably thought of it before, or maybe you've even taken pictures next to Trakanon's corpse by yourself to make the illusion that you soloed him, put it as your wallpaper and showed all your buddies how clever you are. In all honesty, do you really think I'd go through the trouble to make sucha big deal out of such a simple joke/hoax? Anyway, you get the point.~<br>
<br>
Ok, so I've already said I was buffed by my friends, (kazad, wog, sop, focus, sta, agi, po9, poseasons, vog, god, ds(s)). i was the only person in Perma or Solb when I killed the dragons. Now there's three ways I use to keep myself alive during a fight like this (not including FD), I heard some guy saying, &quot;He said he didn't have anyway to heal himself.&quot; I never said that. 1. Which pretty is obvious, Stinging Wort potions. Alot of people who assumed I used these ptoions claimed I had 3-8 bags full of 10 charges, some even said I had 200 of them, they said I would need to click it every 2 hits from the dragons. No, I used about 5, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>10 charge potions</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The other 2 items and I can't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>belive</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> nobody on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thread even suggested them, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>especially</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> since Nagafen drops them both, Bladestopper and Prayers of Life. For God's sake people, I'm looking to buy Prayers of Life in the Baz section of this board, take a look around lol! Prayers are a insta 400 point group heal, Bladestopper is a  insta 394 point rune. I used differnt methods on each fight depending on what I had available to me. For instace on Vox fight all I used what Worts and on a naggy fight I used Prayers, Bladestopper and some Worts. Now the most important ingedient, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13186" target="top">a nice twink</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> with good resists! I think in the total of the 4 solo fights I got feared like 6 times. It's easy to resist the AE's. Now this is the part where I get to address the people who say, &quot;Oh you were buffed? That's not solo!&quot; I think it is, but if you really wanna bust my balls over it, I'll go back to PoM for another month and get Tecknoe some magic, fire and cold resist flowers and those will be plenty enough for the AE's. Epic is my haste/insta click (btw they dispell only 1 buff slot, from right to left and only if their breath AE isn't resisted). I could do it with my self/unbuffed hit points and ac easily (gogo Stave of Shielding). Go ahead and doubt this it'll take longer but I'll prove you wrong again. Ok, now is the part where I adress using potions and items to help me out is also not solo: You are an idot, obviously you mean unless I'm totally naked not using any items available to me it doesn't constitute soloing, right? /smack. I disagree.<br>
<br>
This whole thing was never for publicity and shit, I explained this once and here it is again: I posted orginally here because I know some people would be interested. I posted on Graffe's asking a simple question, &quot;Had it been done before?&quot; lastly I posted on Monkly-Business because I know those guys who read and post there are really interested in the capeablilities of monks. To me this was a fun, laugh type thing. It's just neat. I thought people would think it's neat too. And it's not something crazy difficult and it never seemed so to me, just takes a little calculating and thinking and vision, I didn't think I needed to produce all this crazy evidence because I assumed people would figure out how to do it right away. I'm not saying I rock because I did it, anyone can do it, and it would be easier with a Pal or SK twink. This post and it's random insults aren't directed at everyone who doubted me just the people who flat out dismissed it without giving it a second thought. But, I'm sick of hearing people debate about it calling me a liar, figure I'll set the record straight and see what happens.<br>
<br>
<br>
And well that's all there is to it. See how difficult that was? Now enjoy your nerfs. Oh I should probably post these:<br>

First of congrats on having the balls to do this and accomplishing it.  Now in defense of the monks on Monkly Business, unfortunatly most of the monk community is still sore from the nerf to mitigation from some time back.  And do not believe that the &quot;improved monk mitigation&quot; that Sony mentioned in the recent patch history message put the class anywhere near where it should be or was.  Therefore, when monks see a post of this nature, skepticism is possible, but so is fear.  Alot of casual monks got hurt and are afraid of getting hit again.  Most of those don't have your gear at the same level and never will.  Plus some of the guys overthere just are naysayers no matter what.<br>
As for the buffs=help thing, that is bullshit.  Any caster that solos a mob but has KEI isnt doing it solo if that is the case.  And how many solo casters today would do such a thing?<br>
Sorry for the long message and gratz. <p>Tiket Level 63 Monk<br>
