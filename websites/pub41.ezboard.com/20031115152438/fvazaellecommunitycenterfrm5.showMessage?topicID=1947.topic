<br>
This was posted by a shaman on the crucible and I just wanted to see what you all think....<br>
My response is below this post.<br>
<br>
This is not intended to be one of those &quot;walking 7 miles through the snow&quot; posts, so hopefully it will not come off that way. <br>
<br>
To me, the most fun part of the game was levelling my first character to 60. Sure, there is still the raiding stage of the game which does keep me playing, but, in my opinion, nothing can compare to the fun of the lower stages of the game. <br>
<br>
Lately, however, Sony has dumbed down EQ's leveling system so much that people can now blow through this stage of the game entirely. The introduction of KEI was a major factor in this process, as was the introduction of new zones like Paludal Caverns and basically anywhere in PoP, where people can get experience much, much faster than ever before, with less risk than ever before as well. <br>
<br>
Previously, stuff in everquest was actually scary and challenging; corpse runs are were long and difficult, and getting your experience back was often impossible. As time progressed, however, EQ's challenge magically disappeared- in PoP zones, corpse runs are a thing of the past, and even in older zones getting a corpse summon is usually a breeze. Even finding a rezzer is much easier, now that practically every cleric past 55 has a rez stick. <br>
<br>
Getting from 51-60 took me months of experiencing, and now, with these new zones, you can feasibly do it in 1 month or less, totally skipping over some of the most fun stages of the game. <br>
<br>
Almost nobody bothers with quests anymore until higher levels. I haven't heard of a person trying to create a totemic piece in over a year. These sorts of things were what made the game fun for me, and now they are totally ignored because they are not necessary. <br>
<br>
Now, don't get me wrong, I do realize that this is the nature of this sort of game. As new equipment, skills, and zones are introduced, previous content will obviously become easier to complete. However, with LoY, this will happen like never before. <br>
<br>
First of all, let's look at the new &quot;mini-torpor&quot; that shaman get. This, combined with 4 hour KEI, will make it so the shaman from levels 45-59 literally has unlimited mana, and will make the game SO much easier at those levels. I do believe that they should make the level 60 torpor easier to acquire, but Stoicism is totally unecessary at those levels, and will only make EQ less challenging than it already is. <br>
<br>
New zones for the 45-60 level range- why??? Isn't getting sickeningly accelerated experience at those levels in Planes of Power enough? People are already blowing through these levels extremely rapidly due to the previously mentioned reasons. <br>
<br>
So what is my point in writing all this? To be honest I'm not sure, I know it is too late to change anything, so it is mostly just to vent my frustration with how they are ruining the progression in everquest. Soon, 90% of the people playing this game will be level 60+, and all of the raid content will be even more overly contested than it is currently. And tons of older content will be ignored entirely, simply because these expansions have made it so that there is no reason to bother with it. <br>
<br>
EQ should focus on establishing new ways of progression at the higher end, rather than simply ruining the fun and challenge at the lower end.<br>
<br>

Sorry I agree with the original post and here is why.... <br>
People whined for these changes and now we got em. I made some of my best friends in the game because of the earlier levels. People that get to level 60 and don't know crap about the game dynamics hurts us all. Why do you think people had to spend X amount of time in a lower level dungeon. Learning your class should be a part of the game. It used to mean something to be a level 60 character. This just fuels the player auction market. Easier drops and better gear really messed things up. It was fun racing other guilds to Ragefire, but people complained. It is all about money etc. The only challenge left in this game anymore is trying to find a GM online to answer a petition. WTF happened to camping stuff for items. Hell, I know the new features are nice, but I could have sworn most people chose for old zones to be revamped. No one is going to sit there exploring if there are things like the nexus etc. I understand about time sinks etc. I would have rather seen Verant revamp VT shard camps, rather than change the easier xp and hell levels. If you want to kill your customer base so be it.<br>

<br>
Anyone that had tried the run between Freeport and Qeynos understands how much of an adventure this was... Not to mention the long boat rides between the continents.  Binding at each new town.. stocking up on food and drink, and generally exploring new lands and seeing new people &quot;native&quot; to each fresh province.<br>
<br>
Today, everyone is everywhere from level 5 and beyond.  You find low levels in Plane of Knowledge clicking their way to vast different lands with no experience of the zones or zone interconnections.  They spend time digging through websites and learn the exact level, loot, spawn time and class balance needed for encounters... and stick to a small handful of zones in some sort of progression path of preset nature.  &quot;Newbie to 10, off to Paludal..  Kill in Netherbian, then head for DSP.. blah blah.. Velks, POJ then ...&quot;   They are also doing so with 2x the mana, a plethora of focus items, usually KEI'd, 1.0-&gt;2.0 ratio weapons and almost twice the AC of characters in these same zones a year ago.<br>
<br>
I really dont mind if others lose the experience and mystique enjoyed by so many that played the game for the past couple years.  I do mind that the game is thrusting nothing more but mindless high end exp grinding for more AAss and fairly casino-like high end encounters with little thought or real challenge.  <br>
<br>
The problem is- Sony is a business and no longer wants to appeal to the niche RPG gamers.  We live in an age that releases console and PC RPG games and the number of copies sold isn't too far ahead of the number of &quot;Strategy Guides&quot; (read- total walk through books) sold.  Yes, gamers have evolved into people that dont want to expend the mental energy to actually figure things out on their own.  The mass appeal is to get a 60+ hour game, buy the Walk-Through and follow it step by step to get that level 99 character, 9999 hitpoints, 100 percent secrets, all special items/gear and beat it inside of a weekend by following the guide.  Every time I hear someone say &quot;Game XYZ sucks!  Beat it in 4 hours!&quot; when someone sitting down and playing it WITHOUT cheat codes or a walk-through will easily get a week or two of entertainment from it... it's just silly.<br>
<br>
With EQ, because of it's non-linearity, they have had to build in this same appeal into the gameplay mechanics.  The &quot;Strategy Guide&quot; gamer isnt going to want to go through the effort of having to travel to new zones or explore.  They want to click on an item and be instantly brought to a new zone where the content is trivial and levels their character with the least amount of bother.  <br>
<br>
At the same time, Sony hopes that niche gamers will hang around for the high-end quests and find some amusement in the Boss_Encounter_01, where they add a few more new interesting spells to figure out, double it's hitpoints and make a 5-10 piece &quot;key&quot; quest of timesinks killing tons of trivial content and NO DROP loot collections just to gain access.<br>
<br>
It's a self-defeating process.. and causes serious issues with content delivery.  The content has to be multiplied several hundred times to give the illusion of substance, while providing a fast, easy path to blow through all this content in a hand-held, guided way.   The faster you blow them through the content, the more you have to add to give the illusion of depth.. and EQ is starting down this path.<br>

What KEI? I'm willing to bet he lvl'd without it.<br>
<br>
I was wondering something along the same lines yesterday. I recently started playing the character I first made when I came to Vaz, lvl 27 Ranger. Pretty much every skill I had was maxed. Now I find I can get 4 lvls before I even get a point in forage =x<br>
<br>
Hell lvls used to be there for a reason, ever wonder why they came the lvl after new spells? Its so you learn what each of them do. Now I hit a new spell tier before I've even used half of the spells from the previous spell tier and haven't even maxed my spell skills =x<br>
<br>
It used to be the best mana regen you could get was clarity, lasted something like 20 or so minutes. C2 isn't groupable and not castable on lower than what, 44 or so. Now any noob can spend 150-200pp (or less on a huggies day) and be set for Aego and KEI for like 3-4 hours with EE items and AA.<br>
<br>
Its getting harder and harder to spot the ebay cause the general server populace has become the same. Paladins who are losing agro to a meleeing cleric, clerics using supernal elixir not cheal on the tank in the planes, dmg classes who have no idea wtf agro management is.<br>
<br>
Its a sad state of affairs in EQ. Really I don't care if you only have 8 hours a week to play, if you were playing something like baldurs gate you would take 7 times as long as someone who plays 8 hours a day, 7 days a week. Thats the point of a game, it takes time, you can't put as much as someone else, they would and should progress past you.<br>
<br>
With moderate playing you can have a character in their 50s inside 2 weeks. It used to mean something.<br>

I think Balance has been a prime concern for every expansion. But a player base of a couple of hundred thousand always seems to be smarted than the few dozen designers... and tend to always manage to push a class well beyond their original intent. I do agree that some classes have a much lower saturation level, but all classes can offer enough to make them viable, and if played well every class can be deemed essential.<br>
<br>
As for the Shaman's post. I must agree on his general statement on what direction EQ has been heading. I remember the plow of xp back in Lord/AM/Hand, were every pull was waited with anxiety. And where xp was also rewarded with *treasure*.<br>
<br>
I disagree with how he implies that everyone instantly levels with epic, for very minimal effort. EQ community, like our own community, is growing older on average. The players have generally been around longer and it seems that less new blood is being introduced. basically it is a dieing population.<br>
<br>
Every expansion so far has increased the ease of leveling, not just the last one, it started with Kurnak.<br>
<br>
Quests are still there, but who views them as quests but instead give <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>item x + faction y +item z = item b</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. There are still a lot of quests that are completed, but with the higher level of familarisation that the general populace has, it has now become as exciting as purchasing 5 stacks of Iron Rations.<br>
<br>
The players have always expected WONDERFUL loot from new expansions, and subsequently no minor upgrades will suffice (Sony's priorities is to attract subscribers, not to keep the world a role playing expierence) hence the escalating loot that is now achieving such ridiculous levels. Of course this can be easily countered by making the MoBs more capable, building a need to have much better gear for advancement, but also opening up a near exploitive differential between similar level MoBs from different expansions.<br>
<br>
The majority of players prefer to take the path of least resistance, the easy *good* xp. Velks was never the best XP, yet people decided to stay there for simple convience. When Kurnak came out it was karnors, and getting Sebilis groups started was painful because people weren't familar. Crypt of Decay is one of the best xp zones, yet the swarm stays in Valor.<br>
<br>
Everquest has turned into one giant <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=186166" target="top">Penis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> waving competition.

<br>
It isn't like my 4th level froggy wizard is missing out on something I've never had to struggle with. My first wizard had 105 intelligence(couldn't afford even a FBR) and he got smoked by a lion in WK when I made the mistake of zoning out of Qey Hills at level 7. <br>
<br>
Maye verant knows that the way to keep me playing and keep me challenged is through bigger better encounters\loots for my main(s) and different zones etc for lower level alts\twinks??? <br>
<br>
Maybe I misperceive things such that my assumption that there are NOT that many true VIRGINS to EQ who are misssing the 7 mile walk in the snow that old timers know and love is wrong???  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rascalan>rascalan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/27/03 4:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1947.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> maybe</span><hr size=1> Maybe you are a fucking retard Gonad.....<br>

Maybe for your sorry N00b ass Rasc. The rest of us who play without a hockey helmet on to protect the &quot;softspot&quot; on your head actually are able to find daily challenges in EQ to keep us entertained. <br>
<br>
But Rasc I have a heart for Spec Ed types like you and so I'm gonna make a few suggestions to spice up yer EQ experience: <br>
<br>
1) Go team somewhere dangerous(yes, this will require that you leave Velks or POV  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ) <br>
2) For some help on #1 talk to some real shaman on this server or hell I can refer you to a couple who would give you a tip or two if you agree to carry their piss pale for them a bit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, in summary Rasc...suck it. I fail how to see how any of these changes have made it manifestely easier for me. <br>

<br>
Uhm, half right.  There isnt anyplace in the game that is more dangerous than POV.<br>
<br>
Pickup grouping in POV is absolutely THE most dangerous thing you can do in game.  Chasing the mobs ping-ponging between the enchanter that cast Tash at 100% and the druid that snared it shortly after, then dealing with the 3 adds because the monk doesnt know what FD does, all the while the wizard (who is the only one in group with haste) is piercing away, at which point some random level 62 ranger 'soloing' comes running and dies at your groups feet with three golems over his corpse, and then three undead vassals warp on top of your latest group addition killing him instantly, with the shaman averaging two spot heals per cheal as the cleric is starting cheal at 20 percent tank life (immediately followed by the cleric sitting down)...  It doesnt get any more dangerous.<br>

<br>
People who have no business trying to &quot;one up&quot; the next guy start behaving recklessly. Chanters w/o the right AA start tashing at 100%, rangers trying to one up monks by &quot;keeping the camp full of mobs,&quot;  and monks with porn on the second box fail to keep their eyes out for adds end up hosing the day for the whole group. <br>
<br>
Although in defense of some of these people, SOMETIMES the mindfuckingly boring nature of your average POV exp grind can dull the sense of even the best. The root of this is AA's of course. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think AA's were devised as the ultimate tool of the debil that is Verant.

This is titled to gonad the fuckwhore.   In between the changing of your blood stained underwear, please take make note that your existance is at best maybe blood to your head.   Your sorry ass can't get an erection cause if the blood left your head your body would go limp.  Your star burnt out a long time ago, yet we just still see the reflections of useless ass shit you post.  Main point to your coming here preaching your gayness in the name of what?<br>
Is there a point to your slingblade ass?  We know you like them taters mother fucker now move along. <br>
<br>
I know this is like a lost cause telling you that you are an idiot, as you probably see yourself as einstein.  Let me give you a secret.   If your sonor beacon is sending out singles and nothing comes back you are probably lost. I know you and your scount master must have gone over this countless times.   Taking you out in the woods getting you lost and using his erect dick as your compass.  <br>
<br>
You don't know shit about EQ and it is obvious as you try to figure night after night how to get past the character select screen.   Fuck I am just hoping you are making better strides in RL than you are in game.   They don't drop intelligence in RL, maybe you can multiquest it with someone.  Please don't come here and try to debate my effectiveness in game.   You have never seen me in game unless in may have been in the bazaar arena.   Even then at best you would just see LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br>
Next time you want to come here and talk about time in game post something that is actually game related.  Stop taking hits off your crap stained underwear fucktard.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daerv>Daerv</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 356<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 7:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1947.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: let the games begin</span><hr size=1> I'd just like to say I agree with all and none of the above. I liked the idea of working for what you get but I also like the idea of not having to make so much effort to achieve my goals because I do play this game for fun and it can easily get monotonous.<br>
<br>
The more dangerous the things we do the more fun it generally is. However this is dependent on the people you playing with being vaguely competent. There's very little more rewarding than conquering a seemingly hopeless situation because everyone got their shit together when it was needed most and you won through.<br>
<br>
My main problem with xp groups is silence. No buggers communicate anymore. I like banter in groups as it keeps it feeling more like I'm not playing with a bunch of robots. If talking as well as doing your job is too much for these people then something is wrong (unless they are a bard). But most people just want to sit down, stfu and plow xp. So damn clinical and unpleasant.<br>
<br>
So anyway if anyone wants to do anything hideously dangerous for fun let me know. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28162" target="top">Daerv Heroe</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=truthreason>TruthReason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm actually Goanad.</span><br>  Posts: 735<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 12:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1947.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: let the games begin</span><hr size=1> Rasc will suck a dick for ya np. <br>
