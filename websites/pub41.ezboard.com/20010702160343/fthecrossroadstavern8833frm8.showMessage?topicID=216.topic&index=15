The risks involved are usually lesser, they are abundant, and drop MUCH better loot on the average than the AI. What rewards are there for following the straight and narrow path? Other than being able to do good aligned quests and go into town without fear, there are hardly any.<br>
<br>
This is why looting shouldn't be allowed in PK.  PK should be about just that... the fight against another player.  Not about stripping that player of their belongings.  Additionally, this is why guild type entities need to be restricted along certain lines in regards to who can join.  You want to split up the PKers.  And you must have a system that encourages people to support others like themselves.  Only then can you enforce the most basic of morals... the idea of I won't do this because I'll be punished for it. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;My suggestion would be one that would truly prove the ability of the player. I would place NO restrictins on PvP at all...BUT, the god of life would turn his back on evil players after a certain point. Once you have done enough evil to reach this point you would be subject to permanent death, or at minimum a MUCH steeper death penalty. While you could atone for your past crimes and regain his favor, this would be VERY difficult to do. The reward for being good would be a far lesser fear of death.<br>
<br>
Very bad idea.  Killing the random people isn't that much fun.  That's just what a few social rejects do.  The fun is in facing your equals.  A system such as you propose makes PK unviable.  There shouldn't be a need for a steeper penalty.  And while there should be a penalty for dieing (the severity of which should depend upon the ease of advancement), it should apply equally to any type of death.  Trust me in this, there are rewards for being good already.<br>
<br>
In a situation where guilds/classes/races support each other and form a basic civilization, random PKers aren't tolerated.  They hurt the reputation of your class/guild/race.  And as such, they are often hunted down most intently by their very own race/class/guild (of course, this requires a system where you can force someone into retirement by killing them).  Such a society will allow PKing in only certain circumstances, be it raids, wars, whatever.  And when such a raid occurs, those that are the known PKers are the first target.  Defenders know who the threats are.  They know who they like and dislike.  And those two factors will determine who defenders (or the raiders) target.  Yah, an innocent caught on the battlefield will probably die quickly.  But they die a lot less then those who constantly battle, as the innocent rarely are caught on the battlefield.  A further downside to being a known PKer is the player economy.  An elf raiding orc, for instance, is a lot less likely to get aid/enchantments from an elven sorcerer.  Of course, that same orc might get help from dark elves just because the regular elves hate him.  But in general, it reduces opportunities more than it expands.<br>
<br>
Anyway, from my viewpoint any system that strives to massively punish those who PK is a failure.  It might as well not have PK.  But if you are going to have PK, the players should be regulating it.  And if your game doesn't provide the means to do that (this is where UO failed), then it shouldn't have PK, as it was just thrown in as an afterthought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=201.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=224.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.emailToFriend?topicID=216.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.threadControl?topicID=216.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=216.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=216.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">The Inferno<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Moderators Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F4CC10>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#F4CC10> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8>The Tavern</a> <font color=#F4CC10> - </font><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/">Zebu's Zanadu!</a><font color=#F4CC10> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.2.2 b6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
