Hmm, ok, why are there no European countries in the axis of evil if all of them use the euro now?<br>
<br>
&quot;Other Opec countries are considering it, especially in light of the crumbling american economy and the devastating corruption in corporate america.&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm, the American economy isn't crumbling.  It's called a recession.  There are natural cycles to the economy.  You can't realistically expect bull markets 100 percent of the time.  It really isn't that bad though.<br>
<br>
&quot;The only thing worth trading nowadays is oil. If nobody needs dollars the US can no longer print free, courtesy of the federal reserve...a non US Government corporation, all the dollars it needs to run its massive deficit.&quot;<br>
<br>
OK, this is just wrong.  Saying this shows a complete lack of understanding of how the economy works.  The federal government does NOT print the money to pay the interest on the national debt.  This would cause absolutely massive inflation.  You would be buying candy bars with wheelbarrows full of ben franklins.  The interest on the national debt is funded by the taxpayers.<br>
<br>
If this were the case the US wouldn't even have a national debt, they'd just print money to buy what they wanted.   However, you can't do this or the value of the dollar drops.  The currency becomes unstable and devalues.  No one will put their money in dollars because of fear that it will become worthless.  Hail, Weimar Republic in the 1930's.<br>
<br>
One of the main reasons that the dollar is still considered the safest place to put your money is that the US has responsible fiscal policy and controls inflation.<br>

<br>
There's lots of reasons to take military actions in any part of the world, but should that fact cloud your mind and totally dismiss the possibility that involvement in the middle east isn't primarily about oil and all it's ramifications?  Just because the US has taken action without oil in mind doesn't mean it can't take action with oil interests in mind.<br>
<br>
I agree with Herder indirectly.  I think the reason we weren't so steadfastly stomping around the world taking a more active military role in our foreign oil interests is because our economy--moreover the dollar--wasn't being so heavily rivaled.  With world oil production heading downhill, more dependance on middle east oil looming in the future, and the fact that Iraq's oil is handled in euros now.. if sanctions were lifted it would further jeopardize the US economy; as one of the world's largest oil reserves would be pumping out massive amounts of oil unimpeded and not in our currency.<br>
<br>
Lets ignore that Iraq's oil is traded in euros, lets ignore the US economy is heading downhill, lets ignore the euro is now worth more than the dollar, and lets ignore that Iraq RECENTLY switched to euro exchange.  Now, after 12 years, we're invading on the basis of chemical weapons and human rights?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How fucking convenient</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
I don't want to downplay human rights and global security because I think it's definitely worth fighting for and was a major factor in going to war.  However, our world's veins flow with oil, if that oil starts being traded in abundance with any other currency than the dollar and that results in sad times for America.  OPEC could switch currencies if they wanted to, they'd even make more profit, but they don't.  I feel the US is using military might to ensure future control of the oil market in order to remain <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> economic superpower.  I'm not a big economy buff, but the euro pretty much matches the dollar in investments doesn't it?  And if that's true, just about the only thing going for the dollar is its near-monopoly of the oil market.  I wonder if Iraq will still use the euro for its oil exchanges now? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dunnodoncare>Dunnodoncare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/12/03 1:25:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok</span><hr size=1> The plan to invade Iraq and even to create an excuse to invade was put forward by Cheney and Wolfowitz back when the first Bush was president.

<br>
It's really not such a big issue to us financially which currency Iraq decides to trade its oil in.  If they pick euros, that can be good or bad for us, depending on the strength of the dollar.  People trading oil in euros has no impact on the desirability of the dollar for investments really.  The primary concern is inflation control and responsible fiscal policy.  So long as the US isn't going nuts printing money, which it doesn't, the dollar will remain the most stable and inflation resistant currency.  People just want to be sure the currency they put their money in will hold its value.<br>
<br>
The financial impacts of what currency Iraq trades its oil in are not anywhere near severe enough to justify a war.  They're actually quite minor.<br>

A few points, why did the US not go in sooner if this was an issue? If the regime was so bad, and the US knew about it, and the evidence was all concrete, the nation would have already been liberated.<br>
Saudi Arabia, a country with human rights issues FAR worse than Iraq has, isnt even considered a target for liberation. Why? Why liberate a country that thinks women are filth, chops off your hands for stealing, rips out your tongue for speaking out against the government, is the number ONE harborer of terrorists, has PUBLIC stonings, and so on?<br>
Turkey, has killed around 35-40,000 Kurds. Wheres the liberation? Wheres the human rights issues there?<br>
Oil~ I agree with Brack on the subject. Money is what makes this world go around now. Oil, will keep America in its current status in the world (for now).<br>
And Ive never said everything in the world is about OIL, or everything that has happened (the civil war was about oil, didnt you know?) is about it. In this circumstance, it fits. Human rights in this circumstance, is an inconsistant reason.<br>
As for the thread topic, the way I see it, invading Syria and Iran would be for Israeli security. The possible threat of being invaded and subjugated, for the most part, would be gone with Democracies in place. Oil fields secure, economy gets a little better, and Israel loses alot of tension in the region. I could be wrong, but this is the way I see it.<br>

On Tim Russert's show last night a MiddleEast guest pointed out that Iraqi oil is a &quot;Swing Supply&quot;. Having control of Iraqi oil wells gives control over the oil market prices. Iraqi oil production can ultimately control world oil prices.<br>
<br>
I haven't researched this yet, But after seeing OPEC's reaction to having the Iraqi wells pumping again is interesting. They are complaining that production from Iraq will cause the 2 million gal/day surplus to grow and drive oil prices down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 700<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/13/03 3:02:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Human rights</span><hr size=1> Iraq certainly has enough oil that its production has the power to influence world prices.

Some think it will, some think it won't, but they all seem to be universally concerned about deflation.  It's possible that if OPEC switched to euros and such it could further threaten a deflation, it's also possible that nothing at all could happen and we could actually gain from it.<br>
<br>
From what I was reading there just seems to be a grey area and a lot of speculation on these points, nothing concrete.  What I do know though, is that directly influencing (taking over Iraq) and showing that we're willing to carry out our economic interests militarily pretty much resolves any economic uncertainties in the oil trade.<br>

I'm sure Ammelen could clear up any holes in my research--however unthorough it may be--since he has a sound knowledge of the game.

     1)WE ARE NOT IN IRAQ RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF OIL.  So stop repeating it because it makes you look ignorant.  In actuallity any profit made from the oil in Iraq right now is being put into a trust for the Iraqi people so they can rebuild their government and reconstruct their cities.  This is a fact you can research it anywhere.<br>
      2) SADDAM DOES IN FACT HAVE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.  Not only has he admitted it to the U.N. who has the list of what agents he has and the amounts (that he has been willing to admit to atleast) but we have found barrels of the stuff all over Iraq in hospitals and even schools.  So next time one of your all knowing friends says &quot;Prove he has chemical weapons!&quot; you can say he admitted to having them and you can be the bright one.  Also, last week we found an Iraqi military &quot;radar truck&quot; that was actually a bogus unit with false panels where the electronics should have been and chemical canisters were stored there.<br>
       And for all you hippies that think we should have just left Iraq alone I wish you to be the first people to get hit with a dose of Sarin so maybe you can see that leaving maniacal dictators with chemical weapons alone isn't the best way of dealing with a threat.  You guys are just lucky that the U.S. doesn't believe in using civilians as shields.  <br>

I agree it seems pointless to search for ulterior motives of this war when the obvious motives are so justified (human rights, global security).. but the correlations I draw from my own research are just too vivid for me to ignore them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerai>Kerai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Teh Anti-American</span><br>  Posts: 4334<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/13/03 7:46:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.sowned.com/bleh/kerai2.gif height=77 width=69></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Human rights</span><hr size=1> Yeah, the US is there solely to save the iraqi people...yeah right.<br>
<br>
The US is there to protect their own interests. Lots of people out there don't like the US cause the US has a way of backstabbing people (Saddam is the nice easy one) and their foreign relations are...well...lacking.<br>
<br>
As Brack was saying, its in the US's best interest to stabilize economies that have an effect on the US's. Oil from any country has an effect, a coutry like Iraq which has a huge supply of oil can have a huge effect.<br>
<br>
They are also there to make sure Saddam never threatens them.<br>
<br>
Sure he's a bad guy and he terrorizes his nation, but lets face it, he's been doing that for 12 years. The US doesn't much care for the Iraqi people, they care for themselves. And really, thats how the world works. You don't get far in business by being a nice guy. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477296">Kerai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
This argument isn't valid.  You claim that it cannot be that we are liberating the iraqi people because he is a tyrant because he has been doing that for 12 years.  Instead, we must be doing it for oil...  So they just recently got oil?  They have had oil for much more than 12 years too.  They have also had chemical weapons for more than 12 years.  Your argument is completely invalid logically.<br>
<br>
I agree completely that a substantial part of the reason we are there is to protect our own interests.  It's not oil though, it's concern over terrorism and WMD's.<br>
<br>
Also Kerai, if you take a look around, you'll realize that most of the Iraqis are pretty happy to be free of Saddam.  They are a bit mistrustful of the Americans at this point and some fear an occupation, but they are in a wait and see mode and hoping for the best.  I think the Americans will be very popular in Iraq in a year when the Iraqis realize we are leaving their country in their hands and are not their to occupy/colonize.  We'll have to wait and see on this though.<br>

With 9/11 the majority of Americans are angry at the rest of the world and afraid it might happen again. Basically this gives the government the go ahead that any nation that could pose a threat or might have something to do with Terrorism (tm) are gonna get the beat down.<br>
<br>
Adding to America's economy is a pretty good bonus for it.<br>
<br>
The Humanitarian reason is a nice spin and makes you look good, but really, it isn't your primary reason and saying it is just lulls over the stupid people.

I really think Iraq is a staging point, a strategic location to launch a major sphere of influential American policy and enforcing those policies.<br>
<br>
I don't think anybody really buys that we're there to liberate Iraqi's as the primary goal.. I mean if that were the case why the fuck aren't we in Saudia Arabia?  It's still an awesome perk to the war though.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I could convince myself that this war is just primarily about eliminating a terrorist supporting-WMD possessing regime.  Terrorist attacks could end up costing the US billions and billions and billions of dollars not just on our own land, but the world abroad; not to mention potentially catastrophic loss of life.  But the administration has to know that launching an attack on Iraq would only highten the terrorist threat, so why do it?  I think this is easily justified by the &quot;darker before dawn&quot; scenario--terrorism won't solve itself and it's obvious something needs to be done.  The conspiracy theorist in me just can't settle for this alone though; I need more elaborate plots to suit my tastes~<br>
<br>
It's clear this is a war that needed to be fought for many reasons, I just wonder what sealed the deal.  What is the ultimate primary objective? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barakandejust>BarakanDeJust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/03 3:26:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it me or is this a fucking joke?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think the Americans will be very popular in Iraq in a year when the Iraqis realize we are leaving their country in their hands and are not their to occupy/colonize.

<br>
People have a great tendancy to oversimplify causation.  We are there for quite a few different reasons that all came together in the minds of our leaders to move us to war.  I believe oil is an insignificant part of it.  However, it's certainly not just 1 reason that drove us to war.  It's liberation of the Iraqi people, punishment of Saddam for invading Kuwait, Saddam's continued defiance of the UN, his development of WMD's, his links to terrorist organizations, 9/11 and the general backlash that created, a more hawkish policy of the new administration that all came together to bring us to war.  Anyone that says &quot;We are in the middle east for one reason,and one reason only, ... &quot; is full of crap.  Take an advanced history course sometime, and every single historical event that you seek to explain will be explained with 20 different reasons as contributing factors.  Things are never so simple as to have 1 reason.<br>

Just because it isn't 100% about oil, does not mean that it is not at all about oil.  There are dozens of reasons to invade iraq, here let me brainstorm some for you:<br>
<br>
-They possibly have WMD, and will possibly distribute them to 3rd parties inimical to us.<br>
<br>
-They are in violation of various UN sanctions<br>
<br>
-They possess vast oil wealth that will make select companies alot of money, or if you live in happy land you still have to admit we will be out of oil by like 2030 even if you dont have people who like to burn oil wells in charge of it.<br>
<br>
-He's a dictator with a very poor human rights record, easy to propagandize the war, or for the happy people, &quot;we must protect human rights!&quot;<br>
<br>
-We have alot of new military theories and technologies that need testing.  Just look at how divided the pentagon was about how to run the war, its obvious this was a test run for new doctrine<br>
<br>
-Political concerns.  Keep the focus off our peice of shit economy and on external &quot;threats&quot;  provides a distraction for shit like repealing sunshine on patriot 1, implementing patriot 2, ect<br>
<br>
-Trial run of new american century doctrine.  hopefully they can see that its not going to fly on the world stage now (ya right :/)<br>
<br>
-possibly currency issues<br>
<br>
-of all threatening nations, they are obviously by far the weakest, their army was beaten 10 years ago and sanctions have crippled them since, perfect test case for new doctrines, military and political <br>
<br>
- hell embedded reporting and the advent of reality tv war (with every bit as much spin as other forms of reality tv) alone was worth a test war<br>
<br>
-oh ya, &quot;free the iraqi people&quot;.  laff<br>
<br>
I guess we can include 2 of ammelens reasons, though they repulse me<br>
<br>
-punative war, whatever the fuck that means<br>
<br>
-9/11 backlash wow we are mad so we gotta lash out, man! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=26.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=26.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=26.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=26.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=26.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=26.topic&start=121&stop=132>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showPrevMessage?topicID=26.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showNextMessage?topicID=26.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.threadControl?topicID=26.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm28">Legacy of Ykesha<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm27">Artistic Endeavors<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm30">The Real World<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30>The Real World</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
