<br>
I, as well as others have wives, kids, jobs etc. that place a commitment on our time. The only way I'm able to enjoy the big raids is by planning them around my real life schedule. This means that I am not able to attend all the raids but can pick a few that don't interfere with my responsibilities. <br>
<br>
I fail to see how this is f'ing lame as you put it. Maybe you feel that I shouldn't have the right to hunt these areas? Or maybe you feel we should all rush to a zone to take it before someone else does.<br>
<br>
I'm not advocating booking the plane when you can't possibly put enough peeps together as in your 7am example. Nor do I advocate taking several days in a row. This was all discussed in earlier forums. <br>
<br>
If a zone is free and unbooked by all means do it. I agree on working the 12 hour spawn cycle as close as possible to maximise everyones enjoment. But if others wish to coordinate a schedule to work around their lives and/or to facilitate getting enough members to have a raid I can't see why you wouldn't work with them. Just pretend as if they are there already according to your FCFS beliefs and that it is already taken.  I have not seen any one abuse the calendar by booking a plane and then not going and besides if they cancel it's free for FCFS.<br>

But there's sure as hell more than enough crap to go around.

Even *if* the servers hadn't gone down it wouldn't have mattered much since by the time Endless had gotten their butts in gear and up there the first floor would have been nicely broken and ready for a fresh respawn with all the mini bosses intact. They may have had to push their raid back like 2 hours, but frankly is that too much to ask over denying another guild the opportunity to go to a plane entirely?<br>

Anyway, if what Zozz says is true then I find the whole thing pretty fucking silly. <br>

 <br>
As an example my father's(note: before people question my age because of this, keep in mind my parents are senior citizen and retired before you do age assumptions =P) website he owns(mainly maintained by others, I know more HTML than him and you can tell my internet knowledge beyond that is lacking), has a little IP log built into the page by the original designers of the site, no special HTML code I can find anywhere to make it work, just a little log file made in /LOG/XX-XX-XX each day after someone accesses the site. As I said I didn't do the page myself so who knows, but as far as him and I can tell, it's how the server itself automatically handles incoming IP's. Now, this being noted, breaking it down to which portion of the page they go to gets quite annoying in the log file, it tracks the directories a user accesses, but it's all sorted by time first, then by user name, so would take eons to sort and resort it without writing a program to do just that. So maybe it's something along that lines they do, and with say 400 people using the calendars.net, they don't feel like sorting out all the inappropriate IP's to send out their logs, as an example.<br>
<br>
As for how the IP addresses are handed out... once I went into my long in-depth description, I think you see I was closer to the facts than people assumed with my 2 sentence description.

<br>
Personally I've been quite amused by everything I've read (although I must admit I skipped a few posts due to length).  My short and sweet response to all of this is simple:  CC is Euro, Most of other guilds are US.  Obviously there are going to be timing issues on raids due to long respawns in planes.  <br>
<br>
Calendars don't work, never have worked, regardless of what anyone says about being adults.  Hell I don't know if any of you have girlfriends but mine doesn't like to share (nothing I can do will convince her for the threesome) and since every guild clearly as at least one female, this obviously isn't going to happen.  So just work with it (personally not being guilded for a while plane raids for me was / all 50 60 cleric and look for a plane that wasn't occupied).  <br>
<br>
Clearly me and my buddies aren't going to put on calendar -- Non guilded gimp group in Fear --<br>

<br>
I respect your position and your point of view, however it is only one of many.<br>
<br>
Scheduling via a calendar may suit your needs very well, but it does not work for everyone.  Furthermore, it has pitfalls and exploits of its own -- a race to a plane becomes a race to the calendar to schedule it, everyone wants to schedule on friday, saturday and sunday, etc..<br>
<br>
Just as you're a player with a lot of RL responsibilities, there are a lot of players with next to none.  Calendars do not suit their needs, and scheduling adds an uncomfortable sense of clockwork to the game -- adventurers in fantasy literature don't check their watches before killing a dragon after all.  <br>
<br>
In other words, a calendar may help you, but it inhibits others.<br>
<br>
So, you have the situation we have here.  Different types of people with different beliefs, philosophies, desires and needs playing the same game, coexisting in the same world.<br>
<br>
Telling a player or a guild that they have to conform to your views is as wrong as them telling you that you must adapt to theirs -- and that's exactly what most calendar zealots do.<br>
<br>
Who decides what is right?  The guys running the game, Verant.  They do not support calendars.  As far as they're concerned, the first party to a plane or a mobs has rights to it -- application of this general rule does vary GM to GM.<br>
<br>
I'm not against calendars.  I think they can be a useful *tool*.  However, they are not -- and should not be treated as -- the law. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usotae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sotae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/01 5:01:57 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.dencity.com/pactum/sotae.gif HEIGHT="304" WIDTH="141"></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> ok i guess i'll finally make a real reply to all of this...<br>
<br>
what started it is the fact that posts on the calender for SF's PoG raid was deleted twice, and someone else was in the plane when we all started logging on...<br>
<br>
the calender is NOT the law, it never will be. it's a usefull tool to help people from stepping on each others toes.<br>
<br>
you don't have to respect the calender, but you should. CC should especially respect it, and post their intentional raids on the planes, so others can schedule around a Euro plane raid (as i see it, they are usually finishing up around noon CST, which provides for repops starting late evening for us americans).<br>
<br>
single spawn mobs should be 1 of 2 things, FCFS (first come first serve) or rotation... FCFS is usually great for a single guild when the spawn time is in their prime playing, and usually results in pretty much a monopoly of the spawn due to this fact. a rotation spreads the wealth to whole server.<br>
<br>
something everyone needs to remember, there are other people outside your guild that play this game too.<br>
<br>
way back when on the whole nag spawn ganked from PO, i was opposed to it, and i let it be known to my guild leaders that i was very opposed to it, and that if shit didn't change i would leaving... what has SF gangked since ?<br>
<br>
it pisses me off when guilds are all about 'let's screw over this guild for shit they did in the past to us' what utter nonsense! i would never do anything to hinder something another guild wants to do because of something they did to me in the past.<br>
<br>
i still group with CC members and have no problems doing so, it doesn't bother me much... so they got the loot that day and we didn't... so? point? tonight we got a TON of drops, much more than we probably would have the day someone else was there... loot WILL drop, it always does!<br>
<br>
what i do have a problem with is monopolizing rare spawns when others are quite capable of killing the mob as well. i'm sorry, but that's simply being a loot whore, and i don't care much loot whores... i never go around farming shit i don't need and hindering other players advancement in the game.<br>
<br>
maybe my ideals and morals aren't the same as yours. and if they aren't, all i can say is that your very selfish.<br>
<br>
the main, most important, thing is respect... have respect for everyone else in the game, not just your guildies... i personally try my very best to respect everyone on the server. but sometimes that respect is lost due to actions in the game. so be careful of what you do, else you lose the respect of people you don't know at first, then you'll lose the respect of the people you care for.<br>

<br>
<br>
Sotae you are talking about respecting the other guild etc etc... But its SF who stole naggy from PO ( even tho you say its past, your guild still did it and said big mobs were FCFS cuz you were stronger then PO and could take em down faster then them, but now you want big mob to be on rotation cuz your guild cant gather the ppl fast enough to kill them...), your guild was the one ( well, vaclav... ) that accused the leader of another guild to delete post on a calendar that he doesnt even respect and he has no proof... Your guild is the one that told some caster in his guild to kite lodz around when there was another guild in iceclad that was ready to engage him so SF ppl could port in and get the kill, thats simply KS imo, the other guild was about to engage and SF wasnt ready for lodz... Its your guild that want all of us to use calendar but still abuse it by booking PoG for 3 days straigh without letting a chance to other guild to do that plane... And even before that when SF used to be in PoH a lot, they would book it for whole weekend np and not letting anyone else the chance to do it...<br>
<br>
Before you ask for respect, your guild should respect other ppl...<br>
<br>
SF want the whole server to do and think what THEY think we should do and think, they want us to post on their calendar, FCFS mob when they think they can get that mob faster then other guild that try to do him, and want rotation on mob that they cant kill fast enough... Calendar wont work... People will alway abuse it... <br>
<br>
Ive been KSed by member of SF, ive been accused of being an ass becuz i refused to get KSed by SF member... But i never judged SF as a bad guild because of 3-4 of theirs member that have been acting like moron against me... But from what i heard from SF for the past 1-2 weeks really pisses me off... I still like a good couple of ppl in SF ( including you sotae) but stop talking about respect when your guild dont respect other...<br>
<br>
<br>
Btw vaclav, <br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you Kaminya... good to see some guilds taking a reasonable path when others are trying to force<br>
                            the server FFA.<br>
<br>
<br>
We arent trying to force the server to be FFA, server is FFA by default and its the only thing that will ever work... YOU are the one trying to force us to use calendar...<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry if you are a SF member and are insulted by what i said, if you got a problem with it just message me ingame... It isnt directed to everyone in SF, just the ppl that think the whole server should do what SF tell them to do... The server dont wanna use the calendar cuz it lead to abuse... dont tell us we are moron cuz we dont want to use your system...<br>

<br>
kelnok, i dunno about the whole lodi thing... and if you go back to the old rant thread and read my posts there maybe it'll clear up some of the nag thing, or just ask me in-game...<br>
<br>
as for book pog 3 days in a row... hell i dunno, i haven't even loaded up the calender personally for months, it's not my job to book stuff, or make sure something isn't booked already, that is up to the leaders in SF to do... and yes way back when we used to do hate a lot, for several days in a row... i think it's ok to do planes several days in a row, so long as no one else wants to go up to them as well... you shouldn't reserve more than 1 day raid of each plane at a time... and when your raid is over if next day still isn't taken, book it too... and yes i'll talk to the leaders about this...<br>
<br>
as for FCFS vs. rotations... some mobs it's impossible to put on a rotation examples: lodizal, kelorek'dar - they are too random to get an effective rotation going ... as for VS, traks, sev, tal, gore - they can all be fairly predictable to spawn and thus make it easier to do a rotation, because you can say X guild is up on Y day<br>
<br>
i prefer the rotation because every guild that's high enough to kill the mobs get a turn... but if everyone wants it to be FCFS, whatever /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=81&stop=94>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=634.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=152.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=152.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=152.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm21">General Chat<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <BR><table width=90 height=20 border=1 align="center" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
