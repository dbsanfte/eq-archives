So, technically not terrorism.  Yes, it fucking sucks.  Yes, if we had a conscience as a nation we should think about doing something about it--but what?  Are we going to oust a borderline legitimate (about as legit as -most- sub-Saharan nations get) government to defend a handful of people with caucasian heritage who regardless of its merits, are violating the law of their government?  What sort of government could it be replaced with?  What would we go about the -rest- of sub-Saharan Africa where similar shit is happening to everyone and governments are as transitory as the Flavor of the Week?  What sort of precedent would that set?  And, looking at our previous experience doing similar in the Americas our record ain't so good.  This is really the province of the UN (of which the US is a major player, given our permenant spot on Security and our re-instatement to Human Rights).<br>
<br>
Would this be getting so much Western airplay if those effected were not whites?  No way in Hell.  Worse shit is happening all the time in other parts of Africa and we never hear about it (at least, not until ethnic whites or Westerners are threatened, as in the Ivory Coast recently, or millions are massacred).<br>
<br>
In the end what I find most tragic about this situation, though, is that Zimbabwe is in the heart of a terrible famine and the middle of the growing season when they're doing this, meaning their will a change regime in the middle of the growing season, in many cases from people with generations of experience with the crops to people with pastoral, other crop or no agricultural background.  Tens of thousands will probably starve because of the timing of the execution of this initiative.  That is tragicly irresponsible government making a terrible situation a national disaster.<br>

"Tens of thousands will probably starve because of the timing of the execution of this initiative."<br>
<br>
Damn straight- that's because they cut off the hand that feeds them.  Don't go taking money out of my paycheck to supply them with more food, they need to learn how to rotate crops & engage in mass farming like every other civilized country in the world.  <br>
<br>
Incidentally the agents of Zimbabwe's government have not only killed the farmers, they have also TORTURED the farmers and their families.  This includes raping and killing children.  <br>
<br>
What do I think should be done?  I think all whites should get the hell out of Africa as soon as possible and let the native peoples take care of themselves- for better or for worse.<br>
<br>
South African farmers now suffer<br>
the highest murder rate in the world -- 274 per 100,000.  Get out while you still can!<br>

South African bank, Nedbank, it was revealed that the Black attackers<br>
are<br>

<br>
While you can argue the legitimacy of the occupation of the land until the cows come home (or die), the farms themselves were well-managed, provided employment (black farm workers on these farms are being turfed out, raped, killed, etc, just as their white employers are) and produced a large amount of good-quality produce.<br>
<br>
The large farms are to be split up amongst the persons occupying them, and the reduction of such a large production area to a collection of peasant-style farms will have a hugely detrimental effect on the efficiency and quality of the crops produced. That is, except on the large farms that are being left as single entities and awarded to such superb farm managers as Mr. Mugabe's wife and other members of the Zimbabwe cabinet.<br>
<br>
Once production falls far enough (and it has already, due to the uncertainty of the last couple of years) the spectre of food shortages and starvation arise, with western (including US) money and produce being used to avert the crisis. As I've said, we can argue the politics of land grabs round and round. If the land was being used to benefit the country as well as provide the farmers with a living, then it is surely foolish to say that they are getting what they deserve due to past colonialism, when it will likely plummet that country into a nightmare of famine and death. <p><BR><BR>

Back up a sec there, Sparky. Nobody said that the farmers deserve what's coming to them. In a very dark sense, it's poetic justice that they're on the receiving end of what there ancestors did to the africans, but nobody deserves to be treated the way they are.<br>

But you've missed two very important points there.... firstly, that this is government sanctioned. They're doing it to themselves. Secondly, that there's sweet fuck all that the USA is going to do about it, because your economy runs on oil, not diamonds. In short, Zimbabwe and other Congo-region countries have dick all to offer you, and so you're not gonna leap to their aid.<br>

the &quot;sphere of influence&quot; plays a major part in what the US chooses to act on, or rather; meddle with.

However I do have limited knowledge of the history of it's eastern neighbor Mozambique, which until 1975 was a Portuguese colony.<br>
<br>
A little background. I am a first generation American of Portuguese decent. My mother has 6 brothers, 5 of which served in the Portuguese Army. All five were stationed in Mozambique in the late 60's to early 70's. Four of them will not talk about what they saw. My godfather spoke of it once when we were in Portugal and passed his old military base. I was 12 years old at the time and 16 years later I still remember his tale vividly.<br>
<br>
There was a civil uprising for independence starting in the late 60's growing more violent in the 70's. Your history books will mention that Portugal pulled out of Mozambique in 1975, but offer little explanation as to why. Anyhow, the Portuguese military was present for &quot;policing action&quot; during this time to put down the revolutionaries. How did they do this? If you were a suspected of being a member of Frelimo (the resistance group) you were tied to the back of a jeep. You were then dragged through the tall stiff plains grass which sliced through your skin like razors. Then they would pour salt water mixed with a bit of honey onto your woulds and dump your body on the nearest fire ant hill.<br>
<br>
At this point in his story, my mother interjected asking him to please stop, I was only 12. I asked him, years later, about what else happened during his time in Mozambique, but like my other uncles, he will not talk about what he saw... I scoured the history books to find out oddly enough they make little to no mention of the presence of the Portuguese Army (sarcasm).<br>
<br>
Makes me wonder what happened to the people of the Zimbabwe resistance groups and why they would want to tortue and kill the remaining colonists...<br>
<br>
For those not familiar with Mozambique it's immediately east of Zimbabwe and immediately North of South Africa.<br>

Is that not what the UN is for?  Or at the very least, the EU should do something about it because those people getting tortured are people from their colonizing.<br>
<br>
As for the U.S. only doing things that help themselves or in their own self-interest... what do you people think the U.S. is doing in the Philippines?  Not a flame, per say, just a question.  What do you think the U.S. is getting out of the Philippines by funding and training them to counteract the terrorism going on there?  From what I can guess, the Philippines' only real asses is tourism (though not recently because of terrorism) and coffee... not exactly anything the U.S. can get out of helping them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jebuss>Jebuss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/2/02 3:55:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1685.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> lmao.  asses = assets  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uelliasar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elliasar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/4/02 12:47:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1685.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> simple as this<br>
