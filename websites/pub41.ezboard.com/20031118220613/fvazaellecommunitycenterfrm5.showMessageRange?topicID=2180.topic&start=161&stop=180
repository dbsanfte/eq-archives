Per request, I'll post the link again to my website.  My best friend and I created this mostly tongue-in-cheek, but with the serious intention in mind of educating men on:<br>
<br>
1) how to not be suckers<br>
<br>
2) understanding game-playing and how to avoid it<br>
<br>
3) how to avoid coming on too heavy<br>
<br>
If you can look past the silliness, you'll discover a great amount of real life applications and truth.<br>

<br>
If I ever find a man with the characteristics I appreciate most, I don't care how aloof or unobtainable he is. If he's married, in a relationship, gay, or some other reason I couldn't be with him.. my pursuit would end there, or I'd just enjoy his company as a friend. I respect relationships that are already in place.<br>
<br>
If he was a good man and he was the type that was open and didn't follow the advice you'd give <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  that'd be okay for me. I have no reason to wait on a man that's holding back. I'd question his motives if he were keeping a part of himself from me.<br>
<br>
And yes, most of this is from personal experience.. I'm currently single, but if someone happened into my life that I enjoyed to be with, I would not find them any more attractive if they held back how they felt. I suppose being shy could contribute to this, but when a man isn't and becomes aloof.. no, that really does seem like a game to me /shrug.<br>
<br>
A man tells me how he feels, I find it flattering.. regardless of how I feel toward him. If he's open and honest enough, that's what matters. At least I'll know where he wants to take the relationship. I don't get uncomfortable talking about it when a man wants to, and tbh, more often then not a man brings up the conversation. If two people in a relationship would rather that happen, why hold back?<br>
<br>
I'm sure in general your points are valid.. but some women out there, myself included, don't enjoy waiting around on a man. If a man prefers to manipulate a relationship into progressing at his need to challenge a woman.. what else is he going to keep from me in the future? Other women? Lies?<br>
<br>
And yes, btw, I have been in relationships where the man has told me very early how he feels about me.. some lasted, some didn't.. but the reasons were never based on that. If you like a woman and you tell her, and she turns you down.. it's obviously her loss. If she is like that, would you really want a relationship with her? Or would you rather be aloof and just find out later? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.edenproject.org/~elafount/sepha/images/gallery/sephasig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I think Ammelan pretty much nailed it on the head. Both sexes want someone that is &quot;confident&quot; (when they mature that is). <br>
<br>
For the most part I don't think the women here have defined what they mean by nice guy. If I where to look for a mate again (and yes I've thought about this) I would be looking for a man that is confident, takes care of himself, HAS to be able to afford his OWN toys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , likes himself and understands that sometimes both parties in the relationship need to get away from each other (NOT with someone of the opposite sex that is found attractive I mean, go out with your buddies). <br>
<br>
I dont' understand why a man would find a clingy woman attractive but it takes all kinds I guess :0). And for the record, one night stands can be a BLAST (not that I've done that in years) but I sure as heck wouldnt' define that as any kind of relationship in the sense that has been discussed here. <p>Cyanravyn Frostheart<br>

<br>
but that isn't what you were asking, and that doesn't have anything to do with giving you &quot;insight&quot; as to &quot;what kind of person i am.&quot; <br>
<br>
by &quot;what kind of person&quot; you apparently meant whether or not i am ugly or something, as if that would somehow determine the value on what i have to say.  <br>
<br>
like i said, i wouldn't expect any guy to go around describing me to his buddies by saying how good i look, ever. according to you, that means no guy would want to be more than friends with me. by your logic, i will never have a boyfriend ? i really don't understand the insight you get from any of this about what kind of person i am.<br>
<br>
if a guy tells me how attractive he thinks i am and that he wants to be with me, but would just describe me as his buddies by saying &quot;shes really nice&quot; what would that mean, ? <br>
<br>
also by your logic - if a guy were to describe me by JUST saying &quot;she's SEXY!&quot; that would mean that i had a horrible personality. why does it work one way, but not the other ? and why would someone prefer that over someone actually having good things to say about who they are, rather than what they look like.<br>
<br>
so yeah, was the point of your question ?  i don't get it. but i am sure it isn't really of that much interest to either of us to make sense of it.<br>

I think of women as being understandable much as the weather is.  You can use science to create models and to try to decipher or predict their behavior.  If you study closely and gather enough data, you'll have a success rate far exceeding randomness.  However, from time to time, women will just do something entirely unpredictable that doesn't fit the model.<br>

Ok, all sarcasm aside, Ammelen how about merging real life experience with your attention to detail and offer advice on how to properly play with yourself, shit away years of young life in a game, or avoid suicide while being lonely by overusing a message board ?<br>
<br>
You can spell shit out a few million times with great use of white space and punctuation, but giving a disclaimer that you're not interested in working towards having a happy marriage ever sort of makes everything else coming out of your head completely meaningless.<br>
<br>
If anyone wants some insight from someone who has actually got some life experience, here you go: whatever the answer to how women work is, it won't be the same thing the next fucking day. So stop trying to figure out the pattern and instead increase your skills at adaptation. If it works in theory, it will have no practical application, and everything that gets the job done won't be able to be expressed in a formula or table. If you want to be in good with your woman, to quote Dennis Miller, &quot;How's about you go buy (her) a diamond the size of your fucking head?&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vazsepha>Vaz Sepha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/03 4:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=171>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: easy to understand</span><hr size=1> &quot;If you want to be in good with your woman, to quote Dennis Miller, &quot;How's about you go buy (her) a diamond the size of your fucking head?&quot;.&quot;<br>

Our society really has moved past the notion that everyone must get married.  Many people choose not to.  Some just choose to move from relationship to relationship, some choose a long term, committed relationship without marriage, and others simply choose no relationship.  Personally, I think marriage is outdated.  I'm sure it's great for some people, but everyone should choose what is best for them.<br>

<br>
Actually, I'm quite happy with my life.  I certainly haven't ever been suicidal or even depressed.  Life is far too exciting and there is far too much I enjoy doing.  I don't even play that much everquest anymore (maybe about 6 hours/week now).  However, I also don't regret the time I played everquest.  It was enjoyable at the time, now it isn't really anymore, so I don't play it now.  Kind of ironic seeing this criticism coming from someone that spent about as much time as I did in EQ.  Pot.  Kettle.  Black.  <br>

<br>
This is based on the flawed assumption that any good relationship must be based on marriage and that marriage is necessarily the culmination of a relationship.  I entirely reject that thesis.  It can be in some cases, but to assume that the same solution is necessarily correct for everyone just shows that you can't think for yourself and simply follow societal rules.<br>

Saalron, I understand half of your flame on Amm is purely for the fun of pissing people off, but I'd think you of all people could understand possessing a keen understanding of women, yet never wanting to get married.  You're a great EQ player, but don't play anymore, so what's the deal?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A man tells me how he feels, I find it flattering.. regardless of how I feel toward him. If he's open and honest enough, that's what matters. At least I'll know where he wants to take the relationship. I don't get uncomfortable talking about it when a man wants to, and tbh, more often then not a man brings up the conversation. If two people in a relationship would rather that happen, why hold back?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Flattering, yes.  Impulsive, maybe.  Premature, definitely.<br>
<br>
Here's a RL example.  As of this morning at about 12:30am, the girl I've been seeing off-and-on again for about 6 months finally had &quot;the talk&quot; with me and wanted to be my girlfriend.  <br>
<br>
I've always been forthright and honest with her, which is part of what attracts her to me.  From day 1, I was nuts about her, but I wasn't about to lay it on too heavy and come gushing out about it.  You said yourself, you'd find it flattering, but that's about it.  I'd be willing to bet you'd be a little weirded out by a guy coming out like that so fast.  <br>
<br>
I believe most healthy, lasting relationships come about gradually, with no pressure on either person.  Besides, it's always more fun to gradually discover someone.  Would you want to know the whole plot of a movie in the first 2 minutes?<br>
<br>
Let me put it another way, &quot;show them all your cards in poker right away and the game is over.&quot;  Yet another way would be to say, &quot;when all the wine is gone, the party's over.&quot;   The point is, slow and gradual is ALWAYS better going in to a relationship with a woman.  It gives them their space and allows them the opportunity to decide if they want to be with you under no pressure.  Guys, SLOW IT DOWN.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And yes, btw, I have been in relationships where the man has told me very early how he feels about me.. some lasted, some didn't.. but the reasons were never based on that. If you like a woman and you tell her, and she turns you down.. it's obviously her loss. If she is like that, would you really want a relationship with her? Or would you rather be aloof and just find out later?  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
<br>
Let's illustrate an example of why I don't agree with you.  When I met my girlfriend, on a scale of 1-10, 5 being the minimum for dating, 10 being slobbering true love, her interest in me was probably about a 5.  Had I immediately divulged my feelings and professed my &quot;like&quot; for her, I can guarantee she'd be a little weirded out by that, and preclude any chance of taking the relationship further.  <br>
<br>
Now, she will know I'm interested because I will ask her out on dates, kiss her, and ultimately, have crazy jungle monkey sex with her.  Just because she has sex with me doesn't mean her interest level has risen.  I can't assume anything.  <br>
<br>
So, I'm going to take it slow, call her every other day or so, and let things progress slowly and naturally at a comfortable pace.  Gradually, as she learns more about me, she might decide I'm not chopped liver, and her interest will go up to 7.  <br>
<br>
We start hanging out more outside of date scenarios, and getting to know the real, comfortable side of the person.  Eventually, she may realize, ON HER OWN TERMS, under no pressure from me, (yes, broadcasting my true feelings is pressure... think about it... what happens if someone tells you they love you and you don't love them back?), &quot;Oh my God, I think I love this guy.&quot;  Interest level: 8.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>See, women possess an instinctive grasp of men's interest level in them.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Men, on the other hand, are generally clueless, often projecting THEIR interest onto the girl.  &quot;I like her, so she MUST like me!&quot;  Alternatively, they suspect the girl likes them, but never have a clear indication.<br>
<br>
In this culture, men assume the role of the pursuer and accept rejection as a possibility.  Women, on the other hand, (surprise, evolution at work) get hit on all the time and can therefore be a bit more choosy.  They have to be.  <br>
<br>
Forgive the length of this post, and please stop if you're tired of my lecture.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Guys, here are some good indications and basic guidelines for no-pressure dating.  Girls, please comment.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1.  She touches you.  (light touches on arm, brushes your shoulder, legs touch a second too long under the table, etc.) Good sign.  She's definitely interested.  Uninterested women will not touch you.  Do not touch them first.  Contrary to popular belief, it actually makes them subconsciously uncomfortable and less likely to touch you back.  <br>
<br>
2.  She asks you personal questions.  This means, beyond the usual boring &quot;So, what's your major and where are you from?&quot; chit-chat.  She will ask questions about past relationships, things that involve your feelings and emotions.  This signifies she is interested in getting to know you.  Common sense, but often overlooked.  Remember: no personal questions, no interest.  Just because she laughs at your dumb jokes, doesn't mean she's interested.  <br>
<br>
3.  She makes references to the future.  I was on a date with a girl who asked me what I did that day.  As I told her how I had some appointments with the CFO's at a few wineries just north of Santa Barbara, she perked up and said, &quot;Oh, we should go wine-tasting!&quot;  She wants to see you again, genius.  Just don't overreact to it and act like it's the first date you've ever had.  Smile and nod, say, &quot;Ok, maybe.&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Remember, slooooow doowwwn.<br>
<br>
Now, ways to not come on too heavy after a bit of dating.  <br>
<br>
1) Calling once a day is too much.  Take it easy, boy.  Every other day might even be pushing it.  Space is good.  Even though you're nuts about her, and can't wait for more crazy jungle monkey sex, those nights off = more EQ time.  If she doesn't know when she'll get to hear from you again, it makes her appreciate hearing you that much more.  This will keep her from feeling smothered, thinking you're obsessive, and keep her from uttering those dreaded words, &quot;I need space.&quot;<br>
<br>
2) Don't assume you'll get another date.  If you start presuming she can't wait to go to the tractor pull with you this weekend, and don't ask for a future date on the current date.  It's presumptuous and makes you look desperate, even if she really does want to go with you.  Take it easy, and call her later to ask. <br>
<br>
3) No references to exclusivity.  Even if she's the only one you want to be with, don't make mention of it.  She'll figure that out based on your actions, not your blubbering Romeo and Juliet soliloquy.  There's no need to try and make her think you're seeing other people, because that's deceptive.  Just enjoy your time together, and don't make references to other girls.  If she asks what you did last night, answer simply, honestly, and without elaboration or justification.  <br>
<br>
Example of what NOT to do: <br>
<br>
&quot;So, what did you do last night?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I went to happy-hour with this girl, but she's strictly a friend, I swear.  We didn't do anything.  I'm not seeing anybody else, I promise!&quot;<br>
<br>
(Girl looks at guy like he's a retard.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Example of WHAT to do:<br>
<br>
&quot;So what did you do last night?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I went to happy hour with Kim.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is Kim?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A friend.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, ok.&quot;  <br>
<br>
What else is she going to say?  &quot;What did you do with her?&quot;  &quot;Did you have sex with her?&quot;  What business is that of hers?  You aren't committed yet.  I guarantee that her natural curiosity and predispensation towards competition with other women will make her instinctively raise her interest level in you.<br>
<br>
Were you deceitful?  No.  You answered her question.<br>
<br>
Are you being manipulative?  No.  Her own overactive imagination is.  <br>
<br>
Are you honest?  Yep.  You told her you went to dinner with a friend.  Now she realizes you're a catch and other girls might be after you, and it took no game playing on your part.    <br>
<br>
<br>
Above all, take it slow.  Patience is the greatest virtue, and on of Szun Tzu's key precepts.  Think about, why are you in such a rush to get in a relationship?  <br>

<br>
if you like a girl and are curious if she is interested, i don't see why it isn't ok to touch first, it will help you find out by her response. if she gets creeped out by you flirting and touching, i doubt NOT doing that would have saved you. shrug...<br>
<br>
not that there is anything wrong with waiting for a sign first to feel comfortable doing that (goes both ways), but i guess the &quot;do not touch them first&quot; part is what makes me raise an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
flirting/touching goes both ways. i wouldn't want to feel like it is my responsibility to always do it first. and i wouldn't mind a clue from the guy first that he is interested either... i wouldn't assume that just because a guy is talking to me that he is interested already, i like signs too. <br>
<br>
when my boyfriend and i started dating, i would make it totally obvious to him i'd want him to make a move and stuff, and he still wouldn't. though i think a lot of that had to do with him trying to respect me or something. but i pretty much had to initiate everything that happened in the relationship, even though he was definitely interested. to me, it was annoying.<br>
<br>
maybe it is just me, but i definitely prefer a guy making the moves, flirting, touching, and not being afraid to show his interest before me holding up a big flashing sign that says it is ok.<br>
<br>
