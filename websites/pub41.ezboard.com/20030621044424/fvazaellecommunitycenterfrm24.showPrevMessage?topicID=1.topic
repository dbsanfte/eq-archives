First off,he can't heal worth a damn and he's a jackass who dictates what to do when you group with him.<br>
my impression of flicker<br>
       random tank says &quot;crap I just pulled three&quot;<br>
       Flicker-Stickuphisass says &quot;I'm full mana, we can do it, btw you're on heals I'm on nukes&quot;<br>
       mob has been struck down by wrath<br>
       mob has been struck down by wrath<br>
       mob has been struck down by wrath<br>
       Flicker-Stickuphisass says &quot;oom, afk grabbing a smoke&quot;<br>
       random tank says &quot; ummm theres still three standing&quot;<br>
       other cleric &quot;lom - need help on heals&quot;<br>
       Flicker-Stickuphisass says &quot;damn I told you to take heals&quot;<br>
       mob has been struck down by wrath<br>
       flicker heals once<br>
       Flicker-stickuphisass says &quot;afk again&quot;<br>
<br>
man just a day in the life of grouping with flicker! =)<br>
<br>
Anyway heres the beef, why Sainte was ordered to leave ToS 15 minutes after he posted the following post. The posts after that speak for themselves.<br>

I feel we have a good start here, but we need to push forward. Rules are good start and I am glad to see that coming across, but I think a couple of other areas need to be addressed.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) The Slow Down, I know there will be a period coming where the current pace of gaining levels cannot be sustained by most members, the continuity of the guild is in concern during this period. This happens to every sever, we just need to make plans to address it.<br>
A) Multi-Level Raids, Raids don't strictly need to be targeted for the upper echelon of the guild, if we are going to use the point system then those mid-level raids need to be used as a way of counterbalancing a valid concern that the guild will not become dominated by one sect of the guild.<br>
B) Grouping to Maximaze Lootand XP, Need before greed, BUT it's VERY VERY possible for a group lvls before the top to earn just as good loot as the highest portion of the guild and be just as valvuable in the loot division. Two examples include the Soothsayer camp in Droga, for nice items for all ppl in the guild, and also farming to fund the guild. Raids get expensive, coffins, gems, saving for air &lt; PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, ONE TRIP&gt;.<br>
C) An Open DIalogue, At the current pace, I think the control is a little dominating and controlling &lt;read stifling&gt; we are a collection of real ppl, real person, real lives, real choices, and we play this to have FUN &lt;remember that always&gt;. I'd like to see an itemized vote on elements and a vote of confidence in the guild leadership in propably a month or so, as way to finalize the guild structure.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) The Raids, I was asked to be a sort of I guess designer for guild events of such, but I don't think a title or job is a way to foster an open and communicative forum, I think there should be a sub council of 3-5 players that create/design/channel guild events, each member of the board does 3 every 2 weeks. That I think is not an over-burdening task for those ppl, while sharing the burden as to allow each one of those ppl to have fun. I used to run 2 events a week, and it was a strain getting ppl in locations etc. THAT IS A CHORE, and I don't want to see that happen to ppl. Secondly there needs to be worked out before serious raids begin on leadership, correct use of shout, /ooc, /g, and /gu channels of chat. If you guys want I'll post some thoughts and suggestions later on these.<br>
<br>
3) Power Check, there needs to be some element as a way of checking some person's, group's, click's power from dominating the rest of the guild, either by secret vote etc. Yeah it be nice to do it in the open, but peer pressure even across the computer screen is a strong force heh. I'd like to some sort of that mechanism set in place within a couple weeks, rather than have to mount support, or just de-tag and form another guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) Class Balance, I think I have been very upfornt with my concerns for the guild, we still need a token pally, whether some solo class decides to change mains etc. we need one just to acquire loot, take the first of everything, etc. We also have need for bards, which are a very real concern when doing some uber mobs. Lastly I don't think I can stress this enough, if a cleric or wizard says I'd like to join, take a GOOD look at them heh, you can't have enough of those two classes. Esp. for certain SoV encounters. Besides Barney armor is common heh! =)<br>
<br>
<br>
5) We're here to Have fun. This is my reasoning for saying bunk the race, many ppl enjoy it I guess, but I am not one of those ppl I guess, I would rather spend a night gaining a lvl helping friends in a dungeon, than getting 2 lvls on a full out grind.<br>
<br>
6) Pullers, I would like to see who exactly has knowledge of pulling certain places, like who has pulled PoF before etc. BTW PoF is an easy pull any class can do it, same with most of PoG, some places require tricks to pull succesfully, I'll address that when it's time for us pull them.<br>
<br>
*forgot this one* <br>
7) Turtle Cloaks, it won't be that long before we start doing Lodizial in Iceclad, and everyone for the most part could use the cloak...ummm I mean shield heh.<br>
Stats<br>
ac23 10str 5cha 10wis neg5agi 20fr 20cr 10mr<br>
effect: enduring breath<br>
<br>
I personally think the progression should be<br>
warriors &gt; shamans &gt; paladins &gt; shadowknights &gt; rangers &gt; clerics &gt; druids.<br>
More ac for warriors = less healing for clerics<br>
Shamans = get hit less when they slow in SoV = less deaths<br>
Then secondary tanks<br>
Clerics = well nuff said heh<br>
<br>
*end edit*<br>
<br>
Thats my rant for now, if you've read it all don't feel hesitant to use /tells to ask me about anything here, or any situation ingame or out. <br>
<br>
Thanks-<br>

Some if his points are valid, realy like to know who knows how to pull what. We have necros with no pet control, 2 with no evoke skill, and befor we all get killed bad I would like to know which memebers have skills so we can make groups balanced and able to work well together.<br>
Did we guild his twink monk? Thought we discussed olny 1 char per person for now.<br>
That will teach me to consider others for positions, all I had done was inquire as to weather he was interested in the role, was never offered to him. All in all its not that bad, but it seems to me like he thinks were being to controlling which is bull. The day I turn this guuild over to others is the day I leave it. <br>

I agree, i explained that we did not guild Sainte to be a monk but a Druid and he should have asked us for permission to go ahead and switch main. I did not guild his monk and don't know who did. Gore? lol It really doesn't matter, who can pull what and pet controll, well thats why FG's are great for the guild to practice practice practice. WE WILL HAVE DEATHS. I personally don't mind dying as long as i'm learning in the process. Just get up in lvls would ya flick so exp rez would be nicer lol Some points I didn't mind, but I only wished that you would have read before jumping on him so hard, but he has a hot head and he left so be it he decided. Gore any thoughts on this matter? <br>

ANY TIME some fool tells me he thinks this is HIS guild, i'm gonna go into a rage. I work my nuts off listening to members, players and others whine, beg, cry, plead, and every other damn thing there is. Thoughout all this crap i sit there and be very humble and polite to these people. By nature I am not a humble person and olny average at being polite. But i suffer this as my role within the guild. Some dumbass thinks hes gonna start telling me HOW we should run this guild, what HE wants this guild to do can kiss my ass!!!! We agreed earlier when we created this guild we werent gonna guild tag twinks for now, I accepted the position of council member because I have a very strong personnality and am to damn old to have kids try to beat me into submission. I'm willing to always be the bad guy if thats what its called for as long as I feel what Im doing is right for the guild as a whole. Players want to leave so be it, in order to be the best we need stability, consistency and strong leadership that FIRMLY stands behind their decisions. I ran my own business for over 20 years and I was damn stable, lost a lot of people but had others that always knew I was looking out for every ones best intrest and thats what I wish to do in this guild. We are not gonna please them all, so lets try to please as many as we can without changing what our desires were when we started this. I am willing to win or lose under our direction, not theirs. I said this guild is like a family, and all familys have a head of household and thats us in this case. <br>

*FLAME ON* <br>
OMG you ppl weren't that bright when came to making the password for the forum, anyway couple of things since you trashing me in guild and in tells to members heh, I know it prolly doesn't do any good but oh well.<br>
<br>
1) My monk was never tagged only Sainte, nor did I lobby for him to be tagged after the first series of tells with Tranq and Flicker. Plus it's also kind of funny that Sainte was now still within the range of the guild, and now my monk is as well.<br>
<br>
2) No where did I even hint that this was MY guild, think means suggest, read idea, read thought, read open to counter thought. Amazing I quote from tranq's post on the members board. &lt; feel free to drop a line or post suggestions on the board&gt;. I mean can be any more blantant here, slashing one member for posting his thoughts then asking ppl to do the same exact freaking thing! puhlease thats horrible. and please for the love of humanity read the last line, I even open myself up for discussion of my post.<br>
<br>
3) I didn't decide to leave the guild I was ORDERED &lt;read did not want&gt; to. Flicker if you even doubt that, I got a log of you saying it. I would have liked to stay and work things out, still would mind you, but I don't think a person would stay in a guild where an officer ordered you to detag. <br>
BTW Tranq you never answered that question.<br>
<br>
4) Saying to a person, we'd like to see you as possibly in the position of raid officers, of getting ppl there, balancing locations, and loot balance, that sort of stuff. man sure sounds like an offer to me, but I said I had to think about it. PLUS offer by definition, both contextual and exegetical values, proposes a lack of finality. I addressed that in my post saying I think there should be 3-5 members making those decisions, or a rotating 3 events every 2 weeks sort of deal later heh..which I don't think is a sugesstion out of line.<br>
<br>
5) Tone, don't read it where I don't put it. You don't know me, yet to pretend too. Hell Tranq knows jack about me anymore. You chose to implement a tone that wasn't there flicker, I said there was more to the guild than you three, which I still stand beside. I just think the rest of us deserve a say in what in we follow, no it ain't perfect and I prolly could have dealt with it, had I gotten 0 support and been silent about it.<br>
<br>
6) The guild doesn't need 'dickheads' as you put it flicker. Ask Gore, you got to put up with a lot of @#%$ to be at the top, and to put up with it, you got to take it and like it. Yes there is a time and place for being firm but it's not 24/7, if you would study history an iron hand will get you nothing compared to the velvet glove &lt;yes you can read an insult in that if you want too&gt;.<br>
<br>
7)No I didn't want power, thanks for jumping to conclusions before trying to understand. had I wanted power I would have done a post titled vote of confidence poll here. please vote, and/or I would have whole heartadly explored the option of raid officer just from the mention of it. Man try and think statements through before you outright blast someone otherwise you're only setting someone up for experience.<br>
<br>
 Read point 5 and I stress, I don't pay 10 bucks a month to have you go on a power-trip and sufforcate a person's voice, just because it isn't in line withing your view. When you a form a guild about 'friends' be willing to hear thier side rather than say detag NOW.<br>
<br>
*FLAME OFF*<br>
<br>
you guys are free to delete this post once you read it, I would advise changing your password to the board though heh. I really enjoyed the guild, for the most part it is/was full of decent ppl that understood the meaning of friend. I still have friends in that environment, so don't think I will go away from their lives, thats not your choice, despite what you *suggest* lol !! <br>
I think it could have been worked out, still do to a degree. <br>
Thanks for allowing me to meet the ppl I think are of a high caliber.<br>
<br>
Goodbye<br>
Sainte<br>

Just want to add he is a decent person, was an officer in his last guild for over a year where all members looked up to him and I believe he was used there 'cause he was so nice (he did excessive PLing for those guildmates!).<br>
<br>
Now, to continue with my post.  I don't flame individuals, or anything personally.  When I did my rant it was on general stupidity.  What I have to say about this shouldn't have any negative effect on either party, as that is not my goal.<br>
<br>
I was a bit confused with the Tranq and Sainte persons, but as it looks that Tranq was the one who posted the suggestions and what I have to say is in regard to that.<br>
<br>
In our guild, OA, I deeply promote suggestions.  I would love it if someone gave such suggestions such as Tranq, and I get excited when my fellow guildmates do tell me what they want in a guild.  I believe a guild is nothing if the guildmates are not happy.  Believe it or not, I was happy to get my first complaint as guild leader yesterday.  Granted, it was only a complaint that I wasn't as 'carefree' as I was before the guild was formed, but no one is when they take on the duties as a guild leader.  I thanked the person who said this to me, for keeping it 'real'.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I know this has gone a bit off subject, but I wanted to say what I felt about guild suggestions.  Granted, it was obvious that Tranq was only making suggestions, but then thing can be interpreted wrongly.  Maybe others take more defense and wouldn't see the true meaning of the post?<br>
<br>
I think what I feel about the post is clear <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To Flicker:  Good luck with ToS, I know you have at least one very fine guild member, and from what Sainte says, you have many more.  You are lucky to lead those people.  Remember, part of being guild leader is keeping your guild happy, just not taking crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To Sainte and/or Tranq:  I hope you two fair well.  You are lucky to have made such great friends, and it is good you may have treasured your time in ToS.  Good luck with your futures.<br>

And so what if I dont heal, that was funny as hell and I'm still laughing at it, but you gotta admit if I', gonna nuke all the time I do need the others with evoke skills, and don't worry by lv 50 maybe 55 I'm gonna go out and buy CH I swear, I broke down and bought RES didnt I? I will grant you 1 thing, that was funny as hell and it really brightened up my day. I warned Tranq that protected accounts get hacked all the time and I will stand behind anything I type. I'm not some little punk thats gonna slam some1 behind their back anf smile to their face. I'm not the least bit offeneded by any of this, cause its way to funny. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubettieq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BettiEQ</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/01 3:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/BettiEQ?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMG this is funny stuff and why Sainte left-LP</span><hr size=1> Bah, Damn you VCC!

<br>
I will say, that after Tranq's post, I still feel Sainte was only making suggestions, and should not have been asked to leave for that.<br>
<br>
I feel that Sainte was wrong to post what he did about how Flick handles his groups.<br>
<br>
I feel Tranq was wrong to post what he did about Sainte.<br>
<br>
What you say about each other isn't hurting anyone but yourself because it shows you as an angry hostile person.<br>
<br>
But then again this a flame and rant board.<br>
<br>
my BIGGEST thing to say here is, if I coul dhave deletedmy first post, I would have deleted it and posted nothing else.  I would have left this subject alone and not said anything, but damn you again VCC.<br>
<br>
Now there is something I want from VCC, after damning them twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Could you e-mail me the password to the Guild Leader only section?  The e-mail is Betti@bak.rr.com .  Anyone who wants to flame me personally is also permitted to e-mail me :P<br>

All and all, remember that this is a game and we are here to have fun.  Also, I am not here to start wars, but to state my opinion (which I still regret doing) that I have concluded with the information put in front of me.<br>

p.s. on EZboard their is a way to make extended security meaning, to give access to a private forum, The EZop person needs to add your Ez accunt log-in name to the list in order to let u in to the section.  This usually solves problems with ppl hacking into private section, since Each person's Account pw is fairly hard to obtain...<br>

And no tranq my rep is shot, nor will I start over. I think that would make your life to easy in a sense, I have fun playing the game no matter the situation.<br>

He spent a good 15 minutes at least of his time helping me where I gotta say 95% of the people playing this game would have ignored my plight.<br>
<br>
Now I did not know he was also a extremely adept player who knows his stuff when it comes to raids. A guy with that type of helpful attitude along with great EQ skills is A1 in my book. I will help him out, group with him, be honoured to be his guildmate, and would enjoy being his friend despite your thinking he has ruined his rep. This stuff should never have come to this board, it was posted in the correct area (private guild MB) and should have stayed there.<br>
<br>
Sainte, if ya ever need a buddy to hunt with I am 31 now and would be glad to group with ya. And I want to say thanx again for going out of your way to help me that day man.<br>

I know that this a Rant forum and I may incite a rash of responses.  Before I begin, please let me go on record stating that my intention is not to attack anyone.  I am merely making an observation and relating conclusions that I have made in my on life.  If anyone takes anything out of this post, I hope it is a realization of what impressions may be formed to those potential recruits.<br>
<br>
I am a relatively new addition to the EQ community. (10th Level Half-Elf Warrior)  I am not a member of any guild, but I recognize the names of the guilds listed as having a presence on my server.  I’ve had the opportunity to meet several people on EQ and enjoy grouping.  It made me feel good the first time I logged on and promptly got Tells from previous groups inviting me to join.  Because I am always looking for people that grouped well in the past, I thought of joining a guild.<br>
<br>
I have to say that the dialog I have seen on this thread has disturbed and discouraged me from continuing my search for a guild.  Most people, I would imagine, began this game for a recreational outlet, not a quest for artificial power and petty bickering. As a stockbroker, I have enough tension in my real life.  What I feel is an important aspect (and in my belief – the most important aspect) of this game is ability to share experiences with other people.<br>
<br>
I began to fall into the trap of greed and advancement early on, but came to my senses before I got ridiculous.  EQ is not (to me) about creating that Powergaming, tweeked character or exerting your will on others.  It is a journey where you can share each others vision and develop something that was not there before.<br>
<br>
I am fortunate that I have come in contact with several great people in EQ.  I hope this will always be the case.  I now feel, however, that joining a guild may not be in my character’s future.<br>
<br>
The only ray of hope that continues to shine upon this subject for me is Betty.  I must say that she has shown an understanding of what is important and would be an asset to any group.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I appreciate your allowing me to see guilds in this perspective before I made a decision that I may have regretted.<br>
<br>
With deepest regards,<br>

J: Rants/Trolls, etc have always been around for EQ community boards. This board is minor league compared to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.solusekro.org">www.solusekro.org</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> , and that's a GOOD thing IMHO...<br>
<br>
Rants are really worthless, I just read and post to them when totally bored and can't play EQ, otherwise they are best for ignoring.<br>
<br>
Find people you get along with in-game, stay with them... give others a chance and if they piss you off then /ignore them... that is the key to happiness.<br>
<br>
It IS only a game so unlike work, or other situations, you have no need or obligation to get along with everybody... you have the option to completely blow people off if they bother you :-)<br>
