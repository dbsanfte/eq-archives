Post your own ideas, tips, etc if you have anything to add.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tips</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1) Quick heal/repair - I hope by now everyone is using the favorites feature to load up at equipment terminals. There is a quick way to repair your armor and heal yourself if you have access to a terminal.<br>
<br>
I call it my quick repair favorite and you just need to have a different type of armor than the one you are wearing in this load out as well as a few med kits. Simply change to this armor (for me it's standard), heal once or more, and then change to your preferred load out. <br>
<br>
EG: I go up to a terminal and hit G,5,heal,G,1,heal,G,1 and I'm fully healed/repaired in about 3 seconds. Faster than a med terminal and handy at an AMS in the field.<br>
<br>
2) Finding squad mates/using the map - once you are in a squad, you don't need to ask where people are, simply use the map. Once in the map (M), hit G to get global view, and look for your squad mates numbers. Double click to zoom into the continent they are on et voila.<br>
<br>
3) Medium weapons - everyone should at least have this cert. The cycler is 10 times better than the default rifle. It has 4x zoom, holds 50 ammo at once and should be fired in bursts, not full auto (unless yer in the enemy's face). The punisher is versatile, good for close quarters (but not for me). The shotgun sucks imo, but it's there.<br>
<br>
4) AP ammo - I read a lot of people in beta saying AP ammo sucked and why bother. I'll tell you why: you can take on maxes and vehicles with this stuff and actually have a chance. If I can get behind a max in close quarters I can usually kill him np as long as I stay behind him (fairly easy in agile). Takes about 70-80 rounds. I've taken on a VS thresher solo, on a hill and beat him. Sniping VS maxes = fun! Scaring reavers also = fun! Regular ammo, you might as well give up.<br>
<br>
5) Getting around sanctuary - I think we all know this one now...and that I have to explain it to new people almost every night...but until everyone knows it, I'm gonna have to keep explaining it. At the corner of each HART building in each sanctuary village, are what I call bus stops. Mini warp gates that toggle you between each of the 3 WG villages. Simply walk thru, hack your map to see where you are, walk thru again if you need to.<br>
<br>
6) Getting around bases - This will come with time. Remember that only AMP stations and Tech facilities are UP, rest are down. AMP = outside and up in the dome, Tech = inside up by the air vehicle terminals.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.planetside-universe.com/staticfacil.php">www.planetside-universe.c...cfacil.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
7) Darklight vision - I think this is mandatory at level 6. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Binding - Every base has a &quot;matrixing panel&quot;. Find it and use it whenever you can. It means you can spawn at it even if you are not close to it...even on another continent. Especially useful for me at dropship centers. So guys with vehicle certs, bind at the base so you can get back to get vehicles easily.<br>
<br>
9) Know your team-mates - I'm finding this challenging atm, to know what everyone is certed in. Especially when it's so easy to change. Not like EQ/DAoC where you know what class people are. This will improve with time. I want to get some kind of spreadsheet going tho, or some chart to classify people. <br>
<br>
Also, know that some people know base layouts, etc better than you. So stick together. ie: I know where the CC is in every base now, so if you enter the base with me, follow me cuz I'll be hacking asap. It's always good to have people at my back when hacking the base. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Strategies</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1) Quiet base - the more spawn points we have the better chances we have at not losing the base. Especially if we are working alone. Key steps to taking a quiet base: <br>
   a) Galaxy/sunderer drops off hacker/combat engineer at nearest tower then moves onto base<br>
   b) hacker/engineer secure tower, set up turrets/sensors<br>
   c) rest of squad hot drops on base, secures CC<br>
   d) AMS driver hacks vehicle term and sets up AMS near base right away. Don't even wait for the hack. 2 AMSs if possible.<br>
   e) engineer sets up turrets/sensors at back door of base, then front door and perimeter if possible<br>
   f) optional: Tank/jeep/sunderer/etc driver get vehicle/gunners to patrol if we have man power. Also useful to pick people up who are at other bases and get them back.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) AMS setup - a lot of people set these up in the CY (court yard) of a base. While handy, it is easily found. For the first AMS, I prefer it to be a good distance away and well hidden. If we have 2 or more, one in the CY is good. Also, know that the cloaking bubble is a complete sphere. It can be seen from the basement and thru walls. So if you park next to a facility wall, know that the enemy will be able to spot it on the other side or from below.<br>
<br>
3) Scouting ahead - the thing I hate most when flying a squad in a galaxy is getting to the target base only to find the enemy presence there extremely high and losing the galaxy and squad members in a matter of seconds. At least one mosquito/reaver would be ideal to scout ahead and report back.<br>
<br>
4) Non-stop dying bases - for those really hot hotspots, all plans go to hell. Typing = death. Checking map = death. Setting waypoints = suicide. But some things to try and do amongst the chaos:<br>
   a) get as many AMSs set up as possible<br>
   b) set up turrets/sensors asap<br>
   c) !!!<br>
   <br>
5) ANT runs - someday I'd like to have an ANT team. A galaxy pilot, ANT driver and rear gunner. At the first sign of ANT needage, either get existing galaxy, load up ANT at nearest base, and jet to the WG. OR, immediately recall and get the show on the road:<br>
   a) first, make sure you are at the right WG to get to your destination. If not, use the bus stop.<br>
   b) pilot gets galaxy and gets to WG immediately.<br>
   c) driver gets ANT to WG, parks behind galaxy, loads up NTUs<br>
   d) gunner hauls ass to WG and gets in REAR gun position<br>
   c) ANT loads on galaxy<br>
   e) Galaxy busts thru WG<br>
   <br>
With practice, leader should be able to call for ANT run, and the designated team be en route with full ANT within minutes.<br>
<br>
This is of course an ideal situation, with probably 2 squads. Which brings me to my next point:<br>
<br>
6) Recruiting - yes, this is a strategy. I need more people to boss around. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just like our policy in DAoC and EQ, if you group with cool people, who aren't in an outfit, invite them to check us out (website). If they are eager to join right away, and you think they are a good fit, let us know in game (me, Zato, Bier have invite power...as far as I know)<br>
<br>
If you have RL friends that aren't playing yet, give them yer CDs with the 7 day trial if you haven't already done so.<br>
<br>
Before we had our outfit, I was in an outfit that was fairly large. Most nights we have 3 galaxies full and we're storming bases with ease. It rocked. Hopefully we can get there soonish.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok that's my ideas for now. Feedback and other ideas welcomed. <br>

just some random thoughts from me anyway.<br>
<br>
Darklight is your friend. Trust me, you'll use it ALL the time.<br>
<br>
Matrixing-just wanted to reiterate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
your quick heal is awesome. I was just reloading the same thing and using the heal over and over, this way though, you get new armor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
STICK TOGETHER!!! Nothing more annoying than a team ALL over the place.<br>
<br>
I got AMS today. Already used it about 7 times. GREAT cert to have at only 2 points<br>

First off while aware of the different names for stations, didn't really pay attention to why. Some had sunk in by this time  (not a total brick<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but good to have a fuller understanding. <br>
Parking an Ams, I've found if I park too far away ppl don't seem to want to use it. Of course when I park closer, you can set your watch by how long it lasts. <br>
Praticed placement and setting up of turrets, motion sensors and mines (waste of time really ppl just walk around them). The only thing I've not been able to practice yet is the boomer. Now thats a great little bomb ( I know I blew myself up twice with it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). You can place it in front of an oncoming tank, sunderer, max whatever that moves on the ground, hit fire and Boom. Damage is good, blew myself up in one shot with it.<br>
My next cert will be some sort of aircraft. Mebbe try the gal if Lendl will help me with some tips. I didn't like the mosquito, too fragile and not sure if I have the twitch for the reaver. So gal at least would take some of that off of Lendl. Oh well thats aways off and see what happens.<br>
Now that I know it's ok to talk to ppl about joining the outfit I will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

AP ammo is great.  Ive found I can take out an enemy NC MAX with about 70-80 rounds with a MINI-CHAIN gun (hvy assault.)  VS are a bit easier taking about 55-60 rounds.<br>
<br>
These numbers are based on shooting them on the practice range.  After all, who has time to count rounds in the field when u are more worried about killing them before they kill you hehe.<br>
<br>

<br>
I only played Combat Engineer for a while on my alt (NC on Konried (corn fried?)) but here's a few ideas I have . correct me if I'm wrong on these.<br>
<br>
Turrets hurt regular infantry. <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;">Turrets are useless by themselves. They will only fire if fired upon <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>unless</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there is a motion sensor nearby.<br>
To guard towers, turrets must be in a good range from each door with a motion sensor nearby. </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">UPDATE: Apparently this is wrong, turrets <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>don't</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> need motion sensors to operate. Motion sensors are only good for detecting enemy on your radar. So they are still very useful, especially inside towers.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
I like to set turrets near rocks, trees or those shield things but have an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>open shot</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> at the doors. <br>
<br>
Then a few more placed aroudn the perimiter. <br>
<br>
Also, mines at the door will deter at least one cloaker.<br>
<br>
<br>
At bases, the back door needs mines, turrets and sensors. <br>
<br>
If you have a vehicle, loading up the trunk is a good idea. But frustrating to load it all up (taking several minutes) only to have it blown up a few minutes later. A Basilisk/wraith is good for the solo combat engineer.<br>
<br>

<br>
Also, squad leader needs to know the important certs of each member. <br>
<br>
Like: hacking, repairing, combat engineer, drivers and pilots, ams drivers<br>
<br>
So the squad leader knows who to direct to setup &quot;stuffs&quot; (defences), take out enemy ams or vehicles (with reavers), load up the troops (in vehicles), etc.<br>
<br>
So if you have one of these certs, or change one, or get a new one just let the squad leader know.<br>

<br>
ok founded this info <br>
<br>
1) Always place the commando for what chat it is for in front of your chat. ALSO if you have selected Chat it still needs /s in front of it. (Most common mistake make)<br>
<br>
/b Broadcast<br>
/s Squad<br>
/c Command (Nooo! )<br>
/l Local<br>
/o Outfit <br>
(etc...)<br>
<br>
2) The color uses Hex RGB color values.<br>
<br>
The color code is: \#XXXXXX where X is always 6 numbers/letters and the combinations can be found here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.iconbazaar.com/color_tables/" target="top">www.iconbazaar.com/color_tables/</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
3) Example: You are a Galaxy pilot. And for you to get people's attention to Hotdrop, colors could be handy.<br>
<br>
/s \#FF0000 Approaching Destination \#66FF00 Get Ready!<br>
<br>
This will display in squad: The first 2 words in red and the second 2 in green.<br>
<br>
________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Typing color codes is a b|tch and are often ment to be used many times. So here's where Macro's come to the rescue...<br>
<br>
/macro {3 letter macro name} {Text/command}<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Using the Galaxy drop warning earlyer we get:<br>
<br>
/macro GAL /s \#FF0000 Approaching Destination \#66FF00 Get Ready!<br>
<br>
Press enter and it will make a text baloon on your mouse pointer. Place it in the F1-... hotkey bar and now you can use it again and again without typing.<br>

<br>
First, I'm not usre if everyone has this or you need to be CR1 to do it, but since we want to get everyone to CR1 anyways...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Personal waypoint.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You get this by right clicking on the map. It sets a blue waypoint that only you can see. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Uses:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
- for gal pilot (or anyone driving/flying) set to the warpgate you are heading to so the leader doesnt need to set it. ie: from sanc or if going to anothher continent.<br>
<br>
- when you find an enemy AMS, quickly set it so you can find it again and so you can either set a real way point if you are the squad leader or tell the squad leader where to set it and help the SL move his WP until it is on yours.<br>
<br>
- when driving a windy road to another WP, set it at each turn <br>
<br>
- when flying to a WP but you don't want to fly right over enemy base, set this point off to one side so you swing out and around the base, etc<br>
<br>
- your current target (tower/base)<br>
<br>
- when in reaver and someone dies to magrider, mark where they died and take that @#!$er out!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Squad waypoints:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When you click on the &quot;Set waypoint&quot; menu, you cursor now has waypoints turned on. Whenever you click, even in global view (G), you will set a waypoint. When you click the menu &quot;Set waypoint&quot; again or turn the map off, it toggles it off. No need to click the menu each time.<br>
<br>
A quick way to clear waypoints is to set all 4 close together (but not in the exact same spot or it won't work), then click all 4 again to clear them. That way you don't need to look all over the map to find them to clear them.<br>
<br>
This will be useful when we have 2+ squads and (if) you are trying to coordinate WPs. You don't have to coordinate WPs. For more on that, see below.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Working with 2 or more squads:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'm going to talk about this in the TeamSpeak thread but I'll mention it here as well. Once we start getting 10+ people on TS and we are in battle, we need to concentrate on less chatter and only use TS for tactical data. But still have fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Ok so with 2 squads, setting waypoints and objectives, etc gets more difficult. When you need repairs but the repair guy is in another squad, it's hard to find each other. At least until platoons is implemented. <br>
<br>
So a couple of suggestions: <br>
<br>
Squad leaders should preface commands with &quot;Squad 1 go here&quot;, &quot;Squad 2 go there&quot;. Platoon leader (designated, does not have to be a SL) can also use this. <br>
<br>
Waypoints can be coordinated between leaders, either in tells or better in voice. Just say &quot;Set WP1 to be the NE Anguta tower, WP2 base&quot;. Both leaders would clear up their WPs (see above) and set those. Now both squads have same WPs.<br>
<br>
However sometimes this won't be possible because of chaos or different objectives, so SLs will have to say &quot;Squad 1 goto WP3&quot; and &quot;Squad 2 goto WP2&quot;, etc.<br>
<br>
We'll have to play around with this a bit and see what works and what doesn't.<br>
<br>
I have more to post on multi-squad objectives, but will post it later.<br>
<br>

<br>
When you've bailed or hotdropped from an aircraft, you don't have to wait for the drop animation to finish to take control. Simply pull out your weapon (ie: press 2) and not only can you fire on the way down but you can control your drop path.<br>
<br>
So if you are slightly off target you can move yourself back on target before you land.<br>
<br>
I generally try to have AP ammo loaded so when I get shot down and bail I can fire back at the reaver that got me before I even hit the ground.<br>
<br>
Also, you can land in trees and walk around on top of them or hide in then and snipe unsuspecting enemy on the ground or in the air. It takes them a few seconds to realize you aren't on the ground.<br>
<br>
Also, some towers have trees very close to them. I once bailed, landed on a tree and jumped over to the second level balcony, avoiding the firefight on the ground.<br>

<br>
I have an intelli mouse explorer which has 5 buttons on it. I have the normal configuration for left and right buttons (fire and secondary fire). <br>
<br>
But this is where I've helped myself a lot. The forward and back buttons on the side of my mouse I have one set up for reload and the other for changing ammo to AP or regular. Then my wheel I have set up so I scroll up and it pulls my weapon from backpack slot 1 and then scroll down brings up my weapon from backpack slot 2. Then wheel button I have set up for one of my side holsters (I use it for my med &quot;gun&quot;), <br>
<br>
Not sure if anyone else would find it handy, but I really like the set up and figured I'd pass it on.<br>
