<br>
Ready-to-punch-a-wall angry.  Played-for-a-sucker angry.<br>
<br>
I HATE it when you make an arrangement with someone, and they blow off their promises.  Even worse, try to renegotiate.  How can you trust someone like that?<br>
<br>
Over the last few weeks, I have been trying to find an Ogre Smith willing to do Fulvous Darkscale combines (having discovered that Trolls can wear FD, but cannot make it).  I checked the VCC Tradeskills board and left many notes asking for assistance, and what would be reasonable compensation.  Finally, Jhark of &lt;Call of Elders&gt; responded saying he would do skill-up combines for FREE, provided I was willing to accept 1) his skill was below Grandmaster 2) the likelihood of failure was high for more complicated pieces (bp, legs, etc) 3) all material costs were on me 4) I had to come prepared for the combine with all the necessary ingredients.<br>
<br>
I agreed to his terms, and asked him AGAIN if indeed he was not looking for any compensation.  He reiterated that no compensation was needed, since he wanted very much to skill-up.  He said he had to go to work, but would be back on-line in 10 hours.  I told him I would do my best to make sure that I would have everything ready for when he came back on-line.<br>
<br>
Since I was looking to do combines for the more difficult pieces, I knew I had to have plenty of materials for fails.  I started buying everything I still needed, arranged with a Shaman to do imbuing, arranged and paid an Enchanter to do the enchanting, and camped what I could.  12 hours and 14kpp later, Jhark logs back on and sends me a tell.<br>
<br>
He said he doesn't do skill-up combines for free anymore.<br>
<br>
***pause***<br>
<br>
So I asked him... what about our arrangement?  Was he lying before?  Had we not taked about this beforehand, and come to a deal?  He said he had just become &quot;educated&quot;.  I asked him how much would this &quot;education&quot; cost?  He said he had no idea.... and that he would get back to me on that.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Maybe you're thinking that I was getting too good a deal, and shouldn't be surprised when someone backs out.  And I shouldn't be a baby about it.<br>
<br>
But this is what I really think:  I was willing to compensate him from the beginning.  I do think it reasonable that smiths ask for some compensation for doing what someone else cannot.  Smithing is expensive to learn; I know this well.  I even spent the day trying to figure out HOW I could compensate him indirectly (by giving him some smithing materials), since he flatly refused payment.  We reached an agreement by which we both profited; and based on that agreement, I committed my time and cash to the project.<br>
<br>
I have not been doing tradeskills for as long as some, but it seems to me that a smith or tailor or brewer or person of whatever field of expertise runs on their ability to be trusted.  The success of the combine may not be guaranteed, but the promise of fair business is based fully on trust.  You trust that the artisan will show up, has honestly represented their skill, understands the combine, and if there is a success will return the combined piece for some compensation (that you have agreed beforehand).<br>
<br>
It makes me furious that someone decides to renegotiate a promise because they think they can get a better deal.  Especially after I have committed myself in time and materials.<br>
<br>
Will he do it again?  Would you trust him enough to enter into a deal, knowing thousands of plat are committed, that he might change his mind as to what is fair during or even at the conclusion of a combine?  Even if he came back later and quoted a price, I can't trust him.  I think anyone who would is a fool.  Just makes me mad that I had to be the first to be fooled.<br>

<br>
and yes, i did tell him that i would.<br>
then i went to work... (supposed to be an 8 hour day) turned into a 10 hour day via my boss being the govt.<br>
<br>
During my work day i made a phone call to a friend, and spoke at length about my smithing etc. And this friend informed me of Buaz's conduct as a player. (Detailed below). Considering his conduct as a Celestial Navigator was soooo amazingly good, i decided.... &quot;Fuk him&quot; he can pay or use another smith. <br>
<br>
When i did finally log on, i stated to Buaz, &quot; I no longer do skill up combines for free&quot; the lieing questionw as raise and i said not a lie, just a change of mind.... and iw as EDUCATED.... the education was about his conduct...<br>
<br>
Conduct Explained......  (typical of Celestial Navigators? hope not) (and yes i am emailing them after i reply to this post)<br>
<br>
My good friend, was camping Stormfeather for 2 days strait. (yes i realise SF is not a recognised camp, and YES it is whoever agros 1st gets the kill) however, most people in large guilds realise that its better to be nice than an arse. <br>
<br>
Buaz logs on, moves into the area... my friend sends him a tell and POLITELY tells him, that he is there for SF... Buaz blatently states &quot;its a free for all, not recognised camp&quot; ... ie: get fuked<br>
<br>
Buaz Proceded to KS my friend who has spent 2 days camping this mob, and those of you who have camped it know how annoying and hard it is.<br>
<br>
SO... while i agree i should keep a promice, i do not agree to share my trade with fuktards who fuk over my friends.<br>

Almost looks like someone was attempting to bury a rant hoping that the less views it got the better it would be for business. I can respect the tactic it was just a little too much in your face for my tastes.<br>
<br>
In most circumstances not following through with a trade you didn't want to do is ok in my book. You hear a different PC on the items value etc. However in this case you have a person that for the moment is out of 14k. Thats not cool at all. Usually your only out a moment or two in tells. 14k can take a long time for many people to acquire.<br>
<br>
Personally I hope you lose a great deal more in lost business, now that people know your prices are in accordance with your mood.<br>

<br>
Guess I have to read R&amp;F to find out what is really going on.  Jhark, if you think I'm a jerk and don't want to do business with me, I can respect that.  That is a much more honorable position to take than I thought you were taking.  It seemed you were renegotiating the deal for better profit, but were in fact supporting your friend.  I only wish you would have said that, instead of being mysterious with &quot;educated&quot;, so that we could have talked about it.<br>
<br>
I retract my suggestion that you are untrustworthty.<br>
<br>
I think I might know the incident with the Stormfeather camp.  One time, I showed up and several people were lurking around waiting for SF.  So I sighed, setup my pet for cougar-control, and hunkered down for another 6 hour try-to-out-wait-everyone-else-and-hope-they-leave session with SF.  A level 45 (or near) Monk comes up to me, says this is his camp, and asks me to leave (despite the fact that there was a high level Druid and Warrior already hanging out, and not grouped with him).  The Warrior was even standing right at the pop spot.  The Monk asked me if I was planning to KS him.  I was so sick of peoples' pushiness at the SF camp, that I decided to flex, and said &quot;sure&quot;.   One dumb word.  Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb Troll.  I really just wanted to out-wait everyone, or if SF popped know what time he did so I could come back in 16 hours and hopefully be alone.<br>
<br>
Well, the Monk goes nuts, all of his suspicions confirmed.  He starts sending all kinds of fun tells.  He says he logged my reponse, so he could submit it for petition.  He starts putting down my guild.  He says he will be in contact with my guild officers, to have me deguilded.  Isn't SF camp fun?<br>
<br>
At this point, I had been camping SF for about a month.  I've had many good conversations with people as we while away the time, waiting and hoping for a pop.  I talked with a 64War who had camped him 130hours, only to be KS'd 4 times.  I've read all the remarks people have made about some who lock him up with charm animal, or burn him down with DD, or load up on DPS to out damage people who have been waiting for hours.  I have never knowingly KS'd, but I know it is common with SF.<br>
<br>
Well, gets even better.  A guild officer sends me a tell.  Says someone is complaining about my conduct.  I explain that I am reluctant to leave, given that a high level warrior is standing behind me, waiting to KS the Monk.  I asked the War if he was willing to leave with me, and he said no.<br>
<br>
The guild officer explains that the person sending the message is part of a guild alliance, and should be treated better.  So I talk with the Monk, appologize for strong-arming him, and ask if I can be of assistance.  Given that the Warrior was hovering nearby, would he like to group so his DPS would not allow him to KS.  I told him I would not be surprised if he did not trust the offer, but that it was genuine.<br>
<br>
He seemed to accept my appologie, but declined my offer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I asked him what his plan was to manage the Warrior, and he said he had some people coming to help.  I sent some /say's to the Warrior, but the War didn't leave.  So I wished the Monk well, asked if he would send me a tell if he killed SF with the time, and camped.<br>
<br>
Several days later, I finally bagged SF.  I had been camping him for several hours, and I was alone in the zone when he popped.  I did not KS anyone.  Also, if your friend is not a Monk, then I have know idea what you are talking about.<br>
<br>
Again, I retract my suggestion that you are untrustworthy.  It sounds like you are a very honorable person.  I only wish you would have explained your decision, that we could have talked about it.  I understand if you don't feel sufficient trust for me.<br>

What does sound like Buaz is Buaz's latest post of his time camping SF.<br>
<br>
Sounds like the SF issue is just a way to try and sidestep the real issue.<br>
<br>
This deal made by this smith sounds like an incident that happened to me once. <br>
<br>
When I was younger (21-22 I think) I quested all the Armor of Ro.  I needed the enchant platinum spell (for a chanter I had yet to find). Not knowing any Dark Elves, I created a DE Sk and learned my way around Neriak.  I then brought my Paladin to the newbie log in Nek forest and found a level 30+ person (selling stuff via auction in the zone) and would pay him 20pp for handing my newbie SK 20pp to buy the spell. Then he would take the spell from my DE and give it back to my Paladin. Simple right?<br>
<br>
I hand this person 40pp, log on my DE and he gets the 20pp to go buy the spell. Into Neriak he goes, buys the spell, comes out and hands it to this person on the log.  I log my Paladin back on and hail him.<br>
<br>
He then asks me what I am going to give him for the spell.<br>
<br>
OK. so .. well. hmmm. I got mad then. I had 210pp left to buy the bars of platinum and then 20pp more to my balance.  I told him that was all I had. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So this person held me up for the additional 20pp just to get my spell.<br>
<br>
Sounds like this deal with Buaz and the smith.<br>
<br>
In my case... the deal breaker went into my permanent ignore list, but after I did a tell to zone, not to buy anything from this deal breaker. <p>Thoraz - 56th Dwarven Paladin<br>

In both cases the parties had come to a mutual Agreement, and trusted that the other party would hold their hand of the bargain.<br>
<br>
Just like in RL, your word (at least for most people) is one of your most precious asset.  If people can't trust you to follow what you say you would do than you wont deal with those people on any level.<br>
<br>
Would you tank in a group where the cleric says they would heal but don't !! No you wouldnt !!   Would you group with a wiz that is suppose to evac but gates when shit hits the fan !! No you wouldnt !! <br>
<br>
It is all a question of trust and agreement between people (even if often the agreement is implied such as in a cleric in a group, or a wiz to evac).<br>
<br>
P.S.:  I believe Jhark and Buaz have discussed the matter and they got to a mutal agreement on the matter, and everything is all peachy now.<br>

<br>
Btw if I was gonna bury a rant I would bury it 3 pages back simple fact is bored shitless sitting in another hotel room in another strange city drinking particularly good rum a go go post count seemed like a good idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This sounds like a bit of a misunderstanding and I am sure any payment Buaz makes to Jhark for his skills and service will be very reasonable and will get plowed back into skill up work to get to 255 and a word to the wise my post about Jhark doing free combines for skill ups which was when he was around 200 and some months back but certainly isnt the case any more.<br>
<br>
Considering I have no trade skills on any character over 196 (tho most of my skills are 190 to 196) I dont know whether to fear, admire or stand in awe of people who take the amount of time, effort and PILES of platinum to get their skills even close to GM level.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp again for what its worth.<br>
