The only thing to hit anything was a car striking me as I crossed the street, splitting open my skull, breaking my kneecap and destroying any hopes I ever had of becoming a Rockette, and laying me up for about 2 months while I spent my life savings living in a fleabag motel in half traction. While I was there, I refused to be completely crippled, and after enough pain killers and reflection about my brush with death, I wrote this screenplay. It of course needs polishing and correct format, and I'd like to think my ability to write has progressed since 7 years ago. It is copywrited and registered with the Writer's Guild, and when it was finished, days before I went to peddle it on the streets of California, my father in NY grew ill and I moved back to NY to take care of him. The script was shelved and gathered dust. I'm now at the point in my life where it's time to try and move it. First step is transcribing it onto computer disk, so, as I retype this from my paper copy, I'm going to post it here, to share with those of you who are interested. My intent with this script was to make the reader/viewer think. The soundtrack I reference is almost every song from Pink Floyd's Momentary Lapse of Reason, and there are direct cues for that music in the script. It was the hope when I wrote it that if bought, the producers would contact PF about re-releasing the entire album as a soundtrack for the film, since the music was a huge inspiration for writing it, and was written TO it as I sat up in bed with my head shaved and leg elevated and contemplating to myself &quot;Which Door would I choose?&quot; <br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy. <br>

<br>
Music Cue: Learning to Fly<br>
<br>
as the scene EXPLOSIVELY opens...<br>
<br>
VARIOUS SHOTS of JAKE performing all forms of dangerous or death defying stunts; Sky diving, bungee jumping, hang gliding, demolition derby driving, speed racing....etc. until the music fades out...In NONE of the scenes is JAKE actually smiling.<br>
<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR: RACE TRACK, DAY<br>
Shot is a flip on the race track; the car is in flames...JAKE climbs out unhurt.<br>
<br>
JAKE is around 6', strong wiry build. Blonde hair, almost white, reaches his shoulders, but not long enough to be considered girlish. In fact, NOTHING about JAKE is girlish. He is a man's man, face seeming to be carved in stone. Nothing about JAKE is soft. His blue eyes reflect his soul. He is cold. Almost unfeeling. He FEARS NOTHING, even the threat of death. In fact, half the reason he takes the risks he does is for the mere fact that he laughs in the face of death, challenging it...<br>
<br>
JAKE gets to his feet after STRUGGLING from the BURNING car. PAUL, in a wheel chair, is racing across the feild to him as JAKE's PIT CREW attempts to put out the burning car. JAKE waves off the MEDIC who is attempting to see if he is alright. The PIT CREW sudden;y scatter as the car blows up. JAKE takes off his helmet, not even flinching, as he reaches PAUL.<br>
<br>
PAUL is wheelchair bound, having lost both legs in a car accident on this same track. At one point he was a strong man, but the loss of his legs has left him a shell of a man, with his own mortality and helplessness apparent in his every word and action. He is not coping with his handicap well, and JAKE has become his strength. They used to race together; now PAUL just HAUNTS the race track to watch JAKE, who he is afraid for, due to JAKE's lack of respect for danger. PAUL, while LOOKING UP to JAKE, is like your typical ex-smoker, who, after being forced to quit smoking, is trying to stop all his friends from smoking.<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
Jesus, Jake! You're really pushing it, man! You almost bought the farm this time!<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Relax Paulie. Let me buy you a drink. (Starts walking away, unperturbed)<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL: <br>
<br>
(Trying to keep up, arms working the wheelchair frantically)<br>
But Jake! It's like you don't even give a shit...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I don't. Now watch where you are going before you tip your ass over.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(Relaxing slightly, utters a short laugh)<br>
Right. You're telling ME to be careful.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: FINNIGAN'S BAR, DAY<br>
<br>
Finnigan's is the local bar for the track's race car drivers. Many come in and go out, still dressed in their jumpsuits and still stained with grease and dirt from the track. Many beautiful female track groupies are also in abundance, hanging onto the arms and every word of the drivers. Music is playing on the jukebox in the background. JAKE and PAUL are at a corner table, JAKE in the corner, and PAUL on the outside, sitting in his wheelchair. A cute WAITRESS in a skin tight shirt and a short uniform brings the two men bottled beer, and walks off, hips swaying. PAUL forlornly watches her behind as she goes, and takes a long pull from the beer.<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
God DAMNED! Well, it could have been worse....I could have kept the legs and lost the family jewels.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Staring at nothing in particular in the bar) <br>
Lot of good they'll do you. You still have to CATCH 'em when you chase 'em.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(bubble burst, but still good natured)<br>
Yeah you're right. But when I do catch 'em, they love me.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Oh yeah? Why's that?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(with a huge grin)<br>
I always let them get on top.<br>
<br>
<br>
BOTH men laugh.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
But seriously man, how're you handling it?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
What. the legs? It sucks man, it really sucks. (PAUSE) <br>
(Looks down at his bottle for a moment)<br>
Who the fuck am I kidding? This is HELL, Jake. Suddenly I can't do a fucking thing anymore, just because I got cocky and thought I could take that turn at a speed NOBODY should have tried. Yeah, I won the race, tumbling ass over backwards at 100 miles an hour while my legs crumpled like tin foil. What the fuck was I THINKING when I started racing in the first place?? You know what's one of the things that defines a man from a woman? A man pees standing up. I can't even fucking do that...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Softly)<br>
Easy....<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(Ignoring him)<br>
And you're another one! I seriously think you're trying to kill yourself. The crap you do scares the shit out of me. It's like you don't care what happens to yourself. I just raced, Jay...you seem to be locked into some adrenaline kick that demands if it can kill you, it turns you on...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I like the rush.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
The RUSH!<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
The rush, Paulie. You remember it. It's what got you into the cars in the first place. Hell, people don't come to see the race; they come to see the CRASH. You knew what it was like flying down the track, staring death in the face and beating him. You were racing DEATH, man, and every time you crossed the finish line, first or last, you BEAT it. That's the rush....<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(mumbling)<br>
Yeah, I beat it all right. The only rush I got was to the hospital. I didn't beat death. I just found something worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What's that shit? You're alive, aren't you?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(PAUSE)<br>
This ain't alive man. I feel like a crab, scuttling sideways, hoping some damned fisherman doesn't step on me too hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You're ALIVE.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(resignedly)<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Breaking the mood, smiling)<br>
And...you got me....<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(Short laugh)<br>
Now I really DO want to die.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You got me.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(Soft) Yeah.<br>
(Almost to himself) ...But for how long?<br>
<br>
<br>
WAITRESS approaches with another two beers. She smiles seductively at JAKE.<br>
<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:<br>
<br>
Hey Jake, I heard about the race today.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Humoring her)<br>
Oh yeah?<br>
<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:<br>
<br>
(Leaning forward, great cleavage shot)<br>
Yeah. How fast CAN your engine go before it...explodes?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Playing her game but holding her look steady)<br>
As fast as it needs to go. My engine doesn't know any limitations. It blows when I decide the audience needs a thrill.<br>
<br>
<br>
WAITRESS: <br>
<br>
Is that a fact?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Darlin', it's etched in stone.<br>
<br>
<br>
WAITRESS laughs and walks away, tossing next line over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
<br>
WAITRESS:<br>
<br>
Well, Jake, you ever looking for a RIDE, you know where you can find me.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(Laughing, unable to control himself, mimicking the WAITRESS)<br>
...you ever lookin' for a RIDE....JESUS, Jake!....there's two legs you won't need a key to open...!<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You kidding? That woman will kill you quicker than a car crash.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
Yeah, but I'd die happy. (Raising his bottle) I'd die happy...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR: OUTSIDE OF FINNIGAN'S BAR, DAY<br>
<br>
JAKE is behind the wheel of his red Porsche. PAUL is in his chair in the doorway to the bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You sure you don't want me to give you a ride home?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
Nah. We'd just have to break down the chair and all. Mikey's got his pickup truck around back. I'll just have them toss me in the back and cart me home.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE: <br>
<br>
Alright. I'll give you a call tomorrow.<br>
(Peals out with a screech of tires)<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(Yelling after him)<br>
And BE careful!<br>
(then, to himself)<br>
Ah, why do I even bother?<br>
<br>
(He turns around to roll back into the bar. You hear him calling to the WAITRESS from inside)<br>
<br>
Hey sweetheart! Wanna go park and neck in the handicap space?<br>

A BLACK CORVETTE with BLACKED OUT WINDOWS pulls up next to JAKE'S PORSCHE<br>

BOTH CARS screech off.<br>
<br>
ACTION SEQUENCE of the two cars going through a DANGEROUS race, blowing lights, just missing trains and people and other cars. ALL during the race, JAKE keeps stealing glances at the other car's progress, which keeps up with him easily. What JAKE doesn't see is that, while JAKE narrowly avoids obstacles, the CORVETTE is PASSING THROUGH THEM, as if they were smoke.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR: MOUNTAIN ROAD, DAY<br>
<br>
BOTH CARS head up a mountain road, still racing. JAKE is actually starting to sweat now, but still figures he can beat the other car. There is no question in his mind. SUDDENLY, BOTH CARS bump into each other, lose control, and go OVER THE EDGE of the road. They FREEZE in pace, hanging in mid air, twenty feet away from the embankment they shot off of. EVERYTHING, except for JAKE, is frozen in place, as if time has stopped. As a matter of fact, it has.<br>
<br>
The door to the CORVETTE opens, and DEATH steps out.<br>
<br>
You cannot see DEATH's face. He is garbed in traditional reaper's robe, hood concealing everything but two burning eyes. He stands as if on solid ground next to the car. JAKE opens his door, and, looking down only once, steps out and also stands on solid, though invisible, ground. JAKE just stares at DEATH.<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(In a deep, terrifying voice)<br>
<br>
I...am...Death!<br>
<br>
(NO reaction from JAKE)<br>
<br>
I am DEATH!<br>
<br>
(Nothing from JAKE)<br>
<br>
I am Death, mortal!<br>
<br>
(JAKE just looks at him)<br>
<br>
(In a normal voice)<br>
<br>
You really AREN'T afraid of me, are you?<br>
<br>
(In a flash, DEATH is garbed in a simple black tuxedo. He looks like a normal man, somewhat short, with a trim black goatee. He regards JAKE with an ironic smile)<br>
<br>
Good. Very good.<br>
<br>
(He starts to walk to JAKE)<br>
<br>
I've been waiting to meet someone like you for two thousand years now.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
This isn't happening. This is bad beer.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
No, Jake, this is happening. You're too rational a man to accept the irrational, that's all. But if you stop to think about what's happening, you'll realize that this IS happening.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(after a pause)<br>
So you're Death. So what? What now?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Taken aback, then suddenly laughing out loud)<br>
THAT'S the spirit! You are more than I had ever dreamed, able to assimilate and accept my presence so quickly. Oh, you'll do VERY well...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Well for WHAT? Am I dead? Is this why you're here?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
Dead? Oh no, you're not dead. (Gesturing to the car poised in midair) Well, not YET, anyway. And if you and I make a certain...um....agreement....?....then you need not be dead at all....or, at least, not until you are naturally slated for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You mean, you arranged for this to happen? (DEATH nods) <br>
Why?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
For what seemed to me to be a one in a million chance. I NEED YOU.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
How?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
Ah, a man of many words. Well, you may be short with me now, but I actually heard you in the bar talking to your poor legless friend. The speech about cheating me. Do you remember it?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I recall it.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
I need someone like you....fearless. Afraid of nothing. Especially...me.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
And I fit the profile.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH: <br>
<br>
Perfectly. In fact, the only reason I can speak to you at ALL is for that very reason. Normally, I can only speak to the recently departed. But you...you're different. Most people are so afraid of me they can never communicate directly. But you....well, you can see for yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
That tells me nothing. Obviously you've set up this meeting to blackmail me into doing something for you. What is it?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(spreading hands)<br>
A simple thing, really.....a matter of role reversal....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Role reversal.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
Yes. A day of your life....for a day of mine...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Why?<br>

DEATH:<br>

BECAUSE, dammit! Because for two thousand years I haven't been able to have a drink, lay in bed with a woman, take a piss, or talk to anybody other than poor confused pitiful souls fresh from dying and begging me not to come near them! I want to LIVE, even if just for a day, a minute....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Two thousand years? Why only two thousand years? People were dying more than two thousand years ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Preoccupied, this isn't going as smoothly as he had planned)<br>
I don't cause death. I'm just...the doorman. I help the more confused souls through their door. Thank god there aren't more confused souls than a few a week. If I had to help them all, I'd have to hire an entire staff....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What door?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
You know, the doors to eternity. Heaven, Hell....some people have a hard time finding them...that's where I come in.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
That still doesn't answer my question. People must have had a hard time finding them prior to two thousand years ago. What happened then?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Finally understanding)<br>
Then? Then...the old Death took care of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Old Death. You mean there are TWO of you?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Mumbling)<br>
There have been SCORES of us. This is just a job. One I never would have taken had I known how long the tenure would be...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So what were you before you took the job? And WHY would you take a job like this? I don't understand that.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
What was I...?....Well, I was a man, just like you....a living breathing man....(wistful look)<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
And you gave that up.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Testy)<br>
I was confused at the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I'LL say.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
(peeved)<br>
Listen, do you know who I was?? I was one of the most hated men of my time. I didn't know it then, but I anticipated it. And I was right. I went down in the history books as the most despised villian of all time. I almost hung myself in shame, but right before I could die, Death offered me a choice. And I took it. I always WAS a coward.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Who WERE you?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(A confession, almost a whisper)<br>
Judas Iscariot.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Judas Iscariot? THE Judas Iscariot?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
Yes, yes, the betrayer of Christ, the tax collector Benedict Arnold, the lowest of the low, the fink, the rat, the stool pigeon....I've heard what everyone's said about me, and I won't deny any of it. But I didn't just sell out Christ tothe Romans for a measly thirty pieces of silver....(PAUSE) It was SEVENTY....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
The Bible says you hung yourself and burned in Hell.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
The Bible also says the world was wiped out by a flood and we are all descended from the children of Noah...do you realize what all that interbreeding would do to us genetically? We'd be dumber than slugs....but iin this case, I wish the Bible WAS correct....Hell would be preferrable to this endless nightmare....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
And now you want ME to do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Realizing he's screwing up the sales pitch)<br>
No, no....I don't mean the JOB is bad...actually, it's pretty boring. I mean the length of TIME involved. All I'm asking you is for a day in your shoes....not eternity.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
A day. Nothing more? How can I trust you?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(Indicating the car)<br>
You really have no choice. But I give you my solemn word, which I don't even HAVE to do, that you may have your body back twenty four hours from now.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
The alternative?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
You get back in your car and continue on your merry way.<br>
(JAKE pauses, considering)<br>
Look, Jake, both of us know that you don't FEAR death, but it's undeniable that you also love life...or at least, are having a good time living it, despite risks. All I'm asking is for the same chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Ok, it's a deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
(DEATH releases a huge breath, the tension draining out of him)<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
I had HOPED that's what you'd say.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE: <br>
<br>
So now what?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
Now? Now you just stand there and....<br>
<br>
JAKE'S POV (Point of view): DEATH's spirit, a transparent version of DEATH, rises from DEATH'S body and starts to circle counterclockwise toward JAKE'S body, while JAKE'S point of view circles toward DEATH's body. DEATH's spirit superimposes JAKE's body, and solidifies as JAKE's old body fades out.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You still look like you.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(walking to JAKE'S car and getting in)<br>
Only to YOU do I look like me. To everyone else, I'm you.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So now what do I do?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
(As JAKE's car reverses in time to settle back solidly on the road it flew off)<br>
No time to explain now. Only have twenty four hours in this wonderful body.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So I just sit here for 24 hours? Is that all Death does? Take a day long coffee break?<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
No, of course not. You need lessons? Go see Kane.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Who's Kane? How do I find him?<br>
(DEATH starts the car, revs engine)<br>
<br>
<br>
DEATH:<br>
<br>
No time now, Jake. Just think ofKane, and you'll find him. See you in 24 hours.<br>
(Screeches off)<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Calling after the car)<br>
Be careful with that body!<br>
(To himself)<br>
Jesus, now I sound like Paul.<br>
(PAUSE, then to the CORVETTE)<br>
Back up.<br>
(Car does not move)<br>
Come, car.<br>
(Nothing....he feels stupid)<br>
Here, car. Shit.<br>
(Then, in his mind he says<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Dammit come HERE!<br>
(The car backs up to him)<br>
Hmm, more like it.<br>
(Gets inside)<br>
Now, to Kane, car.<br>
(Car doesn't move)<br>
Christ, I feel like an idiot.<br>
(Then in his mind only, he says<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
To Kane.<br>

<br>
MICHAEL and STACY, two all american type teenagers, are strolling through the woods. MICHAEL carries a large bottle of beer which he passes to STACY throughtout the dialouge between them.<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
My father says these woods are haunted.<br>
<br>
<br>
STACY:<br>
<br>
Yeah, right. He also said that plane crash last year on Cooper's Hill was a UFO.<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
It's true.<br>
<br>
<br>
STACY:<br>
<br>
The UFO?<br>
<br>
(JAKE and the car rush into the scene. JAKE gets out, heady from the speed, looking at the car. The two TEENAGERS walk bye as if nothing had happened, not seeing either him or the car. JAKE follows, intrigued. He passes his hand in front of their faces, but they blithely step THROUGH it as if it isn't there. JAKE is still dressed in his racing clothes.)<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
No....the haunted thing. Dad's drunk most the times, and sees things differently, but the ghost thing is real.<br>
<br>
<br>
STACY:<br>
<br>
How do you know? You're buzzed yourself right now. Hell, you're even starting to LOOK like your old man.<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
I may be a little buzzed, but I've seen old Kane out here....I think...once as a kid...<br>
<br>
<br>
STACY:<br>
<br>
(Mocking)<br>
Oh, BIG man now....<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL: <br>
<br>
Aw, cut it out...you know what I mean. When I was eight. About a year after it happened. I thought I saw Kane hiding behind a tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
STACY:<br>
<br>
Come on, Michael, we were ALL seeing Kane that year. I thought he lived under my bed. The whole town was terrified. After the way he cut up those girls...<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
(Almost to himself)<br>
Yes, but this was different. I KNOW I saw him....It was around here, where that woman got lucky and killed him...<br>
<br>
<br>
((SUDDENLY the ground erupts in front of them. KANE, hideously disfugure and decayed, crawls from the hole in the ground. MICHAEL stands horrified. STACY cannot see it at all))<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Michael, I've come for you....after all these years.<br>
<br>
<br>
((STACY still sees and hears nothing. MICHAEL screams and runs blindly away, knocking the bottle of beer all over STACY. MICHAEL runs through the woods))<br>
<br>
<br>
STACY:<br>
<br>
Goddammit! Michael, get back here, that's not funny! Michael!<br>
(Realizes he's not coming back)<br>
Fuck YOU!<br>
(Continues walking, intent on getting home)<br>
(Under breath)<br>
Asshole! I'm covered in BEER!<br>
(mumbles off)<br>
<br>
<br>
(KANE lopes off through the underbrush after MICHAEL, JAKE not far behind. So far, KANE hasn't seen JAKE)<br>
<br>
((MICHAEL is running through the woods, oblivious to his surroundings. KANE come through the underbrush behind him))<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Michael, behind you.<br>
<br>
<br>
((MICHAEL turns around in a panic, still running. He runs full speed into a tree with several spall, sharp protruding branches. He impales himself onto one, spasms, and dies, hung on the tree.)<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(In childish excitement)<br>
Two points! Yesssssss!<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(disgusted)<br>
Oh my god.<br>
<br>
<br>
((KANE's head whips around. He realizes that there's a witness, but still assumes JAKE cannot see him. He begins sneaking up on JAKE, a huge, evil smile on his face))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Don't even THINK about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
((KANE freezes))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You killed that boy.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Amazed)<br>
You can see me.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You killed that boy for no reason at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
You can SEE me! Are you one of those mediums? Huh. huh? Nono, too big for a medium, you'd be a large, I'd say. Or are you just a well preserved ghostie?? ((Drooling)) I would have preferred a woman (scratching crotch obscenely) but you'll do fine. I like em pretty, all types....(Inches closer to JAKE)...I suppose I can TOUCH you too....((reaches out lustily))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Touch me and I'll rip your balls off and shove them down your throat.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Smiling, but backing off) Not my idea of a well balanced meal, but strangely, it appeals to me. Don't get so pissy, friend. I thought you were a gift from Jude.<br>
<br>
((starts singing bits and pieces of the Beatles &quot;Hey Jude&quot;))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Judas is on business right now and I'm his replacement. He told me to find you.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Bursting into laughter)<br>
Replacement? Is THAT what he told you?<br>
(More laughter)<br>
Wow, Death is a TEMP...<br>
(Almost on floor, cackling insanely)<br>
((Then he straightens up, almost military)<br>
Well, then, Mr. Death, SIR!<br>
((Salutes, very military))<br>
It is my duty to inform you that that poor unfortunate civilian tacked to that tree over there is one of those rare individuals that need your form of expertise to cross over into the Great Beyond. SIR!<br>
<br>
((JAKE looks and sees the boy's spirit peel itself out of the body on the tree. MICHAEL looks at his dead body in horror))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Whispering to KANE, transfixed)<br>
What do I do?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Set up the doors, idiot. Obviously if the kid could set up his own like most people, you wouldn't even have to be here.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What doors?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Just think &quot;Doors&quot;...they'll come. And do it quick, before the kid's spirit starts to rot. If it goes on for too long the kid'll be trapped here like me.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(In his mind)<br>
Doors....<br>
<br>
<br>
((TWO doors, one of pure light, one of darkness rise from the ground on either side of the spirit))<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Now. Help him through.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Steps forward)<br>
Michael.<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
(Spinning around) Who are you? What's going on here?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I am Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
Cut the shit man. You look like a mechanic. Listen, something really fucked up is going on here....(gesturing weakly at the body on the tree) I don't know what's going on here...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Sorta weak) Listen kid, you're dead. That's you on the tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
No, it can't be. I just hit my head or something...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Trust me...I know I don't look like what you expected, but you have to choose a door now...<br>
<br>
<br>
((JAKE watches as MICHAEL's face decomposes, just a tiny bit. He begins pushing him towards the door))<br>
<br>
<br>
MICHAEL:<br>
<br>
(resisting) But which door?? I don't want the black one man. Don't want it!<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Tell him only one will open to him anyway. He'll know which one.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Quickly)<br>
Only one door will accept you. You'll know which one.<br>
<br>
<br>
((Tears begin to run down MICHAEL's face. He reaches out tentatively))<br>
<br>
((MICHAEL grips the handle to the black door, and steps through it howling))<br>
<br>
((Both DOORS disappear in a flash))<br>
<br>
<br>
((PAUSE))<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Such a young kid. Going to Hell.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Lightly) <br>
Ah well, you play you pay.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What could he have done that could sentence him to that?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Probably nothing. Some guilt from the past that he won't let go of. Not me tho. When I went I would have picked the white door, nooooo problem. Only Judas wouldn't let me.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
The white door would take you and the black door took the kid?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
The white door would have taken the kid too. I lied. He could have opened either door.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You sonofabitch! Why didn't you tell me that??!<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Because you're new. You would have looked at the kid, said &quot;White door&quot; and that would have been it. Who do you think you are, God?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What are you talking about?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
I'm talking about CHOICES. I hung around with Judas long enough to figure out whathe does. You give the person a choice, but not really. You tell them only one door will open to them, but not which one. Who knows their lives any better than they themselves? They pick the door that they truly believe is their fate. So, ultimately, they get exactly what they deserve.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So that kid may have stolen a can of soda from a store and went to Hell from a little guilt, while you can kill people at leisure and go to Heaven because you can live with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
What is Heaven and Hell except a state of mind? Has to be (motioning to MICHAEL'S body on the tree) cause you ain't got no body left. If your mind is at peace, your spirit's at peace. All very Zen. I dig it.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
This is all screwed up. What religion has taught us for years is all garbage.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Not really. If you actually DO good deeds then you have no reason to feel you're going anywhere BUT to a good place. Unless that is, you're like me, and &quot;good&quot; is just a matter of interpretation.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So why aren't you through the white door? Why stick around here, murdering kids?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Getting angry) Judas, your predecessor. He wouldn't raise the doors for me. Found me...fascinating was the word he used.<br>
(Getting melodramatic)<br>
He knew my soul would rot the longer it remained detached from the body. He just waited an hour, watching, till I got to THIS point (gestures to his decayed spirit form), no longer able to pass through EITHER door, TRAPPED to the spot of my death FOREVER!<br>
(Then, deadpan)<br>
Prick.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
How did you die?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Like this:<br>
<br>
((KANE replays the scene for JAKE. JAKE sees a human KANE running after a scared young woman, SYLVIA, with an axe, double sided, with a spike on one side and the cutting egde on the other. Throughout the action, KANE narrates from JAKE's side. JAKE is mesmerized by the woman's beauty.))<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Almost to himself)<br>
She's beautiful...<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Ah, Sylvia FOrrester. What divine breasts. They would have been perfect.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
For what?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
My collection. I was building a woman.<br>
<br>
((Human KANE is gibbering, calling out Sylvia's name, swinging the axe. He is gaining on her))<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
I had already collected a perfect ass, some LOVELY fingers, and a set of legs that went ALL the way up, and then stopped abruptly. (Chuckles) I just needed a few more parts...and then BAM, once more, a man in search of the perfect set of breasts finds himself victim to his own urges.<br>
<br>
((Human KANE is almost upon SYLVIA, swinging the axe as she trips. The AXE flies over her head and embeds itself into a tree. KANE tries to loosen the axe, as she gets up to run))<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
I should have just let her go. But breasts like those only come once in a lifetime. I, unfortunately, was about to find out how short a lifetime could be.<br>
<br>
((Human KANE grabs her and swings her around to face him, his back to the axe embedded in the tree. After a brief struggle, SYLVIA breaks away, pushing Human KANE back. Human KANE is impaled on the spiky ice-pick-like end of the axe.))<br>
<br>
((The scene fades to smoke))<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Ah, the death of a genius. With those breasts sewn onto my creation, hook her up to a generator to jump start those cells again, and viola! I'd give Frankenstein a run for his money. True, I hadn't gotten a head for my baby yet, but as soon as I could get Michelle Pfeiffer's home address.....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You're sick.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Hey, I'M not the one who volunteered to be Death. What I did was art. You're no more than a cosmic doorman.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Big difference, pal. My shift lets out in 24 hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Slyly)<br>
We'll see.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What do you mean by that? Judas gave me his word.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Dryly)<br>
You took the word of history's most diabolical traitor?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(uncertain now)<br>
Well, he sounded honest....<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Judas was a TAX collector, Jake.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Oh shit.<br>
<br>
<br>
((SUDDENLY, a low pitched choral arrangement fills JAKE'S head. it rises in pitch. He squeezes his eyes closed for a second))<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Something's....calling me.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
That's your next pickup, oh Garbageman from Hell....follow the sound to find your next trashbag....and by the way, change your outfit. Even tho you and I know that the perfect proof you're dead is for Death to come knocking as Evil Kenival, most people need a little more convincing.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
How do I change clothing? For that matter, how do I follow the sound?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(exasperated)<br>
With your MIND....remember, you left the world of the physical behind when you gave Judas your body. In the spirit world, the phrase &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; has a whole different meaning...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Right...think.<br>
<br>
((Closes eyes, and his outfit turns into an all black ensemble))<br>
<br>
How's this?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Not bad, but we'll work on the details later. Now you better follow that call before you have another ghostie walking the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I don't intend to see you again until I'm dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
In that case, see you soon (KANE winks, does a mock bow, and fades away)<br>
<br>
((JAKE watches him go, then closes his eyes))<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(In his mind)<br>
Follow the call....<br>

<br>
POLICE CARS are at the scene of a car accident, where the car has hit a telephone pole and has burst into flames. The car is a wreck. The POLICE OFFICERS are discussing the details of the accident as JAKE appears.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Thinks)<br>
Doors.<br>
<br>
(The Doors, black and white, spring up)<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
What happened here Billy?<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 2:<br>
<br>
Witnesses say the car drove head first into this telephone pole. The victim was going at least 90 at the time of collision. Funny thing is, no one heard a popped tire, a screech of brakes, nuthin'. Looks like he deliberately wrecked the car.<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
Suicide?<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 2:<br>
<br>
Who the fuck knows? The guy's always had a death wish, as far as I'm concerned.<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
You know the stiff?<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 2:<br>
<br>
Hell, YOU probably know him. You remember the race car driver, Jake Spillane?<br>
<br>
((JAKE freezes, then runs to the car))<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
Yeah, I remember him. Guy looked like he was always riding the edge of a razor.<br>
<br>
<br>
((JAKE reaches the car in time to see DEATH reach the white door. DEATH pauses to look at JAKE. JAKE looks down at the body on the stretcher. It is a burned, dead version of himself))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Nooo!<br>
<br>
<br>
((DEATH, looking frightened, dives through the white door. They disappear behind him. JAKE, almost sick, listens to the two officers))<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
So now what?<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 2:<br>
<br>
Now we tag 'im and bag 'im. At least with this guy gone the roads'll be a little bit safer.<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
Still what a waste. You remember that race at Daytona? Christ, what a crash he walked away from. You'd think he could survive anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 2: <br>
<br>
Yeah, the crashes were the only reason I watched the damned things. He sure knew how to put on a show.<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 1:<br>
<br>
Yeah, well, that show's over. Alright, I'll make you a deal. You notify the family and I'll do the paperwork.<br>
<br>
<br>
OFFICER 2:<br>
<br>
Deal. I hate fucking paperwork.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR: KANE'S FOREST, NIGHT<br>
<br>
Several flashlights cut through the dark. STACY says &quot;Yeah, he ran off here, but it's not like him to pull something like this for this long.&quot; A GROUP of MEN are searching for MICHAEL, calling out for him, in typical search party fashion. KANE is sneaking up behind one of the search party, malicious intent on his mind. Suddenly JAKE stomps up behind him, and spins him around, hand gripping shoulders.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Goddamit Kane! He screwed me!<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoyed it, sunshine.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Cut the shit!<br>
<br>
((JAKE is shaking KANE hard. On the word &quot;shit, KANE's HEAD falls from his shoulders and lands on the ground. JAKE is horrified))<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ!<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Now look what you've done! You've got me falling to pieces!<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
This is a fucking nightmare.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
No, this is it, Jake. Death. Disfigurement. Blood and guts and all that wet stuff. Better get used to it and (chuckle) get your head on straight. Um, speaking of, will you give me a hand? (JAKE just stares at the talking head) Never mind, I'll do it. (Puts head back on his shoulders)<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So what do I do now?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Why are you asking me? I'm just a ghost. Obviously I don't know a thing about death. Otherwise, I'd BE dead. Instead of ...(disgusted)...this.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You know a lot more than I do. I mean, Judas liked you, right? He must have talked to you about SOMETHING. Why else would he have kept you around?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Explosively) Because he's a sadistic FUCK!<br>
(Calms down, and then sweetly) But yes, he told me....many things. I know most of the rules....I think.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Focused)<br>
Tell me.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
For one thing, only take out the spirit after death. You know, DEAD PEOPLE. Do not, REPEAT NOT take a soul out of a living person. They go into comas and such, and after about an hour the body lays braindead while the soul begins to rot.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Ok, what else?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Hmm, anxious, aren't we? Two, in times of mass death, where you have to move large quantities of souls...in like, you know, train wrecks, war, massmurders with machine guns....then you set up the gray door instead of the black and white.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Gray door? What's behind the gray door?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
How the hell should I know? Have *I* ever been through the gray door? Use your head. Probably limbo or purgatory of some place like that. Judas had a saying &quot;Ship em out before they rot&quot;. If there's no time for them to make their own decisions, then they get no decision, and go through the gray door.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I don't like that one, but go on.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Always answer the call. ALWAYS. If a soul sings its song thatit needs help, go to it. Otherwise, the earth will become one huge ghostyard. ALWAYS answer the call. It's not often, but when it IS, you have to help them through.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Ok got it.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Four. Son't get involved. Don't listen to a sob story and let the secret out that they ultimately can pick whatever door they want. And NEVER choose for them. Don't ask me why, but even Judas respected that rule. Every person has the right to his own destiny. Oh, and one final rule. Have a nice day. Eternity is too long not to.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What happens if you break the rules?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Who knows? From what I understand, Judas never had the balls to break the rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
But what if he did? Would God punish him?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(With a snort)<br>
God? Who's he?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You know what I mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Listen, sunshine. For as long as I've been like this, God never paid me a visit. Or Judas either for that matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
There has to be SOMEONE who made this whole system up.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Well, if there is, He stayed hidden behind the doors. I'd ask Judas, for he probably knows now, be recently not-so-dearly-departed. Except.....OOOOPS...you can't do that. He suckered you into a job with the worst hours of all time, and the doors are inaccessible to you. Sorry, thank you for playing.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What if I pulled the same trick he did?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
What, find someone as stupid as you? There IS no one stupider than you.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
All kidding aside, from what I understand, the actual transfer cannot be done unless the person to be transferred believes he does not fear the idea of death. feels completely ambiguous to it. From what I understand, this is so rare it's almost unheard of. I hear Judas looked for 2000 years before finding you. What luck for him.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
And me.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
And THEN, in the almost impossible occurance that you DO find someone like that, then you have to convince him to trade with you. To spend eternity talking to ghosts and picking up dead chicks. Not a very thrilling job prospect.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I can always do what Judas did to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(fixing him with a look)<br>
Look, we both know that Judas was a bastard, but could you really trick someone into giving you their body like that? And besides, Judas WANTED to die and get the whole thing over with. He doesn't have to think about the repercussions anymore. Could you actually live from day to day in that new body, knowing you had screwed someone out of a natural life?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
To get MY life back? I think I could do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Maybe, but when you finally DID die, which door would YOU take?<br>
<br>
<br>
(Uncomfortable silence)<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
So I'm fucked.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Basically.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I ask again, what now?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Now? Now you wait for the call. And the next. And the next.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Completely depressed)<br>
And the next.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
And if you don't mind, I have some search party gentlemen to terrorize. It's those little perks in my day that makes it more bearable.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Just don't....kill anyone this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(With that wink of his)<br>
We'll see. Wouldn't want you to slack off on the job.<br>

Song Cue: A New Machine, Part 1<br>
<br>
A PRIEST drones on behind the music at the lowering of JAKE'S coffin into the ground. A large group of people, many race drivers, are at his funeral. PAUL is there, in his wheelchair, looking striken. He has taken the news of JAKE'S death extremely hard. JAKE watches speechless as PAUL wheels over to the hole in the ground and places JAKE'S old racing helmet on top of the coffin.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
(To coffin)<br>
You hardly ever used the damned thing anyway.<br>
(Then chokes, sobbing silently)<br>
<br>
(PAUL throws a handful of dirt over the coffin, and friends and family follow suit)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: PAUL'S HOUSE, NIGHT<br>
<br>
PAUL is staring at a whiskey bottle, three quarters empty. There is a shot glass next to him. The room is lit by candles alone. PAUL is VERY drunk. Pictures of him and JAKE lay on the table. He has been crying. The pictures depict him with both legs prior to the accident.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
Well, you did it Jake. You finally did it. You didn't win this time, or maybe you did, I don't know, I don't know....They say it was suicide. Well, I say you commited suicide a long time ago. But people needed you man. I...I needed you. (Crying hard) You fucking said you'd be there. Liar! Goddamned you! (Almost passing out) Dammit Jake. I miss you so bad. You're the only one who understood me...<br>
<br>
((PASSES OUT))<br>
<br>
((JAKE steps from the shadows where he has been listening. He notices that he can actually SEE PAUL'S legs as phantom images. Even tho PAUL's body is ravaged, PAUL'S soul is still complete.))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Forgive me, Paul, if I'm making a mistake.<br>
<br>
((JAKE then plunges his hands INTO PAUL, and draws him out of his body. This PAUL has both legs))<br>

(softly) <br>
No, it's not that you're drunk. It's really me.<br>

JAKE: <br>
<br>
Yes. And look. You're STANDING, man.<br>

<br>
PAUL:<br>

Oh christ I missed you man! I thought you were dead....<br>

<br>

JAKE:<br>
<br>
Yes. I know. It's sorta hard to explain. But I just wanted to show you that I'm ok, you know...? I can't really stay long, but I promise I'll be back each night to talk with you, and let you walk around a bit. But we can't stay long. Otherwise you'll di...understand?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
I'd gladly die, man. To get you and my legs back?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
No, no man. You don't understand. Not everyone stays around like I do. If they do, they rot away and turn into ghosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
But you look ok....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I'm...different. I'm like an angel. That's why I can take you out of your body like this. But you can't stay with me all day. Just a litle each time. Deal?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
Deal? of course it's a deal. Shit yeah it's a deal. But why Jake? They said you commited suicide....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Don't worry about it. They were wrong. ((Paul's face minutely begins to decompose)) Alright Paulie. Time's up for now. But I'll be back tomorrow, alright?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
But Jake, can't we...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
No, not now. ((pushing him gently back into his body)) Now, sleep.<br>

Music cue: Signs of Life<br>
<br>
ROY, a 40 something fisherman, is rowing his boat out on the water. He has on his fishing gear. He rows silently for a while, and then stands up, ready to throw the anchor. His feet snarl in the rope as he tosses the anchor, and he slips, hitting his head badly and tumbling unconscious into the water.<br>
<br>
JAKE arrives, floating over the water, feet not touching the sea. He is garbed completely in the traditional reaper robes, face obscured. ROY's body is still floating just under the surface, unconscious, drowning to death, blood clouding the water. Just as his body begins to slip beneathe the waves, JAKE reaches down and draws his soul up out of the water, as the body continues to sink. The whole scene should have the look of Michelangelo's Creation Scene in the Cistene CHapel, where God is reaching down to touch Adam's finger.<br>
<br>
The doors rise up, and JAKE solemnly points to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
ROY:<br>
<br>
I still have my children at home....<br>

<br>
Jake, tell me I'm not dreaming.<br>

You're not dreaming Paulie. Tomorrow when you know who won tonight's races you'll know you're not dreaming.<br>

And to have my legs back! Jake, when I found out you died, I almost killed myself. If I hadn't passed out that night I probably would have. Now you gave me my life back.<br>

An American DOCTOR examines a little African BOY while the BOY'S FATHER looks on stoically. There is an INTERPRETER, also African, standing by. The DOCTOR looks up, and shakes his head. The BOY is unmoving.<br>
<br>
<br>
DOCTOR:<br>
<br>
He's gone. I'm sorry. I couldn't stop the poison. Once the spider bit, it was all over for him.<br>
<br>
<br>
((The INTERPRETER repeats that to the family in their native language. The FATHER says something in return, and then he walks out of the room, still stoic.))<br>
<br>
DOCTOR:<br>
<br>
What did he say?<br>
<br>

INTERPRETER:<br>
<br>
He say since boy is so young, the Great Spirit will take favor on him.<br>

You are wrong. Our women cry. Our men anger. But not for death, for the Great Spirit. Fear only for the Great Spirit. We just do not show it, for the Great Spirit can sniff out fear like a tiger, and will pounce when you least expect.<br>
<br>
<br>
DOCTOR:<br>
<br>
So you respect your Great Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERPRETER:<br>
<br>
Respect It? No. Who could respect something that could take a child?<br>
<br>
<br>
DOCTOR:<br>
<br>
You mean, you worship your Great Spirit out of fear, instead of respect?<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERPRETER:<br>
<br>
(Softly)<br>
If you are feared by all, who needs respect?<br>
<br>
((PAUSE))<br>
<br>
Let us leave the body so the Great Spirit can collect its due, yes?<br>
<br>
((They leave))<br>
<br>
<br>
((The spirit of the BOY sits up and looks around the hut. He runs about, aimlessly, as a child does. He then spots his body and freezes. He is curious. He walks over to the body, tries to poke it, and stares as his hand passes through it. He turns to run in fear, and bumps into JAKE, dressed in full tribal shaman's robes and mask. The Doors are standing behind him.))<br>
<br>
JAKE points toward the doors. The BOY hides behind JAKE'S robes. He does not want to go to the doors. JAKE points again. The BOY comes out from behind the robes, but still looks reluctant. In the background, a crazy African beat swells. JAKE offers his hand to the BOY. The BOY takes it, and together, they walk to the doors.<br>
<br>
JAKE steps back, leaving the BOY before them. The BOY looks at both, and tentatively reaches for the black door.<br>
<br>
CLOSEUP, JAKE'S MASK<br>
<br>
The BOY suddenly drops his hand, turns to the white door, and steps through, waving bye as he does. You can hear the sound of the child's laughter as the doors disappear.<br>
<br>
((JAKE rips of his mask, hyperventillating. His face is haggard))<br>

<br>
JAKE and PAUL are sitting in PAUL'S living room.<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
You're WHAT?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Death. I'm Death, Paulie.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
This makes no sense, Jake. I can believe the angel thing; man, I WANT to believe it. I sorta still think this whole thing is some weird fucking dream...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
It's not a dream, Paul. You should know that now. Didn't you check to see who won those races last night?<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
I checked....and everyone I saw win DID win...but still Jake, that could be some psychic thing...you know...precognition or some fucking thing....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Fine. Believe what you want.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
No, it's not that, Jake. It's just this is getting crazier by the minute. This stuff about being Death and rotting souls is hard to swallow, you know? At least an angel I can believe in. They talk about angels all the time. But people have been dying for all time. You USED to be alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I told you....it's just a job I got screwed into taking. And as soon as I can get out of it, I will.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
But how?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I don't know, man, I don't know. But I'll find a way, somehow.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
I won't be able to see you anymore like this...with my legs, I mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I know, but I'll be alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
Well, you know, does it matter...?...I mean, we can always meet like this.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Of course it fucking matters! This might be heaven for you, Paul, but it's Hell for me! You know what I did today? I sent a KID through, man...do you have any idea what that's like? To see a kid die? A BABY? This fucking SUCKS, and I want out, as soon as I can.<br>
<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
I don't want...<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Fuck what you want! You think this is what *I* want?<br>
<br>

PAUL:<br>
<br>
Hey Jake....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE: <br>
<br>
Never mind...I...gotta go...<br>

INTERIOR: HOSPITAL LOBBY, DAY<br>
<br>
SYLVIA is walking through the lobby. She has a different hair cut than the scene with KANE being killed, and if anything, she is even more beautiful. She stops at the nurses station. DIANE, a nurse and friend of SYLVIA'S, is behind the desk.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Any change, Diane?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
Sorry Sylvia. Same as before. You want coffee on my break?<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Sounds good. I'm going to wait by his bed. Did anyone come by for him today?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
No. No one has.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
I'm dead tired. Come up and get me when you're ready. I'll probably catch a few winks in his room.<br>
<br>
((SYLVIA gets on elevator. Doors close))<br>
<br>
((Another NURSE has been watching. DIANE glances over at her))<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
That's Sylvia, the woman I was telling you about. She's always allowed into Mr. Somma's room. Unrestricted unless there's an emergency.<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
Is she his daughter?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
No, just a close friend. She lives in his apartment building. She's the one who found him in the coma. She's all he's got. Has a son, but so far the guy hasn't shown up. She reads to him, hoping he'll wake up. She's been coming to the hospital for the last four months, that's how we met. One tough woman there. She's been through some pretty rough times.<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
Haven't we all...<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
No, really. You remember the Kane killings in the Valley?<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
Who doesn't? Oh! One of her relatives was a victim?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
No. She's the one who finally killed the psychopath.<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
THAT Sylvia?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
That's Sylvia. Heart of gold, but a hell of a life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: SOMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM, DAY<br>
<br>
SYLVIA sits down, opens a book, and addresses MR. SOMMA, who is an old man, laying in a coma on the bed.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
It's me, Sylvia, again, Mr. Somma. Can you wake up for me today? (No response) Ok, you want to rest while I read, that's ok. Just try and wake up soon, ok? We're going to continue with Great Expectations. When I'm done with this, we'll go into David Copperfeild, ok? Ok.<br>
<br>
((An ORDERLY wheels in BARKER, who has a bandage around his head and is also in a coma))<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
Hi, Sylvia. Still on Great Expectations?<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Still going. I never read it before. I like it.<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
Well, today you have a larger audience. I'm going to put Mr. Barker in here.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Coma?<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
Yes. Looks like a mix of a head wound and post traumatic shock. You see the news last night?<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
No, I was in here until 3 in the morning. What happened?<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
This guy Barker and his girlfriend were coming home from a movie and walked into his apartment during a breakin. The thief smashed a crystal ashtry over Barker's head.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Oh my god! What happened to the girlfriend?<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
Raped.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Is she...<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
She's dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Did they catch whoever did it?<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
The guy? No. No fingerprints. They say they're following leads, but I don't think they'll find the guy. We just have to wait until Mr. Barker wakes up.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
How will that help?<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY<br>
<br>
The news said Barker probably saw the guy. They found him tied upright in a chair. They think the guy had him watch while he...well, you know...<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
That's horrible! He's lucky he's still alive!<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
If the neighbors hadn't banged on the door to tell them to quiet down, he'd probably be dead. The killer got out the way he got in, through the window. Ok, Mr. Barker. You're all set. Sylvia, we're short tonight. If Mr. Barker makes ANY move, give me a holler, ok?<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Sure, as long as I'm awake. Last night was a long one. I feel like I could fall asleep now.<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
Then get some sleep, or go home. I don't want to get you down, but Mr. Somma hasn't moved since he came in here. We'll let you know if he does.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
He just likes the sound of my voice, that's why he won't wake up. It's ok. He doesn't have anyone else to do this for him. I'll feel better if someone's here when he wakes up.<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
I give you credit. I would have given up long ago. Ok, Sylvia. Just get me if either Sleeping Beauty wakes up.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
No problem. Bye.<br>
<br>
<br>
ORDERLY:<br>
<br>
See ya ((leaves))<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Ok, gentlemen, here we go....<br>
<br>

DIANE is at desk. NURSE is doing some paperwork.<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
Hey Cindy, you want to watch the desk while I go on break?<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
Sure. See ya when you get back.<br>
<br>
<br>
((Continues to file paperwork, while DIANE gets into the elevator and presses the button to the seventh floor))<br>
<br>
((The door to the lobby slides open and WICKS enters. He's wearing a long black trenchcoat, and a hat. He's trying his best to keep his face hidden. He walks by the desk, down the hall, and slips into a room. NURSE never notices.))<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: SOMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM, NIGHT<br>
<br>
DIANE enters and finds SYLVIA asleep in the chair, book still in hand. DIANE shakes her head sympathetically and puts a planket over Sylvia, almost covering her completely. She then turns out the light in the room and leaves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: HOSPITAL LOBBY, NIGHT<br>
<br>
((WICKS emerges from the room, dressed as a doctor, mask and all. He walks over to NURSE))<br>
<br>
<br>
WICKS:<br>
<br>
Excuse me, Nurse. Could you tell me which room Mr. Barker is in?<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
Barker?<br>
<br>
<br>
WICKS:<br>
<br>
The coma patient they brought in yesterday. The one whose girlfriend got killed?<br>
<br>
<br>
NURSE:<br>
<br>
Oh, right. Just a moment. ((Looks through paperwork)) He's been transferred to the 7th floor, room 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
WICKS:<br>
<br>
Thanks so much.<br>
(Heads for the elevator)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: SOMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM, NIGHT<br>
<br>
JAKE arrives in the room, fading into view gradually. He is in reaper garb. He looks between the two beds. He is confused; which body should he take? Suddenly the spirit of MR. SOMMA sits up on the table.<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
If you've come for me, you've made some sort of mistake. I feel fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
((JAKE takes down the hood))<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
My, you're nothing like I expected. I was waiting for some decrepid skeleton.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You're about to die. That's why I'm here.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Nonsense. My body feels fine. I'm just locked into this damned coma.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Then how come you can see me?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
My boy, I've been climbing in and out of this body ever since I came to this hospital. I used to dabble a bit in the occult in my younger days. Just for knowledge sake, I'm not a witch or warlock or any rubbish like that. So when I realized my mind was trapped in this body, I tried all of the things the books had told me. And wouldn't you know--Astral Projection. Although I can't do this for long, maybe a half hour at a time. This is just a typical excursion for me. No need for you to be here.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE: <br>
<br>
(Confused)<br>
So then why am I here? I heard The Call, the voices singing....<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Ah, the legendary Song of the Dead! I've read about it. The author will be happy to know his theory was right. Though I suppose he already knows. He died 70 years ago. Maybe you remember him?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I doubt it, I'm new to this job.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
New? Job? Now THERE'S a twist I didn't anticipate.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You're taking this all extremely well. Most people are scared out of their minds.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
My boy, I've been through 77 years and two wars. NOTHING scares me anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
((Preoccupied)) <br>
Maybe I'm in the wrong room.<br>
<br>
((WICKS slips into the room. During all of this, SYLVIA has been sleeping))<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(Motioning to WICKS)<br>
Or maybe this doctor has something to do with it. He hasn't turned on the light, and usually they WANT to wake up the coma patients.<br>
<br>
<br>
((WICKS walks over to BARKER'S bed. He looks down at the patient for a second, and then removes his surgical mask and hat. The only sound is that of the EKG beeping and his breathing. JAKE and SOMMA watch. WICKS picks up a pillow and begins smothering BARKER))<br>
<br>
MUSIC CUE: Momentary Lapse of Reason<br>
<br>
((SYLVIA stirs and opens her eyes. She and WICKS lock eyes, fear on both their faces. WICKS reaches into a pocket and pulls out a scalpel, which he buries in BARKER'S chest. EKG flatlines. SYLVIA screams. SOunds of voices and footsteps echo through the halls. WICKS pulls on his mask and bolts through the door. During all of this JAKE has not removed his eyes from SYLVIA))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I've seen her somewhere before.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA<br>
<br>
You probably have. She was on every news station for months two years ago. She's the one who stopped Killer Kane.<br>
<br>
<br>
((BARKER'S spirit raises from the body. JAKE absentmindedly points to the doors, still fixed on SYLVIA. SOMMA walks BARKER to the doors, like an old grandfather type. BARKER chooses white, and goes through. JAKE doesn't even notice.))<br>
<br>
((Through the remainder of the song, we see brief clips of SYLVIA going through the next few days, mixed in with PAUL waiting for a JAKE who never comes and drinking more heavily. Throughout all of the SYLVIA scenes that follow, JAKE is standing in a simple black outfit, watching her.....it has a stalker feel to it.))<br>
<br>
SCENES:<br>
<br>
SYLVIA at the police station, describing WICKS, and getting a so-so picture from a police artist.<br>
<br>
SYLVIA walking home.<br>
<br>
PAUL pouring a drink, looking at the pictures again forlornly, then at his watch.<br>
<br>
SYLVIA in the shower.<br>
<br>
PAUL, drunk, nodding out and tumbling from his wheelchair.<br>
<br>
SYLVIA sleeping.<br>
<br>
PAUL lying on the floor.<br>
<br>
(Change to DAYLIGHT scenes)<br>
<br>
SYLVIA back at the hospital, reading to SOMMA. JAKE watches her, fascinated by her, in love with her. SOMMA sits next to him, shaking his head sadly.<br>
<br>
PAUL back in his chair, a new bottle, another drink, badly hung over.<br>

KANE is lying on the grass, watching the sky. JAKE runs up.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Kane!<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Go away, Jet Boy. You're blocking my sun.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Did Judas ever fall in love?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Just stares at him for a moment, then bursts out laughing)<br>
With WHAT? A woman?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Yes, a woman.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Living or dead?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Living.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Dismissing him)<br>
At least once a year. Became a regular peeping tom. Must have had blue balls to rival the worst.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What did he do about it?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Oh, he'd wait 20 or 30 years till they got old and fat and then thank god he hadn't been alive to marry 'em. Or, if they died young, he'd profess his undying love to them when he went to pick them up and usually have them in hysterics, screaming. Who the hell wants Death to be in love with them? First date, and you're dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Didn't he draw them out?<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
Draw them out? Of their bodies? That's against the rules. I told you Judas was a coward. (Suddenly realizing) Hey, you're not thinking of drawing out some sweet young thing, are you?<br>
<br>
(JAKE says nothing)<br>
<br>
HA! On the job less than a week and already falling in love. You're such a sap. Anyone I know?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, it is. Sylvia Forrester.<br>
<br>
<br>
KANE:<br>
<br>
(Staring hard at him, then shrugs, ruffled)<br>
Kiss her hello for me.<br>
<br>
(JAKE begins to fade away)<br>
<br>
In fact, do me one better. Draw her out, and don't let her back in. Make her a ghostie so *I* can get a poke at her!<br>
<br>
(JAKE's face is stoic as KANE'S insane laughter echoes behind him)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: PAUL'S LIVING ROOM, DAY<br>
<br>
A phone rings. After four rings, PAUL's machine picks it up.<br>
<br>
PAUL'S VOICE<br>
<br>
Hi, this is Paul. EIther I'm not at home, or this damned chair has a flat and I'm crawling across the floor to get to the phone. Either way, after the beep, leave a message and I'll get right back to you. By the way, if this is Legs-R-Us? I'll take two, to go....See ya.<br>
<br>
(MACHINE beeps, and you can hear DREW'S voice on the machine)<br>
<br>
DREW'S VOICE:<br>
<br>
Hey Paulie, are you there? Hello hello hello. Well, guess not. Listen, Paul, you haven't been out of the house since the whole thing with Jake, man. I was wondering if you wanted me to pick you up and bring you to the track tonight. The guys and I are sorta worried about ya. Well, since you're obviously not there, I hope I see you tonight. Take care, man.<br>

Jake.<br>

Am I dreaming, Jake?<br>

<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Who are you?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>

I'm an angel.<br>

SYLVIA:<br>

My guardian angel?<br>

Yes.<br>

SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Why are you here?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I love you.<br>
From the first moment I saw you.<br>
<br>
<br>
(JAKE pulls SYLVIA in for a kiss. Switch scenes back and forth between THEM and the PAUL scenes)<br>
<br>
JAKE and SYLVIA slowly build the passion until they are making love, floating in midair, with the backdrop sort of washed out, with a phantom wind blowing, very arty looking....high class love scene, dreamlike quality to it, intersperced with footage of PAUL ------<br>
<br>
PAUL taking cap off of sleeping pills.<br>
<br>
PAUL downing the pills, then a huge swig of whiskey.<br>
<br>
PAUL popping more pills.<br>
<br>
PAUL gagging, falling from wheelchair.<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
You'll come now. You have to.<br>
<br>
<br>
(While JAKE is with SYLVIA, PAUL dies. JAKE hears the song, The Call. JAKE pauses in his lovemaking)<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
What is it.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Nothing. (Gently kisses the back of her hand, opens her hand and kisses her palm. He then returns to making love)<br>

So, what do you want me to do about it? Administer the ceremony? Give away the bride?<br>

No. That won't work.<br>

Why not? Cause she'd rot? Hell, we ALL rot, Jake, eventually. Worm food, buddy. Ashes to ashes, shit to shit...so what if she looks like a train wreck victim after an hour? You can't tell me you're so shallow that you only love her for her breasts....or are you....?....Is this &quot;true love&quot; or &quot;Do Me&quot; love?<br>

JAKE:<br>
<br>
You're a sick bastard, Kane. It's a shame you couldn't pass out of this world completely. Instead you had to leave your soul here like a disease.<br>

Blame Judas. Fucked us both. But take my advice, Jake....you can have her forever.<br>

You disgust me....<br>

Oh, you'll think about it. Give it a little time. The older she gets, the more you'll think about it. You'll think about it. Enough time you'll wish you'd taken her...just wait...we all rot Jake. Everything rots. Except you....and you get to watch it all....watch it all rot away....!<br>

(No answer, and suddenly two ABULANCE ATTENDANTS come from the other room, carrying PAUL'S BODY on a stretcher, with a white sheet over him. They exit through the front door. A POLICE OFFICER is putting an empty bottle of sleeping pills and an empty whiskey bottle into separate plastic bags, handling them with care. JAKE is stricken)<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Paulie, no....<br>

<br>
(JAKE begins running from room to room, searching frantically. Finally he stops in the darkened bedroom where PAUL'S wheelchair rests. JAKE looks wiped out.)<br>

JAKE:<br>

<br>
<br>
PAUL:<br>
<br>
I AM dead. I've been dead for twelve hours Jake....<br>
<br>
((PAUL emerges from the shadows. He is floating in midair, his legs two withered, rotted stumps, his face hideous, a parody of his former self. He has become a disgusting, bloated, horribly frightening ghost. JAKE steps back involuntarily.))<br>

You went away. I didn't even know if you had been real in the first place. I thought either way, I was crazy and would be dead, or I'd see you again....even if for a little while....I thought behind that fucking white door I'd get my legs back, permanently. But look at me....LOOK AT ME!! They were the first fucking things to rot off. Right in front of my eyes, while I waited for you to show up. You always said that YOU'D BE THERE!

<br>
A gray beam of light strikes JAKE and illuminates him as:<br>
<br>
MUSIC CUE: A New Machine, PART II<br>
<br>
JAKE is staring at the floor during the music. At the end of the song, the SONG OF THE DEAD (The Call) starts, louder than ever before. Voices on top of voices.<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(softly) I'm coming...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EXTERIOR: BATTLEFIELD (EITHER JUNGLE OR DESERT)<br>
<br>
MUSIC CUE: Dogs of War<br>
<br>
<br>
Several ARMED AMERICAN SOLDIERS are sneaking across the battlefeild, attempting not to be seen. Depending on whatever world crisis we ar ein at the time will decide whether it is through the jungle or across the desert. SERGEANT turns to whisper to his men.<br>
<br>
SERGEANT:<br>
<br>
This is it. We get across now and we're home free back to base. We've dealt with enough shit. Run low and run fast. No one's coming back in to get you, so don't fuck this up. (pulls his gun in close to his body) Now...GOGOGO!<br>
<br>
SCENES:<br>
<br>
The first mortar explodes, and a row of claymore mines go up. Men on both sides are screaming, as the enemy engages them. Men are dying left and right.<br>
<br>
American soldier blown up by a trip wire mine.<br>
<br>
Enemy soldier multiply shot in the chest, goes down, his machine gun firing reflexively in the air.<br>
<br>
American soldier tosses a grenade.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE, dressed in black army fatigues and wearing a black beret, with camoflauge face paint, marches in. The Gray Door opens up in the middle of the battle field.<br>
<br>
JAKE marches over to the men who died, yanking out their souls from their bodies even as they die. The mens' souls are still screaming; JAKE makes a terrifying soldier. Some acknowledge their bodies left behind, some are completely unaware they are dead.<br>
<br>
JAKE forcefully THROWS them through the open gray door, with the strength of a superman. They go screaming in. Some try to grab the edges, but JAKE uses the butt of the RIFLE slung over his shoulder to knock their hands free and WHOOSH, they get sucked through the door.<br>
<br>
He disentangles an American soldier and the enemy soldier, who have stabbed each other to death, and sends them both sailing through the door.<br>
<br>
The scene ends with JAKE standing on a corpse littered battlefeild, as the camera spins around him. He is screaming at the sky, at God, incoherantly, hands locked into claws as the camera circles him three times, going faster each spin. It suddenly locks onto JAKE'S face and goes into an extreme closeup as he gives almost an animal's howl.<br>
<br>
The gray door disappears with a flash. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/23/03 1:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Knocking On Heaven's Door (Notes and Screenplay)</span><hr size=1> INTERIOR: HOSPITAL CAFETERIA, DAY<br>

<br>
Sylvia, you have got to tell me what's going on. Who is he? Don't tell me there's not a man, because I haven't seen you this happy since...well, I HAVEN'T seen you this happy.<br>

Nope. And the man was perfect in every way, let me tell you. I think I could sleep three days straight with him there.<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE:<br>
<br>
I wish *I* had a guardian angel like that. Honey, you've got that &quot;glowing&quot; thing going on right now. I always thought it was bullshit till today. Figures, it was a dream. No real man can do that.<br>

SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
At least no man I've ever known.<br>
<br>

DIANE:<br>

Well, I've got to get out of here. It's getting dark, and they still haven't caught that psychopath yet.<br>

Hey, how are you doing with that? It would scare the hell out of me to be alone in that apartment after that.<br>

<br>
It's creepy, but I'm doing ok, I guess. I've been through worse...<br>

You shouldn't have had to go through ANY of it....listen honey, if you need me, you know where to find me....<br>

No fear. And if Mr. Somma wakes up....<br>

<br>
SOMMA's spirit is sitting upright in his hospital bed, protruding from his lying body. JAKE is sitting in a chair next to him, very serious, very pale. JAKE is looking more skeletal every day.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
If you don't mind me saying, you look like hell.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
It hasn't been a good couple of days.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Try living in a coma. I feel like one of those &quot;ghosts&quot; you were talking about.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
But you're alive, and can talk to me. That's the part I can't figure out.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
I'm probably what you call a special case. But I think your real problem lies in figuring out what you're going to do about Sylvia.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I know.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
She's a wonderful girl. After she had killed Kane, she was an emotional wreck. She spent many a day drinking coffee in my apartment, reliving her demons and letting an old man with no companionship banter for hours. We helped each other. I just hate to see you do this to her.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Taken aback)<br>
What?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
When she was in here today, reading, I could tell her mind was preoccupied. Now I know what she was thinking of...you. A young woman like her should be thinking of the living, not the dead. Not that I'mjealous...I'm one foot in the grave myself. But this relationship, &quot;dream lover&quot; thing you've started can't be healthy for her.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Why not?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
You can't take her out every day. One day she's going to ask you why you can only visit for an hour and you'll break down and tell her the truth, and that will destroy her. Or, worse, one day you're not going to pay attention and she'll end up lost in the ether like your friend Paul. Do you really want to put her in jeopardy? Or live your relationship as a lie?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(softly)<br>
No.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
And another thing to consider. She'll be growing older, while you stay perpetually at this age. What happens when she DOES die? Will you keep her from going through the doors?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Of course not. Jesus, no.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Then I suggest you break off contact with her. This isn't at all healthy.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Of course you're right.<br>
(Thoroughly depressed)<br>
Kane was right. There can't be a God.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Nonsense.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What god could let things like this happen?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
What? Not allow you to ruin a young woman's life? A merciful one, I would suppose.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
No. I mean all of this. This whole system. Disease. Accidents. War. Death. You couldn't imagine the things I've seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
My boy. You can't imagine the things I'VE seen. You're shocked now, but you are just beginning to open your eyes, and the truth bothers you. From what you've told me about yourself, you've never stared Death right in the face. Sure, you've skirted it and flirted with it, but you were like a shy boy at his first dance, not willing to look into your partner's eyes. I've seen death, plenty of it. It's the natural way of things. And I've learned to accept it, and in turn, understand it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Everything rots, Kane said. How can you accept that?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
The best fertilizer is that which has died. We're all fertilizer. We sacrifice our bodies that God has loaned us to help more grow. The soul doesn't die, not if given the proper passage. Who knows what lies beyond that white door? Or the black, for that matter? But it must be SOMETHING worth living and dying for. Why else would it be there? If there wasn't a God, who set UP the whole thing in the first place? I don't know if he's a merciful god, or a terrible god, or both, or just some space alien from Planet X. But I have to believe there is some form of higher being. Otherwise, I believe I would go mad. There has to be some reason for our lives, and for our souls to continue on when our flesh withers. That's called faith, Jake, and it's one of the most powerful forces in the world. It's made religions, started wars, and created miracles. I don't want to live in a world without faith. It would kill any chance of Hope, and hope gave me a reason to wake up every day.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I understand. My god, you have a better grip on this than I do. I only wish...<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Wish what?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I wish there was some way I could touch her. I mean really touch her, touch her face, if only for a second....<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
You could, I imagine. There is a way.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Take my body.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You mean like possess you or something?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
No. Take my body. Trade with me. I don't fear death. I haven't feared it for years.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
(Finally understanding)<br>
Take your body....<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
You're obviously not cut out for this, while I think I might have find the whole thing rather fascinating. Imagine, after years of studying the occult, to actually EXPERIENCE death from a whole new angle. The only drawback is you'd probably only have a few weeks, tops, in a rather frail old wrinkled body.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
You don't know what I'd give.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(soft)<br>
Yes, I think I do. And you may have the will I don't to break out of the coma. Are you willing to take that chance?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I've been taking risks against death all my life. This time I'll take a risk against LIFE.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Then we'll do it. I must say, I find the prospect exciting.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
The hours suck. (Laughs)<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(with a wink)<br>
But for me, the perks are worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
((Suddenly JAKE hears the SONG OF THE DEAD))<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
What's the matter?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
The Call. I've got to go, one more time. I won't leave anymore ghosts walking around.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Then godspeed, and hurry back. The old body of mine hasn't been feeling up to snuff lately, and I believe time is of the essense for both of us.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Yes, I'll be right back.<br>

<br>
JAKE appears, looks at her door.<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Oh no...<br>
<br>
((JAKE runs right THROUGH the door. CAMERA closeup on name on mailbox &quot;Forrester, Sylvia&quot;))<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: SYLVIA'S APARTMENT<br>
<br>
JAKE runs through the apartment, searching for SYLVIA. He finally comes to a dark bedroom, where SYLVIA is in front of a mirror, not looking in it, putting her earrings into a box. WICKS is standing behind her, a long butcher knife raised.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
NOOOOOOOOO!<br>
<br>
<br>
(SYLVIA'S head snaps up. She has heard him, even tho he does not reflect int he mirror. But WICKS does reflect, and she sees him. She spins around and dodges to the side as WICKS buries the knife into the wood bureau. SYLVIA hits WICKS with thelamp by the bed. It shatters over his head and he staggers. SYLVIA tries to get away, but WICKS grabs her, hands locking around her throat, as he tries to strangle her.)<br>
<br>
(SYLVIA gropes and finds the knife. She pulls it free of the bureau)<br>
<br>
(WICKS tightens, intent on killing her)<br>
<br>
(SYLVIA staps him in the back, the knife coming through him and almost stabbing herself in the process)<br>
<br>
(WICKS shudders, a look of shock on his face, and dies)<br>
<br>
(SYLVIA runs from the room)<br>
<br>
<br>
(WICK'S SPIRIT rises from the body. JAKE raises the doors. WICKS looks at JAKE, smiles and begins walking toward the white door)<br>
<br>
((SUDDENLY, JAKE reaches for WICK'S shoulder, and spins him around, so WICK'S back is to the black door))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
Fuck the rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
(JAKE punches WICKS in the face. WICKS staggers back, splintering open the Black Door. He is sucked through and gone.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: SOMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM<br>
<br>
JAKE appears next to SOMMA'S bed. He pulls the old man from his body urgently.<br>
<br>
JAKE: Let's do it. If I see her again, I won't be able to help myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Do you know how?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I think I'll manage, it's all in the mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Then let's begin.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Scene fades, then comes back in. SOMMA, in reaper's robes, stares at his own body as JAKE'S imagine, which is superimposed over it, fades from view.)<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Good luck, son. I hope you have the will to wake up.<br>
<br>
<br>
((The body on the bed does not respond))<br>

<br>
The scene switches back and forth.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA on the hospital bed, not moving. The scene shifts to show the passing of time, as his EKG slows down.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA sleeping, restlessly. Every now and then she sits bolt upright in bed. Once she says &quot;Jake!&quot; but then goes back to sleep, a tear rolling from her closed eye.<br>
<br>
At the end of one of these scenes, she says:<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Well, it was a beautiful dream....<br>
<br>
then cut to:<br>
<br>
(SYLVIA'S phone ringing. It's DIANE's voice on the other side. SYLVIA wakes up with a start)<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Hello?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE'S VOICE:<br>
<br>
Sylvia, get to the hospital quick....Mr. Somma woke up....<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
What??? He did?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE'S VOICE:<br>
<br>
Hurry, he's going fast...<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
<br>
DIANE'S VOICE:<br>
<br>
He's been asking for you, honey. But he's dying....<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
I'll be right there. Tell him to hold on!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: CAB<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA is in the back seat as the cab driver races along.<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Just hold on, Mr. Somma....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INTERIOR: SOMMA's HOSPITAL ROOM<br>
<br>
Several doctors are doing doctor things, trying to keep SOMMA holding on. SYLVIA rushes to his side.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(Holding out hand)<br>
Sylvia....<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
I'm here....you....finally decided nap time was over, huh?<br>
(She takes his hand)<br>
<br>
<br>
((In the background, you hear a nurse say &quot;He's back at normal&quot; and a doctor answer &quot;That was close....&quot;))<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(irritably to the voices)<br>
Of course I'm alright. Just had a bad moment. Now get out and leave me alone for a minute.<br>
<br>
((Doctors and nurses back off, but don't leave. SOMMA gives them an exasperated look, and turns to SYLVIA))<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
(Near tears)<br>
You're alive! and awake!<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(whispering, with a smile on his face)<br>
Not for long. But I don't want to waste my last minutes with them.<br>
<br>
<br>
SYLVIA:<br>
<br>
Mr. Somma...<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Shhhh. ....don't cry when I'm gone....I'm going to a higher place. And remember, even if you can't see him, your guardian angel will be watching over you (takes her hand to his lips, kisses the back of it, then her palm...)<br>
<br>
((SOMMA dies))<br>
<br>
((SYLVIA'S eyes well with tears, but are open, amazed, looking at the spot where he kissed her palm, then back to the dead old man in the bed))<br>
<br>
((Behind her stands SOMMA dressed in reaper garb. The SONG of the DEAD is humming. JAKE'S spirit rises out of the dead body on the hospital table.))<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Was it worth it?<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
It was worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
((SOMMA raises the doors))<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
You know the routine.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
But wait, if you have any questions, you need to ask Kane....<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Oh, I've met Kane already. I had to after your lovely description of him. But he won't be causing anymore trouble with sudden deaths in those woods anymore. I told him if he was VERY good I'd set him free to go through the white door.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
What? You figured out how to DO that?<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
(with a wink)<br>
No. I lied. But HE believed it.<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
It's been a pleasure knowing you. You'll do a better job. I know it.<br>
((Then JAKE'S smile fades))<br>
Now, I should go.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
((JAKE walks towards the doors. He walks up to the black door and pauses in front of it))<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I know you might not understand this, but this is the only door I could take.<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
But why??<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
I was given this job, however much I didn't want it, and I had a responsibility to it. I made mistakes....<br>
<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
We all make mistakes....<br>
<br>
<br>
JAKE:<br>
<br>
...and caused a lot of pain for those I loved. Please, don't try to talk me out of this. It's eating me up inside. It's the only choice I can make.<br>
<br>
<br>
((JAKE reaches for the doorknob and tries to turn it)<br>
<br>
((The BLACK DOOR is LOCKED))<br>
<br>
((JAKE spins to face SOMMA))<br>
<br>
SOMMA:<br>
<br>
Don't look at ME! <br>
(Then, glancing heavanward, says)<br>
Looks like someone else chose for you....<br>
<br>
<br>
(JAKE looks up for a moment, then turns toward the white door)<br>
<br>
(JAKE opens the white door)<br>
<br>
(JAKE'S body is momentarily washed out by a beautiful white light filling the open doorway)<br>
<br>
(A child's voice is heard laughing from within, just JAKE'S sillouette is seen against the bright white doorway)<br>
<br>
(The shadow of the african BOY appears briefly, reaching up to hold JAKE'S hand, and leads him into the light. The door closes behind him, and disappears)<br>
<br>
<br>
(SOMMA looks at SYLVIA, watching them wheel away his old body. She is crying, but the tears are also full of wonder, as she touches her palm where JAKE had kissed her.)<br>

Only thing I would change is the ending, it was way to happy.<br>
<br>
I would like to see him thank Somma for the chance he was given. Somma then summons the doors but he sees that Jake makes no move to enter either door. Jake turns to Somma and tells him he is sorry but he cannot enter either door, he has caused great pain and done many wrongs while acting as death and now must try to make ammends on at least one of those. With a sad look on his face he slowly walks out of the room and out of the hospital. The camera follows him as he continues to walk and slowly rot. Finally the last scene we see Jake is a decomposed and gruesome image of his former self and he is walking up to a familiar house that we (the viewer) recongnize as Paul's.<br>
<br>
<br>
I suck at the actual writing compared to you, but that ending would be harsh and very Kubrick-esqu if done up with your awesome writing style.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tropicsdelight>TropicsDelight</A> at: 1/23/03 6:19:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyanravyn>Cyanravyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 360<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/25/03 1:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Knocking On Heaven's Door (Notes and Screenplay)</span><hr size=1> River, email me please<br>
