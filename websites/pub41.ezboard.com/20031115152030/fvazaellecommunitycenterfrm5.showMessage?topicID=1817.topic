Triality (a fairly n00b guild when compared to EA, AD, PO, etc) is in Kael faction farming and waiting for clerics to log in for a Vindi and Statue kill.  We have a member from AD and a member from EA hanging out with us.  As soon as our fourth cleric logs on, we move to the Vindi pull spot, form our groups, and buff up.  However, as soon as we announce that our fourth cleric has logged in and start moving to Vindi pull spot, members from AD and EA begin showing up.  Within minutes, Kael goes from 40 people to 124 people.<br>
<br>
We talk to the leaders of each guild who both state that they are only interested in AoW.  They will gladly let us take Statue and then we will get the hell out of their way.  However, AD gets scared with so many EA in the zone that they decide they can't wait for us to drop Vindi and Statue.  Their solution: they place themselves right next to us and start buffing themselves while we pull Vindi.  Our CH clerics all immediately ping at 5k and get 3-8 second lag.  The first CH doesn't even land before MA is dead.  LMAO.  As soon as Triality is dead and Vindi is at 60%, AD engages him and kills him.<br>
<br>
Next, AD moves in and kills the Statue.  Dabamf sends the following tell to Triality's officer still in Kael: &quot;Sorry to do that to you guys but we can't afford to wait with EA in the zone.&quot;  After Statue dies, AD kills Idol.  However, they slowed him first and still needed 20 minutes to rez the 30 or so corpses.  At this point, you might think that AD's leaders would say, &quot;Well, guys.  We almost wiped to Idol even with it slowed.  There is no fucking way that we have a chance to kill AoW.  Since EA has proven that they can kill AoW, we are going to step aside and let them have it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope.  They still insist that the AoW spawn is theirs (maybe they just want to see how far down they can bring him in order to guage their current progress or something? /shrug).  However, while AD is screwing around with CRing, EA pulls and kills AoW.  LMAO again.<br>
<br>
Petitions happen and Brettan shows up.  The end result: Brettan says &quot;Bad EA.  Don't do that again or I'll have to warn you.  Have a nice day!  Here are some lollipops to go with your new pants.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can't wait to read the shit talking that this ganking is going to generate.  I personally don't give a shit that AD screwed us to get to AoW.  After all, Vindi pops every 8 hours, and we are not a sure bet to kill Statue anyway...only done it once.  However, I do find it mildly amusing that Karma bit them in the ass so quickly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dulyendetrimental>DulyenDetrimental</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>teh rewl~</span><br>  Posts: 1162<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/02 10:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1817.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Soap Opera in Kael</span><hr size=1> I'd say thats a bad move for AD, if they know they can't take down AoW why fuck with something you can't fuck with?<br>

<br>
Idol was not slowed until 14%, so please dont get the holier than thou attitude on that part, he was not slowed right away. We didnt have the healing power towards the end /shrug. So we kill Idol, rez the dead, and coth our additional cleric and spot healers for the AoW attempt that didnt happen. <br>
<br>
Vindi was 100% when we had began the fight, unless his regen had become insane in the last 3 days, I doubt we mopped up your wipe. You all died and I am sure dabamf might be saying EA has a million peeps in zone, we cant wait all day.<br>
<br>
As for the vindi part, I can only say my apologies as to the lag thing, i also blame Sony for the insane lag with /serverfilter not functioning perfectly, but I do believe dabamf tried to move us as far from your fight as possible - i dont think many AD recognized your different fighting spot than what we typically do.<br>
<br>
EA and AD do not get along much - there is hella pressure when any significant portions of peeps of both guilds are in the same zone. I would assume an uber wizard of your caliber would understand the tensions that this might create in a zone. <br>
<br>
While I thank you for inflaming an issue I believe you had very little factual info on, I wish to send a hearty STFU to a fellow &quot;uber&quot; sorcerer. I am not gonna pretend to know everything that happened but I do agree with ya karma is a bitch and all things come back to bite you in the long run. For me its just a game of waiting now.<br>

No it does not.  Also, the statue was slowed at 14 percent on first attempt.  SO, do not go saying we have no chance of killing AoW.  I think we would have shut the server up about AD's potential with AoW if EA had not done THE single most gimpest act I have witnessed in EQ.<br>
 <br>
I am sorry about Vindi I really am.  We try not to step on toes of other guilds because we respect them.  We also thry not to have hot man sex with each other like EA does (not Eastern Alliance).  I should have applied to EA to have have hot man sex.  Oh wait, I am not gay but EA leaders are.  Conflict of interests, nevermind.<br>
<br>
I never had a beef with EA members as a whole.  I really did not.  I only disliked the ones who go out of their way to show how big their balls are and make a scene. &quot;EA guud! We follow AD around because we have 'Dominus Envy' &quot; <br>
<br>
Why don't you change your name to Dominus Envy?  I am not ashamed to say that I won't be grouping with any EA members any time soon accept maybe like two I know are too cool to be in EA anyways.  Not every one of them is at fault but how can the cool people(as few as there are in EA) stay in that mass hot man sex guild?  <br>
<br>
Liars!!  It is very classy how EA lied to Brettan about how STUPID they are.  <br>
<br>
Papers' wording of what happened in short, &quot;Brettan, we are one of the top 5 guilds on the server and we were not aware pulling a triggered mob is against policy.  The CC members helping us were ALSO not aware of the policy&quot;<br>
<br>
Enjoy your AoW kill EA, and when you are all crying on your pillows at night(or biting them whichever) I hope you get cancer in your colon and die, and have to sell your EQ accounts to pay for your medication because you are so deep in debt due to bills your grandkids will hate you.  I want to travel back in time, and convince the mothers of the current EA leaders to have abortions because that would honestly make this Virtual world a better place for most rather than few. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gonuso>Gonuso</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://site.yahoo.net/lib/gastrolicious/banana1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pimpbot 5000</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/02 10:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1817.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://site.yahoo.net/lib/gastrolicious/banana1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Soap Opera in Kael</span><hr size=1> aarc, sorry to dispell the notion you have, but vindi was at 100 percent when i ran up past the see invis line on the way to the arena and he somehow warped onto me during the pull.

I know for a fact we could have killed the Idol non-slowed, if we didn't have to worry about EA ganking the idol if we didn't move on it fast.  Specifically the Nisk telling Dabamf 'you got 20 minutes' comes to mind.  We had 6 to 7 more people inc, several of them healers.  Additionally in the lag, we had two healers go linkdead.  I'm sure that the &quot;mules&quot; running in and out of the camp didn't help the situtation.<br>
<br>
Regarless, gratz EA on the AoW and loots.  At least Nisk knows, and the rest of EA, that pulling &quot;triggered mobs&quot;  is against the rules of conduct.  And Kixx, your right, Papers words are harse, but then again, when people cheat at a game, it rubs you the wrong way.<br>

Yeah that is a valid threat.

Specifically when I don't even have to think.<br>
<br>
Regarding Triality.  We knew statue was up, and we were waiting for our 3rd cleric to log on so we'd have a decent attempt at idol.  I saw them in there when we had maybe 17 people online.  We could have gone in easy (20+ with apps) and killed but we didn't, because we were only really concerned about AoW even though we still very much need st keys.  Over an hour later I figure at least Vindi is dead and statue is being pulled, so we call forces to kael.  We arrive and find out vindi isn't even pulled yet, much less killed.  I told dunadaine that vindi/statue was all theirs.  However I noticed EA showing up rapidly, and only a moron would stick around and wait for competition to be as ready as we are.  We moved up to the OPPOSITE side of arena as Triality.  We gave them plenty of space.  Prepped right next to you? Please.  You were at the kael area entrance, we moved to the left side ramp near the dead end.  A good 20 second run at least.  Anyway, Triality wipes, so I run over there real fast to see what's going on.  I see vindi at 99%, so I wait a second to let him finish regening, then pull and we kill.  I believe what I said to dunadaine was more along the lines of &quot;sorry, we had no time to wait, we had to kill&quot; etc etc.  I didn't say &quot;sorry to do that to you&quot; because even the most courteous guilds - which I like to thing we are - don't wait for multiple attempts at a mob when there is a competitor breathing down their necks.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on to EA.<br>
We hear statue is up, and wanting to take AoW for a month and always lacking healing or dmg, except for today, sorta.  We arrive buff up etc. and notice EA gathering so we push it fast.  Kill vindi and statue as quick as possible and move to a dead end on one side of arena, with EA at the other.  Nisk tells me we have 20 min to engage idol or they are pulling, as well as other tidbits (DONT SLOW IDOL - I know you can't kill him, you'll wipe, you can't kill him, you better not slow).  Alright whatever.  We couldn't kill aary either right?<br>
<br>
So anyhow, we pull idol.  I won't go into the details but we made a couple significant mistakes and managed to get him to 14% (too bad PO was raiding huh, or he woulda died cuz they kill EVERYTHING for us!).  KNOWING EA was right there, we slowed it at 14% and finished him with whoever was left alive.  We would never slow idol and blow AoW spawn.  It was quite evident EA was prepped and ready to engage if we were to wipe to AoW, so no harm done at all...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>An interesting bit of info, Nisk tells me, &quot;killing idol unslowed is a right of passage, you can't kill idol slowed till you kill aow&quot;.  Hi, I witnissed a slowed idol kill before you killed AoW <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (I know it was killed unslowed before that galliamus so think of another retarded comment to make)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It is fairly obvious that with 14% to go on first attempt ever with big mistakes we are capable of killing him np.  Chances are quite good we would have killed AoW given his recent gimpage.<br>
<br>
-Begin rant here-<br>
We res and rebuff and I'm ready to start clearing to arena when I hear EA's inc msg.  First thinking it's just a joke, cuz no guild could sink that low as to steal a triggered spawn, fully knowing the rules (more on that later), I ran over and find him engaged.  He dies followed by multiple self-congrats spammings in shout (laff) so of course we petition such utter bullshit.  Brettan arrives and states the rules that the guild who triggers a mob such as AoW has first rights to the mob.  EVERYONE of you fuckers knows the rules.  I'm sure no one read the PO/CC rant a while back regarding Cursed right?  Nisk claims ignorance so Brettan does nothing.  You're fooling everyone there, huh Nisk...don't bullshit me.  You just look like a bigger gimp when you try to cover yourself up with excuses that any moron knows are obviously BS.<br>
<br>
If we can't kill these mobs why are you so worried?  We &quot;couldn't&quot; kill Aary, yet you did everything in your power to stop us from attempting.  We &quot;can't&quot; kill AoW, yet the minute we show up you start arriving also.  Why so scared?  <br>
<br>
Why don't you quit making excuses for yourselves.  First, we have gm friends.  We get Aary on a silver platter because we got the connections.  That lasted a bit but maybe after everyone realized Galliamus is a complete moron you had to cling to another excuse why you aren't miles ahead of us?  So the PO thing comes in.  &quot;We can't kill anything without PO's help&quot;.  Right...I recall 2 times anyone has even laid a finger on one of our mobs.  Israi was there to watch our first Aary kill - I don't know if he even did anything, and I think Akethadar began fighting Exiled when he was at 20% to us once - which followed but us giving Cursed to them because we had 30 people there and shit for taunt weapons.  Yea sure they walk us through everything.  You've jumped ahead a bit while we were/are stuck in a rut and you are still making excuses that only make you look more and more gimp.<br>

Nisk, this is bullshit #2 (first being &quot;ohh I didn't know you were pulling Ikatiar I thought he just magically popped in front of me&quot;).  Just give it up already and stop playing good guy.  I guess when you can't cover up your complete lack of skill you need to cling to other falsities to retain your image.  I laughed my ass off when I read Saalron's post about your gimpness in NToV, dying 10 times to Triplets and such before figuring out the unbelievably obvious trick.  A shitty monk will always remain a shitty monk, no matter how much loot you manage to whore with your officer status.  Enjoy your complete lack of competition while you have it.  It's a wonder you haven't managed to at least come reasonably close to PO, but I guess when you guild people just for sake of more lemmings used to gear up your officers you have limitations. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43670">Dabamf Squirrellmaster</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.appotusdominus.com">Appotus Dominus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aeranae@vazaellecommunitycenter>Aeranae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/02 11:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1817.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Soap Opera in Kael</span><hr size=1> I was with Fantasy when we took a GM warning from allegations of KS from some *cough* unnamed *cough* guild (not AD) going after Ragefire after aforementioned guild wiped, except for their FD person...<br>

Really, get over it already if you are one of those AD folks who think all we do is run around as secret investigators to find out what you are doing.<br>

I've grouped with and spoken with a few AD and as always respect those I know to be good people. <br>

To the one who spews out filth wishing death on real people over a game, well all you gain is disgust and perhaps the honor of convincing many others that you have some real psychological problems, if you truly think that way.

<br>
First of all, I don't lie, about anything, ever. I pride myself on that. I do not sugar coat my words and I do not try to soften the impact of anything that I say. Not that I expect you to believe that, but there it is. I need a picture of Emeril to put up here with 'BAM' written in big red letters to emphasize.<br>
<br>
You guys slowed Idol. It doesn't matter when you slowed him, whether it was full health or 14%. You were going to wipe to him, and you slowed him. AoW isn't that forgiving. I told you tonight that you misinterpretted what I said. We killed Idol unslowed flawlessly before we killed AoW, and not even on the same night. I never said that you couldn't slow Idol before you beat AoW, but you took it that way. However, I highly recomend beating Idol unslowed without any deaths before trying AoW. He is A LOT harder than an unslowed idol.<br>
<br>
Yes, a guide did tell us that it was legal for us to pull AoW even though you had killed Idol first. That's what happened. I don't know how else to explain it you, that that's just what happened. It just IS. That's why we pulled. If I had known it was illegal, I wouldn't have pulled, but based on some false information provided to us, we were mislead into believing that we were breaking no rules by pulling before you.<br>
<br>
Taking vindicator and statue from Triality... and you call US low? We need nothing from either of those mobs. You killed them because you got paranoid of us being in zone. Do you honestly think that we would plow down a lower guild just to get to AoW first? They had nothing to do with anything that was going on there. They were just doing their thing, and we were going to let them be regardless of whether you were there or not. <br>
<br>
Think of this for a minute. Statue is up, and we're an AoW capable guild. Hmm, maybe, just maybe, we came to kael to kill AoW?! Dunno about you bro, but we didn't find out you were in Kael till we got there. No one's kidding when they say we give exactly a half of a rat's ass about what you're doing and when you're doing it. We do our own thing, and if it's already dead, we move on. We don't stop for anything or anyone, and you certainly aren't going to get in our way. The game's about bigger, faster, stronger. We recently had a wake-up call to that with being in constant competition with PO for Ssra, and we deal. No hate to PO at all, cuz they're just like us; do their own thing, and move on. Just like you; no hate to AD either. You do your own thing, and move on. You happened to want to do our thing tonight. That's why we clashed.<br>
<br>
Don't take potshots at my pulling skills man. You've never seen me pull, just like I've never seen you pull. I can't make assumptions about your skill just like you can't make those same assumptions about mine. You're just taking the opportunity while you rant on to grab onto some type of feasable argument in order to make me look bad, and it ain't workin' yo. Chill out bro, it's not about cocks and whether yours is bigger than mine. The game's a lot more fun without the hate.<br>
<br>
Anyway, not gonna respond anymore, since I can just see the replies that will flow now. People that know me will tell you I'm a nice guy who's brutally honest. People that don't will tell you I'm an outright prick that needs to go die of colon cancer irl. Whatever works for you is fine with me, but personally, I like to think of myself as a neat individual. Peace ~<br>
