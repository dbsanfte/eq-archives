I did this with her and a few others a couple of nights ago, and everything went fine, except that the chanter had to leave a bit early.<br><br>The ones in the group this time was Rakshak, Buuba, Pirrallo, Trampy, Slarena &amp; me. Well, we head on down.. things roll on smoothely for a while, and suddenly things go bad quickly. Pirrallo goes down before I have a chance to heal him (I dont think anyone blamed me for this). After this we get additional adds, 3-4 frogs maybe total, not sure. Im  not certain if we could have cleared it up at this point. Trampy gets aggro after shealing someone, and goes down. I stay around a bit longer, because im still not sure that it has to be death for the tanks (I dont, at this point, know that there is a zone nearby.. still dont know where it is) and Cheal the tanks and used my DB when the frogs aggro me. Both tanks run low and i use my last CHeal on Rakshak.<br><br>Im now certain that theres no way to save the tanks, and I attempt to gate out, the gate &quot;is unstable&quot; and a sec later a myconid summons me and kills me as Rakshak goes down as well.<br><br>Well, TPW. We get a necro to summon and I res the corpses.. not much else to do.<br><br>After this, however, im told in no uncertain terms by the druid that im no longer wanted by the group. Slarena leaves in disgust and im pretty sure that a whole lot of badmouthing went on during a period when the necro &amp; coffins were brought and I was not in the group. A new cleric is on his/her way in, and im offered a port out. I potion-gate out, not wanting anything more to do with these people.<br><br>WTF is wrong with some people?? Maybe I did do a mistake, I could propably have timed a heal better or chosen another heal or whatever. Im sorry I cant compete with your 100% proficiency in hitting the 'A' button Buuba. This was propably the worst Ive seen in EQ, and Ive seen quite a few gimpy things. Im not sure which of you were behind kicking me out. It doesnt really matter either. Staying in the group after this is just as bad as instigating it, and all of you except Slarena (who showed backbone and left the sorry bunch), were still in Seb long after this.<br><br>One strike, then youre out.

A good cleric is amazing, and can transform your EQ experience.
