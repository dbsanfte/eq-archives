Not playing any games right now and its monday night. Prepare for long post. Its mainly about how an EQ server deteriorates and no longer becomes fun for me. If it doesn't interest you then I would suggest you skip it.<br><br>This is the original post created by Zaliss about new servers for SoL, it basically asks if anyone has heard of a new server and gave me reason to think:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1286.topic">pub41.ezboard.com/fvazael...1286.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>How hard would it be for Verant to announce they are going to wipe a server and combine two old ones? I think EQ kicks hella ass up until you get loot/item/level saturation. I know this doesn't apply to everyone (particularly people who like big encounters). This would be huge though IMO and would renew my interest in EQ *completely*.<br><br>I could care less about big encounters to be honest. Anything over 2 groups becomes a chore for me. Hurry up and wait. Linkdeaths, buffing cycles, waiting for people to get ported, guildies bitching about this or that or them, loot issues, yada yada. Who needs that crap?<br><br>Besides how much skill is involved in big encounters? Sure, maybe a few classes and the leaders need to be on their toes but for everyone else its a big yawnfest until the mob drops and then it gets interesting...interesting in a bad way. How do you split loot when the drops don't equal the people? <br><br>The way I see it, you should be able to get 6 interesting items a successful &quot;outing&quot;, and coincidentally, thats a group.<br><br>Besides, anything in a game that requires more than 6 hours in one session isn't healthy IMO. Think about that.  Is keeping the stats on your character more important than your health?  Mentally? Socially? Physically?  <br><br>And its not fair to the people who are new to EQ to have us oldies hanging around. They need their own server where they can make their own history. Krimzins post in the NToV thread really made that stand out in my mind. <br><br>Sorry Krimzin, what you posted was true but I don't think it was warranted and the current players don't need that. What they are doing has merit.  <br><br>I still think you are, without a doubt, one of the best leaders in this game and what IV did was a tremendous accomplishment but it really does sound better when someone else says it.<br><br>What was fun to me was doing without things. The game is challeging when half your armor was cloth and the other half is whatever you could get your hands on. Items were interesting when you got them. There would be less greed too I think<br><br>Go back and read some of the posts during the early months of Vaz.  People were excited, not tired and bickering.  There were tons of stories and while they don't interest some I find them highly amusing.   <br><br>A set of constantly wiping servers (even if it is just Old World/Kunark) would be just fine with me.<br> <p>Herder</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 7:47:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Server Syndrome</span><hr size=1> If only VI would enact upon /feedbacks...

Alot of the no lifers will flame ya for it or question or bitch and well fuck them. There is more to EQ then the raid for 8 hrs kill said mob dist. dsaid 6 items rinse repeat. Unless yhou have no fucking life or are a corpse what fucking fun is that, but thats my opinion so stfu.<br><br>But in all our time here, look back, think about every single thing ya did, if ya have a soul or just not some little 15 yr old quake/star craft fuck, there is so much more then that to eq. Think about all the great ppl you have met and all the experiances. I dunno to me thats the best. I still remember my days with you karp and , dammit what was that De warriros name who left? Anyways those were the days. Till this day i have still never had as much enjoyment in eq then I did leveling with you all. I remember leveling with comoc and them in LOIO,, the good ole days. Anyways i am old fashioned or i just dunno what i am tlakin bout right you fucks?<br><br>There's more to eq then the loot stature i am 60 and have a little dick mentality. Its a game have fun your own way, too many times alot fo you and you know you do have that pissant ego and feel your special, your not you simple fucks, its a game, some of us actually do enjoy doin other shit then playing eq 20 hrs a day 7 days week, to me thats sick and fucking sad. Its sad when guys ya leve3ld 1-50 with were the coolest there was and damn well they get big and UBER and jesus they diff ppl, not all liek that, btu its sad, take the time to rethink where ya have come from instead of loggin on for 9 hrs like a sap.<br><br>Anyways that was off subject, i havent been hard to rant for a long time, yall know that, but herder made some good points, qwhich i didnt even stick to, either all you no lifers and simple fucks that take this game too serious, fuck you, your mother, and any of your guildies.

For me the fun comes in trying new things, seeing new places, meeting new NPCs, and killing them.  In whatever online game I've been in I've always associated with the &quot;achievers&quot;.  Its not really a brag but.. I wouldn't have fun being in xxxxx guild that is full of mediocre players and dieing repeatedly to things because we played mediocre - and I haven't.<br><br>I'm not all that sure there's that much to Everquest other than big mob fights.  The rest of it (leveling, quests, etc) is just kinda not fleshed out and not very interesting, at least for me.  YMMV though.. I'm certainely not ripping on people who find that stuff fun.  The farthest I got in Everquest prior to playing on Vazaelle was old world stuff, I was level 50 for a long time before kunark came out and did everything I could in the old world.  My goal when playing on Vazaelle was to see all I could see in the 2 expansions I missed.<br><br>My question I guess is what do you want out of EQ?  I personally do not find doing things I've done hundreds of times before fun (although doing nag with my rogue a couple months ago a blast).  What is there really to EQ that's so great that you'd want to do it over and over?  I mean leveling is just about the most boring thing ever, even when you're in a new place.  I mean after I did sebilis and saw every camp I had no more desire to go back there, or any other xp place, other than its more challenging than some other ghey places (velks).  <br><br>Whats so great about EQ that you'd want to do it all over again repeatedly? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaarithyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aarithyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 8:42:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Server Syndrome</span><hr size=1> /em apoligizes for butting in, but has nothing else to do ATM<br><br>Whats so great about EQ that you'd want to do it all over again repeatedly? <br><br>A few things for me:<br>-coming to the realization that there is more out there than CrushBone and waiting for a Cracked Staff to drop<br>-getting my first &quot;uber&quot; loot on my first Guild Raid (Tserrina's Symbol lol) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upigboyph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PigboyPH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 485<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 8:42:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Server Syndrome</span><hr size=1> &quot;Unless yhou have no fucking life&quot;<br><br>/em raises his hand<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221" target="new">Haels</link></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 933<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 8:52:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Server Syndrome</span><hr size=1> Vehn, exactly my points, just a different outlook and let me explain.<br><br>People get too wrapped up in their character to enjoy the game.  The uber mob/Guild monstrosity doesn't even need to be there.  Two groups is the most optimal setting for a big encounter and would really help with LD's and lag.  If they started over in the game, using a new character, new people, new stories it would be fun.<br><br>As it is now you are *forced* to kill a certain mob over and fucking over so everyone in the guild can get a key, get a scale get a book.  Thats fucking work dude, not a game.<br><br>Aarithyn, If you have never played on a new server think about it.  A cracked staff *is the shit* on a new server.  You don't need a guild with a bunch of people who can't get along and all vie for the same loot to get it either.<br><br>I want to make this perfectly clear, I am not bashing people for playing EQ the way it is now, its just that it could be both ways.  <br><br>Biship: Give people a break.

The early days of Vazaelle were super fun just like the early days of Tallon Zek were fun, just like the early days of futureserver will be fun. The greatest days in a server are the early days because the future is not written yet, the sky is the limit for a new server, it could become utopia. But as the server gets older people level up quite fast and stuff quickly becomes old. As Vhenn said doing a place the 1st time is exciting but doing the place the 21st time gets pretty dull and worklike.<br><br>The greatest times I had in EQ were in my younger years on TZ when I was a member of the Ronin Warriors, we had a blast and EQ PvP was new to me. Extreme excitment the first time we went to war with CN in Lavastorm I was shocked EQ could be so fun. But like every other asspect of EQ its becomes routine and loses its appeal. And the other greatest time I had in EQ was on Vazaelle when You, Roundhouse, Roanoke, Karp, Kazi and I were hunting quite often and when we were first members of PO. Kunark was new for me and I was in extacy seeing all the new zones and mobs I had not seen on TZ with a whole bunch of new friends. Then we got older, had seen the places to see, and of course grew past the infant stages of our characters life.<br><br>Honestly Herder we leveled fast when the server came out, it is people like me you and Bish that push the server from the infant stage as fast as it goes. We were the head of the class and pushing the way into the multiple group levels of the game. We made bronze obsolete when we started killing the bigger stuff early.<br><br>The way I see it though it is all a matter of attitude. I can not start over on another server at this point. One of these days I want to be done with exp'ing which I never have found fun. I am with Vhenn when he says seeing the new areas of the game is what makes him tick. The first time I saw the Aviak city in South Karana I was amazed and excited. The first time I saw the platform and hole where Phinigel is I was awe inspired and amazed at the view. The first time I saw The giant falls above Yael I was extremely stoked about the next few minutes. And even recently when I was in ToV with Arise I was amazed at the huge hallways and quite nervous and excited in the minutes before the Gozremm fight.<br><br>There are lots of places I have not seen yet in the game. Shocking number of them really and I wanna see them all. I want to get to 60 so I can finally do the Kain thing. I want to walk the lands, see the sights, and speak to the people I meet. Until I am 60 I cannot really do it the way I want to. I want to be as high as I can so I am more able to survive and do the quests I need to do. The Greenmist calls and once I am level 60 I shall go to all the dungeons and areas to get it done. The Epic also has a hook pulling at me and I want to in time get it as well. I could not do these quests before level 60 without feeling like I should be leveling so I will get to 60 first though.<br><br>I plan on having alot of fun at 60. I want to visit old places such as Perma, Cazic, Crushbone and check the places out. I would have just as much fun walking around those areas (probably more) as a 60 the fighting for my life there as a level 30. Being a high level just opens up many more places I can go in the game without a armed guard of a guild =) I plan on having alot of fun seeing the new areas of the game at 60, it will be alot like playing on a new server feels I think. <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 934<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 9:40:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Herder...</span><hr size=1> Woot!<br><br>Got a lurker to post.<br><br>Nice Sig Pstormbringer. <p>Herder</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvehn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 765<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 9:47:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Herder...</span><hr size=1> Herder my point is its (somewhat) interesting to fight yelinak 20 times because you're with a bunch of people, its new every time, its a challenge etc etc - its not interesting to level to 50 or 60 because there's no challenge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uraolfcq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 9:47:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Herder...</span><hr size=1> the warrior's name was draake.<br><br>I pretty much agree, Im not sure if I would want to do it at this point in my eq existence tho.

I dunno maybe i'm gay or somethin, i enjoy the comraderie(spelling) of it all. Its no secret to some why I hold my views as the way I do, I think Quarken knows this the most of anyone, when Noc left Sl it killed me, just felt betrayed and thats when I took on my ginh ho fight for the little guy atittude and fuck all the ubers. But in reality, everyone has goals desires and needs. No matter if one as no life and flys to 60 and flaunts it, or one like me who just has fun helpin people or just sits in ec bartering. Point is, and i know this is weird commin from me, we all have goals in Eq, as in Rl cannot disrespect peopels ambitions and wants, yeah i know i am the biggest fucking hypocrite right now.<br><br>As for Vehn's points, very valid, we all want to go diff places and do certain things, some more then other's, sometimes it gets old, i think 2 and a half yrs in eq has burnt me, i prob wont last much longer, i dont think luclin is EQ's savior the way everyone makes it out to be, its the same game with the same content just new graphics and zones. <br><br>Anyways I'm drunk and I am agreeing with vehnn, goin to shoot myself now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 335<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 10:01:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Herder...</span><hr size=1> Procax, that last sentence is the perfect summary... <p><H2><B>--Vaclav Romanov--</H2></B><BR><A HREF=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=91925>My Castersrealm Character Profile</A><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 935<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/3/01 10:09:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Herder...</span><hr size=1> Yeah Tropics.

The fact still remains that many dungeon encounters (for my money the most interesting parts of the game) rely heavily on a couple key classes... or everyone has to be much higher level to compensate.<br><br>There is no excitement in levelling when you are just going to hit DL over and over again or pray for a cleric etc to save you from the monotony.  (maybe I'm missing your point here but now I'm on my own little rant)<br><br>imho, 45+ dungeons you need key classes for:<br><li>Howling Stones (chanter and or cleric for the hts/mob wandering, rogue if you wanna go somewhere fast, porting class to get the hell out when you want)<br><li>The Hole (chanter for crowd control when you progress down towards the city)<br><li>Chardok (chanter for heading past entrance to exit area)<br><li>Siren's Grotto (a slower for those bratty sea mammals)<br><li>any of the planes (chanter or two -- as a 55 bard none of my attempted mezzes or charms landed in Hate still, maybe that's just the suck in me --, probably a fd puller, cleric, porter, main tankage)<br><li>Dragon Necropolis -- haven't been here but sounds like another chanter/tank/cleric job from what my guildies say<br><li>Deeper Velks -- ditto<br><li>KD -- tankage, healer, chanter to charm adds or more tankage<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>this leaves:<br><li>Karnor's Castle<br><li>Old Sebelis<br><li>ToFS (getting green)<br><li>kiting in Skyfire, BW, CS, TD. WL or WW if you are feeling adventurous<br><li>Chardok zone in to zone out<br><li>Velk's Lab spiders, heh<br><li>Kedge Keep<br>etc<br><br>In short, zone areas that were interesting to maybe crawl 5+ levels earlier.  Should you really have to be 59 60 to take a 5 man group and kick some ass in any of these areas?<br><br>If they kept the challenge in zones but made them a little more open to any combo of classes, I think you would see more adventurers visiting those areas.  Mistmoore, Crystal Caverns, Tower of Frozen Shadows, Kaesora, even yucky Droga are good examples of dungeons you don't need the marines to take down at lower levels.  <br><br>Was very happy to hear they were supposed to be addressing this problem somewhat in SoL, we'll see I guess.  I do love the end game raiding still but I like to let my hair down sometimes and it would be nice if I didn't have to play a twink to do that.<br><br>YMMV, shamelessly fishing for info on killing in these zones at my level  :p<br><br>Katarin, 55 bard<br><br>p.s.  counting down the levels to do that aoe group in Fear!~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=604.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=604.topic&start=41&stop=48>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=544.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=606.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=604.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=604.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=604.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm21">General Chat<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <BR><table width=90 height=20 border=1 align="center" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>    <tr>      <td><IMG SRC="http://counter.digits.com/wc/-d/6/-z/-c/13/-f/ccccff/-b/000000/VazaelleCommunityCenter" ALIGN=middle WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 HSPACE=0 VSPACE=0></td>    </tr></table><BR><HR> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
