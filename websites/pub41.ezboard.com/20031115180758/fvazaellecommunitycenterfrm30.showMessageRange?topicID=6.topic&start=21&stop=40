If it's your perception that Hussein was going to just &quot;burn out&quot; then as a matter of opinion you are entitled to that. Many however see that possibility as not likely. In fact, Hussein is sort of held to be a &quot;known regional antisocial&quot; I guess you could say. Is it really a magnificent leap of the imagination to think that as other host countries for radical terrorists are confronted, one by one, that the radicalism eventually would find it's home in a Hussien's Iraq? <br>
<br>
Raolf, do you live in the United States? People who live here have reason to be concerned and &quot;afraid&quot; of radicalism of the middle eastern variety. I wouldn't even think that a person would have to explain why. We support Israel's existence and we were attacked on our own soil by radicals. <br>
<br>
Maybe you don't live here and hence are seriously unafraid\concerned /shrug.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raolfcq>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 980<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 7:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Yes I live here, and I think it is obvious that invading Iraq does nothing to hurt al-Queda, and only inflames the rest of the arab world against us.

I dont care how long it takes them to burn out, if they aren't a threat, ignore them.  Here is the part where you show how Iraq was going to invade us.  For some reason we've decided to invade the ones that aren't a threat, and ignore the ones that are (North Korea).  This is just assinine.<br>

As far as Al-Queda is concerned it will remove one option for their relocation plans for their base of operations. It will also remove a potential supplier of WMD. The US effort to deal with terrorist and radicals is by it's very nature an incrementalist project. It's going to be long, laborious, and mostly importantly, eminently necessary.  <br>
<br>
BTW Raolf, you are too hung up on labels like Al-Queda, etc. Look at the broader range of radicalism and terroristic activity. Zoom out from the tree that is Al-Queda and you see a forrest of radicalism that must be deal with before it burns down world stability. <br>

<br>
I do not have any reason to believe that Saddam was in any very direct way behind the 9/11 incidents.  It is quite possible he was behind it financially in some way, but it's also quite possible he was not.<br>
<br>
However, this is essentially where my mind goes...<br>
<br>
1) Iraq hates the US.  This is largely a result of Gulf War I where we booted his ass out of Kuwait.<br>
<br>
2) Saddam is vindictive and blind rage and a desire for revenge do motivate him.  For example, he tried to assassinate a former president who posed no threat to him at that point.<br>
<br>
3) Iraq has shown in the past that it desires to develop WMD, including nuclear weapons.  Look at the reactors that were being built for Iraq in the 1970's/80's (which Israel bombed) as well as the admissions of defected nuclear scientists.<br>
<br>
4) Al Qaeda hates the US and desires to see as many American civilians die as possible.  This is obvious.<br>
<br>
Given the above, I don't see it as that much of a stretch that unchecked, Saddam succeeds in developing nukes, teams up with Al Qaeda despite the fact that they are not great friends to strike a common enemy, and NYC or Washington DC goes up in a mushroom cloud.<br>
<br>
This may well make a lot of muslims hate us, but what scares me the most is the possibility of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists.  Bin Laden can't do that alone, he'd need a national level regime for it.<br>

<br>
People try break the solid ties Iraq has with Al Qaeda but they can only do so by ignoring the facts and politics of the region... such as totally ignoring the Ansar al-Islam which were almost fully trained under Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, as well as Osama's own words on one of the pinnacle reasons for Sept. 11th (i.e. &quot;Kuwait&quot;).<br>
<br>
It's also fitting how the extreme left bend and distort the facts and have to ignore such massive quantities of evidence in order to build a flawed hypothesis.  It would be almost reasonable if the flawed hypothesis contained a reasonable debate for the viewpoint, but it doesnt.. add to how it has to ignore/dismiss thousands of bits of information in order to make it's cause just makes the source look even worse. (i.e. the original post commentary).   It's amazing how Bosnia and Somalia weren't included in this alleged &quot;Imperialistic Nation&quot;- but then again, there wasnt a Bush in the White House.. and there weren't any logical oil/power goals at hand.. guess we just wanted to offload some surplus food and humanitarian aid and stock pile the precious resource known as sand for all the American lives that were lost in those conflicts.  Damn Zionists. <br>
<br>
I think the chain of events is good for the world.  Anyone that lives some pipedream of some &quot;New World Order&quot; or single nationalism needs to put the pipe down and look at human history for the past 5000 years.  France/Germany already gave proof as evidence of why such a Utopian concept can never exist... rivalry and a thirst for power.  The sad thing is how Turkey is the recent victim caught in this &quot;West vs. France/EU&quot; struggle and in the end it's going to be lose-lose no matter what they do.  Where there is a leader, there will always be 100's trying to dismount and claim the throne as their own.  It's a fact of life.  What dictates morality and ethic is to what extent they will go to in order to claim such crown.   <br>
<br>
In conclusion, America isn't concerned what a bunch of rag heads that are being spoon fed state-financed propaganda and media think.  If you read about the latest protests and terrorists volunteering to enter Iraq and fight, most every one of them references &quot;children with no heads&quot; and similar.  They have been spoon fed the idealism that marines are running around with machetes and decapitating Iraqi civilians by the 1000's and therefore are going to go their duty and defend the Iraqi's against this aggression.  I can't say I blame them.  If I were being bombarded with solely reports of Marines butchering, torturing, killing, raping and kidnapping Iraqi citizens, all the while Sadamm has been striving to curb the incline of famine and starvation deaths with the *extra* $3 billion per year he grosses after sanctions were put in place..  I'd probably be grabbing some weapons and flying to Iraq myself to kill those damn evil marines.<br>

Goanad, any country is a potential place for terrorists to hide.  Countries are big places.  There have been terrorist cells busted in the United States, should we invade ourselves?  You have to give me a better reason than that.<br>
<br>
Ammelen, I give credit for actually doing so.  He sees that the heart of the issue is the weapons.  My contention is a nation under the constant scrutiny of the world in the form of meaningful inspections and sanctions is not a threat to build weapons of mass destruction regardless of its intent.<br>
<br>
I have a problem classing chemical weapons as weapons of mass destruction in any event, which is all he likely has, but I guess that is a separate debate.  How is a liter of sarin mass destruction but not a MOAB?<br>

<br>
He is pointing out the possible dangers, the negatives of this war. Some might be a real danger, some might turn out to be untrue. Nobody knows it. I have brought up many of these arguments before.<br>
<br>
There are many things in this article that you simply cannot deny (well, I hope not) :<br>
<br>
- Several moderate Arab regimes have come under pressure.<br>
- Terrorist threat has become greater globally.<br>
- Anti US-sentiments are skyhigh - the Arab nations have become more unified in its stance against the US.<br>
<br>
The thing I am scared off the most is the Saudi regime being replaced with an extreme Muslim regime. It will be a lose-lose situation for the western world. They can't intervene, because that will make the Muslim oppposition against the US complete - if they won't intervene we will lose a very important factor for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>some</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> stability in the region. I'm not saying it WILL happen, I am saying it MIGHT.<br>
<br>
The whole point of the post was to say that Osama has won, that the attack on 9/11 had the desired effects. I cannot do anything but agree with it, in fact, this had come to my mind long ago. Worldwide fear has increased, fear about terrorism, saddam, etc. Worldwide, anti-US feelings have increased greatly, both with Afghanistan and now Iraq (although I think in the case of Afghanistan the positive effects outweigh the negative ones - impossible to measure though, the effects of it may really turn up years later).<br>
<br>

At least with Goanad it is easy to see where our difference of opinion lays. We both see the negatives and the positives, but we value/weigh them different. (Not sure if I used &quot;value/weigh&quot; here in the right context, simply said I meant something like &quot;we disagree on whether the positives outweigh the negatives&quot;.)<br>
<br>
To cure some of your bafflement (=P) :<br>
- First of all, many anti-war people are not saying to doing totally nothing no matter what.<br>
- the &quot;very real security risk&quot; is really subjective.<br>
<br>
As far as terrorism goes, this war may possibly cut some access to terror-weaponry off from Al Qaida. But access to weaponry has never been one of terrorism's strengths. Their strength lies in going for non-military targets with any means available to them. I mean, cardboard cutters were used in 9/11 - the really important factor in 9/11 was the funding (which the US has been trying to make difficult ever since, with success I believe) and the way they used unconventional weapons.<br>
<br>
What I consider more serious is that I think that Al Qaida has found many more believers for their cause. I think that is much more dangerous than cutting off some chemical weaponry, which to my knowledge (although I admit, I can't really judge this) is relatively easy obtained elsewhere.<br>
<br>
You know, the US had a LOT of support just after 9/11 - I can't help but think, couldn't this strong power they had then (not military, but political power) be used to create stability in the region ? None of that remains and the global support is actually worse than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War.<br>
<br>
Don't be too quick to say that Raolf posted this to proof a point, nowhere did he say it was factual. Of course, you can dismiss this article as being biased and all its arguments unfounded and untrue, but I think you are dismissing some very real dangerous too easily.<br>
<br>
You know, and this comes from the bottom off my heart, I really really hope this dangers don't turn out to be true. I am not anti-war, because I think it is cool and I am not cemented in my opinion. As far as I am concerned you all can go &quot;I told you so&quot; and Iraq becomes a thriving pro-western democracy, which will diminish Muslim extremism in the region. I truely do (yes, seriously).<br>
<br>
Bah, new material has come up just as I hit preview (as well as making huge posts, I'm also terribly slow in putting them together).<br>
<br>
Goanad, on fighting Radicalism - I agree, that is the true root of the danger. However, how will radicalism die by confronting them like this ? You will create some logistics problems possibly for the terrorist networks, but radicalism will grow because of this. Seriously, look how returning the violence of radical Muslims has worked out for Israel. Hamas is killing much more people than they have been killing during the last few years of Rabin.<br>
<br>
Ammelen, I agree with you that the prospect of Saddam possesing a nuclear weapon is scary as hell. However, I do think he was not even close to produce a nuclear weapon and there has been no proof that he was in the process of trying to produce one. There is no doubt in my mind that Saddam would've tried to get one if he got the chance and that that has to be prevented at all costs. The best way (note : not only way) to achieve this is to remove the regime and install a regime that is more friendly towards the rest of the world. I do think that the price to be paid for doing that is too high and that it would be a last-resort measure - I would rather want a less controversial solution to be found. Of course, I know you and I disagree on that, so let's just agree to disagree on that matter.<br>
<br>
ps. I do realize that some of the increased fear since 9/11 comes from having been too ignorant to the danger of terrorism before 9/11<br>

<br>
Um, not to confound the &quot;facts&quot; here, but in 1998 inspections ceased after the Security Council failed to back up in any meaningful form and fashion the intent of the UN to actually hold Hussein to the agreements he signed at the end of the Gulf War. <br>
<br>
There was a four year hiatus on inspections from that time. <br>
<br>
Perhaps we should put American inspectors in the offices of Security Council members to determine why the subterfuge took place post Gulf War I. Of course I doubt those nations in question would comply with those inspections!!!<br>

<br>
Pre Sept 11th (as far back as 1990), he and several of his top trusted Al Qaeda opertives gave several speeches of their solidarity with Iraq and expressed that the Cole Bombing and other events were direct retaliation for the US's tampering with Iraq's advance into Kuwait. <br>
<br>
These are just a few examples and about 7 minutes quick work..  even the slightest effort of delving into the matter with an open mind and thirst for learning the reality will reveal a massive landslide of evidence to solidify this tie.   It's just unfortunate that some folks require Osama wearing a &quot;I &lt;8 IRAQ&quot; T-shirt and &quot;First Osama bin Laden National Bank&quot; opening in Iraq in order to declare a basis.. yet the same people are willing to accept that Sadamm has no weapons of mass destruction because he says he doesn't. lol. <br>

<br>
I simply cannot see entirely much of a difference between a Nuclear and a Chemical weapon when in the hands of a dictator such as Saddam.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_production_and_use_of_weapons_of_mass_destruction" target="top">This Article</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> states and I quote <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>According to reports from the previous U.N. inspection agency, UNSCOM, Iraq has 600 metric tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, VX and sarin, and nearly 25,000 rockets and 15,000 artillery shells, with chemical agents, that are still unaccounted for.

<br>
Also it says in that article <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In January 2003, United Nations weapons inspectors reported that they have found no indication that Iraq has a currently active program to make nuclear weapons and there is no credible evidence that Iraq posseses nuclear weapons. Although there is no evidence that Iraq made use of chemical weapons during the Gulf War, it has developed and used chemical weapons in the past. Blistering agents such as mustard gas were used on Iranian infantry in the 1980-1988 Persian Gulf War, and nerve agents were used on at least one Kurdish village. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I'm losing patience with my neighbours, Mr Bush <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm really excited by George Bush's latest reason for bombing Iraq: he's running out of patience. And so am I! <br>
For some time now I've been really pissed off with Mr Johnson, who lives a couple of doors down the street. Well, him and Mr Patel, who runs the health food shop. They both give me queer looks, and I'm sure Mr Johnson is planning something nasty for me, but so far I haven't been able to discover what. I've been round to his place a few times to see what he's up to, but he's got everything well hidden. That's how devious he is. <br>
<br>
As for Mr Patel, don't ask me how I know, I just know - from very good sources - that he is, in reality, a Mass Murderer. I have leafleted the street telling them that if we don't act first, he'll pick us off one by one. <br>
<br>
Some of my neighbours say, if I've got proof, why don't I go to the police? But that's simply ridiculous. The police will say that they need evidence of a crime with which to charge my neighbours. <br>
<br>
They'll come up with endless red tape and quibbling about the rights and wrongs of a pre-emptive strike and all the while Mr Johnson will be finalising his plans to do terrible things to me, while Mr Patel will be secretly murdering people. Since I'm the only one in the street with a decent range of automatic firearms, I reckon it's up to me to keep the peace. But until recently that's been a little difficult. Now, however, George W. Bush has made it clear that all I need to do is run out of patience, and then I can wade in and do whatever I want! <br>
<br>
And let's face it, Mr Bush's carefully thought-out policy towards Iraq is the only way to bring about international peace and security. The one certain way to stop Muslim fundamentalist suicide bombers targeting the US or the UK is to bomb a few Muslim countries that have never threatened us. <br>
<br>
That's why I want to blow up Mr Johnson's garage and kill his wife and children. Strike first! That'll teach him a lesson. Then he'll leave us in peace and stop peering at me in that totally unacceptable way. <br>
<br>
Mr Bush makes it clear that all he needs to know before bombing Iraq is that Saddam is a really nasty man and that he has weapons of mass destruction - even if no one can find them. I'm certain I've just as much justification for killing Mr Johnson's wife and children as Mr Bush has for bombing Iraq. <br>
<br>
Mr Bush's long-term aim is to make the world a safer place by eliminating 'rogue states' and 'terrorism'. It's such a clever long-term aim because how can you ever know when you've achieved it? How will Mr Bush know when he's wiped out all terrorists? When every single terrorist is dead? But then a terrorist is only a terrorist once he's committed an act of terror. What about would-be terrorists? These are the ones you really want to eliminate, since most of the known terrorists, being suicide bombers, have already eliminated themselves. <br>
<br>
Perhaps Mr Bush needs to wipe out everyone who could possibly be a future terrorist? Maybe he can't be sure he's achieved his objective until every Muslim fundamentalist is dead? But then some moderate Muslims might convert to fundamentalism. Maybe the only really safe thing to do would be for Mr Bush to eliminate all Muslims? <br>
<br>
It's the same in my street. Mr Johnson and Mr Patel are just the tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of other people in the street who I don't like and who - quite frankly - look at me in odd ways. No one will be really safe until I've wiped them all out. <br>
<br>
My wife says I might be going too far but I tell her I'm simply using the same logic as the President of the United States. That shuts her up. <br>
<br>
Like Mr Bush, I've run out of patience, and if that's a good enough reason for the President, it's good enough for me. I'm going to give the whole street two weeks - no, 10 days - to come out in the open and hand over all aliens and interplanetary hijackers, galactic outlaws and interstellar terrorist masterminds, and if they don't hand them over nicely and say 'Thank you', I'm going to bomb the entire street to kingdom come. <br>
<br>
It's just as sane as what George W. Bush is proposing - and, in contrast to what he's intending, my policy will destroy only one street. <br>

<br>
This is the fundamental source of disagreement for us then I believe.  I think the inspections process is essentially useless.  I view it as looking for a quarter on the beaches along the coastline of California.<br>
<br>
I just have no faith in the inspections system, it seems doomed from the start to me.  It was basically designed to observe and document the destruction of those WMD's catalogued at the end of the first gulf war, it was never designed to search out hidden WMD's, and I don't see how it possibly could hope to get ALL of them, or even anything close to all of them.
