<br>
The post was dying.  I had thought you MIGHT have caught a clue and listened.  At one point and time, it was number 6 on the list.  It looked like posting was diminishing....given enough time, it will sink to the bottom.  <br>
<br>
I will also say that people, as a whole, can stop posting to this...the flame has served its purpose.  If he continues to bhave in a poor fashion, log it, post it to bottom feeders.  <br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because Dethen has truly succeeded in completely destroying his game.  It is gone.  Completely.  Totally.  Gone.  <br>
<br>
Congratulations Dethen.  You are now the least respected player on Zeb.  There are people of many ages, ethnicities, races, creeds, and of both sexes, of varying levels of education, social standing, varynig levels of involvement in game, etc, who are all in agreement that you have no place in our little society.  <br>
<br>
I won't dignify your comments about showing the post to anyone else with a reply, purely because of the fact that it is highly dubious that any of it is true.  I just hope that the retribution you receive is not as bad as I believe it might be.<br>

<br>
This is the person who plays Xeal. <br>
<br>
My friend who is from a guild that Dethen was formerly in, gave me the link to this board. I thought it was necesscary to give a reply, and share my opinions (and the opinions of my character).<br>
<br>
First of all, Yes, Xeal is Dethen's fiance (this is roleplaying - he's not my fiance or boyfriend in real life, just to clear that up...), and I would like to clear up my actions towards the person who plays Bryre. I am in ROLE PLAY MODE all the time, because the guild that I'm in requires it. (We are a role playing guild.) As part of my role playing, I try to act out how my character would view other things while I am in the game. I, as a person, have nothing against Bryre or the person who plays Bryre. Xeal, however...Well, being a dark elf, she naturally hates everything. I really wanted to clear this up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Second of all, Dethen Valiant seems like a very sweet, considerate person from what I have seen - always helping out a newbie, or a guildie, or a friend in need. <br>
<br>
He does, however, have an occasional ego problem, where he thinks he is the best paladin EVER......He brags about how he joined raids with his current and past guilds (Lady Vox, for example) and how he ends up the only one alive, having to revive everyone....and how he ultimately ends up a hero. He also talks big about how everyone loves him, and how he's the strongest and best paladin...Just general bragging. It gets annoying, and I'm not sure if I'm the only one extremely bugged by his arrogance at times...<br>
<br>
He role plays, as well, as far as I know. He does have rivals in game, like everyone else. And I know this is heresay, but he always tells me that he dislikes the guild BDL because an officer kicked him out. (I remember him mentioning the name Bryre, and that's probably the reason he had so much animosity against Bryre upon seeing her that night) He never gave me the details about this, and perhaps now I see why.<br>
<br>
My character is too low (Xeal is level 22) to have any group experiences with him, but I must say that I am surprised by the things I read here, and I'm not going to call you all liars. I'm just here to tell you the things I have noticed about him, and my experiences as an EverQuest player with him.<br>
<br>
I have noticed that Dethen joins and leaves many guilds. He has joined and quit at least 3 other guilds in the past 3 months. I cannot say whether or not he was expelled from them, or if he decided to leave on his own. In any case, he keeps the topic of leaving guilds to himself when I am around.<br>
<br>
I just thought I'd share this information with you. I intend to remain role playing with Dethen, and remain an in-the-middle person...I'm not choosing any sides. Also, I will not share any of this information with him. I do hope you all figure things out, if they aren't already. Safe journies, and take care.<br>

<br>
Dethen -  We are nothing in real life, and never will be. You don't know me in real life. We play EverQuest together; we play two characters that are &quot;in love&quot;, AND THAT'S IT. I don't want to meet some freak boy from the internet who thinks he's in love with the girl behind Xeal. <br>
<br>
And if you *ever* attempt to come up here to see me, my father will have your head. <br>

<br>
There's a difference between /role, and being a dick.  Dethen is not roleplaying.  He's being an ass.  When you roleplay, you do not call people slut.  You do not post lude comments on their website, you don't bring it to real life.<br>
<br>
In short /role is for when your logged in to EQ.  When he went to our boards and posted what he did, he wasn't in roleplay mode, he was just flat being a dick.<br>
<br>
Go to www.miratos.com in the open forums.  You will see what your EQ friend is really like.  If I were you, I would think twice about the company you keep.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against you, and will offer you the following advice/warning:<br>
<br>
Anyone that defends Dethen's actions, will also carry a portion of his reputation.<br>
<br>
I'm done now.  This thread has gone on long enough, and it must die now.

I would have a lot less to be upset about now, had I not received the link to this message board from my friend. However, in a way, I am glad that I can add my two cents in this matter.<br>
<br>
You are correct. I do not wish to be associated with someone who takes role playing out of the game, or hurts other people out of /roleplay or deeply or personally, nor do I want to be around someone who just in general acts immature and rude to the public.<br>
<br>
I do not beg to differ with you and others who believe that he has earned each and every one of these so-called &quot;flames&quot;, and I do hope he comes to his senses soon, so that he can somehow manage to start rebuilding a good reputation for himself...one that he thought he had, and so often mentioned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucereborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cereborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 5:09:04 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Correct.</span><hr size=1> /me passes around popcorn.<br>

Dethen: We are in love. Xeal loves me. I am going to visit her soon! I really am! We are in love!!!<br>
<br>
Xeal: Yeah right, little boy. Go away now.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can't wait to see Dethen's reply to this one. I wonder if it will include some threat about how he is going to give her a lifetime spinal injury for betraying him.<br>
