An Unrelated Story <br>
<br>
Many years ago when I was in elementary school I remember meeting this kid named VInny on the playground.  VInny seemed like a nice guy.  He invited me to play a game with him  At first, I was unfamiliar with the game.  Slowly VInny explained all the rules to me.  They were complicated but I learned quickly.  After awhile, I got to be so good at the game, that I kept beating VInny.  Poor VInny had some ego issues it seemed because each time I would beat him at his own game, he would change the rules on me.  Man, VInny was a spoiled brat.  I think he grew up and works for some computer company in San Diego now. . .<br>
<br>
In other news. . .<br>
<br>
As most of you know Kael was brought down last night and patched.  The ability to charm the majority of mobs in the zone was removed.  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out the reason for this nerf was because of the recent AoW killings by LoS/SoS.  While our victories over the AoW were perfectly within the rules of the game, VI decided to alter those rules.  I've read that there are over 300,000+ Everquest subscribers.  I find it fascinating that a company took the time to alter their game to basically say &quot;screw you&quot; to 80 of those 300.000+.  What's worse is, this nerf wasn't a &quot;thumbed nose&quot; at LoS/SoS for killing their &quot;unkillable&quot; mob.  This nerf affects a vast array of people.<br>
<br>
Enchanters you are now buff whores.  Time to start a rogue.<br>
<br>
Druids lost their ability to charm wolves.  Back to casting PoG and dying after your first fire debuff.  Hey I think the Monk needs SoW -- zone out to WL.<br>
<br>
Exp groups and Armor Farmers now have to deal with uncharmable giants.<br>
<br>
Smaller guilds who used pet tanks on Vind and Statue can no longer use those methods.<br>
<br>
Many claim the AoW is now unkillable.  I haven't decided yet.  Give me a few tries and I'll get back to you on that one.<br>
<br>
Perhaps instead of bringing down Kael, Verant should have re-patched Everquest and removed all classes but Warriors/Clerics/Rogues/Wizards and while they are at it they can remove CoV faction from the game.  Not that anyone had much reason to be on CoV faction in the first place (thanks Dozekar NERF, 2 tears per kill), but this is like the last &quot;fuck you&quot; that CoV guilds are going to stand for.  With ALL the things wrong with this game -- BROKEN quests, BUGGED pathing, WARPING mobs, endless UI GLITCHES -- Verant takes the time to bring down a zone because 80 people out of 300,000+ killed ONE mob?  Not only that but their solution is to fuck over enchanters, druids, anyone on CoV faction?  Of course no one is surprised.  We've seen countless nerfs.  But this honetsly has to be one of the most RETARDED, knee-jerk reactions I've ever witnessed.<br>
<br>
We're not your goddamned beta testers.  We're not your Quality Assurance department.  Either start sending me paychecks or cut out this &quot;live beta test&quot; bullshit.<br>

It makes no sense really for Verant to do this.

They fuck over their poster boy (LoS) for CoV faction and get a big, &quot;FU, we're going Giant&quot; in return. How could they not see that coming??<br>

I actually havent looked at it from the angle they want people on different factions (no sarcasim <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but how can they expect people to go to dragon faction? you guys get NW and 3 Westwing dragons on giant faction. we get..... one dragon, and he doesnt even drop anything we can use, its gay quests and shit, sure the stuff is godly but its just gay.<br>
<br>
you have to go clear HoT (EW of ToV) kill these named drakes hope they drop the symbol you need (their rare/common, the symbols they drop are not random and only certin drakes drop certin symbols) and as simple as it sounds, these drakes are a 1 week spawn, there are like 8 of them, and they are usually killed by guilds that cant even kill dozekar to complete the quest.<br>
<br>
it wasent to bad a first, doze dropped like 4-6 tears, was hard, no compeition. then they nerf him, making him slowable hitting for a lot less, making him gimp guild killable, and lowering his drop rate to 2-3 tears. course hes easier, but his loot was cut in half, thats cool!<br>
<br>
then we kill AoW, they make him harder. neato.<br>
<br>
what does giant faction get?? all their NW drops upgraded! and even their West wing drops upgraded. i really to wonder how they expect people to stay on dragon faction with all this nonsese.<br>
