Maybe that will happen, maybe it won't.  Of course the response will be somewhat individual.  Some people will be thrilled, some people will be pissed, and everything in between.  However, I don't think you can state with any degree of certainty that they will not be happy (at least a large percentage of them) to be rid of Saddam.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
Dubya is telling the world (again) that we should all go in and get Saddam Hussein for a variety of evil things he's done and those U.N. resolutions he's breaking.  Dubya has so much respect for the U.N.<br>
<br>
Let's understand what resolution 1441 says about Iraq.  Saddam can't have chemical weapons.  Surprisingly, the inspectors can't find any chemical weapons, even with the help of the U.S. and U.K. governments who gave him the weapons in the 80s.  Saddam can't have biological weapons.  Again, even with the help of the supplying nations, the inspectors can't find any biological weapons.<br>
<br>
Saddam also can't have nuclear weapons.  The inspectors point out the correct pronunciation and still can't find any part of Iraq's nuclear weapons program.<br>
<br>
But Saddam is a murderous tyrant who could hand over his non-existent weapons to fundamentalist terrorists ... except that the fundamentalists are actually strong opponents of Saddam's entirely secular (that means non-religious) ruling party.<br>
<br>
But Saddam tortures his own people!  Yeah, okay, that part is likely true, but I don't see how firing three thousand cruise missiles in to a city of five million starving people is going to improve things.  Even if each missile only kills two civilians, the innocent death toll would exceed that of September 11, an atrocity we all agreed was evil, no matter what the goals or motivations of the people who made it happen.<br>
 <br>
Wishy-washy as the Canadian government is, we're doing the right thing sitting this one out.  As Dubya said last night, somewhat hypocritically, &quot;It is never an excuse to say 'I was just following orders.'&quot;<br>

<br>
Let me try to break this down so you can understand it.<br>
<br>
A newborn infant has no concept of what is called &quot;object permenance&quot;.  Meaning, if I show a 2 month old baby a block, and then remove it from their sight, the infant does not understand that the block still exists.  Out of Sight, Out of Mind, so to speak.  This is why the game of peak-a-boo can be so entertaining to a baby.<br>
<br>
By the age of one year old, the infant begins to realize that the block continues to exist, despite the fact that it is no longer in view, and the infant will continue to look for the block knowing that it must be somewhere.<br>
<br>
So now let's apply this to our situation in Iraq...<br>
<br>
Saddam SHOWS the UN that he has a weapons arsenal.  He admits it.  He signs surrender documents stating that he has the weapons, and agrees to dismantle them and SHOW PROOF that they have been dismantled.<br>
<br>
Now a UN Inspections team shows up, and the weapons are not there.  Nor is there any evidence that the weapons have been dismantled.  The inspectors find only a fraction of the weapons which Saddam origianlly disclosed that he had.<br>
<br>
So out of sight out of mind, right?  The weapons magically disappeared, right?  They are not out in plain view, so they must not exist.<br>
<br>
Dig your head out of the sand, folks. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

He has very cleverly managed to use the inspections system to shift the burden of proof to the United States.  The burden of proof has never been and will never be on the United States.  He has to show that he dismantled weapons, either by having UN observers, showing us the dismantled pieces, or whatever.  He hasn't done this, therefore, since the burden of proof was on him from the beginning, it is assumed that he has them.<br>
<br>
It was quite clearly stated at the end of the first war in the gulf that the burden of proof was on saddam.  At one point in time, he has weapons of mass destruction.  We all know this and agree on it.  If you don't you're a moron, even Saddam doesn't deny this.  Now, the natural assumption unless there is evidence to the contrary is that he still does.  If there is no evidence that anything has changed, we must believe nothing has.<br>
<br>
Now on another note, you say that lobbing 3000 cruise missiles isn't going to make things better.  Well, I disagree.  Right now the war of Iraqi independence is about to be fought.  It will be a revolution during which an evil dictator will be removed from power and replaced with a regime that listens to the voice of the people.<br>
<br>
You could have made the same absurd argument about the American revolution.  Sure the Americans were being oppressed by the English, but fighting a war would get people killed.  What good would that do?  Well, many Americans feel that that war did a great deal of good.  I certainly do.<br>

I think it's a very good comparison.  We are playing the role in the Iraqi revolution that France played in the American revolution in some ways; the larger, more established country that steps in to aid the people who cannot achieve freedom on their own.<br>

<br>
The Iraqi conflict is Bush fighting (supposedly) for world freedom, but in reality its for America. Thats not putting it down, the US wouldn't do it if it didn't benefit them, bad business practice and the US wouldn't have gotten as far as it has if it did. A side benefit is it helps the Iraqi people but this is a secondary, maybe even tertiary (behind WMD and the crusade against Sadam) concern.<br>
<br>
You can say its like the American revolution as its for the American people, but its not at all like the conflict.<br>
<br>
If the US is collaborating with an Iraqi resistance force I don't know about well, that might be different. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477296">Kerai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Well I guess there is one thing we can all agree upon.  But aren't most wars?<br>
<br>
Even the American Revolution was a war fought over money.  Remember &quot;taxation without representation&quot;?  Sure, a secondary benefit of the war was our freedom, but colonists who opposed the revolution felt we should have fought harder to simply have representation back in Mother England.  But the colonists who realized that the King would never allow the colonies to have representation knew that the only answer was war - a war to separate the Colonies from England.<br>
<br>
So now, more than 200 years later, we're off to fight a war in Iraq.  And sure, there are monetary reasons involved.  Same as there are monetary reasons behind the opposition from France and Russia.  But the secondary benefits you mentioned: removing Saddam's arsenal of WMD and the freedom of his people... those are worthy causes.  If we as a nation (the United States) somehow benefit monetarily in the process of disarming and overthrowing Saddam and freeing his people, then I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.<br>
<br>
To use a tried cliche - money makes this world go 'round.  And to think that our nation, or ANY nation in the world opperates without that thought foremost in their minds is completely unrealistic. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Actually, the US is collaborating with an Iraqi resistance force.  They have been consulting with them all along.  So I guess that means you're wrong?  I'll try to find a link on it.<br>

I think your poll is interesting, but mob rule is never very smart.  I think it would be interesting as well to put a series of different questions to the people:<br>
<br>
Does Sadam Hussien pose a threat to the security of the Middle East Region?<br>
<br>
Does Sadam Hussien have weapons of mass destruction?<br>
<br>
Should Sadam Hussien be removed from power?<br>
<br>
The question of &quot;Should the United States use millitary force against Iraq&quot; brings too much to the table.  Resentment for the US and the war issue should be kept seperate.  As the saying goes, &quot;There are liars, there are d*mn liar and then there are statician.&quot;<br>
<br>
It would be interesting to note what the various people in the world thought about stopping Hitler before he rearmed Germany as well.  (Now that I think of it, the League of Nations blustered ineffectually against Hitler too, and most of the people didn't want war...well that got us a long way)<br>
