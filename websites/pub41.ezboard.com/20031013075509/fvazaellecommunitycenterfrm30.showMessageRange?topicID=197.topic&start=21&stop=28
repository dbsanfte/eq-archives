You say that Christian societies hate Islamic societies. You say that Islamic societies are all hellbend on destroying Christian societies. That's generalising and just plain wrong. Go read up on Islamic societies like Turkey and Egypt, for instance. That's why you are wrong.<br>

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. Is this your proof that all Islamic societies are evil or something ? I never said America is the bad guy, all I am saying is that you're overgeneralizing Muslims. Your perception of the Muslims as a whole is defined by the actions of the few.<br>
<br>
You can point out the despicable acts of Muslim extremists all day long, but I don't see how it's relevant here. <p>---------------<br>

<br>
There are extremists in any organization/cause/movemnt in history. There allways has been and there allways will be. Troughout History there have been many questionable actions taken from all sides in a conflict. US's assistance in training troups and providing weapons for government takeovers by more &quot;controllable&quot; or more &quot;like minded&quot; groups, the former USSR's push to do the same in many &quot;smaller&quot; countries.<br>
<br>
The Middle East is just one of the many places where such actions have taken place in the constant battle for more control. Be it on the now EU's site, NATO or whatever gatherring or single nation/movement's side. Aftica comes to mind as does the Balkans region of Eastern Europe (more recently). Everyone wants a larger piece of the pie that is the world. The US wants it their way &quot;'couse we can&quot; to quote some extremists as does any other &quot;Advanced&quot; or &quot;Civilized&quot; nation (Great Britain, Russia, Germany, France to name a few).<br>
<br>
Some of these smaller countries are willing to negotiate middle grounds, and some just plain don't give a crap anymore after beeing reorganized and restructured in the past 60 years by the &quot;Cilivized World&quot;. Some have changed forms of government so many times and so radicaly, that they forgot where they were headed.<br>
<br>
I heard someone define Islamic Extremists a few days ago on a show and it struck me as a very true definition:<br>
&quot;Islamic Extremism is to Islam as KKK is to Christianity&quot;<br>
<br>
See on one side you have the Americas.<br>
On the other hand you have the European nations, who have had to deal with close quater neighbours around them fo centuries and quite frankly have nuch better experience in negotiating then the US does. Historicly and Geographicly the U.S.A. has been a pretty isolated country. It is allmost as the big bully when you were a kid that stomped on you for your copper just becouse they can. The I'm bigger and stronger syndrome which untill recently only two countries cound honestly exibit. U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. Nowadays .. everyone thinks they are the big bully. And it's not that they have the power or the finantial backing, or the resources to do anything .. it's becouse in today's world you don't need much of resources to reachour across the world and touch someone's life, identity or what have you. The world is quickly becoming a smaller place than it used to be. Global communications and information networks are getting more and more widely used and common and there woun't be long when we as humans are so dependant on them that a rogue nation could do unspeakable damage to the world economy without even leaving their borders. <br>
<br>
So in hindsight i think everyone needs to learn to appreacite their fellow humans for what they are. One whole package. Their Culture, Believes, Religion, History all a part of who they are. And if you don't like it then learn to disagree with it. Just accept that not everyone has the same values or morals as you do and deal with it in a peacfull manner. Or else we all turn into Modern Day Conquistadors. Destrying nations and great tresures of art, history, culture on the process of &quot;Converting&quot; the world to &quot;Our View&quot;. <br>
<br>
At any rate i'm going to quit ranting. <br>
<br>
<br>
P.S This is not directed at anyone personally. Take it as you will. Perception after all is relative.<br>
