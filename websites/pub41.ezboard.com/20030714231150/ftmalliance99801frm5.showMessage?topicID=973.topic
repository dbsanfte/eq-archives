Here is the step by step of this mornings attack<br>
<br>
Part 1 9:00 AM Frontier Retake Begins!!<br>
<br>
<br>
This morning when I logged on Mids took Hurb with 2 group, then advanced to Surs about 30 minutes later. At that time we formed a frontier retake force with only about 3 group of albs, and we got intel from someone in CG that said Mids are planning on a relic attack the moment we gather up for Sidi. The moment we got wind of that intel, I requested in cg everyone to notify in all alliance including ours, long story short, half hour goes by and our force increased by another half group only. We Rally at Berk and advanced forward towards Surs when mids left for Hurb, then due to couple of guard aggro on one of the group other 2 groups decided to advanced forward even though I call stop and got wiped out by 3 group of mids and bascially 2 minutes later, whats left of our main force was regrouping back at CS  . <br>
<br>
Part 2 10:00 AM 90 Mids Myth or Reality?<br>
<br>
After regrouped, onces again we Rally back at Berk and the moment we arrived, we got relic guard spam of 90. After about an hour of plead for help, my force increased by 1 group which made the head count of 4 groups of albs Total give or take a few scouters (Thank Dwe and Venoma for the excellent intel, (I know there were a few others that contributed, sorry i just cannot remember, at that time cg was going off the hook) Now we cry for help and everyone responded in a panic. Our 4 group of Albs now advanced to Snow fort Praying and hopeing reinforcements will arrive same time.<br>
<br>
Part 3 10:30 AM The Nightmare Began<br>
<br>
By time we arrived to Snow Fort, we were still the only albs in the area, everyone else was half way to Snow by Horse, and we got intel in /cg that rams was already on d3 and d1 is down. We have roughly 5 group of albs with reinforcement about 5 mintues behind so what do we do? We stood at Snow fort for 1 minute and we made the decision to advance to what I thought would be suicide but it was a chance we just had to try or all is lost. Now 30 Brave Albs follow me through the rocky Mtn's of Snowdonia and minutes later we have arrived to face 100 mids and no relic guards and both doors were down, 10% on door 3 was all is left standing between us and a Terrible defeat.<br>
<br>
Part 4 11:00 AM Shinning Moment<br>
<br>
As we approched Myrr, there was about 4 group of Mids standing out front with their backs facing the keep, that was our first Lucky Break. We engaged and soon the 4 group of Mids was quickly falling 1 by 1 till more reinforcements came from inside and slowly killing us off. 2-3 minutes later, when only about 2 group of us left standing facing off against 80+ mids, we caught our 2nd Big break... RELIC Guards to rescue. We got our deads up and continue to press our attack while mids were busy dancing with the RG's, few more minutes go by and I start to notice the lag was improving each passing second and notice the grounds of Myrr was covered with these huge Elephant Armors.... the tides are turning, now we advanced in-wards toward the courtyard of Myrr and D3 was at 1%.. Thats right it was that close to loosing.. We finish off the reminder of the disgusting faul creatures that invaded our land and we were Victorious.<br>
<br>
THE END<br>
<br>
10 mintues after the mids are defeated 100 albs arrived at Myrr. Our victory today even though Im proud of the fantastic job everyone did but I have to admit was pure luck. If we had arrive 30 seconds later the outcome would've been differnt. My Key point to this post is hoping in future we can all be alittle more supportive for our frontier. And we cannot underestimate the enemy any time, Im sure majority of the people were thinking is only Mids, what harm can they do? This is the 2nd attack Mids attempted on Myrr past 2 months, and both times they almost came out victorious.<br>
For those that didn't get a chance to experience this mornings thrill, hope this post was detail enough to get an idea what happen this morning.<br>

I have no problem with anyone going on these raids, but it is utterly foolish to do the Sidi raid EVERY SUNDAY AT THE SAME TIME.  If you really want to support our frontier, in my opinion you boycott it until the organizers get the message and mix up the schedule a little bit.<br>
<br>
For my part, Sundays at the times of these Sidi raids, with also the relic raids seemingly an ongoing event now too, I have real life commitments and can't be here.  If I could, I would have Peckinpah logged on in Merlin waiting, cause as long as these boneheads schedule the raids at the same time every week I think we can count on a relic raid too.<br>
<br>
We aren't going to have the power relics for very much longer imo.  Hope the Sidi drops are worth it.<br>

See you next Sunday&quot;.  That says all that needs to be said about the repetitive raids.<br>
<br>
I can tell everyone that this is an issue that is obvious and of concern to all of the Albion leadership (at least those who participate regularly in the inter-alliance message boards).  We cannot dictate to others how they spend their time ingame, but the issue is not being ignored by Albion's leadership (although it may appear that way at the moment).   Many alliance and guild leaders, throughout the realm, are urging that these raids be varied as to day and start time, it remains to be seen whether the raid organizers are sensitive to this concern.<br>

Wish mids would try it more often actually, relics arin't meant to be held by any specific realm for long duration of time, today if the mids were wiped out completely on Gawaine, onlything that would've cause is the entire server to go down due to the fun factor.  Just wish mids weren't soo negative and have the Hib God complex in mind where they can start pushing more on the Hibs.<br>
