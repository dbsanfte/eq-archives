I have been playing the game since beta so I've been around awhile. I am usually a calm guy who trys to enjoy the game, have fun, and make a few friends.<br><br>The flame is directed at Spirit of Fire guild. So I camp Ragefire once again, since our guild clerics cannot affored to invest the time. I spent a good 40 hours there when today he decides to spawn. Luckily enough, I am the only one camping him in the zone(whew, last night there was 4). So I send tells out, call some poeple, talk to friends, and do what I could to get a force together. People begin to trickle in and I had around 15 soon. Dunemir(not sure on spelling) from CoP logs on, sees the building force I have, says congradulations to me, the logs/gates out. I always respected CoP and ocne again they prove how much class a guild can have. Minutes later we begin to buff as my people reach over 20 in numbers. I figure we have enough to kill him so we better do so. Unfortuantely some agroed Rage and pulled him from us by accident. He said he was sorry and gated out. As Rage is wandering back to us so we can pull him a sole druid from SoF decides to snare kite him. So we are sitting here waiting on Rage to return and no return . . . <br><br>So I send my druid out to get him as I hear he was spotted towards BW. I said to myself BW? Why over there. So my druid heads out to get him and pull him for us as he did. I notice 6 SoF gate in including Lucane. Cool, I know lucane, we are good friends! So I send him a tell and ask him what is he up to? No response, hmmmm. So I send him another tell . . . again, no repsonse. So I tell my druid to bring him asap just in case. My druid goes to BW and snares him and begins to pull him to our force that has been ready for the kill. Grey trys to pullhim away as more SoF zone in again.<br><br>To make a long story short, SoF wouldnt let my druid pull him and there was no way out raid party could run across the zone in time, so they killed him. By killing him not only did they disrespect that we were ready to kill him first and had in fact snared him and was pulling him but they ruined any type of integreity that SoF had IMO.<br><br>The whole times I sent Lucane about 10 tells and he did not respond to one of them. Now some of you may say, hey dude, its FCFS. Well, yeah your right, and if we didnt have the people to do it there, ready to go, then I would say, you know what, even though I camped him for 40 hours, u guys have the right to him. But that wasnt the case, we had a ful force there that could of killed him easy. The only reason why we could not have killed him first was becuase their druid was kiting him around to the opposite end of the zone. <br><br>I have alot of friends in SoF and I am saddened to see whay the game has done to people that once played the game fair and with respect.<br><br>Of course, this all could be solved if verant would make him spawnable but alas, that would be asking for too much. Congradulations to SoF on another cleric epic while KS a mob and making themseleves look like complete arses. What respect I had for you guys was lost. Good Luck and best wishes!<br><br>Calh <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ulucaneofsof.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lucane of SoF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:35:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cableone.net/shannonw69/lucane2.jpg HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoF - Rage</span><hr size=1> I would first like to say how we are sorry that you did not get the cleric epic for your alt Calh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>But here is how we saw it, form beginning to end.<br><br>Falqour tells us that Ragefire is up, he goes over and looks and notices no one is even near Ragefire.  He says it in a channel, and I call for SoF to run over to SF as soon as possible.  We zoned in and ran to the Burning Woods zone line and began to buff.  I was the first group in there, and we were fully buffed and were ready to take on the human form of Ragefire, so our druid pulled him.  More zoned in, we cast AE Aego, KEI'ed the groups and by then he was in our camp.  <br><br>During the process Calh had sent tells to me, but I was in mid-raid giving directions and killing the human form of Ragefire.  We killed the human form, dragon form spawned and we killed it.  Now here are the finer details.<br><br>-Ragefire was alone, no one was near Ragefire, and no one had touched Ragefire (No one was kiting or pulling Ragefire, our druid found him there)<br>-Unknown Legacy was anon, at the time a /who did not show any guilds in zone.<br>-Ragefire is similar to a Lodizal.  You can't claim it till you engage it, and fact is SoF was buffed, ready to go, and pulled before UL did.  I do not believe you can be mad at us for being faster at buffing.<br>-Had UL truly been as ready as they said they were, they would have pulled Ragefire before we got to him.<br>-Ragefire is a long pull to the Burning Woods zone line, he was about 3/4 of the way there before we got /ooc Stop KSing us.  So either A) They were not close to Ragefire B) They were not watching Ragefire C) They really were not ready till then, and could not handle him at that time.<br><br>I see no right for you to claim it, you had not engaged Ragefire, and you had not been pulling it.  We won't pull a mob if it is in midst of being pulled, but Ragefire was standing by himself with no one in sight (And the druid had max clipping on)<br><br>I was told conflicting stories from UL after Rage died.  Some said they were and were not buffed.   Some said they were directly above Ragefire when no one was near Ragefire when we began the pull.  <br><br>Facts are this<br>1) SoF zoned in and bugged within 3 minutes<br>2) Druid pulled Ragefire to us while Ragefire was not engaged by UL, and there was NO ONE near Ragefire.<br>3) SoF killed the human form, and the dragon form.<br><br>Had UL been pulling Ragefire, we would not have even touched him.  The mob is a contested mob, and we went for it.  We were ready while UL apparently was not.<br><br>I am sorry that UL was not able to get Ragefire for Calh's Alt.  I am sad Calh spent 40 hours camping Ragefire (Although I was told 30 during the conversation with him).  But fact is, camping something does not entitle it to you.  I am sorry fro your loss.  But I am happy that SoF was able to get and finish Falqour's epic. <p><table width="500" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td width="110"><img src="http://www.sofeq.com/sofburn.gif" width="110" height="96"></td><td width="390"><font size=4> </font><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137521 " target="_blank"><font face="verdana" color="blue" size="4">Lucane Darkseraphim</font></a><br><b><font size="4"> </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="blue">Hummie Warlord</font></b><br><font size="4"> </font><a href="http://www.sofeq.com" target="_blank"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="blue"><b>Spirits of Fire</b></font></a></font></td></tr></table> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucrumbkake.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crumb Kake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:36:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lol</span><hr size=1> so your druid missed like the 20 people standing behind ragefire? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukomodonshadowstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Komodon Shadowstalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:39:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol</span><hr size=1> Man Lucane, ur story is way different from the one that Mckenna told me.<br> <p>Sir Komodon Shadowstalker60 Grave Lord</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufalqourthornwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falqour Thornwalker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.smogfarm.com/sof/dot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:39:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.sofeq.com/fearfalqour.jpg width=142 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoF - Rage</span><hr size=1> I'm so sorry to hear this, Calh. I too am a cleric who has felt cheated after more then a few Zordak spawns, so I know how you feel. You have my sympathies.<br><br>The real monsters here are not my fellow guildies, however, but instead the monsters are those who work at Verant Interactive, and, with absolutely no knowledge of how the game is played, decided to ruin the Cleric Particle Weapon quest by turning it into a second version of Lodizal. VI has stated in the past that such a powerful device shouldn't even be in the game, and the intended to make it as difficult as possible to obtain it, since they couldn't just remove it after the fact.<br><br>According to the well respected opinions of the cleric community on this illustrious forum, the new Zordak Ragefire spawn can only be considered as &quot;taken&quot; if the mob has already been engaged. When SoF arrived in Skyfire, it hadn't been. Our scouts saw no raiding party in sight of Zordak. We made quite sure that no one was attacking Ragefire before we decided to engage. Had you been attacking Ragefire, we would have left. We were not about to attempt to outdamage (KS) you.<br><br>Normally, I don't like to respond to flames on this forum... Or even read them, for that matter. But, since this one was a little personal, I thought I'd drop by. Hopefully, VI will eventually see the error of their ways and revert the cleric epic back to the way it was originally, or to a less arbitrary and thus better system. Perhaps they'd also like to come up with a better way to do the warrior epic final battle as well. And, perhaps othmir will fly out of my butt. /sigh<br><br>I do hope you'll get the next spawn, Calh, and again, you have my sympathies. May Tunare be with you.<br><br><br> <p><div align="center"> <img src="http://www.sofeq.com/pics/falcollage.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>Falqour Thornwalker - Healer and Holyman of Tunare</i><br><a href="http://www.sofeq.com" target="_blank"><font size="1">Spirits of Fire</font></a><font size="1"> / <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55304" target="_blank">Character Profile</a> (<b>58</b> High Elf Cleric)</font></font></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufeanan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feanan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:48:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoF - Rage</span><hr size=1> woot, another he said, she said!<br><br>i like the attempt to deflect it upon verant, tis a nice touch <p><p><table border="1" width="285" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2"bgcolor="#333333" bordercolor="#000000"><tr>  <td width="60" rowspan="2" bgcolor="#000000"><div align="center"><imgborder="0" src="http://jesse.earnware.com/eq/50px-bunnylogo.gif" width="50"height="50"></div></td>  <td align="left" bgcolor="#990000" nowrap><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23132"target="_blank"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small; font-weight: normal;color: #ffffff;">  <div align="center"><b>Feanan</b></a>     60 Hierophant</div></td></tr><tr>  <td  valign="top" align="center" bgcolor="#000000"><spanstyle="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;font-weight: normal; color: #cccccc;"><b>Iratus Lepus</b></td></tr> </table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ulucaneofsof.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lucane of SoF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:51:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cableone.net/shannonw69/lucane2.jpg HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoF - Rage</span><hr size=1> Actually Crumb, our druid saw no one in sight.

Fishy.<br><br>This was quite a lame thing to do in my opinion, grats on a tainted epic. <p><center><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="center" valign="center"><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Camoman</strong></br>Warder of Tunare</br><a href="http://www.raarcentral.com"><strong>Crusaders of Plilo</strong></a></br>Snare Bitz</font><br /><br /><font ace="Verdana, sans-serif" size="0"> <a href =" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79622 ">Profile</a> | <a href="mailto:jeremyjw1@hotmail.com">E-Mail</a> | <a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=106246 "> Pet</a></font></td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usanadan1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanadan1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 9:07:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol</span><hr size=1> /sigh<br><br>&quot;Ragefire is up&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is anyone there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let me go look around.&quot;<br><br>About 1 minute later.... &quot;I don't see anyone around him at all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Port to SF guys Ragefire is up and no one is there.&quot;<br><br>About 1 minute later.... &quot;Pull it, we're almost done buffing.&quot;<br><br>About 4 minutes later Rage was dead.<br><br>When I zoned into SF I think there was 25ish people in zone and 6 or so were SoF and the rest in a few other guilds (including UL and Bonds of Trust) and most role or anon so it appeared no one else was there.  From the &quot;Pull it, we're almost done buffing&quot; tell until it made it to BW apparently people starting saying stuff in ooc and shout (I had mine off from a raid the night before that I had too much spam on, I turned it back on while engaged with the human form which is when I realized it was still off.)<br><br>There was no single guild with a sizeable force in SF when we zoned in.  We didn't even announce to port in until the druid had checked the Ragefire area and noticed no people around it.  Nothing was said to any SoF member until after we had pulled the human form (note the word after).  While we were pulling the human form others started to try and pull it off (/boggle).<br><br>What happened does suck, it's the nature of a crappy set up for a contested epic mob.  Upon zone in no single guild stood out in a /w so for a contested mob like this it's natural to assume that a few guilds were racing for it or with the lack of numbers for any guild maybe people were just in SF xp'ing / farming spells.  We buffed as we pulled and guess won a race we didn't know we were in until the mob was almost at camp (first time I heard anything about Unknown Legacy camping the mob was about 30seconds before it was in camp).  At that point it was too late.<br><br>Was there lack of communication? Yes.  Was there a KS? No, we buffed and pulled first.  We didn't steal a pull or anything, we simply heard a mob was up, didn't see anyone there camping it so we zoned in and killed it 5 mins later.  Dunno what else to say. <p><br><p> <table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" width="547" border="0"><tbody><tr><td rowSpan="4" width="104"><a href="http://www.sofeq.com"><img src="http://plaza.powersurfr.com/everquest/everquest/pics/sofburn.gif" border="0" width="100" height="87"></a></td><td width="439"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23630"><b><i>Sanadan Moonbow</i></b></a></font></td></tr><tr><td width="439"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="http://spiritsoffyre.cjb.net">Spirit of Fire</a></font></td></tr><tr><td width="439"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warder of Zebuxoruk</font></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukomodonshadowstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Komodon Shadowstalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 9:09:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol</span><hr size=1> Hehe, lol, guess who the other anon people were?  <p>Sir Komodon Shadowstalker60 Grave Lord</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwiliamwallice.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wiliam wallice</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 9:13:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol</span><hr size=1> Given that Ragefire is such a frigging hot commodity (sorry for the pun) who here can tell me with a straight face that he/she HONESTLY thinks that there isn't at least 1 person camping it 24/7?<br><br>Yeah..

SoF gets word that Rage has popped so they get on their wagon to do it - hey it is a big accomplishment. During their rush and furror they some how miss the other people in the zone, somehow their oocs get turned out, and somehow they get tunnel vision on the prize. Instead of taking a second to make sure that someone wasnt already there to tackle him - they proceed to pounce - forgetting that there are a few rules of friendly spawn engagement. I guess the Rage got the better of them in this situation. <br><br>Think of this:<br>/cle 60 all ..... there a are a bunch of unguilded high lvl clerics on zeb - who was to say that those anon people, or even unguilded people who were there, werent there for rage?<br><br>Oh well, all I can say is I know SoF is an honorable guild, and they dont do things to screw people over - it was a shaded mistake, but I know that SoF being the honorable Guild that it is will somehow make ammends to this situation.
