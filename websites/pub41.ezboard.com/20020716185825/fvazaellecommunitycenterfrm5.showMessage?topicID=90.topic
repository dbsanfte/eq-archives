I have seen GMs have intimate long-term relationships with players on their server.  I have seen GMs make up reasons to change player names, even when they don't violate the name policy.<br>
<br>
That said, I don't know anything about Jaydrox.  He could be the first Guide/GM that never played favorites, didn't misuse his limited powers, etc.<br>
<br>
Just feel lucky that he:<br>
1) can communicate in English<br>
2) responds to petitions<br>
3) participates in events<br>
<br>
Good luck keeping your account.  I know several who have lost everything for much less than what you are accused of.<br>
<br>
Past history has shown us there is no such thing as a fair and impartial review.  If the server GM recommends an action by filling out the paperwork, that action will be implemented regardless of how wrong the GM may be.  It will be backed up all the way to Brad.  If you attempt to fight it, get used to stone walls and silence.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel banning is the ultimate reprisal and should never be done unless there is a strong LEGAL basis.  Clicking &quot;I accept&quot; on the EULA is not a strong legal basis for Verant to do anything they desire. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubled1234.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bled1234</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/26/01 4:23:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: jaydrox finally found an excuse to ban me</span><hr size=1> booyah neferati!<br>

You're looking for the Letter of the Law while Jaydrox seems to be relying on the Spirit of the Law. If Verant codified EVERY single situation in which a player could receive a warning or be banned, they would need a varitable army of guides to monitor everyone to ensure none broke a rule. Jaydrox seems to be interpreting the spirit of the law concerning zone disruption to say that killing an NPC controlled by a guide/GM in an event is inappropriate until there is a proper time. <br>
<br>
What is the proper time? Sometimes it's immediately as with the Halloween events where the sky would turn red, NPCs controlled by guides would pop into the zone and start attacking anyone. Sometimes it's after some dialogue exchanges between the guide/NPC and the PCs to learn that the guide/NPC has some type of evil intent that must be thwarted. Sometimes it's never and is simply something for the entertainment of all (giant gnomes fighting in the arena during a special event comes to mind as an example).<br>
<br>
Was Jaydrox singling you out, Bled? I'd say yes. And I'd say it's because you had established a pattern of being trouble (in the eyes of Verant) that allowed them to bring the hammer down on you this time. If you had not had those past warnings/suspension, I doubt you would be subject to banning now for attacking an NPC controlled by a GM/guide. But by your own past decisions, however clouded they may have been by self-induced exhaustion or whatever, you flagged yourself to Jaydrox. You set the sequence of events in motion, Jaydrox responded to them.<br>
<br>
Here's the catch: This happens IRL to people. Two people can do the exact same action that is inappropriate and one will get hammered because of past history committing mis-deeds and the other will get off with a slap on the wrist because he/she has no past history of mis-deeds. This, however, assumes that the action is not one that triggers maximum punitive response automatically, such as typing in a racial slur for Everquest.<br>
<br>
It stinks that you will have to start from level one if you choose to continue to play Everquest. All you can do is learn from these experiences and avoid repeating them.<br>
