I wacth my fair share of news and i get the idea that the war in iraq is going bad as everyone in iraq wants saddam back. While wacthing Fox news today i heard of the new Gallup Poll, in which Citizens of Baghdad were polled. Although this is not the view of the whole country of iraq. It puts the war into a better perspective. Would be nice to get a discussion going. <br>

&quot;THE IRAQIS <br>
In a Poll, Baghdad Residents Call Freedom Worth the Price<br>
By PATRICK E. TYLER<br>
<br>
<br>
AGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 23 — After five months of foreign military occupation and the ouster of Saddam Hussein, nearly two-thirds of Baghdad residents believe that the removal of the Iraqi dictator has been worth the hardships they have been forced to endure, a new Gallup poll shows.<br>
<br>
Despite the systemic collapse of government and civic institutions, a wave of looting and violence, and shortages of water and electricity, 67 percent of 1,178 Iraqis told a Gallup survey team that within five years, their lives would be better than before the American and British invasion. <br>
<br>
Only 8 percent of those queried said they believed that their lives would be worse off as a result of the military campaign to remove Mr. Hussein and his Baath Party leadership from power.<br>
<br>
The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from Aug. 28 through Sept. 4 across the ethnically diverse landscape of the battered capital. <br>
<br>
The results, which have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, showed that Iraqis in the capital still maintained a great deal of skepticism about the motives of the United States and Britain, and residents said they held France and its president, Jacques Chirac, in higher regard than President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who supported the American military action. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chirac's favorability rating was 42 percent to Mr. Bush's 29 percent and Mr. Blair's 20 percent.<br>
<br>
The poll results also showed that Baghdad residents were nearly evenly divided on whether the American-British occupation authority, headed by L. Paul Bremer III, was doing a good job running the country, with 28 percent giving it a positive rating and 25 percent saying it was doing a poor job on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 the most positive rating.<br>
<br>
But half the respondents said the occupation authority was doing a better job now than it was two months ago, and their view of Mr. Bremer himself was remarkably positive, with 47 percent holding a favorable view of him compared with 22 percent who held an unfavorable view. <br>
<br>
One possible explanation for the changing view of the occupation authority was its decision in July to turn over significant powers to the 25-member Governing Council of Iraqis, the Gallup findings suggested. The council was installed by the occupation authority. <br>
<br>
While 75 percent of those polled said the council's actions were &quot;mostly determined by the coalition's own authorities,&quot; the interim government's performance received a favorable rating from 40 percent of those polled. Thirteen percent said it was performing poorly. Forty-two percent were neither positive nor negative.<br>
<br>
Today, the Governing Council issued a decree banning the two main Arab satellite networks, Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya, from &quot;covering the activities of the Governing Council&quot; and other official events, accusing them of inciting violence against the new Iraqi government and its officials. Audiotapes saying they were carrying the voice of Mr. Hussein and a videotape of Osama bin Laden have been broadcast on those networks. <br>
<br>
Several members of the Governing Council told Arab and Western news organizations on Monday that the staffs of the two networks would be expelled from Iraq for a month, but that decision appeared to have been modified in the last 24 hours. <br>
<br>
&quot;We told them it was a dumb idea,&quot; said an aide to the council president, Ahmad Chalabi, who is in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly. <br>
<br>
When the text of the decree was issued today, the council accused the Arab networks of promoting the return of the Baath Party in Iraq, promoting sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims and inciting attacks on the government and its members.<br>
<br>
Spokesmen for Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya denied the allegations, saying their correspondents in Iraq sought to broadcast the views of all Iraqis during a time of national crisis. <br>
<br>
An informal sampling of Iraqis on the streets of Baghdad found more people inclined to support the government's crackdown on the Arab channels, reflecting a popular view here that the Arab leaders supported Mr. Hussein's repressive regime for too long and failed to support his removal despite evidence of widespread human rights abuses.<br>
<br>
But some Iraqis defended the Arab networks, as Al Sahib, 33, did when he said that expelling them or restricting their coverage &quot;will give them a pretext to bark more and to cry with other Arab countries about there be no freedom of press in Iraq.&quot;<br>
