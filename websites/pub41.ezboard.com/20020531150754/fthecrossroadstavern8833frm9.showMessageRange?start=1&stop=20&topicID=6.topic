Birds sang, hidden among the great boles of the forest while a doe darted in and out of sight, disappearing into the brush. Senses attuned to nature drank in the sights and smells, feeling at peace, as always. This was home. Kelethin, the great tree city of the wood elves, fashioned from love, sweat, and the blessing of Tunare.<br><br>Llerian, eldest of the Moonbow clan and one time ranger sat back against the mighty Oak and continued the task at hand. An arrow shaft, lovingly carved from the best wood lay in his fletching kit. The feathers of a hawk, carefully collected, were affixed to the shaft and would make the arrow fly straight and true, like the bird they came from. A small nock, made from bone, would grip the bowstring like a lover. And the last, a silver tipped head, imbued with the magic of Tunare so as to strike even creatures from the Netherworld. His hand absently brushed the long red locks of hair behind his upswept, pointed ears as he put the finishing touches onto the arrow<br><br>Suddenly, Llerian’s head snapped up. The usual sounds of the forest had gone strangely quiet. With the silence only a ranger could accomplish, the fletching kit was closed, a bow, the likes of which few have ever seen, was drawn out and strung, and an arrow nocked. Where before a craftsman had worked his craft now stood only empty space as Llerian disappeared into the foliage surrounding his home. Silence reigned.<br><br>A curse pierced the silence as a huge man tripped over a large vine and stumbled into the clearing surrounding Llerian’s small house. He was huge, standing close to seven feet tall and carrying a huge spear that seemed to be coated in slime. His much dented and worn armor shone a russet bronze in the shafts of sunlight let in by the overhead foliage. His helmet, crowned with the horns of some animal, came off his head as he wiped his brow free of sweat. From the blue tattoos that covered his face, it was now obvious that this was a Northman, often labeled barbarians, from the cold steppes of the Everfrost Peaks. His once young face was scarred by years of working the Art of the shaman. It is a hard life that takes its toll on any who practice it.<br>Without ceremony, he dumped his shield, which looked to have been through a roaring fire, so blackened and charred did it appear, onto the grass. Unslinging his water skin, he took a long pull and surveyed the small cottage.<br><br>“LLERIAN! Curse you for a flea ridden dog, where are you?!?”<br><br>Unnocking the arrow, Llerian stepped from around the trunk of an oak tree, “As usual you wake the dead with that bellow of yours Curghann Bearfist.”<br><br>The huge barbarian and the slender elf locked arms in greeting and after a moment, both grinned.<br><br>“How long has it been my friend?” asked Llerian.<br><br>Clasping Llerian around the shoulders, Curghann says, “Too long, and while I have become an old man, you stay as you have always been. Damn all elves! Come invite me into your fine home and we will share a meal.” Quickly picking up his gear, Curghann followed Llerian.<br><br>As they walked toward the small cottage Curghann appraised his elven friend. They entered the main room of the cottage and Llerian immediately went to the fireplace. Placing two fresh connies on the spit to roast, he set about preparing some wild tubers and carrots.<br><br>Glancing at the tall barbarian, Llerian said. “I know better than to think this is a social call. You detest boats and for you to travel the Ocean of Tears means something is afoot.”<br><br>Curghann simply glanced around the room, noticing the many fine bows that decorated the walls. He picked up Llerian’s longbow, the secret bow that only the rangers of Kelethin know how to make and even then, only master fletchers, and caressed the wood.<br><br>With a penetrating stare, Curghann said. “How long has it been since this bow hunted something more fearsome than a deer?”<br><br>The barbarian’s stern look was answered with an angry glare, as Llerian stopped his cooking. “You know my reasons for hanging up my swords.” With effort, the anger drained away and he resumed his chopping. Carrots and tubers were placed in the pot and hung over the fire. As he mixed in various spices and tree bark, he continued. “You can’t know what it was like, hanging there on those chains, watching the Teir’Dal preparing their evil rites.” In a whisper, his voice filled with remembered dread, he explained. “The servants of Najeena know their business well. When it finally came, I welcomed death. I knew I would join Tunare and know everlasting peace. But no, I was denied even that. If not for chance, I’d be there still, my soul trapped for all time. Snapping out of his memories, Llerian looked at Curghann, “Sometimes I wake at night, and I can still feel the chains on me, binding my soul to darkness.”<br><br>With a sigh, Curghann said, “The elven Lords have begun the colonization of Kunark. The clans of the North have promised aid and I have journeyed there to give what aid I may. Close to the outpost is a huge lake, once blue and filled with life, but now it’s waters run dark and it is home to foul creatures that plague the surrounding area. I need you ranger. I need your skills and your courage by my side. Goblins, more cunning and intelligent than the tribes I’ve fought before, patrol the lake and guard the entrance to an ancient city. The leader of these goblins, I believe, holds the key to the city and should we defeat him and gain entrance, we can learn much.”<br><br>As Curghann spoke, Llerian shook his head. “I will not go. The peace of the forest is all that keeps the demons I harbor from overwhelming me. I am sorry you wasted your time in coming here. Know you my brother, Llars, has become a powerful druid and serves Tunare well. Seek his aid for I will not leave here.”<br><br>A single tear, quickly brushed aside, fell down Curghann’s face. “Aye, I know it. It is why I sought you out. Llars already agreed to help me. But we failed. We were overwhelmed and with his last scrap of power he cast a Succor to take us away from that cursed lake. But when the spell faded and I could see again, he was not there. I knew not what had befallen.<br><br>“I found myself in the Butcherblock Mountains and immediately came to Kelethin to seek aid from the druid council. The Hierophant communed with Tunare herself to learn if Llars was at her side. He is not. He lives and can only be a prisoner of those thrice damned Bloodgills. The council said the majority of the Faydark Champions were already spread to thin between Kunark and the constant struggle with the Crushbone Orcs. Those they could spare were green to the ways of battle and would prove small help. Then one mentioned you. I had thought you still in Surefall Glade and rejoiced that you were here. Misplaced hope I now see.”<br><br>Gathering his weapons, Curghann made for the door. “The ranger I knew was filled with courage and a passionate rage and the ranger I see before me is an empty shell. You go through the motions of life but do not truly live. If you wake to feel chains binding you, they are of your own fashioning, made of fear and self-pity.”<br><br>Without a second glance, Curghann was out the door and into the forest, heading south toward the Butcherblock Mountains and from there, Kunark<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A> at: 4/4/01 1:37:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(4/2/01 8:39:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> One more for today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>---<br><br>Llerian sat cross-legged before the fire, seeking that calm meditative state where he could find peace. His mind was filled with images of the dark priests of Najeena, fearsome goblins, and his brother. The images mixed and he saw Llars hanging in the dungeons of the Teir’Dal, trapped for all time. He saw them slowly take him down and toss him into a foul vat of dark water where hungry goblins waited. His usual peaceful mood would not come.<br><br>Slowly standing, tears streaming down his face, he crossed the room to the back corner. Carefully, he opened the secret compartment in the floorboards and hauled out a large chest. Taking a silver key that had hung around his neck for ten years, he unlocked the chest and opened it. He drew forth first his weapons, two short swords of the Ykesha, their power and craftsmanship long lost to the world, scavenged from the remains of an ancient and dead empire. He donned his mithril chain tunic, forged by the rangers of Kithicor, etched with ivy. Leggings of similar make covered his legs and jewelry from various adventures and pieces of scavenged armor quickly followed the ivy-etched mithril.<br><br>With a last look at his home for the past decade, Llerian drew a black vial from his belt pouch. Removing the stopper, he quickly quaffed the potion before his mind could dwell on the contents. He felt the magic course through his veins and he was off, running through the woods in the direction his friend had gone. Curghann had a few hours head start but no one of the Northland could navigate the forest of Faydark and the Butcherblock Mountains like one born to this region. Llerian was confident that he could catch his friend before the boat left.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A> at: 4/4/01 1:37:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(4/3/01 8:46:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> Wow, tough crowd, lol. <p><BR><A HREF=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=14097>Llerian Moonbow</A><BR>54 Pathfinder</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(4/3/01 2:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> The sun shone bright against the waters of the Ocean of Tears. It was a hot day for being so early in the season and Curghann drank deep from his water skin. A friendly dwarf maid was fishing off the dock and chatting idly with a young gnome. A swift breeze took much of the sun’s sting away, for which Curghann gave thanks. His heavy armor was uncomfortable on the best days and sweating inside of it only made it worse. But he wouldn’t trade it for all the gold in Norrath, for the magics placed on the armor by the totem spirits had kept him alive more times than he could count.<br><br>Off in the distance, he could see the great elven warship, Maiden’s Voyage, and the 4 small skiffs that would carry passengers to the ship. As the skiffs approached the dock, a voice next to him caused him to jump in surprise.<br><br>“After we rescue Llars, and recover this key you need, I am coming back”, said Llerian. The ranger looked straight out at the huge warship, avoiding Curghann’s eyes.<br><br>Curghann said nothing, merely nodded, and placed his hand on Llerian’s shoulder.

The rocky terrain, made slick by the sudden storm, proved dangerous to cross. The two adventurers cautiously followed the river, the fog obscuring what little visibility would have been possible in the rain. Llerian stopped a moment, bending down to examine the ground.<br><br>Nearly shouting over the rain, Llerian said, “Tracks. Looks like goblin but none that I have ever seen before. And some kind of feline tracks as well.”<br><br>Curghann eyed the surrounding area, his spear held at the ready. “Aye, goblins are thick in these parts, like flees on a beggar’s ass. We should steer clear of them if we can. We have bigger fish to fry.”<br><br>Llerian stood up and continued to follow the river. For almost an hour they continued on, stopping frequently so Llerian could examine any tracks in the mud. The fog was beginning to lift and the rain had slowed to a drizzle. Occasionally, the roar of some wild beast would split the patter of the rain. Llerian glanced at Curghann, raising an eyebrow.<br><br>Curghann said, “Sabertooth.”<br><br>Llerian shrugged and continued on. For another quarter hour the light rain continued before finally ceasing all together. Llerian removed the oilcloth cover from his quiver and rubbed his longbow down, replacing the string with a dry one from his pack.<br><br>Curghann pulled a rough map from his pack and laid it against a rock, motioning for Llerian to take a look.<br><br>Pointing to a spot in the middle of the lake, Curghann said, “This is the ancient city I spoke of. It rests now on the floor of the lake. Guards are posted here, here, and here.” Curghann used a piece of charcoal to mark places on the map. Looking up, he pointed to a ruined stone tower in the middle of the lake. “There may be more guards at the base of that tower but I think we can avoid them.”<br><br>“Fair enough. Let’s get this over with,” said Llerian.<br><br>They crested the last hill and headed for the lakeshore. Edging around the shoreline, they passed a tall, ruined structure located on a hill to the right. As they were passing it, Llerian stopped, holding his hand out to Curghann. Bending down, he examined more tracks in the mud. As he made to rise, a war cry sounded and six goblins came sprinting around the structure, their loping gate eating up the distance between them and the two heroes.<br><br>Instinct took over and Llerian moved with the fluid grace that only an elf could manage. Arrow after arrow left his bow and struck with startling accuracy. The first arrow struck the lead goblin in the chest, blasting him backwards. The goblin directly behind him staggered over his fallen companion and lay still, stunned. The second arrow took another goblin in the thigh, while the third and fourth arrow hit the last goblin in the charge, one piercing its eye, killing it instantly.<br><br>Curghann reacted only a second after Llerian and intoning a spell in the language of the north, he summoned spirits from the Netherworld. The icy touch of the otherworldly spirits slammed into one of the remaining goblins. It collapsed, ice forming around its body as the spirits bled it of all life. The last goblin charged on, headless of the danger and angered beyond reason at the death of its kin. Tossing his bow to the side, Llerian leaped to meet the charge, his short swords working to deflect the razor sharp claws of the goblin. Each time the goblin tried an attack, Llerian would exploit the weakness of its attack and launch a counter attack. In seconds, the goblin was bleeding from many small wounds. Fear overcame its rage and it turned to flee, sprinting towards the ruined building. With careful aim, Curghann threw his massive spear, catching the fleeing goblin in the back, killing it.<br><br>The stunned goblin had recovered by now and launched an attack at the ranger. Claws raked his back but the ivy armor turned the claws away. Spinning, Llerian used brute force to smash the goblins arms out of the way with one swipe, partially spinning it. With a low thrust, he sunk his second short sword deep into the goblin's chest. Staring at the sword, the goblin slid off the blade with a piteous gurgle.<br><br>The goblin Llerian had wounded with arrows was making a vain attempt to crawl away, seeing its death in the ranger’s eyes. Llerian murmured a quick prayer to Tunare and the goblin suddenly tripped on a shrub. It once again tried to move away and a root snagged its ankle. Hampered, it clawed at the ground, desperately trying to flee. Llerian closed in and with a single stroke, ended the fight.<br><br>Llerian retrieved Curghann’s spear and handing it back to him, said, “The bodies?”<br><br>Curghann spit in disgust, and said, “Leave them. The scavengers will deal with it, I’ve no doubt. We’ve tarried long enough. Let us head down and see what we may. We will need your magic to prevent us from drowning. I will prepare us for battle.”<br><br>Curghann began casting, once again using the language of his birth. Llerian watched as Curghann summoned spirits of protection around both of them. He could almost see the spirits gather around him, and wondered at his friend’s power. Next Curghann removed a small talisman from his pack and holding it in both hands, began another spell. Soon, the talisman began to glow with a faint aura. Handing it to Llerian, he said, “This will offer some protection as well as the guardian spirits I summoned. Quickly now, cast your spell and lets head down.”<br><br>After Llerian had cast his breath spell, they waded into the water and Llerian could almost smell the evil. The water was tepid and rank. What horrible torture was being visited upon his brother in this place? With firm resolve, he pushed away his discomfort and dove into the lake. The murky water closed over them and they were gone.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A> at: 4/4/01 1:38:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucaeddwyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caeddwyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(4/3/01 3:54:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> Very nice work Llerian, keep it up! <p><b><i><u>Caeddwyn Longstrider</b></i></u><br>54th Season Pathfinder</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(4/4/01 12:53:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> Dull eyes glanced around the pillar in the murky depths of the lake. The goblin yawned, bored at so tedious a post. The water was icy cold, but the goblin hardly noticed, being at home in the cold depths. An odd sound nearby caused the goblin to look up, and it felt the ripple of water pass over it. It thought of calling its companions by the door, but if it were just a fish, it would have to share the meal. It swam out a bit and sure enough, a large barracuda swam by. It speared the fish on its claw, happy at its meal. It began gnawing on the tough scales of the barracuda. It died that way, a huge spear suddenly appearing in its chest. It was confused at why it couldn’t call out for help. But then it realized, when it saw the elf appear with a sword held high, that its throat had been cut. Death caught up to it then, and it died without a sound. Llerian made a few brief gestures and he disappeared, his magic making him blend in with the surroundings. Curghann cast a spell and he, too, disappeared. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A> at: 4/4/01 1:37:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(4/4/01 1:20:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> Two goblins stood guard at the entrance to an ancient building.

Llerian motioned and he quickly passed through the doorway and a ripple of water followed him.<br><br>But the ranger had made a mistake. The shadows in the entrance exploded into motion and a huge goblin, much bigger than the door guards, tackled the ranger. With the wind knocked out of him, Llerian was unable to draw his swords. The goblin’s claws pierced his ivy armor and the water was soon red with the ranger’s blood. Before he could recover, the goblin had pinned him down and was beating him senseless.<br><br>Once again, as Curghann appeared, spirits of ice slammed into the fell beast, knocking him off Llerian. He shrugged off the spell and launched himself at Curghann, howling in rage and pain. Curghann took the brunt of the attack on his shield but one claw connected and Curghann felt ribs snap, though his armor prevented a more serious wound. Curghann doubted he could survive a second attack.<br><br>Flames enveloped the huge monster as Llerian, recovered from the first assault, punished the goblin’s flank, driving him up against the wall with a blinding attack. His short swords moved in a blur, but this goblin was much more skilled than the others and he parried the short swords almost casually. Llerian cursed himself for those long years of idleness, which dulled his fighting skills, but he continued the attack.<br><br>Curghann completed a second spell and the goblin was racked with pain as venom seeped into his skin.<br><br>&quot;The spell I cast won’t last forever. If the other two join in, this will be all over,&quot; Llerian exclaimed!<br><br>Curghann responded with another spell, this one though aimed at the elf. Llerian felt the magic course through him and his weapons somehow seemed lighter, his opponent seemed to attack slower. Llerian began a steady rhythm, building on the goblin’s momentum like a dancer. Moments before the ranger was fully on the defensive, but now the tables had turned and the goblin was bleeding from many wounds. More icy spirits slammed into him and screaming in pain, he turned to the barbarian to crush the life from him. But that was the opening the ranger needed. With a double thrust, he pierced the beast’s back and with a vicious twist of his swords, severed the goblin’s spine.<br><br>Realizing their survival was measured in seconds, Llerian spat out another harmony spell on the door guards. Then with quick precision, he cut their throats.<br><br>Curghann slumped against the wall, exhausted. Glancing at his friend, he said, &quot;You did well elf. I thought that beast beyond us but you’ve a trick or two to be sure.&quot;<br><br>Llerian covered the bodies with sand as best he could and slumped down next to his companion. He murmured another prayer to Tunare and the spell infused his muscles, restoring lost energy. He cast the same spell on Curghann.<br><br>&quot;It won’t be long before we are discovered. We must press on. Are you ready?&quot; he asked.<br><br>Curghann nodded. Reaching down, he pulled a heavy chain from around the goblin's neck.  A dull, rusted key hung on the end of it.  Curghann grunted in satisfaction and slipped it around his own neck.  Two more spells were quickly cast and Llerian could feel his wounds closing slowly, the healing process greatly accelerated by the shaman’s spell. Curghann picked up his gear and they entered the fallen city.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A> at: 4/4/01 1:38:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(4/6/01 8:51:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> Shadows danced around the underwater hall.

The hallway, though once straight, angled upward, the walls and ceiling showing cracks and part of the rocky lake floor had pierced the bottom, showing through the marble like the jagged teeth of some huge beast.

The corridors of this fallen city were humid and rank. Years of algae and fungus grew thick on the walls, thriving in the moist air. The light given off by the fungi cast the rooms and halls with a sickly greenish tint. The faint clang, as if a hammer striking metal, could be heard ahead.<br><br>Llerian could see a dull red light coming from the far end of the hall. The wet floor made it almost impossible to move silently but Llerian hoped the sound of the hammer would mask any sound he might make. Peaking his head around the corner, the clang on the hammer grew very loud. A huge room opened up and Llerian could see a forge at the far end. A skinny lizard man, whom Llerian had learned were called Iksar, worked the forge. Various weapons were arrayed next to the forge and a huge goblin bent over a table where a finely crafted harpoon lay. The goblin began invoking some foul spell and the harpoon began glowling with a dull orange aura. It quickly faded and the goblin cackled with glee. Looking up, it noticed the Iksar smith taking a long gulp of water and snarling, it picked up a barbed whip and whipped the poor Iksar. It hissed something in its own tongue and stalked out a side passage.<br><br>The Iksar accepted its punishment without complaint and when the goblin left, Llerian noticed the lash wounds begin to close, without spell or gesture. As the smith turned back to the forge, Llerian ducked into the room and melded into the shadows. <br><br>Before the Iksar could continue his work, the blade of a sword came up to its chin. Its eyes went wide as the form of the elf appeared before it. Motioning with his head, Llerian drew the lizard man back into the shadows, keeping his blade firmly against the creatures throat.<br><br>Whispering, Llerian asked, &quot;Can you understand me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yesss elfling, I speak the tongue of the mans,&quot; it hissed, equally quiet.<br><br>Llerian nodded, &quot;An elf like me, dark hair, similar features. Where?&quot;<br><br>&quot;All soft skinss look the same elfling, to me. But he could only be where all prisoners are kept,&quot; it said.<br><br>The Iksar pointed down the hall where the goblin had gone, &quot;Down that hall, come to a big room, many goblinss. Passt that to the left is a pit where the prisonerss are kept. Down into darkness you must go to save your friend.&quot;<br><br>As suddenly as he appeared, the ranger was gone, down the hall where the goblin spellcaster had gone. The Iksar went to return to work when it noticed the harpoon the goblin had been working on was missing. Shaking its scaled head, it decided the stories the broodling masters had told it about elves being part demon must be true.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(4/6/01 8:53:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> A large fire burned brightly, the walls dripped with moss and algae turned the color of dried blood by the light. The once proud hall was a shambles. Years of goblin life had worn away any sign of what must have been a place where kings held court. The smoke of the fire was trapped by a mystical net on the ceiling, keeping the room fairly free of smoke, although the air was far from fresh. The stench of unwashed bodies, excrement, and burnt fish clung to Llerian like a wet blanket. He hid in a niche in the wall, totally obscured by shadow. The goblins mostly slept, with the occasional movement from one guard near the fire. Llerian had wiped some algae and mud on his face and hands to mask his scent, for he knew goblins had sensitive noses and would detect him no matter how silent he was.<br><br>Occasionally, he could hear the cry of a human or elf from the far end of the room and he cursed himself. There was no way to get to the opposite side completely undetected.<br>He counted five warriors sleeping and one standing guard, although the guard spent more time staring into the fire than watching for danger and Llerian knew that should he look up, it would be a few moments before his eyes adjusted.<br><br>A log split in the fire, throwing sparks and the guard jumped back with a start, crying out. Other goblins stirred, snarling at the guard in their own tongue. In the commotion, Llerian slipped out of the crevice he was in and moved silently down the hall, back to the forge.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A> at: 4/6/01 8:54:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullerian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(4/6/01 8:57:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> Curghann stirred from his meditations as a figure crossed the path of light coming into his hiding place. Standing, he brought his spear to the ready just as Llerian came into view.<br><br>“You took your time elf,” said Curghann.<br><br>Glancing over his shoulder, Llerian replied, “The path ahead is thick with goblins. I had to be extremely cautious to avoid detection. There is a forge down this corridor, with an Iksar smithing for the goblins. He is most likely a slave. Past him, quite some distance is the room where the prisoners are kept. That is where Llars is likely to be, though I couldn’t get close enough to see the prisoners. I double backed and looked around. The rest of the corridors are collapsed and without mighty magic or heavy labor, we cannot pass. There must be another way however because I saw no evidence of females or young. Unless there is another entrance from outside.”<br><br>Without looking back, Llerian slipped into the darkness once more, heading back towards the forge. Curghann followed as best he could. Something else slipped out of the crack and followed the proud barbarian and only the ripple of puddles on the floor marked its passage.<br><br>The lash sliced into the Iksar, opening another terrible wound on his back. The goblin snarled in hatred, and grabbing the Iksar by the throat, lifted him off the ground, crushing his throat. Unable to breath, the Iksar almost smiled as he felt the cold touch of death coming. Finally, he would be free.<br><br>A sword came down and severed the goblin’s hand at the wrist. The Iksar slumped down and the goblin cried out in pain. He turned toward his attacker and Llerian parried a clumsy blow.<br><br>“Looking for this?” Llerian snarled. He rammed the harpoon into the goblin’s stomach and twisted it savagely. The goblin clung to life and tried to cast a spell but Curghann’s spear took it in the throat and its last spell turned to a gurgle and it died.<br><br>Llerian bent over the fallen Iksar and saw that it was still alive. He incanted quickly and healing energy surrounded the lizard and a few of his wounds closed. As the Iksar stirred, Llerian picked up the chain around its neck and he could feel the tingle of magic. He dispelled the enchantment with a quick prayer and the chain collar split in two and fell to the floor.<br><br>“We’ve no time for this elf, the sound of the battle may have alerted the rest of the scum. Time is our enemy now.”<br><br>Llerian ignored the warning for he knew the Iksar was punished because he stole the harpoon. Llerian dragged the Iksar into the corner. The Iksar, now conscious, opened his eyes and nodded his thanks. “I will live. It wass worth the lassh to ssee that harpoon I crafted sstained by hiss blood.”<br><br>Llerian rejoined Curghann and they made their way down the hall leading to the prisoners. The trickle of water and the sounds of the forge helped to mask Curghann as his armor prevented him from moving quietly.<br><br>Llerian motioned for Curghann to stop. Looking around, the ranger saw no sign that any other creature was here. A puzzled frown crossed Llerian’s face. The trickle of water was undisturbed and the sound of the fire came from up ahead. Everything seemed normal but the ranger was still uneasy.<br><br>“I sense we are not alone, but I can’t place the feeling. Stay alert”<br><br>As Llerian turned to continue on, Curghann smiled and followed after. The air behind Curghann stirred ever so slightly as something followed after.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umredsuperstar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MrEd Superstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>MrEd MiniTank!</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#333333>(4/15/01 3:52:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Llerian's Return</span><hr size=1> Nice stories... wish I had the time on my hands that you seemingly do  LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>Good work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font size=3><font color=blue><b>MrEd Superstar</b></f><BR> <font size=2><font color=dark red><i>Gnomish Wizard<BR>Tinkerer Extraordinaire!</i></f></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ushaelynwyldheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShaelynWyldheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poo-Bah</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#333333>(4/16/01 10:53:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://allencaron.com/clients/oldclients/telepad/shae.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thank you</span><hr size=1> Very enjoyable.

He remembered something that felt good, it was cool as it went down his throat, but he could not name it. It was so long since the green skinned monster had brought some and his throat ached for it. His lips were cracked and dried blood coated his right side. How he came to be injured was a mystery to him but it hurt when he tried to move so he knew it was recent. He dreamed sometimes, of huge trees stretching up to the heavens. He heard voices, someone singing. Small ones, little ones, children, yes that was the name. Children. Laughter. Sadness. Love. He had a name once, though he couldn’t remember it now. There was a beautiful woman. He thought at first it was his mother, as some of the wretches here cried out for, but it wasn’t. She was young and ancient. She was innocent and wise. She was life and death. He knew it was important, but he couldn’t remember. As always, whenever he thought of her, the pain began, in his head. It would grow worse the more he thought of it. As always, he struggled as long as he could, trying to remember her.

Apparently the sound of their previous battle had not carried this far but it would only be a matter of time before the goblin shaman was missed. Curghann indicated he would handle the guard by the fire and Llerian should head for the cell. Nodding once, Llerian drew his swords. He edged over to the entrance to the room and turned, awaiting Curghann’s signal. Curghann murmured a quick prayer and his eyes glowed violet.<br><br>Then, standing tall, he openly strode into the room and called out an ancient battle cry of the North. The goblin looked up for the fire, totally surprised and only saw a seven-foot monster of darkness. Raising its arms to cover its face, it cried out in fear, screaming something. Llerian wasted no time. He was darting in and out of the shadows made by the fire. He was halfway to the pit before the goblin recovered.<br><br>Curghann launched his attack, taking the goblin in the shoulder with his spear. Blood splattered the shaman’s armor and the goblin stumbled over a sleeping companion and then rose, its cries changing from fear to pain and anger. As before, Curghann called on the totem spirits. But instead of killing the goblin as he did outside, the spell hit the blazing fire. Ice met fire and a loud hiss like a thousand deadly snakes was heard. Steam erupted from the fire and scalded those goblins sleeping closest to the fire pit. Then the fire went out and the room was plunged into darkness.<br><br>Two warriors in the back leaped from their pallets and began advancing on the barbarian. Curghann's magic allowed him to see perfectly and he spat another spell, unleashing a killing rain of acidic poison on the advancing goblins. Blankets and tunics melted in the storm and skin blistered and burned. The goblins howled in agony. Before the goblins could attack, Curghann turned and sprinted down the corridor, his laughter echoing back. Moments later, five goblins darted after him.<br><br>The three remaining goblins snarled at each other, obviously unwilling to leave the room undefended. Whatever they said to each other was lost on Llerian, but he had already reached the pit and was half way down. Reaching the floor, the stench nearly made him vomit but he managed to control himself and quickly began searching the prisoners. Picking his way through blood, muck, and feces, he couldn’t believe the size of it. It stretched on for nearly fifty yards. Most of the prisoners were dead, mainly from starvation, but many groaned as he passed them. His heart ached to see these poor wretches but he knew he could not save everyone. His brother was his primary concern. He steeled his heart and pressed on.<br><br>With no warning at all, one of the bodies stood up and landed a stunning blow to his head. His ears ringing, Llerian tried to defend himself but his vision was blurred and he couldn’t make out where the attacker was. A second blow landed and the elf felt ribs crack.<br><br>Years of training took over and the ranger’s swords crossed in front of him, parrying an attack. He skipped out of the way, getting some distance to get his bearings. His vision focused and he saw the skinniest goblin he had ever seen. It was emaciated, almost a skeleton with skin. Around its neck was a necklace of humanoid tongues, and it had a belt made out of skulls. It was hunched over and moved more like an ape. Its fangs were yellow and broken and one of its eyes had been ripped out. Its tongue licked at the air, as if it sought to taste whether the elf was fresh enough for a meal.<br><br>Claws came down and Llerian dodged the first and parried the second, dancing to the side of the goblin. A lightning stroke opened a gash in the goblins side, which it barely noticed. It kicked out to the side, catching Llerian square in the chest. Hardly sure footed in the slime that coated the floor, Llerian slammed against the wall of the pit and fell to the floor. The goblin lifted the bruised ranger from the floor and hurled him against the opposite wall. It advanced, cackling with glee.<br><br>Tears of frustration and pain streaked down his cheeks. Trying to rise, he knew it was almost over. Looking back, he saw the goblin towering over him. <br><br>“Oh Tunare, I tried. Forgive me brother.”<br> <p><BR><A HREF=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=14097>Llerian Moonbow</A><BR>55 Outrider<BR><BR>"This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces.
