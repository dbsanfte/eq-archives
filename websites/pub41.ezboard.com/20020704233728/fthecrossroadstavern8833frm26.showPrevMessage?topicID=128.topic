<br>
I have a level 34 Cleric, Arqebus Macedonicus, and he is my highest (my main as you say) character.  I just started playing about 6 months ago.  There is a level guide by zone on eqatlas but there isn't 'a good place to find a group ranking' or 'loot is good/exp bad ranking' - some extra fields would be nice.<br>
<br>
For example:  in my limited EQ gaming experience it seems like one 'path' to leveling is: (1-5)Newbie area of your starting zone; (6-10)Blackburrow; (11-15)Sro/Nro; (15-20)Oasis; (20-25) LOIO; (25-30) FM; (30-35) OT... and that's as far as I've gotten.  I have a few alts in their teens and i've been following this path generically.  Some zones have poor loot (OT), some groups are not as easy to get FM vs LOIO, and so on.  Is there anywhere this information is found?  Am I using the most used "path" to leveling?  and if so, where do I go next?<br>

Sigh...<br>
<br>
Following your current path...you will likely go from OT to Dreadlands to Karnor's Castle and then to Velketors Lab.<br>
<br>
On your first real raid you will freak out and panic and cause all sorts of mayhem because you never ventured into anything remotely close to a dungeon.<br>
<br>
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.<br>
<br>
Explore, find a guild or a regular hunting group and go see new and exciting zones and dungeons. Kedge keep, Solusek's Eye, Permafrost, Stonebrunt, Droga/Nurga, Kaesora, Dalnir's...have a dungeon crawl a week in these zones and learn how to play in them. <br>
<br>
There is SO MUCH more than following the zerg herds to the stupid newbie zone/oasis/omen/ot/dl/kc/velketors route.<br>
<br>
Sorry for starting with an attack, the zones you leveled in are great but try to go into a dungeon or two on the way up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Actually I think that was a little uncalled for. I was specifically asking for alternatives.<br>
<br>
I have been in Dalnir, Splitpaw, Befallen, and a few other dungeons that I cannot remember. Those memories are in fact my favorites. I learned alot and I'd like to think I became a much better Cleric for it. It is those memories that keep me coming back to play this game. I do get tired of lfg in LOIO or OT or FM - not to mention those zones get boring rather quickly after a couple of nights hunting in them. I thought I would try posting here to get some answers from the Cleric community on alternatives to the most traveled path. I don't even know what they are.<br>
<br>
Think back to before you were "Legend's Golden Boy" for a moment when you first starting playing. No need to sigh. No need to get on your soapbox. I know nothing of factions or higher level gaming or where to go, like many new players to this game I am abit overwhelmed and lost. I was looking for some helpful advise. <br>
<br>
You did mention Dreadland's, Karnor's Castle and Velketors Lab as the 'most traveled' route - thank you, perhaps I will use those if necessary however I did make my way to the Great Divide last night and will try lfg there tonight - although I have seen quite a number of high levels there eqatlas does state that I should be in the range. I've also been reading abit on Kaesora which looks exciting - is it difficult to find a group there? <br>
<br>
I would be willing to start a guide for newbies on places to visit by level range if that might be needed to help that question of "Where do I go next?"<br>

Tower of Frozen Shadows 1st and 2nd floor<br>
Dalnir 3rd level (through about 38 or so)<br>
East Wastes Ulthorks (the north east part of the zone)<br>
Great Divide Giant fort (maybe higher than mid 30s, i forget)<br>
<br>
Loot is something that you really wont come across much of in the lower levels, IMHO.  What you do have access to you probably dont want :)  You'll get decent coin from the ulthorks .. the armor they drop vendors for 5p per item, as do the velium weapons.  The Giants drop a little plat and some weapons, but not as much as the ulthorks.  Tormax is stingy I guess.  Tower of frozen shadows again has some coin and some weapons that vendor.  But still, all of these zones will net maybe 100p a night .. so in a 6 person group, no one's getting rich.<br>
<br>
Those zones are *ALL* bring your own groups.  The benefit to that is they're often underhunted (except ulthorks, the tusks are quest items that people farm).  <br>
<br>
I take all of my toons to Dalnir from 27-32 or so on the 1st floor and then 33-35 or so on the 1st OR second floor.  I believe you can get exp on the 3rd floor through 38 or so ... but i usually leave for other zones in the high 30s.<br>
<br>
Tower of frozen shadows is a favorite for me just because it's different.  Some semi decent loot can be had on all floors, including the Teachers Sylibus and Students Homework on the 2nd floor.  In theory, you can go from level 30-55 in there if you go up the levels progressively.  Different types of mobs on each floor too.   Usually empty save a few farmers :)<br>
<br>
Ok, i've posted enough.  Like Adon said, think outside the box.  You're not on the track, you're in the Rut.  Everyone and their druid leveled on that cycle you stated.  There are SO many zones in this game... use some of them :)  <br>

You need to be able to find a group of people that have a few hours together that can travel to these other zones and fight.  If you have a limited amount of time and you don't have a steady group you fight with, you are forced to follow the path that Adon dislikes so much because those seem to be the only places you can shout that you are looking for a group and get a response.<br>
<br>
I see people come into zones like like Solusek's Eye and other low to mid-level dungeon zones and start looking for a group.  Its kind of sad, because the only other people in the zone are farming or powerleveling.<br>
<br>
I hope you are able to find some people that feel the way you do and go have some dungeon fun.  In my limited experience though, if you are looking for pick-up groups, you are almost forced to follow the oasis-loio-ot-dl path.<br>

You can usually find a group, being a cleric, in this zone.  Stonebrunt is also a good, underutilized outdoor zone for your current level.  This is a bring your own group type of zone. <br>
<br>
I haven't found a better zone for xp in the low to mid 40's than Sol B, and you can usally find a group/partner there as a cleric.  <br>
<br>
I do suggest hitting Karnor's in your late 40's early 50's to get a feel for the train game on a higher level.  Karnor's has notorious trains.  More than this, you meet and network with more people of a similar level in this zone and you can work on your pathing for the higher end of the game with the contacts you meet here.<br>
<br>
Around 53, head to Chardok or Sebilis.  Chardok for the xp, Seb for the loot.  You'll need both being a cleric of this level.  Peridots are a hard hit to the purse.  You can't pay for your dots in Chardok, but the xp is phenomenal.  You don't get the xp like you do in Chardok, but Seb will pay for your dots and those higher level spells that you just can't seem to get your hands on.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps and good luck in your journies.<br>

<br>
Lower Guk is your god !!!<br>
<br>
Seriously though...<br>
<br>
I like the old world spots the best, if you can bring your own group.  Lower Guk is a great dungeon for a cleric - lots of undead to kill and decent loot to boot.  I lvl'd my cleric there long before kunark came out.  Started at lvl 30 and left around lvl 45 or so.<br>
<br>
SolB is another great dungeon for your lvl.  Start out with some kobold camps and such and work your way to bats and spiders.<br>
<br>
I am sure there are more spots out there to try and hunt.  I try not to follow the &quot;zerg route&quot; and try some dungeon crawling though.  You can get in some great battles that really help you understand more about your character and your playing abilities.  Nothing is more statisfying(sp?) then having, what would be an epic battle in your minds, and comming out alive.  the feeling of &quot;damn, i cant believe we pulled it off&quot; is one of my favorite<br>

I was there with my cleric from 29 to about 52 when I moved to Seb.  But theoretically you can level in Solb till about 59....stone spider camp gives exp to 59.  Weak exp, but exp nonetheless, and safe exp as well.  At 59 it's easy to solo that camp. <p><BR>

As for spending 15 levels in one zone, I would avoid that advice entirely and explore everything as you level.  Staying in one zone for 15 levels is how the Oasis/LOIO/OT route got started in the first place.<br>

BTW, is there some rule now that former CIW go to SoF and former KEG and FS go to CoP? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uscytheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScytheEQ</A> at: 5/11/02 12:55:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#7A3412><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uadonborealis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adon Borealis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legend's Golden Boy</span><br>  Posts: 753<br> <font color=#F0E68C>(5/11/02 2:27:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/legends11114/images/Adon.jpg HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hunting/Grouping Locations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Some of us remember his &quot;bloodstained mantle at the FV bank, hand on his hip&quot; picture though, that one was much more &quot;Adon&quot;, IMO.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
