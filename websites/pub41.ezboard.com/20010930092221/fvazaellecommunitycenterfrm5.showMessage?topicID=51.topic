I was bound in the tomb room nearby and kept charm-charging him until he finally fell (only died 2 times).  As I had hoped I looted the HBC instead of that stupid useless potion.<br>
<br>
Corvid, Sleets, Lyra, Terv, and myself were a pretty solid group from around level 20-45.  I had given tons of stuff away to various SF members and had LOANED two items to two different SF members.  I stressed it was a -LOAN- when I let them use it.<br>
<br>
The first was the HBC, which I let Corvid use.  He was our group tank and needed the ac/str/hp more than anyone else.  The second item was a yak which I loaned to Carrais.<br>
<br>
A few weeks later Corvid disappears from the server for several days, then when he logs back in he doesnt respond to any (ANY!) of my &quot;Hey hows it going&quot;, &quot;How are ya doing&quot;, messages so I have to resort to hunting him down in Guk Lord room.<br>
<br>
He ignores me for two hours.  No emotes, no /says, no tells.  Some other SF people (Lyra and Sleete) tell me that Corvid isnt Corvid anymore, someone else is playing his account.  They know he has my HBC and they tell me I will get it returned to me when the real Corvid comes back.<br>
<br>
Its been two months, no HBC.  He still wont respond to any in game messages, nothing.  He knows its my HBC and refuses to even acknowledge my existence.<br>
<br>
I recently saw a post from Corvid in this message board, so I know he at least checks here.<br>
<br>
Corvid:  Log back in and return my HBC.  I have friends who need it.<br>

You were in sacred fires and yes we did group with you for a long time, its our guild policy that we do not sell items to guild members and while we were all leveling up we handed stuff down to any members who could use the stuff we couldnt.  We gave a lot of stuff away to the guild as group loot.  I remember when you got the hooded black cloak and gave it to corvid.  and several times you told me when I mentioned corvid took a break from EQ you said and I quote &quot; that cloak wasn't his, It was for the guild, He needs to pass that to another guild member If he quit&quot; well he didn't quit he came back.  And speaking of stealing nef, I believe you still owe me and shade 2,000 pp and some other items that you had which u were holding for the &quot;guild&quot; .  We gave you the cash to raise your jewel craft skill, and u promised to make us all the jewelry and everything we needed at your cost once u reached 200 (which we never got)  So don't be going on about a hooded black cloak.  your just upset because you got KICKED outa the guild.  and I'm glad you were because your CRAZY!  whoever reads his nutty post please don't even think twice about it,  The guy is psychotic and was removed from scared fires for being a psycho and screaming and cussing out members on a daily basis.  Giving items to people then deciding you want them back is not how things work,  I have not bothered to message you for the money back or items because of your actions I really never wanted to even speak to you again.  YOU GAVE THE CLOAK AWAY SO LET IT GO ! YOU ARE CRAZY , GO AWAY AND LEAVE US ALL ALONE PLEASE AND THANK YOU! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neferati>Neferati</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/15/01 10:40:57 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http:\\207.252.219.170\neferati.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corvid: Return my HBC</span><hr size=1> Lyra (or Sleete) or whoever you are today...<br>
<br>
For one, I -NEVER- -EVER- said the cloak was his.  You are just pissed off that I didn't loan it to you (Sleete) because you coveted one the entire time you were on The Nameless.  Even by Corvid's own admission (in this thread no less) the cloak is mine.  You know it, I know it, all of Sacred Fires knows it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;And speaking of stealing nef, I believe you still owe me and shade 2,000 pp and some other items that you had which u were holding for the &quot;guild&quot; &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You want the 1100pp back I was given to improve my jewelcraft?  Message me in game and I will deliver it with interest.  I have nothing that belongs to Sacred Fires and you know it.  This is just a lame attempt on your part to try to shift some blame away from Corvid.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;your just upset because you got KICKED outa the guild&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I didn't have a desire to flame an entire guild in public, but since you opened this can of worms...<br>
<br>
Yes, I was /guildremoved by Firanel.  I was camping just one of SIX spawn points for the Herbalist in Crystal Caverns in an attempt to get the Blackened Crystalized Robe.  When I started camping it I was the only person in the zone.  About half an hour later, Firanel and friends show up and try to steal the spawn from me on repeated occasions.  I wasn't camping the entire zone, I was only camping one of six different known spawn points for the Herbalist.<br>
<br>
Firanel got upset because I was camping something that was green to me (I was around level 45), and said I was greedy because I was keeping the xp from her.  I replied &quot;If you think that my equipping as many people in Sacred Fires as I did is greedy, then FUCK YOU&quot;.  I was there to get every cleric a CGS.  I was there to get every member a herbalist pack (remember the 21 packs in a row we got?)  I was there to get crystalized swords for the tanks.  I never asked for anything in return, ever.  The only piece of loot I truly wanted was that damned robe from the Herbalist, but in the 28 times I killed it (7 were solo) he never dropped it.  I finally got it in a trade from some wizard (sorry but I dont remember your name).<br>
<br>
True, I have two completely different personalities that you may experience when you interract with me.  I'm a very nice person as long as you dont try to jerk me around (Lyra/Sleete), dont try to bully me into giving up a camp (Firanel), dont steal from me (Corvid), and dont lie (Corvid,Lyra/Sleete) about me.<br>
<br>
Just because I am nice does not mean you can walk all over me.  If you step on me, I bite back.  If you corner me, I fight.  If you try to abuse imaginary powers simply because you created a guild, I leave. (Note to Firanel: Having the ability to make a good web page does NOT give you the leadership skills necessary to run an organization).  To this date I have refused to group with any Sacred Fires members or assist them in any way.  I feel justified in doing so, since it is Sacred Fires who is holding my HBC ransom.  (If the real Corvid is gone, someone within Sacred Fires is now playing his account).<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that the original Corvid is long gone.  There is no way that someone who I grouped with for that many levels and talked with as much as I did could do a complete attitude turnaround when I never did anything to him.  Why else would I loan someone my very best item?  I obtained that cloak when I was SOLO in Mistmoore.  There is absolutely no conceivable way Sacred Fires could think they own it as a guild item, unless they admit they stole it.<br>
<br>
When Corvid stated &lt;&lt;I won't return anything to you&gt;&gt; he was admitting 1) He had my HBC, 2) He was refusing to return it (which makes him a thief), and 3) the cloak rightfully belongs to me.<br>

<br>
I certainly think that taking off with all that jewelcrafting money as Lyra mentioned hurt us a lot more than getting some stupid weight reduction packs. And yes, it was much more than the 1,100pp you claim. Everyone knows it takes WAY more than that to raise JC more than a few points at high skill.<br>

And guildmate or not, by Verant's very own rules you have no business taking a green mob when others are there that can benefit from the exp.

They *do* enforce that one.. go figure.<br>
<br>
I had always understood that the HBC had been donated to the guild from the start. Coming back and expecting to have it returned after being guildremoved for being an ass on REPEATED occasions, all while holding other equipment and owing large amounts of cash doesn't really make sense. I suggest you call it even, move along and leave it alone.

The HBC isnt for a twink of mine, but for a friend I enticed away from The Nameless.  He played a level 60 monk, and is working on a SK for Vazaelle.  I wanted to hand the cloak down to him since he is the needier person.<br>

<br>
Its great to talk about benefits of a guild when you are continually on the receiving end. It boggled my mind when Firanel called me &quot;greedy&quot; when I was always on the giving end.  That, and her actions were motivated by pure greed.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I certainly think that taking off with all that jewelcrafting money as Lyra mentioned hurt us a lot more than getting some stupid weight reduction packs. And yes, it was much more than the 1,100pp you claim. Everyone knows it takes WAY more than that to raise JC more than a few points at high skill.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually, no it doesnt take a lot of coin (contrary to popular belief).  If you enchant every bar of gold before combining, you can come very close to break even.  It takes a HELL of a lot of time to do that though, so most people are lazy and just throw money at the skill.  Not an option on a new server.  I manage my time very well.  If I have full mana, I enchant 2 bars and put them away.  Before the end of the night I have 4-5 stacks of gold bars to practice.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;And guildmate or not, by Verant's very own rules you have no business taking a green mob when others are there that can benefit from the exp. If it had been some other group of people they would have PNPed you at the very least, and could have petitioned you if you had reacted the same way you did to Fira and in guildchat. They *do* enforce that one.. go figure.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I have never seen this rule about green mobs, ever.  You can correct my ignorance by cutting and pasting the rule to this thread.  PnP  states (I will paraphrase) that &quot;if a reasonable agreement cannot be reached by the players, then the GM will impose a reasonable agreement&quot;.  Personal opinion here, but I think camping one spawn point in an entire dungeon is reasonable.  Especially since there are six known spawn points for the Herbalist.  Need before Greed, and I needed that robe.  Firanel was trying to bully someone in her greedy search for loot and xp.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I had always understood that the HBC had been donated to the guild from the start.

<br>
I dont recognize your name as ever being in my group.  The people who know the facts of me loaning the cloak are Lyra/Sleete, Terv, Corvid, and myself.  Unless you are Terv you dont know the facts.  Lyra/Sleete has already lied in this thread, their voice has been heard.<br>
<br>
And make no mistake about it, I am the victim.  If there is anything due to Sacred Fires, let it be known.  I already stated I would return the gift of 1100pp (with interest).  I made plat jasper rings at cost for the whole guild.  I made plat ruby veils at cost for anyone who wanted them.  I gave away plat fire opal rings to guild tanks.  My commitment as guild jeweler ended when Firanel kicked me.<br>

I do not know what was talked about between our GM and you, given the profanity that you steeped on a guildmate in the above incident, I am not suprised that she became similarly upset and told you to Fuck Off, you were guildremoved on the basis of the above incidents of conduct.<br>
<br>
As far as the cloak goes, I do not know what was said between you and corvid, however guild policy is to share any item you recieve with any main in the guild who needs that item.  Wether its a golden chitin bracer that someone gets while camping SolB, or a trak tooth that we got while getting OS keys, we share those items with the guild.  The first think most of us do when we recieve a drop is ask if anyone in the guild needs, and then post it/leave it for grabs for a while.  Whatever agreement you reached with Corvid is your business.  Posting here on a rant board no less is poor form and shows that you have no intention of working to resolve the issue.  Your intent was to degrade and troll, while amusing, only further adds to your character. <br>

<br>
1) How can she work out an agreement with someone who wouldnt talk to her for a month?<br>
<br>
2) What does JC money (which comon is less than nothing, it took me 3k to get to 199, you think plat jewelry at cost to a guild of 30 members isnt worth 3k?  What world do you live in?) , or green camps, or ANYTHING have to do with theft?  Its just a form of ad hominem, its smoke and mirrors, and its easy to see through, no matter how big of a block paragraph you bury it in^^<br>
<br>
3) She got the item solo, if guild policy applies even to stuff gotten solo thats pretty odd, given that the guild had nothing to do with her getting it.  You arent the government, get over yourself, thats not really an argument in this case just a personal critism, but I thought Id throw it in.<br>
<br>
 It seems obvious from the thread that:  you dont like neferati, and therefore you are going to STEAL from her.  Why dont you just state that as your position, and then try to defend it, rather than hiding behind all this clutter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neferati>Neferati</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/16/01 5:23:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Corvid: Return my HBC</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;...the one time i had to cross solB to get to SolA (im a troll and we didnt had a shaman) you wouldnt let me bring 1 or 2 mobs to you and you began cursing...&gt;&gt;<br>

You asked if you could train the Window group when we were handling a bad pull, and I said NO.  You trained us anyway and someone in the group died because of it.  Any more questions as to why I went off on you?<br>

<br>
Wycca, I call bullshit on this one.  Like 99 percent of anything you ever say, its just plain crap.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;...not to mention the fact that the robe probably would have gone to you had it dropped...&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Remember the raid where the Advisor was killed and within a microsecond you looted the robe and started wearing it?  You seriously thought as a monk you were going to get to keep the robe instead of a needy caster.  Please, dont try to lecture on how equipment would go to who needed it.  You left the raid (angry) very shortly after you were forced to give the robe to a guild caster.  Its ironic that Corvid (the real one) was the driving force behind you handing the robe to whomever the caster was.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Later while a guild group was hunting in zone, you came down, started camping a named in the same area as we were pulling and let us know that it was *your* camp.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Reverse the order of events.  I was already there camping a single spawn.  There are dozens other spawns they could have pulled for xp and loot, yet Firanel wanted to see how far she could abuse her Guild Leader status.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the Corvid thats now in the game is the real one, he just doesnt act that way from my personal experience.  I am guessing he is probably being played by Firanel or Wycca/Trinity.<br>
<br>
The Corvid I knew was honest, fair, and at times a bit unbalanced (aren't we all!).  The Corvid in game now is just a jackass.  Fess up Wycca, did you get control of Corvid's account? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukeltekakatheolis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keltek aka Theolis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/16/01 7:12:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corvid: Return my HBC</span><hr size=1> Hmm, hey Wycca I think shes callin you a Jackass...right?

<br>
<br>
Nef's helped (without asking mind you) myself, AND soooo many of my friends out, without needing thanks, or anything else. I can see why not even replying or talking about this on a rational level would irritate him, and Im surprised at how calm he is after you all brought up (yeah, I said all, but not all of you, its just a general term, dont go nuts) this guild issue and airing it in public, well, in my books, thats a disgrace, and harsh.<br>
<br>
Nef, I know, would have been assisting the guild in ANY way possible, because thats the sought of guy he is. He has dropped doing very important things JUST to catch up and say hello.<br>
<br>
I have friends in SF, and know it isnt a bad guild, but because of this issue, and the few people who wish to turn it into an insult slinging match, it is putting the entire guild in a bad light. You guild leader should be informed, and a suitable arrangement be made with Nef.<br>
<br>
Why should he luck out in this deal just because things turned sour at one point? It is a game after all, and we should be enjoying it as a whole. Things need to be discussed rationally, or it will turn into one big bitching match, as has happened on other servers.<br>
<br>
I know our guild is based on Roleplay and Friendship, and we dont wish to see other guilds fall apart or have disputes which ruin the game for them either (except for In Virtue...damn them and their power...hehehehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

Neferati once gave me a golden star ruby ring for no apparent reason other than I think she felt bad that my jewelry sucked. <br>
<br>
Thanks Neferati...  um  I still wear it because my jewelry still sucks. <br>
<br>
Probably should have done jewelcraft myself, but... ugh  what a pain in the arse.  <br>
<br>
Did I have a point here?<br>
