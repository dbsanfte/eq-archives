<br>
I'd like to talk about the guild group, 5 people of the same guild and 1 of another, and how that one gets fucked inside out and sideways.  I know this, because I've been guildless for.... wait I've never held my own guild chat (discounting me and cure talking in EMR) but that's another subject so don't post about that here u fuq's.. k<br>
<br>
Anyways, more to the point, I'm INSAELY pissed off at these people : Rakot, Jebb, Uneek, Nisma, Glaciusw...<br>
and here's why: Group of 6 going to shrooms / king, so they get down there kill away, oh look a cbracer drops... 6th person in group was Pron btw, 60 Ogre WARLORD, k, now, Pron not only could use the nice stats on this cbracer (which nobody else in group can use....), but he also desperately needs the effect : shrink, on it, being ogre and all... well im sure you all know what im gonna say now, yes, these gimp people make pron roll on it, WTF Is that? just because your with your guildmates you think it's okay to fucking take things people really really need? Me and Cure have seen this bullshit enough, NBG MY LEVEL 1 GUILDMATE NEEDS THIS SHIT SO IMA TAKE IT, if their not there why the fuck should they get it? lame way to justify it.  I don't mean to attack these people, I know and talk to Rakot/Jebb occasionally, but this is just fucking lame, c'mon people, if you've ever bitched about someone getting loot you think you deserve/need more, then why the fuck do you turn around and do it to others? Pron's a good good friend of mine, and it really upsets me to see this type of greed out of these people. <br>
<br>
And no im not just talking shit about agony guild groups, EVERY guild group basically pulls this shit, so avoid them from now on please, so i dont' have to become ANGRY for a second time =x<br>
<br>
If you don't like my post, it's because i havn't had practice ranting so like, /msg churro you should do &lt;this&gt; when you rant etc. tks~ (i'll prolly post again, if i can figure out how to get back here HEHE)<br>

Loot rules were made clear before we got there(at least I understood it to be a /random group, I cannot vouch for what Rakot told pron directly).<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you feel otherwise Churro, but I went for a shot at a CB for tanks in my guild that need(we have enough fatasses in our guild I'm tired of trying to hit around).  I don't need xp or any other loot at that camp.<br>
<br>
Pron is a big boy, if he had questions ahead of time, he should have asked them.  To be honest, I'm amazed that someone in a mixed group at lvl 60 would think differently, but that's just me.  Until today, I'd never grouped with or spoken to Pron at all, I don't owe him jack shit.  He's neither friend, nor in my guild, and those are the 2 things that get someone a free ride on loot when I'm out playing.<br>

 I like Pron alot very good guy, but if the rules were random stated before hand, I see no wrong doing.  <br>
<br>
 I have camped Sebilis alot, been 60 for months now, never was going to go back.  Now I'm twinking an Alt and I need some gear I'll only go back if it is a random group I don't think thats being unfair at all if its declared to be a random group before group moves in. <br>
<br>
 Your thread basicly says from now on ever time I group I must use a NBG rule ... ahh bullshit  I've given my share on cobalt bracers and Fungi tunics away. If I want to farm some for my alt thats my business.  Before anyone gets in an uproar about taking away from server let me say this I havent stepped foot in Sebilis in 3 months so its not like Im farming everyday. <br>

I joined an all guild group but I was an idiot and didn't ask about loot.  I just thought it would be NBG on major items, random the rest.<br>
<br>
Boy was I wrong.  About 12 BP/Robe gems dropped, several netted kelp armor drops and a few other things that were pretty nice.  At the end of the group I got nothing and was told that if the guild wanted to award me the items they would.  I then stated the obvious, &quot;but I am not in your guild&quot;.<br>
<br>
The thing that ticked me was I already had a group in Velks and was asked several times to drop it so this 5 man guild group could get their velious BP gems.  After finding a replacement for my velks group I paid 100pp to get a port to CS to join them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my fault for not asking about the loot up front and that won't happen again.  In the guild's defense, I was offered 3 Pristine Emeralds after I made a big stink and the group was already separated.  Keep in mind I wasn't even offered one stinking plat or a sellable gem drop.  Yeah, I was pissed.  I declined on the grounds I will probably never see the Dragon drop component due to me not being in a guild but if I ever did get it, said guild would help me get my gems.<br>
<br>
Here's another interesting occurrence of a guild screwing a non-guilded player out of some loot...<br>
<br>

<br>
Come on guys, non-guilded guys should get a share of the loot.  We aren't trying to join your guild, we aren't an island unto ourself either.  If you need us and ask us, make sure we get compensated.  It isn't so much about the loot as being used. <p>Herder

There were some misunderstandings there and it all worked out, I am not unhappy with what was offered me and as you know, I declined that offer on the basis I would probably just sell them since I won't be getting the armor component drop so all is well. <p>Herder

Your point about unguilded people deserving loot is valid, but does not apply specifically to this case.<br>
<br>
From what I understand, this was a level 60 loot group, meaning they were just grouped to get some nice items.  It sounds like a nice item dropped, and everyone rolled for it, rather than it being defaulted to somebody who can use.  This kind of group has a specific purpose and is valid in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Only 4 of the 6 members were in the same guild, and it wasn't a case where the group just took the item, stating it was for the guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 595<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/20/01 11:06:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=359.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild groups....</span><hr size=1> Ya I do agree if the loot rules were stated then no foul, regardless of the blatent hypocrasy of the intentions stated re: equipping guildies.

The group was Krialis Jebb Nisma Uneek Rakot Glaciusw and Pron.  Krialis was pullin out of group just to help (and not taking a roll btw). The group consists of 4 60s, all maxxed exp.  I dont go down to kill mushrooms for fun folks.  I was there for loot because i have nothing to my name after buying a Crimson Robe of Alendine from Krimzin.  That is why I am there personally.  Krialis and Nisma, maybe they were there for guildmates so don't think when Krialis said that she was lying.  She gives almost everything she gets to the guild.  When I am back up to having at least a little cash then will stop auctioning shit also.  Cobalt and fungi tunic dropped, big loot problem ensues, Pron ends up leavin.  We continue on to get Heiro cloak and another tunic.  <br>
I guess the point I am trying to make is when we are maxxed 60, which most of us in the group were why else would we be in Sebilis.  Procax says &quot;I know its probably hard to get a 60 warrior who prolly has full xp to go to a fungi camp that he knows in advance is gonna be ffa on an item he needs with a bunch of relative strangers, that makes me tend to beleive churro, but who knows maybe pron is just a much nicer/more bored person than I am.&quot;  What about getting a 60 chanter rogue monk and wizard to go down there?  It goes both ways.  Glaciusw supports this as well so do not think its an all Agony group.  Everyones goal that night was to get loot, I am sorry if this wasnt clear to everyone.  <br>

However, I worked Karnor's for two plus months trying to get cobalt drops. This was a very frustrating time for me becuase I saw several other class specific armor drops during that time. Always the armour was given freely to the member of the group that could use it without a roll. If there was no member of the group that could use it, of course there was a roll. Need before greed is the only reasonable way to handle these rare class specific drops. Period. If a member of the group can use such a drop then he or she deserves it. They were there. They earned it. Rolling so you can give it to friend or guild member who was not there is crap. Tell those people to get off their duff and camp the item if they want it. I can't believe a Cobalt Bracer dropped and the warrior present did not get it. Unbelievable. Pron was cheated. Any other opinion is a rationalization of greed.<br>

If i had known, (which Rakot claimed he cleared with me, when he didn't) then i would have said no thx. As a fat warrior i've had my time spent looking for that particular item. When it drops, and only 1 class there can/will use gets told that i will have to roll on it,I was pissed, not at the group, but at myself for wasting my time grouping with lamers. I was taken as a sucker, so i'll take my beats and move on. I play with pc names off always, i never ever judge anyone by their guild-tag. So this was also a good experience for me to see who i never have to group with again.<br>
 Greed is a way of life in EQ.  So anyone that takes the time to put groups together, state the loot rules beforehand so losers like me know what to expect.<br>
Ya i left the group, only because you guys weren't being honest with me. I hope you get some phat loots for that bracer Rakot, cuz god knows you deserve it.<br>
PS. When a 7th member is pulling for a group of 6, and this 7th person is being played by someone in the group, make sure you are aware that they will be expected to roll on any drops aswell.<br>
PPS. holy shit, dont fuck with this Angrychurro guy<br>
PPPSSSS. Krialis i don't know if yer a transfer or someones twink, but you can go fuck yourself . Better yet, you should get on your knees and consider yourself lucky you had your 1 time to fuck me.<br>

I am not saying anything to protect Pron since I wasn't in the group at the time.  All I know was in the guild chat that Pron told us Cbracer dropped, the group became a random rolling group all of sudden for an item that he can really use.  Before anyone roll, Rakot gated out.  I did a check of / all rakot and / all Pron, Rakot was in Thurgadin and poor Pron was still in Seb.  WTF?  You are in a group, something good drop, loot it, then you gate out and leave your group in the dungeon?  This is lame imo.<br>

<br>
As for Caylan, we got the heiro after Pron left because we had to restart from zone in, and the rog and monk already had tunics.  So lets not bring that into the discussion.<br>

I guess I get to here all the shit because I won the roll<br>
