Farming is a right earned by people that put the time and effort into their characters needed.  The high end game is expensive as hell.  I know you don't understand this yet due to your ignorant post.  Even if he didn't &quot;need&quot; the FBSS, he has the right to farm it for the money.  Guilds do have fund raisers for raids you know.  This could have been the issue.  Know how much it costs to go to PoH?  200+ pp per port. Same for PoA.  How about a lvl 60 wizard with Dragon Bane.  It takes 2 peridots to cast.  2!!  In an average fight your looking at 6-8 stacks of those damn things per dragon.<br>

<br>
I’ve watched about 50 iksar scaled gloves rot, but still have not gotten my gobbo earring.<br>
<br>
I’ve camped Permafrost -all of it- at once. <br>
Alchemist, King, Scryer, Jailmaster, Preacher, Archeologist, Diplomat/Champion.<br>
<br>
I’ve farmed the pool room in Skyshrine to get my guardian leggings when all mobs were green.<br>
<br>
I once farmed Najena.<br>
<br>
I farm the Sarnak fort in OT all the time because I am determined to get my 2nd sarnak earring of station. And I mind my VS faction.<br>
<br>
In all of these situations, those camps were mine and I expected all those who came roaming by to honor my camps. Unless, though, if those people would get experience from those camps. If I am farming something and a person or group comes along who could get XP from my camp, then I yield to them. Every time.<br>
<br>
I thought this was the decent thing to do. It appears that I am in the minority.<br>

I’m not saying that my opinion is the right one and everyone else is wrong. I write this post merely to illustrate a different view.<br>

<br>
When one is < 50 and looking for exp/loot your perspective is very different from those that are 50+ and pharming for loot.<br>
<br>
Those that are 50+ and pharming find their actions very reasonable, and it is.  Those that are < 50 also find their reasons reasonable, and they are as well.<br>
<br>
Its about perspective.  Yes, you could give your seat on the subway to that nice old lady standing there with the heavy grocery bags.  But there is nothing that says you should.  You were there first, she is capable of standing, though it would be easier for you, and you are comfortable.  <br>

I am not a farmer by any means!<br>
<br>
I don't go into L.Guk expecting to get whatever camp I would like though, I realise it's popular and pickings are scarce.<br>
<br>
I may go down there 1 day and then again 3 or 4 days later and I have noticed lately that it's the same high level people camping the same mobs all the time. I've never seen Slambam though, but there are some high level farmers living in L.Guk that are constantly camping 3 or 4 mobs. Some of these guys can be nice and give you the mob they didn't really want anyway just so you can get some xp, mighty generous.<br>
<br>
Sure I can understand you might want some nice items to twink an alt, who doesn't?, but living down there so as nobody else can camp it for a month GET A LIFE! I may be mistaken but I don't think one person can single handedly corner the FBSS or the runed cowl market, but I could be mistaken.<br>
<br>
In closing I would like to add that if I am mistaken I am going to kick myself in the ass for wasting 40+ levels working on tradeskills and other junk when I should of just powerlevelled to 60 and moved into a dungeon.<br>

<br>
Equipment camping (and pharming) as someone mentioned earlier, is indeed a "feature" of the game.  I'm level 56 and I was farming Dalnir for a long time because there's some stuff I want there but will never use for other than show.  I was lucky enough to win a roll on the _one_ rbg I've even seen drop, but if not for that, I'd farm the frenzy, too.  Haste items are that important, similarly, with the completely outrageous prices that are paid at high level for the few pieces of equipment we can still use that isn't no_drop (erm, WTB pre-nerf CoS, btw) and just general raiding expenses, many high-levels have to resort to some pharming to fund themselves.<br>
<br>
However, Auros, I think your only true error was resorting to PnP.  Nothing pisses off 99% of the EQ population more than PnP.  If you had just said it's lame that high-levels pharm, etc, your response from the VCC would have been along the lines of, "Yeah, Verant sucks, huh?  Sorry you had to deal with it," instead of what it was.<br>

If I was camping say Emperor Crush in CB and along came a group of 19th Level players who have banded up to try and kill him I'd give way to them without a second thought and even help em out as they made the try.  To me if you're max equipped and taking camps that others want and which you can't get xp from then you're being an asshole.<br>
  I could draw a correlation between doing this and me joining up a junior football league, paying the dues, playing my first game, scoring ten touchdowns, completely ruining the playing experience of everyone else playing and putting four of the opposition ten year old players into hospital.  Then, when the officials point out that there are rules in place preventing older players from playing in this competition/dungeon whining about how unfair it is and how I payed my &quot;10 dollars a month to do what I want.&quot;<br>
  Sure you can do what you want, be an asshole and bottom feed all that you want, it just amazes me that behaviour that would get someone a quick jab to the head is condoned, and even encouraged by the games community.  This is despite Verant putting in policies to prevent such selfishness.<br>
  I know I shouldn't expect the kind of consideration and respect for others in Everquest that I would from people on the street, the anonymity and type of people that play these kind of games precludes that.  I just find it amazing that the &quot;me me me&quot; mentality is so all pervading.<br>
  Slam, I didn't come down there to try and kick &quot;a 60th out from a spawn and look like a big man&quot; to my group.  Read my lips, I don't derive my sense of self worth from what level my character is or how my group sees me.  Consequently I don't see you, as a level 60 character, as some kind of bigger, tougher or smarter person than I am, I see you as someone who has had more time to push the button to get the reward that EQ levelling and equipment gain is.  If you somehow feel that you are a better person than those who are lower level than you I'd recommend taking a long hard look at yourself to figure out where you went wrong in your life.<br>
  As to someone posting that I'm a player hater, not at all I've met some great people in the game who are fun, smart and generous but I've also met some self centred, loot whoring idiots who can barely string a sentence together.  This is why I only group with regular friends and family and have the freedom to say exactly what I like to whoever I want because I don't have to suck up to anyone to either get in groups/guilds/raids.  I do what I like say what I like and rep be damned.  Flame away guys I enjoy the tortured logic and self serving statements you use to justify your positions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uqxired.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/01 11:08:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=432.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pharming Idiots</span><hr size=1> ya but what benefit does camping emporor crush have to you? slam can benefit from the fbss...god, wish there was a mental preview button <p><center><font color = red>Quarken Xired

Is where the whole thing went in slambam's favor....<br>
<br>
you could've maybe tried what Siggy had pointed out:<br>
<br>
&quot;okay, you have the frenzy and we'll take the others for xp, Slambam. Could you send us a tell when you're done at the frenzy so we can take it over at that time?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm sure Slambam would've been more cooperative and you would look less dumb flaming him for defending himself....<br>
<br>
The game involves a lot of player interaction, and if I'm camping something and someone comes up to me being a dick, I'm not budging and you're going on my /ingore list.  If someone comes up and asks nicely and doesn't become a dick I might just leave then, or the next drop that I'm looking for, simply because I can and I believe that person deserves it more than....some that says....oh, your high level get out or I'll use PnP against you wah wah wah!!<br>
<br>
I believe someone else said it too.....but the 57 Cleric could most likely get xp from the frenzy as well.....<br>
