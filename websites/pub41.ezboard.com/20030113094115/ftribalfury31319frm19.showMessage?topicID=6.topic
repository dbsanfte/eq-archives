<br>
Down below I place a flag for parts I need to complete...<br>
<br>
like this [-----*-----]<br>
<br>
<br>
MAGICIAN EPIC QUEST <br>
<br>
<br>
Element of Earth<br>
<br>
Use the spell Sense Summoned to lead you to Tiblner Milnik's pet within Firiona Vie. He has been seen wandering the cliff. Look for a High Elf Male wearing a brown robe. <br>
<br>
Tiblner Milnik says 'Huh? What? Oh, you speak so fast, it took me a moment. I have become used to the slow and stately conversation the Earth holds, where a thought can span aeons. I am the Master of Earth, you know. Though I'm usually too humble to say this, that makes me the most powerful mortal in Norrath, as everyone knows that Earth is the only REAL Element, all else must give way before its power. Water is absorbed by it, Air is ignored by it, and Fire is contained in it. But you know all these things, I am sure. Are you interested in obtaining the Element of Earth? I know Magi'kot was, but we know what happened to him, don't we? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am interested in obtaining the Element of earth' <br>
<br>
<br>
Tiblner Milnik says 'Combining the following items can bring the Element of Earth together. Obtain the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth, held by the minions of the Prince of Hate, The Dirt of Underfoot found on Slix something or the other, and of course, I shall need the Broom of Trilon and the Shovel of Ponz. Bring all these things, and I shall show you what a true Master of Earth can do, and gift you with the Element of Earth. <br>
<br>
[-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----]<br>
Staff of Earth drops off Magi P'Tasa in Hate. He is on a rare pop out of several (12) places, so there can be multiples of him up, although I have never seen more than 2. The drop rate is about 1 in 4. One uber group can do him, although you probably need an all out raid.  (I need this.)<br>
[-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----]<br>
<br>
Hand the four items in to Tiblner Milnik and you will be rewarded with the Element of Earth. <br>
<br>
<br>
Element of Water<br>
<br>
Go to Jinalis Andir in Dagnor's Cauldron. His location is -447.00, -2044.00. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Jinalis Andir.' <br>
<br>
<br>
Jinalis Andir says 'Let us dispense with pleasantries. I am Jinalis, as you know. I imagine you want to control the Elements. The Element of Water, which I possess, is the most powerful of the Elements. With it you can control the water which falls from the Air, erodes the Earth, and extinguishes Fire. It is a pity you do not focus on the Prime Element, but if you wish to follow that fool Magi'kot to your doom, I will not stop you. Bring me the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water held by the last of the Kedge, the Tears of Erolisi held by a dirty and rotten officer across the Blessed Deep, and finally, the Rain of Karana, found on a mighty Giant in, where else, the Karanas. <br>
<br>
[-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----]<br>
The Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water is dropped from Phinigel Autropos. The Phinigel Autropos is a very hard level 50 Wizard. He can be taken out by around 2-3 groups that work well together. He enjoys dispelling people (usually your enduring breath.)  He is also very difficult to kill because he is guarded by 6 guardians which can be hard to kill as well.  (I need this.)<br>
[-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----]<br>
<br>
<br>
Once you have the three items give them to Jinalis Andir and you will receive the Element of Water. <br>
<br>
<br>
Element of Wind<br>
<br>
Go to Plane of Air and seek Kihun Solstin. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Kihun Solstin' <br>
<br>
Kihun Solstin says 'So, you have made it this far. I am Kihun Solstin, the Master of Wind. I control the unfettered Element like none other. As you should have learned, Air is the most potent of Elements. It fuels Fire, Water is comprised of it, and Earth cannot restrain it. Knowing this, do you seek the Element of Wind? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I seek the element of wind' <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kihun Solstin says 'I will test you then. In this wondrous plane of Air, find the Crown of Elemental Mastery, and search the world below for an Elemental Binder, and a cloak fashioned from the feathers of a Pegasus. Return them to me and I shall give you the Element of Wind. <br>
<br>
[-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----]<br>
The Crown of Elemental Mastery is dropped from anything on the 7th Island in Plane of Air. Basically, clearing the island can result in anywhere from 0-3 crowns.  The crowns are not no drop, so they can be bought, but for extremely high prices.  (I need this.)<br>
[-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----][-----*-----]<br>
<br>
Completing the Quest<br>
<br>
Once you have given him the three items you will receive the Element of Wind. Also, the Master of Elements will spawn (Thought to spawn in the middle of the Quest Room in Plane of Sky but unsure). Give the four elements to the Master of Elements and he will in return, give you the scroll Summon Orb of Mastery.   If you are just doing the Element of Wind first, then you can come back when you are ready to turn in all four elements and say to Kihun, &quot;I want to see your master.&quot;  Scribe this spell and then summon your epic weapon. It is very useful that this is a summon spell because if you accidentally delete it or something happens to it, you just summon it again. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Hope this helps you in understanding my driving force.  This quest is the first and foremost quest on my vending brain.  any and all help is MUCHO appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

~EDIT~<br>
to save wasted reading time, i cut out the parts i have already, leaving only the good stuff behind.<br>
<br>
Also, Blibdoolpoolp is holding some burning embers for me that I need his help to turn in.  Blib, if you read this, I have all the items for the fire turn-in, plz drop a note or send me a tell in game when we can hook up for a quick run thru skyfire.<br>
<br>
Keamien, I am hoping you still have the pegasus cloak, I am counting on you for that one =)  I still need the crown of elemental mastery for the cloak turn-in tho, so it is not finished atm.  Thx bro.<br>

<br>
So, get those four elemental pages of mastery, and get that stein, broom, shovel and torch.<br>
<br>
that's pretty much almost all you can do at 30.  I didn't start till I was 29.  Still pluggin along, and I know many magi much lower than me who are far better off.  They obviously had more help =p<br>
<br>
once you have finished assembling the shovel of ponz, the torch of alna, stein of Ulissa and the broom of trilon and got all four of those pages, lemme know.  if i am able, i would gladly help you thrash najena and her puppets, lemme know when you want to.<br>

<br>
enjoy the game where you are - all levels of the game kick ass and are fun.  It was designed that way. Not for you to feel useless because you are at a level different than your friends.<br>
<br>
There is little content I missed along the way.<br>
<br>
OK thats not right - THERE IS GOBS of content I missed along the way.  Yet I also saw far more than many other players on my way up the level game.  Level Game is just one aspect - if that is all you chase then there is great stuffs to be missed out on.<br>
<br>
The other day I realized there is only 2 kunark zones I haven't explored and exped in ( OK i didn't exp inside cabalis but I tried but my faction wasn't high enough (capped) to turn in mm rings ) - and I don't have keys to those zones.  The only Cities in old world I haven't traveled in are the troll and Dark Elf cities - yes I shop in the ogre town in wolf form.<br>
<br>
There is only one zone in Luclin I haven't been to. (And it is very likely I won't make it but I have 15/17 months left before I quit.)<br>
<br>
Velious has gobs left for me to explore - but well - Velious is a place I just need to explore in a group.  Only been to 7 or 8 zones on Vel.<br>
<br>
AND in all of that I have found  less than half the content available.  EQ has an amazing amount of content for every level.<br>
<br>
Ok Mindless rambling is just to remind you that there is no uselessness of any level thats all.<br>

There are (2) sets of (4) pages you need.  One set, all four can be found in najena.  The torn pages of elemental mastery.<br>
<br>
the words of magi'kot, however, are thrown about the world.<br>

in this case, you need to go to the basement of unrest, they drop the page almost every time, I got mine quickly.  I hate toadmit this, but if you just wait till your about 39-44, you can just storm around and pretty much get all of this stuff.  So, even tho they don't really give magi much to do in this game, don't be afraid to leave your epic alone for a while.  honestly, getting your cloak is by far the hardest part in my eyes.  i won't even tell you how much game time and PP i spent on other trackers helpin me for days and days and....<br>
<br>
yeah, you get the point, and i still don't have my cloak.  light at the end of the tunnel, it's MQable....so at the very least, find someone who can MQ it for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bill>bill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Vending Machine</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/16/02 8:57:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Hunt for the Orb of Mastery</span><hr size=1> Hi Gang, hoping to set up a raid for tomorrow night to take Captain Rottgrime.

Then on to Phinny.  We singled the seahorses just like reliance showed us, pulling them down into the area below the ledge.  We owned phinny, my spells were all landing, my stun pet was wreaking havoc....was a quick fight.  Not to mention 2 warriors spanking him the whole time.  We had repops in the room before we could get out agter killin him, so we gotta have decent dps, and gotta watch out to loot and move back to the ledge or evac in a hurry.  CR's there really suck!<br>
<br>
TF could seriously spank him with one good group.   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
