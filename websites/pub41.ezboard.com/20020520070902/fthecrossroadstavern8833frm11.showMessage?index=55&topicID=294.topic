<br>
heres the best example i can think of for the statement that will follow it. dont try to be P.C. its not going to work. (and i know my spelling sucks, no need to comment)<br>
<br>
over the years of our history many races have been called by many names. it was blacks, then negros, then africain americans. those from mexico have been hispanic, latino, and mexican american. the names, or titles, have been changed all the time as to not offend anyone or as few as possible. this is where PC tries to fit in. our world has become so frightened of what others may think someone meens that we try to sugarcoat everything that is spoken in public so as to not offend anyone that may be in range of what is said, or written, or posted, or whatever. people will always find something to be offened about. almost all the time its because of some personal problem of thiers that they must exploit and change the meanings of what others say to draw attention to it cause it is what they want, as to draw out whats in them and to watch someone else suffer or take the blame of thier evils that they do not have the heart to deal with themselvs.<br>
<br>
in short. if someone took cere's train message personal and desided it was racest, then it was more then likely that the person has either suffered from someones racest attackes before and wants to see punishment, or trouble, delt upon someone, or is racest and like to see trouble make from words that didnt meen anything until he/she could change it to what they wanted it to be. <br>
<br>
in even shroter, dont be PC, you will always offend someone cause there are the people out there that look to be offened or thier life just cant be complete. some people thrive on sturring up shit from nothing and creating a wide spread panic and trouble. these are the people that need to be drug out into the streets and shot to save humanity.<br>

<br>
As for being cute, I'll never forget the night my (now) wife introduced me to her friend Howard who was (insert slang of your choice to indicate &quot;into guys&quot;) .. i shook his hand and then he hugged her hello and she laughed hysterically at something he said.  Later she told me he whispered &quot;Oh My God he's so cute, does he have a brother&quot;.  I just took it as a compliment.<br>
<br>
Fuck the people who got upset over the train message.  Do we really care about them?  I mean isnt there a saying &quot;It's none of my business what other people think of me&quot;.  They're gonna get bent out of shape, let em.<br>
<br>
People in this world need to grow up and get over all this bullshit.<br>
<br>
As a Jewish person, i could get enraged every time someone refers to bargaining down a price as &quot;Jew them down&quot;.<br>
As someone with a homosexual family member, I could get pissed everytime I hear someone called a &quot;Polesmoking homo&quot;.<br>
As an uncle of someone who's develpmentally slow, i could get pissed everytime I hear someone call a person &quot;a fucking retard&quot;.<br>
Or I can just realize that there are a lot of different views, opinions, thoughts and beliefs, and let people have theirs, let me have mine, and just keep my circle of friends &quot;clean&quot;.<br>
<br>
For those that think homosexuality is a sin, fine. Live that way. Just keep the shit to yourself.  Is your life *SO* fucking miserable you need to get involved in others lives?  Or better yet, are you so fucking perfect, you have TIME to get involved in others?  While you thump that bible, your son is upstairs hanging himself and sniffing glue.  <br>

I mean, honestly, my big thing is screwing two asian girls at the same time. Never done it, would love to. Is it deviant? Yes, if you prefer three blondes. Yes, if you prefer two guys and one girl there with you. Yes, if I leave the lights on while I'm doing it (/nod Llewyn).<br>
<br>
What stumps me is why does some people's idea of fun bother other people, namely catholics and, to a lesser extent, other christians. It doesn't bother, say, buddhists. It never bothered the shintoists (if Clavell's &quot;Shogun&quot; is to be believed). <br>
<br>
Heck, what stumps me even more is why anyone these days believes in the bible to begin with: food falling from the sky, sea parting, rezurrections (did Lazarus get exp back from the rez, btw?), water turning into blood, heck even a burning bush gets these people off! A bush, burning, and it's a goddamn miracle? I tell ya, it doesn't take much to excite a catholic!<br>
<br>
If there's any minority which deserves being pushed around, it's any catholic who preaches in public. Not a native american, not an irishman, and for god's sake, not me and my two asian girls.<br>

When I was in highschool, i wanted to have sex with a black girl (I'm a jewish boy from brooklyn).  I had the opportunity and was too stupid to realize it until it was too late... Karen, cheerleader in HS that was a year older (and oh so hot).  Oh well.<br>
<br>
I prefer tall women with tone bodies and nice hands and feet .. polished is important ... gimmie a halfling woman (big feet with polished toenails) and a barb woman (ripped calves and legs) and i'm a happy dwarf.  <br>
<br>
I guess the point to my ramblings is ya'll gotta chill.  This is just a game.  Getting worked up over it is obscene. I remember when I used to curse when I died. Nearly put my fist thru the PC during a bad hate raid once. Now I just shrug it off.  If the game is too much for you, no matter HOW serious you play it, then walk away.   As for the other shit (racial slurs, sexuality preferences, etc) .. dude, it's time to realize that not everyone in the world is going to think and act and believe the way you do.  Give them their space and the right do be their own person.  Dont agree with them, but atleast accept them.  World would be a much better place.<br>

So, given the lifespan of human history, the &quot;stance&quot; currently in place for this behavior is away from the norm, ie deviant itself.  Therefore, are we even at a position to judge such a thing since the apparent stance is one of deviance itself?  My point:  Dont judge, you arent the final arbiter and neither is anyone else.<br>

In case you were not aware morality and relegion ARE NOT the same thing.  Agnostics also have morals.  So does that mean they also are &quot;bible thumpers&quot; . Very very odd. <br>
<br>
Seems to me all of you trying to accuse me of being a homosexual might just be trying to cover for yourselves.  <br>
<br>
I have not attacked anyone in a personal manner as have several of you.  But you have the nerve to attack me.  Guess that really proves who is more intelligent and has more common sense.  You cant defend yourself without making attacks.<br>
<br>
Just to make it clear, I am a heterosexual, not homosexual.  I am not a &quot;bible thumper&quot; though I do believe  in the existance of God.  <br>
<br>
This enitire thread changed from language to moral/deviant issues when those with small minds decided to attack me instead of just have a discussion.  Maybe at some point you will mature enough to not do such childish things.<br>
<br>
And for the person with the Fallwel or whatever his name is, that pissed me off probably more than any others that post here.  He was entirely wrong and it was a ridiculous statement.  Hope that clears that little issue up for you. <p>Llewyn Desperado <BR>

Well I got news for ya buddy.  MAJORITY RULES!! God what a dip.  Lets see Gay=homo is slang it is very common in the english language.  And yes slang words that are used enough turn into common language.  No it isn't proper english but then again then we would all be saying thou art and all that bull shit.  I don't see you typing that way so hmmm that would mean you use slang.  So quit your self righteous bull shit you aren't better than anyone here because you have different morals or general thought process than the rest of the english speaking world.  It just means you are a dumb ass.  Wow i feel better now.<br>

A Polish guy walks into a store, and asks for some Polish sausage.<br>
The cashier looks at him funny, and asks, &quot;Are you Polish?&quot;<br>
The guy gets annoyed. &quot;Why, if I walked in and asked for beer would you ask me if I were Irish? Or if I asked for some pasta, would you ask if I were Italian?&quot;<br>
&quot;No,&quot; the cashier replies, &quot;I wouldn't.&quot;<br>

You can go on and on about generalizations, but that's ALL they are.  They are general statements about a 'whole' and do not relate very well to the specifics.  <br>
