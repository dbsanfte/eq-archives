<br>
I don't have the time to commit to the game as most of IV do, nor do i want to be so serious about a raid that it would seem like a job (unless i were to get paid the same, that would rock!).  but alas, this game is supposed to be a distraction from life, not life a distraction from the game.  After y'all get tired of EQ and move on, what will you have.  This is my 2nd mmorpg and the other game doesn't even mean anything to me anymore, as this one won't.  So what else is there...to have fun.  People have different methods of having fun.  For IV it's putting on their game faces and getting snazy stuff, and go places noone else can touch (for the moment).  For PO it's all about having fun while there.  no we don't clear planes fast, but we have fun doing it.  As far as the other guilds go....they have their own idea of fun too.<br>
<br>
whats my point?  Krimzin was just lettin y'all know what you could expect out of your time w/ IV.  If you joined w/o knowing that, you would probobly cause some friction before you got fed up with something and quit either IV or EQ alltogether.<br>

Krim, wanna know why you and your guild catch so much flak?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Monji / Monjo: Hows Zlandicar and &quot;Zone in&quot; ToV sir? Almost as fun as watching us in Kael while we kill Vindicator I bet?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Cleary sir, IV started in NToV and never did zone in? You guys started in on this shit when we were in ToV the other night at the same time and some other real bullshit too.<br>
<br>
You can come back here later and rant at me cus next time I see your members being asses, I'm not gonna ignore it. I can pretty much make a social button to say what needs to be said everytime.<br>
<br>
/ooc Guys, I'm insecure and/or overwieght IRL. Since I never get laid and live with my parents, I need you to boost my ego by telling me how UBER I am and how much everyone else SUCKS.<br>
<br>
Bullshit, you all ran around at level 3 hoping to get the skel with a cracked staff just like the rest of us. You had bad Fear breaks, you got wiped by Maestro and had to camp a cleric, you had to learn how to kill CT, you started in WW before going to ToV, in ToV you started and zone in before going farther in. I guess if it makes you feel better to point out, and make fun of, the fact that some people are doing the same things you had to do, except for some who joined you semi-recently and got to skip all of the work some of us are still doing, then that's what you should continue to do.<br>
<br>
Hey guys, grats on the accomplishments. Noone is trying to take that away from you, but guess what? You aren't the only guild who's ever done these things and won't be the only guild on Vaz that ever does.<br>
<br>
Does IV catch hell sometimes becuase of jealousy? Sure. Do you and most of your members ask for it more often than not? You bet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note, yeah I just destroyed any chance that IV would ever consider me if I hadn't done that by telling Vhenn what a total and complete dipshit he is in some other threads. Do I care? Nope, know why? Because I'm happy where I am and if PO broke up tomorrow, there are several guilds on this server who I've never seen act like total and complete asses just to jerk each other off and remind themselves how uber they are. Never seen SF in Kael /oocing about how lame it must be for Regression to be killing around the arena. Never seen CC /oocing about how lame it must be for other euro's to still be exping in KC.<br>
<br>
Before anyone asks, I don't hate IV, just Vhenn, but I AM starting to dislike alot of thier members who I'd never have known existed until they started the.. how did that go? 'Self-congratulatory circle jerk' when other guilds are present in a zone. <p>Alyen Stormrunner <BR>

<br>
And yes, there's still a little hard feelings toward him for that one day.  I'm sorry, I don't know about you guys but we work fucking hard for our strats, we don't just let anyone go and watch how we do shit, specially without helping us in return.<br>
<br>
As for our guild, or more directly krimzin and this post deserving being flamed for past ooc comments against your guild, I think you're taking things a little far.  I've only seen krimzin make *one* negative comment toward any PO member in ooc (during the alkabor event about telandra and her fake sig, she was annoying everyone at the time I think so that was pretty much why, eventhough that's not justification) and that wasn't even against PO, that was just simply against her...so here comes the she's my friend so I'll stick up for her defense!<br>
<br>
And since you asked, the first time we did tov we did it on a weekend, we spent friday at the zone in to get the feel for mobs and by saturday we'd moved past the zone in and a day or two later began pulling from the west wing.  We haven't done the &quot;zone in&quot; since, we don't see the point in having to kill 8 drakes with basically 0 chance of a drop.  We also never really farmed WW, maybe once while waiting for people to log on for a real raid.<br>
<br>
I also like how you pointed out later in the post that you don't hate IV, just Vehnn, and a few more members from ooc comments.  Yet, this being the case, you seem so willing to flame the guild as whole.<br>
<br>
Please, give it a rest, your same argument trying to be the good guy by jumping on the bandwagon and flaming the side you dislike when you could easily go at either side is getting old.  Or, wait, if you were to flame that other side that's one more guild who wouldn't let you in if PO broke up, and god forbid anyone looks for flaws in those who aren't the best.<br>
<br>
Props to kead, eventhough I never thought I'd say that, for not jumping on the bandwagon Alyen's got a front row seat on. <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

I don't know how many people read through the other lists that were made, but honestly... I glanced over them in about 5 sec until I got back to original posts, not mimicry...<br>
<br>
So for everyone here bitching at Krimzin, reread everything to its fullest(his quotes do give some excellent examples).<br>
<br>
On the other side of the coin Krimzin, much like the President of the US, or any other person in a position of power, there's going to be people that rub you as nicely as some sandpaper TP. And I hate to say it, but in the world of politics you have to do one of two things : 1. Shut up and be the bigger man and take the flak for bullshit reasons until the idiots make asses of themselves or 2. Lash back at them and consider it all a big joke and everyone who comes to their 'defense' as well. <br>
<br>
IMO however, the last thing you want to do is attack and then drop back to defense, all that does is make people think you are weak. I think it shows that you honestly do care about what people think about you and you're guild, but to most of the idiots that start this nonsense, you're only giving them more incentive to sling mud when you stick your neck out.<br>
<br>
And before any of the aforementioned idiots call me a Krimzin/IV asskisser, I can't say for sure what terms we're on now, but when I left EQ on my break, we were on about the worst terms possible. However, I don't think any of the nonsense that was started in this thread against him had any right to be there.<br>
<br>
And one last word for the idiots... keep in mind what could happen if Krimzin and the core of IV were to leave and any other guilds 'above you', you could end up being in the same hotseat that you try to put him into. Now, how would you like to be there... Hmm? <p><H2><B>--Vaclav Romanov--</H2></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/unaryasf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Narya SF</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://sirion.netfirms.com/rings.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/23/01 7:42:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=108>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sirion.netfirms.com/eq/narya_sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: memory lane</span><hr size=1> I'm agreeing with Vaclav in that Krimzin's initial reaction to the first few replies was completely justified.

I'm proud of my guild.  I think that we've done some impressive things from a power-gamer point of view, given the age of this server.  <br>
<br>
It doesn't make us better people, it won't matter for most of us five years from now.  Some of us will let it get to our head, just like a level 35 warrior might let a yak get to his head, or a level 29 necromancer might it the fact that he's a higher level than his best friend get to his head.<br>
<br>
This is human nature.  Not only that, but it is common human nature.  I know members of every larger guild who have done such things.  If you want to dislike a guild for that, go for it.<br>
<br>
We're not a guild of perfect people.  We're just a bunch of guys who have fun killings big mobs in EQ.<br>
<br>
I've said it before, but people need to chill.  The people who bash IV on this board typically accuse us of having RL issues, but I don't think that's the case.  The people with the real issues are the people who feel real anger, bitterness and resentment on these boards.  They need to step back, relax, and go see a movie or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvehn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 487<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/23/01 9:29:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=112>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: memory lane</span><hr size=1> That's nice that you hate me alyen.

Np, I'll play with log on from now on. The wounded martyr role doesn't fit you well.<br>
<br>
Today's lesson, everyone in IV is a saint who is put upon by the rest of us. They *never* say anything bad or talk down to people. Vhenn(I don't care how it's spelled) doesn't say anything in ooc, musta been his evil twin in ToV.<br>
<br>
So, things that weren't said in ooc that I just imagined:<br>
<br>
Soon after arriving, and cothing a few of your people from SG to the zone in cus I'm a nice guy, I imagined hearing Vehnn and a few others /oocing about sig pics(/em points out member(s) of your own guild who's sig pics have gear they never owned). I also imagined hearing something about 'Hey guys, should we go camp the zone out?' 'Yeah, may as well. The zone in is camped.' And the best thing I imagined was when someone on your raid did a mana check and a guest on our raid accidentally responded, how many people did I imagine going postal? The hate and venom spewed in ooc that night was one-sided and flung at anyone without an IV tag or hoping to get one.<br>
<br>
Don't want me pointing out when your members behave like children? Tell them to stfu, because a few are making the rest of you look like turd sandwiches. <p>Alyen Stormrunner <BR>

1. Vaclav, people that try to get groups to kill epic turn in mobs to prevent someone from getting their epic shouldn't give PR advice.<br>
<br>
2. Alyen, your raid had done that many times.  It was rude.  And Breill went so far above the line, and we let him know.  Of the following exchange, and the tells kead sent samir, you guys didn't show you were the better guild at all.<br>

By that time, I was more than ready to sink to being innappropiate myself.<br>
<br>
About people responding to your mana checks /shrug you guys were using both /ooc and /shout. We just stuck to using /gu rather than public channels, and I wasn't paying much attention to your raid chatter and who responded but people make mistakes.<br>
<br>
If you'd rather, I'll not respond to the childishness when I see it. I can, however, just start being petty. Several times in ToV I saw instances of profanity in public channels from your raid leaders, I'll just make use of the /report tool in the future. That fits the 'playing by the rules' that I've read so often, does sound like a better plan? It's not what I want to do, but I'm pretty much done listening to members of your guild behaving like jackasses and having nothing to say about it.<br>
<br>
I'll go ahead and make a blanket statement for every member of PO here. I garuntee that if IV ignores PO when we are in the same zones together, that we'd do the same. Sit around and bait us all night? Don't be surprised when someone gets pissed.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we can work hard at making sure other people don't have fun at this game. Or we can get over our ego, stfu, leave each other to our own devices and have fun. <p>Alyen Stormrunner <BR>
