<br>
...a sleeping soul...<br>
<br>
...inhale...<br>
<br>
For three days, Riverdane Wyldechylde sat, unmoving, staring at the ghost of his wife, Camille, laying in the oversized bed of Innoruuk, a soul without a living body, perpetually locked in unnatural slumber...for three days he had received no audience, eaten no food, sipped from no cup....nor did he need to. After the defeat of his father Innoruuk, River had achieved godhood. He, by bastard bloodrite, was the new Prince of Hate.<br>
<br>
Outside the chamber doors, what passed as life in Hate went on. Often there was a quiet knock on his door, but River ignored these. Until today. This knocking was more like pounding, with a frantic urgency to it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in.&quot; River said, eyes not leaving Camille on the bed.<br>
<br>
The door opened, and the voice of one of Hate's Elite, the damned dark elven souls who had served Innoruuk, cut through the once silent chamber.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your wickedness, Hate is under siege.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who has come?&quot; River asked. Hate was ALWAYS under siege.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Walkers, sire.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahhh, Walkers. Must be Elyohim again. He was always coming up here in search of his last piece of his epic. Or maybe Mildane. Both rangers had been haunted by that rare gem since they had begun their epics. Both were friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find me the Master of Spite and the Mistress of Scorn please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Elite stood there blinking in surprise at him. It truly looked lost.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's the matter?&quot; River asked, when it became apparent the Elite didn't know how to proceed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sire,&quot; the Elite stammered. &quot;The Master and Mistress are both in, but I didn't understand 'please'.&quot; He took a cautionary step forward. &quot;Are you ill, my Lord?&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane sighed. &quot;Get them now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that the Elite was gone.<br>
<br>
Several moments later, another knock, to be ushered in by River. The Elite opened the door and stepped to the side. Through the door first came a woman with a body that would make a grown man cry, and a face that would make a grown man scream. Maggots wriggled in and out of the decomposing skin on the zombie woman's face. Her breath was a hiss of leaking gassing. The Mistress of Scorn.<br>
<br>
Behind her, pushing his bulk through the doorway, came the Master of Spite. A huge black obsidian juggurnaut, his features seemed cut into the black living stone he was created from. With two thunderous footsteps he took his place in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two.&quot; River addressed them, trying to look at Spite rather than become ill looking at the Mistress. &quot;Do you have your Shattered Emeralds of Corruption?&quot;<br>
<br>
Spite nodded silently at him. &quot;Yesssss, my Lord.&quot; Scorn hissed quietly.<br>
<br>
River turned his attention to the Elite. &quot;Where are Walkers now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are travelling across the north wall, sire. I believe they are headed to our southwest corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; He turned his attention back to the two he summoned. &quot;That gives you two time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What would you have us do, my Lord?&quot; Spite asked, his voice a deep echoing bass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I want you both to get to southwest corner as quickly as you can, cutting through the city and....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesssssss.&quot; Scorn said happily, eyesockets lighting with fire dancing in empty holes.<br>
<br>
&quot;....and take your emeralds and leave them in a neat little pile and then return to me.&quot; River finished.<br>
<br>
If the Mistress could blink with no eyes, she would have.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you mean surprise them and rip them apart, sire?&quot; Spite asked, nodding his head as if to encourage River to agree.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I mean as I said.&quot; River replied, shooing them away. &quot;Now go, and if you disobey a word I've said, I'll put you in a small locked room with the Evangelist for three days until you lose what passes for your mind with his chatter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, yes sire.&quot; Spite said, pulling a dumbfounded Mistress out of the room with him.<br>
<br>
River turned back to Camille, the problem with how to wake her replacing the thoughts of Walkers in his new home. <br>
<br>
The Elite stood staring at River's back. &quot;You know,&quot; the Elite said. &quot;You're supposed to be one of the BAD guys.&quot; And with that, the Elite turned rather indignantly and left the room.<br>
<br>
River stubbed out the cigarette, eyes on his sleeping wife. He had to find a way to wake her, and to escape his new job.<br>
<br>
Eternity could be a long long time.<br>

Gah, the entire book is permeated with it. The denizens of evil, birthed in sulphurous fumes, are inured to the smoke, but however did Camille stand it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Lyri&quot;, the door opens quickly and her youngest brother tumbles onto her bed, wetting her cheek with his tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi is dead again!&quot; Still sobbing he presses the still warm, limp body of a small hamster against her shoulder.<br>
<br>
Lyriele represses her aversion to rodents and takes the small body from her brother. She kisses him softly and gently carries Vindi to the simple altar in the corner of her room.<br>
<br>
Although not part of her formal training, she knew of Tunare's love of all nature and so through trial and error, had perfected the mini-mammal resurrection spell which she now cast.<br>
<br>
No sooner had she begun the incantation, when Vindi's sides began to move in and out and the pink colour rushed back into his muzzle. <br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi, Vindi&quot;, squealed her brother as he scooped the reborn troublemaker into the palms of his hand. He ambled toward the door with his small prize, but Lyriele put her hand on his shoulder and stopped him a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;No parachuting him from rooftops, or whatever it was that killed him this time&quot;. Lyriele tried to fix a stern expression on her face. Kev bobbed his head in agreement and ran down the hallway. &quot;No more radio control hamster&quot;, she heard him exclaim to his friends as she closed the door.<br>
<br>
She crossed the room again and returned to the altar. She grabbed a handful of rose petals and scattered them there, uttering a quick prayer of thanks to Tunare, before collapsing back onto her bed.<br>
<br>
She held the Book of Riverdane absently in her hand and wondered how he would obtain new life for Camille. Perhaps he might fulfill a quest for Marr and earn her life that way? <br>
<br>
&quot;I bet she's never res'd a hamster&quot;, Lyriele gloats as she begins to read again the story.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;You will not deny me passage!&quot; the new voice said, raising in pitch. &quot;Do you know what I went through to get here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry...&quot; the elite replied. &quot;I have tried to tell you over and over, the Dark Prince is seeing no visitors....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am no mere visitor!&quot; the stranger said in indignation. &quot; I have served Innoruuk faithfully for 22 years! I was his champion in life, striving to bring the word and will of Hate to all corners of Norrath! NO one could hate better than me, no one!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, you don't seem to under...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Hells I don't! I was this close, THIS close to being pulled back by a resurrection! I saw the light, I was lifting up into it. And i FOUGHT it! I fought my way back down into death, just to sit at the right hand of my Father. And now, after permanently succumbing my soul to this accursed place, you are telling me he is BUSY?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; the elite responded, resignedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then enough...of YOU!&quot; the stranger cried, and the sound of magical energy building filled the room. The sound of something being mesmerized. And then another sound.<br>
<br>
The sound of River's door being flung open.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Dark Prince, I have served you humbly for 22 years, and have delivered my soul to you across the boundary of death! Use me to serve your dark purpose, oh Lord!&quot;<br>
<br>
River turned in his chair to find a robed dark elf kneeling before him, head low to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up Vven.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
The dark elf looked up and blinked.<br>
<br>
&quot;River?? What the hells are you doing here?&quot; Vven got up and brushed dust off his robes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well....&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no.....nonono.&quot; Vven replied. &quot;Don't tell me Razor's Edge came up here and booted Inny for a few days, not after all I went through to get here and...&quot; The enchanter was obviously distraught.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, no....&quot; River interjected.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, cause, well, I refused to be resurrected after a bad turn in The Deep, and am sort of committed to Innoruuk now. How long ago did you lay siege?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord, this enchanter mesmerized me outside.&quot; the elite said, coming in, still blinking off the fog of his magical daze. &quot;Shall I have the invader's skin flayed off?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, no.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord.&quot; Vven repeated slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;MILORD???&quot; Vven cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, milord.&quot; the elite said, shooting Vven a dirty look and exiting the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen Vven...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;After all this, my body permanently down there, my soul permanently up here, you mean to tell me somehow you not only defeated Innoruuk, but are now the new God of Hate? You? A......HUMAN?&quot; If Vven could foam at the mouth, he would be at this point.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been a long week.&quot; River said softly, sinking back into his chair. It was at this point Vven saw Camille on the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and...oh.&quot; For once Vven looked speechless. &quot;What happened here? Why isn't she...breathing or anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk trapped me into trading Camille's soul for my own life, Vven. I came back here to get her back, but all I have done is trapped myself as the new prince of Hate and locked camille in stasis. I need to discover what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven let this all sink in. &quot;So you killed Innoruuk, for good, no coming back after a little while?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. Innoruuk is dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven let out a long sigh. &quot;Then I have sacrificed myself for nothing. I'm sorry River, but I wouldn't follow you on Norrath, I'm CERTAINLY not going to follow you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We need to find out where to begin. I need to find how to wake Camille. Who knows, if I can find a way to wake her from her slumber, maybe I can find a way to return you to your body. I am supposedly a god now. That must count for something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, then let's move. The longer I am up here the longer my body rots down there.&quot; Vven hitched up his robe from dragging on the ground and started to march out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold on, I don't have a clue where to begin.&quot; River said, grabbing hold of the enchanter's sleeve.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was never into lore, or mythology, other than Innoruuk's teachings.&quot; Vven replied. &quot;You need someone with a little more history under his belt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone very smart...&quot; River said, stroking his chin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone with all the answers...&quot; Vven chimed in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone that knows Norrathian history backwards and forward...&quot; River added.<br>
<br>
Vven nodded. &quot;Someone short.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang.&quot; they said together.<br>

&quot;I hate Ak'Anon.&quot; Vven murmured in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;So do I, brother, so do I.&quot; Riverdane agreed, squatting on his haunches in front of the small house, knocking hard on the door.<br>
<br>
Ak'Anon. Steamfront Mountains. Home of the gnomes, gnarled men, cute petite women, eternal tinkerers, gadget makers, masters of the lever and spring, creaters of clocks and modern tools. And all through the land, that persistant, maddening noise. Tick TOCK.<br>
<br>
No answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Must be all this noise.&quot; River remarked. &quot;It's amazing gnomes can hear anything at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's because you are human!&quot; Vven snorted, rolling up his sleeve. &quot;Learn to knock with authority!&quot;. He rapped his knuckle against the door with a hrumph.<br>
<br>
And through it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm.&quot; Vven remarked, a little out of sorts. &quot;I passed my hand through, as if discorpreal.&quot; River just looked at him, and where his arm ended with the wrist flush against the door, hand passing through it as if the door didn't exist.<br>
<br>
&quot;I imagine, you being dead has something to do with that.&quot; River commented, watching Vven draw his hand from the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely. I am a ghost.&quot; Vven said with disgust. &quot;That should prove cumbersome.&quot;<br>
<br>
River knocked again. &quot;Whizbang, you old goat, let me in!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whether it be his shout or the occupants finally hearing the knock, the small door opened without a creak. Good old fashion Gnome Oil made sure of that.<br>
<br>
There in the framework of the miniature door, stood a tiny gnome woman with a rolling pin in one hand. Her eyes smiled when she saw River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well well, Riverdane Wyldechylde, I haven't seen you in ages!&quot; she exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Ms. Dustyboots.&quot; River said with a smile. The smell of some confection permeated the air. River may not need to eat, but the smell of good cooking still gave his senses a turn for the better.<br>
<br>
&quot;Call me Pedi, boy, or don't come calling at all!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You know better than that! And who is this with you? Oh..&quot; Now taking a close look at Vven. &quot;A dark elf. How...lovely. Well well come in, come in. I imagine the smell of my cooking isn't what brought you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven looked at the tiny door with an eyebrow raised. &quot;And how, madam, do you expect us to fit into this quaint little....doll house?&quot;<br>
<br>
But Pedi was already anticipating the question. She handed them both small vials. &quot;Just drink up and come in.&quot; she said. River took the small vial from her. Vven tried to, but it passed through his hand and shattered on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...my.&quot; she said, staring at the puddle on the ground. &quot;Perfectly good waste of a shrink potion. You do have a little problem, don't you, young man? Well, I'm afraid then you'll have to crawl in....&quot;<br>
<br>
River had already partaken in the contents of the vial, and was slowly changing form, shrinking down to Pedi's small stature.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hells I will crawl through the home of a gnome!&quot; Vven snorted. &quot;May Innoruuk forgive me.&quot; he murmured, reciting an incantation. And with a shimmer, his image changed to a small gnome, white beard and all. But he kept his bright blue skin. The effect was....disquieting.<br>
<br>
&quot;My, you look just like a...&quot; Pedi began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we proceed?&quot; Vven interrupted, pushing into the house.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your friend needs to learn to be polite!&quot; Pedi commented to River as he looked at her apologetically.<br>
<br>
&quot;That WAS him polite.&quot; River said, entering the house and closing the door behind him. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0> at: 1/5/03 7:06:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/7/03 4:40:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;WHIZBANG YOU HAVE VISITORS!&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane shook his head in a daze as the echoes of Pedi's shout reverberated through the house. For such a petite woman she certainly could give the bards a run for volume.<br>
<br>
A voice came from the doorway leading into the basement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Visitors? So soon? Blast them, they're early! I didn't expect the new guild applicants till noon!&quot; A crash of a chest being closed, then some more noise, something falling to the floor, followed by a lot of somethings falling to the floor, a string of colorful gnomish curses, and small feet pounding up wooden stairs.<br>
<br>
And that was just the beginning of his entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Whizbang Dustyboots, gnomish sorcerer of the third rank, Baron of the Dragonscale Hills and wielder of the Staff of the Four! I am the scourge of the Teir'Dal, death incarnate to the Kromzek and ...&quot; Whizbang stopped mid-sentence, scratching his white goatee and looking at River and Vven.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; River smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't, go on.&quot; Vven interjected. &quot;Specially the scum of the Teir'Dal...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Scourge, my blue tainted cousin, scourge.&quot; Whizbang replied, peering at Vven. &quot;I must say, your pigmentation I have never seen before on a gnome. Although, I must have record of it somewhere in this house. No matter, I will find it after our business here is conducted. But yes, many a Teir'Dal has tasted the wrathe of my fire. If I had my way, I would enter Neriak itself and lay wast...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang...&quot; Pedi tried to cut in, but he shushed her with a wave of his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;...lay waste to the twisted children of Innoruuk. Their sole purposes seem to be...&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi seemed more urgent. &quot;Whizbang, our guest is....&quot; she tried again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, woman, WHAT?&quot; Whizbang cried in frustration.<br>
<br>
She glared at him. &quot;Our guest is...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An inky.&quot; Vven supplied, with a crooked grin. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang, meet Vven. An old aquaintance of mine.&quot; River offered. &quot;He was a Teir'Dal enchanter in life, thus this little illusion to enter your house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrummph.&quot; Whizbang hrummphed, &quot;Blue skin. A mockery of gnomes in my house. Well, River, you've got my attention.&quot; Then something dawned on him. &quot;You say '...was a Teir'Dal enchanter in life' Was. What is the meaning of that, does he not live now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorta dead, gnome.&quot; Vven answered. &quot;I'm not just blue because I'm a Teir'Dal. I'm blue cause I'm not breathing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang looked at River for a sign of a joke, and was more disturbed by the serious look on his old friends' face.<br>
<br>
&quot;We need to talk about this....and more, don't we, River.&quot; Whiz said. It was not a question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, and more.&quot; River replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;To my basement. We will have privacy there.&quot; Whiz said, ushering them though the doorway to the staircase that led into his library. &quot;Pedi, please bring some refreshment, and join us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh good,&quot; Pedi replied. &quot;I just made a fresh batch of Gnome Shaped Cookies...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, woman!&quot; Whizbang exploded. &quot;How many times do I have to tell you no Gnome Shape Cookies in this house! It's symbolic of cannibalism, I tell you, and I won't....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU'LL EAT THEM AND LIKE THEM!&quot; Pedi roared. River nearly tripped down the stairs. Whizbang's mouth snapped shut and he descended into the cool depths of the library. Pedi turned a warm smile on her still youthful face towards River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, watch your footing, gentlemen, and you can tell us all about it down below. Have a cookie?&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/8/03 3:12:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> ...inhale...<br>
<br>
&quot;You say Innoruuk is dead.&quot; Whizbang said after a pause. The two gnomes and River sat at an oak table, with a burning candle and platter of cookies on it, while Vven paced nervously around the room, glancing at the hundreds of titles of Whizbang's library.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dead.&quot; River replied, watching Whizbang's face for any sign of belief. Whizbang was impossible to read when lost in thought, and lost in thought he seemed. &quot;Or...gone at least. Done in, in some way. The Elite acknowledged me as their new master.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi's face was distraught. &quot;Poor poor Camille! Trapped in Hate. River, how could you have made that agreement with Innoruuk? Any of us could have told you she gave you her soul long ag...&quot; But she trailed off unfinished, as River turned to her with a look of such self loathing she was left speechless.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; he said softly.<br>
<br>
She patted his hand. &quot;Well, it is the curse of all things male to make at least one huge mistake in their lives.&quot; she said. &quot;Now it is time to fix it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And fix ME, River.&quot; Vven said from behind him. &quot;An eternity playing spook for a human is not my destiny. Not even Innoruuk had that cruel a sense of humor!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm WORKING on it.&quot; River replied testily. He turned back to Whizbang. &quot;So, Whiz, any advice? Do you even believe me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You've never lied to me before, to my knowledge, River, and I don't expect you would concoct something this bizarre even as a joke. Plus no one would suffer the ravings of this dark elf,&quot; a gesture to Vven, met with a theatrical hiss from the enchanter, &quot;for no reason. So yes, I believe you. Do I know how to proceed? No. My mind is old, but something keeps dancing at the edge of it. Something important. Something I've read.&quot; His eyes got a very faraway look in the candlelight. &quot;What was it......what was it.....something you said tripped a switch....&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly his eyes focused in again. &quot;Yes! That's it. Camille. You had said you had at first thought when she drowned herself she was with Marr. Mithaniel Marr, not Erollsi, yes? Camille worshipped Mithaniel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Whiz. How did you guess that? Most women worshipped Erollsi rather than Mithaniel, but Camille was different. She called Erollsi too soft for a woman of steel. How did you guess that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because it makes sense. It is all starting to make sense.&quot; Whizbang replied. But rather than look happy with his discovery, Whizbang's look became more and more worried, deep lines cutting into his forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;River,&quot; he said suddenly. &quot;You say you haven't eaten or taken drink in almost a week, yet have suffered no desire or need for food or water? A result of your godhood? And you were able to will yourself to my doorstep from Hate, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; River replied, &quot;I haven't felt the need to eat or sleep or drink or....&quot;<br>
<br>
And before River could even react, Whizbang with quick movements pulled a long hair pin from Pedi's bun, and drove it into River's palm. <br>
<br>
&quot;What the OWWW DAMMIT!&quot; River cried as the pin drove itself in and through his palm. Whiz pulled the pin out and absently handed it to a shocked Pedi, staring at River's twitching palm. At first there was nothing, but then the blood began to flow, puddling in River's palm and dripping to the table. River glared at Whizbang, teeth gritted in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hells, and you call the Teir'Dal sadists...&quot;, Vven chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are mortal yet.&quot; Whizbang murmured. &quot;Pedi, your skills please.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pedi took River's palm into her hands and closed her eyes. From under her lids, a flash of blue light. And then, the pain was gone, the wound disappearing before River's eyes. He knew Pedi was a cleric of no meager skills, but the shock of what Whiz had done still left him rattled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz, what in the gods' names was that all about?&quot; River asked, accepting a handtowel Pedi handed to him to clean up the blood. She then swatted Whizbang hard on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;STOP stabbing the guests!&quot; she warned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation woman!&quot; Whizbang cried, rubbing the lump that began forming on his forehead. &quot;I needed to know for certain!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Know WHAT, Whiz?&quot; River asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you were still mortal. A god yet still mortal.&quot; Whizbang said, leaping up, starting to peer at books lining his walls. &quot;Mortal Hate. I needed to know.....&quot; A pause, two books pushed aside, more frantic searching. &quot;Where is it, where is it...?.....I needed to know if you were mortal Hate...damnation, where is my Lexicon Of Prophecy??&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi and Vven pointed at the same time about a foot to Whizbang's left, and uttered the same word.<br>
<br>
&quot;There.&quot;, they said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrrumph.&quot; Whiz hrrumphed, pulling it off the shelf. Dust flew as he did. He slapped it down flat on the table in such a rush that he forgot River's puddle of blood, and the blood spread out from around the book's edges like a crimson aura. Whizbang began flipping through the pages in a rush.<br>
<br>
&quot;So this book has the answer to my problem?&quot; River asked, trying to make out any of the words or runes that flipped by as Whiz tore through the pages.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid this is much bigger than your friend Vven's life, or Camille's or your own, River.&quot; Whiz said distractedly, still searching through the book.<br>
<br>
River's bloody hand clamped over Whiz's, stopping the gnome for a moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; River asked intensely.<br>
<br>
&quot;My boy,&quot; Whiz said, turning to look at River dead in the eyes. &quot;If I am not mistaken, what you have described to me with be the end of Norrath. Of all things living...and dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven leaned in close. &quot;Wizard do you mean...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;End Game.&quot; Whizbang whispered. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/03 4:15:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> ...a held breath...<br>
<br>
&quot;End Game?&quot; River asked blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, End Game.&quot; Whizbang replied, turning back to his book. &quot;End Game is...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...the end of everything.&quot; Vven finished for him. &quot;The Apocolypse. The destruction of everything. Everything just ceasing to be. Even we follower of Hate feared the thought of End Game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whiz continue on, flipping pages frantically as River digested what he was hearing. &quot;End Game, called thus on the latter day belief that we are just pawns being shuffled by a higher intelligence, beings greater than we, somehow more real than even the gods themselves. An absurd theory, if you ask me, but an apt enough name. End Game. The end of all games, this game that is our existance. There is a prophecy tied into End Game, and an odd one at that. Now where the Hells is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;...You see, the prophecy itself is unique, in a very odd way, which lends it some notice, if not full credibility...&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;This version is in Common Tongue, but I, a master linguist, noticed something very odd about it...&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;It rhymes, not very cleverly, but it holds to a certain rhyming pattern. As most prophecies do....that was not the oddity...&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
---flipflip---<br>
<br>
&quot;But regardless of what language it is translated into, whether it the grunts of the Trollish folk, the lyrical language of the High Elves, the gutteral slang of the Teir'Dal, regardless of the language...&quot;<br>
<br>
---flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;It STILL rhymes.&quot;<br>
<br>
River looked at Whizbang in surprise. &quot;But you know over a dozen languages....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DOZENS.&quot; Whizbang corrected. His flipping through pages came to an end, and he peered at an open page.<br>
<br>
&quot;...that would make that coincidence almost....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...impossible. Aye. I know.&quot; Whizbang tapped the page. &quot;Here. I found it. Listen to this. Sound familiar?<br>
<br>
When Hate finds love and walks the lands<br>
With enchanted dead close at hand<br>
And Mithaniel's handmaiden lays in sleep<br>
The End of All has a promise to keep.<br>
<br>
See the players here? Hate walking the lands...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me.&quot; River replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Whizbang nodded. &quot;Then this....enchanted dead....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roughly translated into 'a dead enchanter.'&quot; Vven supplied.<br>
<br>
Again a nod from Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Mithaniel's handmaiden laying in sleep...Camille.&quot; Pedi finished. &quot;I'm getting goosebumps.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare for goosebumps on top of goosebumps, woman.&quot; Whizbang warned, and continued on:<br>
<br>
&quot;The grounds in one moon will crack and split<br>
And all known cities slip into the Pit.<br>
Norrath will light with unnatural flame<br>
As begins the process known as End Game.<br>
<br>
All living will die, all growing decay<br>
All that was created will wither away<br>
And how it began it will all fade away.<br>
Thus will occur on Judgement Day.&quot;<br>
<br>
River swallowed hard. &quot;In one moon. A month. All this that happened with me. My death, Innoruuk's lessons, Camille put to sleep, even Vven dying....all of this, is going to cause the end of everything within a month?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So it seems, according to this, and its accuracy so far leaves me little doubt that we are reading what WILL come.&quot; Whizbang mopped some sweat from his forehead with a sleeve. &quot;Do I think you caused it to be? No, I don't think you had any choice in this. This was put into motion at the beginning of time. But are you the catalyst? Aye, River, you most certainly are.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more, gnome.&quot; Vven said, looking over Whizbang's shoulder. &quot;What else does it say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The first was the bad news.&quot; Whiz said, &quot;Now here....here is the good news:<br>
<br>
The only hope to deny that fate<br>
is to be championed by mortal Hate.<br>
To reverse it, Hate must pass a test.<br>
A test that is part journey, part quest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mortal Hate.&quot; River said. &quot;Me again. I can fix this, with a quest.&quot; He sighed deeply. &quot;Why does it seem I am forever doing quests? Forever quests...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, &quot;Whizbang said, &quot;We get to the quest:<br>
<br>
Only when Fear can overcome fear, <br>
And a Nightmare shed a single tear<br>
And that tear does burn in Natural flame<br>
Can one stop the beginning of End Game.<br>
<br>
A sacrifice pure of mortal life<br>
When War finds peace from eternal strife<br>
And Love denied will even the score.<br>
Then all will be as it was Before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Welllllll.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Doesn't this seem easy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It makes no sense, Whiz.&quot; River said in frustration. &quot;When Fear can overcome fear? Love denied? Riddles? Do you understand any of this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Whiz replied, &quot;But I didn't understand the first part either until you told me your story. Give me a little time and we can...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, from upstairs and outside, alarms began to sound from far off. The Gnomish Public Warning System, blaring its horns. In the distance, screams of women and children were heard. and then suddenly, to punctuate it, an awful banging on Whizbang's door upstairs. The ceiling creaked from the pounding, and several books slipped off the shelves to thump to the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, what NOW?&quot; Whizbang exclaimed.<br>
<br>
It was answered by one deafening word from upstairs outside his door.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot;<br>

&quot;Lyriele!&quot;, her mother's voice rising, &quot;are you working on your quests?&quot;. Her mothers sharp voice now cut through her conciousness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Merde&quot;, Lyriele breathed softly in reply and quickly shoved the Book of Riverdane under her pillow, grabbed the crumpled quest list, and went to the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm working on one now&quot;, Lyriele replied sweetly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why am I talking to a door again? Do I have a door for a daughter? And what is that smell? Have you started smoking?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, it was just a little offering for the hamster res. I think some rose petals must have mildewed or something&quot;, Lyriele replied glibly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well open a window and finish what you're doing soon. Dinner is in an hour.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her mothers footsteps faded away. Lyriele took one look at the crumpled quest list, and stuffed it into her pocket. She dutifully opened the window a crack, and bounced back onto her bed.<br>
<br>
She pulled out the Book of Riverdane and again made herself comfortable.

<br>
And up the stairs she went.<br>
<br>
The banging continued till River feared the walls would come down. And the sound of a large crowd forming outside.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's alright, it's alright!&quot; Pedi's voice carried clearly to them in the basement. &quot;This ogre is trained and on a special job for Whizbang. Your children are safe. Go back to your business now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogre?&quot; Riverdane asked Whizbang with a raised eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't have the slightest clue of what that woman of mine is talking about.&quot; Whizbang said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
Then Pedi's voice again, as the murmur of the crowd dwindled and faded away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad ogre! How many times have I told you, come at night?&quot; A long sigh from her. &quot;Here drink this up and come in before the townfolk stick you with pitchforks.&quot;<br>
<br>
A crunching sound and the tinkle of breaking glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drink! Not eat. You...oh never mind. You are shrunk now, come in come in....watch your head.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry Miz Pedi.&quot; her visitor said. &quot;But me so hungry. Me knew today Cookie Day, and no snacks from Miz Cami since she all cold and dead at guild house.&quot; And then the sound of cookies being devoured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah.&quot; Whizbang said, looking at River. &quot;Not just any 'ogga'. YOUR ogga.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a pet ogre?&quot; Vven said in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not exactly.&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the loud munching stopped, and the sound of sniffing filled the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me nose smell something not smelled in long time.&quot; her visitor said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh?&quot; Pedi asked innocently. The sound of the basement door quietly shutting was barely audible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya ya.&quot; the ogre said. &quot;Me smell...&quot; Sniff. &quot;Me smell...&quot;<br>
<br>
And suddenly the sound of heavy footsteps, a lamp crashing to the ground, a chair tipping back, and the basement door swinging open with a crash.<br>
<br>
&quot;No no no!&quot; Pedi cried, &quot;You can't go down there....&quot;<br>
<br>
Footsteps banging down the stairs, and an immense figure, even shrunk down as it had to be to even enter the house, loomed in the stairway. One of the ugliest, biggest (scaled down), STUPIDEST looking ogres any of them had ever seen. Weaponry was strapped to its sides and back, making it look like a porcupine, so many sharp edges protruded from its armored body. There it stood, looking for all the world like one of the most dangerous creatures in all the land. With a huge, stupid smile on its face.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; it said happily, pointing at River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk.&quot; River sighed. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/10/03 8:02:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;How....cute.&quot; Vven drawled. &quot;Is it housebroken?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He breaks houses.&quot; River replied, watching Ramluk carefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga knew!&quot; Ramluk said proudly, beating his chest. &quot;Me knew me smelled Riverdane!&quot; Then his face fell, and the smile dropped. &quot;Miz Cami cold and no moving at guildhouse. Grelin made me go away when I try wake her up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, Rammie, I know.&quot; River said softly. &quot;She's sick, and I have to find her some medicine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me sorry Miz Cami sick.&quot; Ramluk frowned. &quot;Miz Cami make number four best cookies. Miz Pedi number two. My momma is number one. Big momma make best cookies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is between Camille and Pedi?&quot; Vven asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me told you! No one!&quot; Ramluk replied. Vven rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;And this is one of your guildmates?&quot; he snickered. &quot;No wonder it took your guild so long to break Hate...&quot;<br>
<br>
River shot him a murderous look. &quot;Didn't take much to drop your god, did it?&quot; Vven was silent.<br>
<br>
Whizbang was oblivious to it all. His eyes were darting back and forth between Ramluk and a rack of vintage gnomish spirits a few feet from the ogre. Back and forth. Back and forth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk....&quot; Whiz said carefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Ramluk said, stepping off the bottom step. He turned to Whiz, and one of his swords, arcing from the swing of his body, almost tipped the rack over.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOTHING!&quot; Whiz cried, hands up in protest. &quot;Nothing! Just....don't...move.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silly old fool!&quot; Pedi cried in disgust. &quot;The world is about to end and you're worried about your BOOZE?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Those bottle are older than your mother LOOKS!&quot; Whizbang snapped back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you dare bring my mother into this, you old goa...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; River exclaimed, sinking onto a stool. That stopped them midsentence. &quot;Let's figure out what to do here, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang cleared his throat. &quot;Of course, of course. Ok. Now, where to begin. Let's look at the prophecy first as a written piece. I already have a few theories on what this may mean. Or some of it, at least.&quot; He pointed at a few words on the page before him. &quot;Notice these words, here, here, here....a few more here. Capitilized in the middle of sentences. Like the first line, 'When Hate finds love...&quot;. What is the writer referring to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To me.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes to you, but not you as Riverdane. You as in the God of Hate. The diety. The capitilization is to name you a god, your proper title. Notice, handmaiden and enchanted dead, not capitilized. They aren't gods, no need to address them with respect or signifigance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, so it is my title.&quot; River said slowly, &quot;So these other capitilized words....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...are not actually words at all, but signify other gods, yes.&quot; Whizbang finished. &quot;At least, that's what it looks like, and seems as good a place to start as any.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So this first line in the quest part,&quot; Vven interjected. &quot;'Only when Fear overcomes fear....' That's where we begin, aye? In the Plane of Fear, with Cazic-Thule, god of Fear?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is what I am thinking.&quot; Whizbang agreed. &quot;Though what or who Cazic may be afraid of I don't have the foggiest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, Vven,&quot; River said. &quot;Have you memorized this prophecy yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven pointed to his head. &quot;All locked away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Whizbang.&quot; River said, turning to the gnome. &quot;You have started me off on my journey. Wish us luck, old man. The fate of the world depends on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which is exactly why I am going with you.&quot; Whizbang said, standing up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Whiz, no...&quot; River said gently. &quot;This whole thing is very dangerous, and I can't take the responsibility of getting you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...killed?&quot; Whizbang said. His eyes narrowed. &quot;River, I have seen more years on this world than you have hairs in that mane of yours. And for all its faults, I like this world, and intend to add more years on it. If you think this wizard is going to sit idly by while a young foolhardy shadowknight and his partner Vven the Unfriendly Ghost play with the fate of it, you are sadly mistaken. I am going with you to record the events that transpire for the sake of history, and to consult and decipher the rest of the prophecy, and you will not stop me, or my name isn't Whizbang Dustyboots!&quot;<br>
<br>
One look at Whizbang's stance, and River knew his argument was lost.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, old man.&quot; River said. &quot;I wash my hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe if you did, ogga over there wouldn't have smelled you.&quot; Vven chuckled nastily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, gentlemen.&quot; Pedi said, removing her apron. &quot;Let me get my armor....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are NOT going.&quot; Whizbang declared.<br>
<br>
Pedi opened a closet and removed a red runed metal breastplate and began fastening it on with the leather straps. She did not look at Whizbang as she spoke. &quot;Whizbang, I have seen more years on this world than you have hairs missing from your head. And for all its faults, especially crotchety old wizards, I like this world, and intend...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ALRIGHT.&quot; Whizbang exclaimed in defeat. &quot;I get the point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Besides,&quot; she said, suddenly soft. &quot;Who's going to look after you, old man?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang's frown did not give way, but his eyes smiled, as his wife went back to adjusting her armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where we go?&quot; Ramluk said, breaking the silence loudly, beaming at everyone in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;We?&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miz Cami sick, me help.&quot; Ramluk said simply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk....&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Miz Pedi go. If she get sick, no more gnome cookies!&quot; Something in the ogre's tone left no argument. Riverdane sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright Ram. I can use the muscle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Pedi remarked, looking at them, final piece of armor in place. &quot;Don't we make a fine group.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If Innoruuk could see me now.&quot; Vven muttered. &quot;Grouped with a human, two gnomes and an OGRE.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where we go?&quot; Ramluk repeated again.<br>
<br>
Riverdane stood up, pushing away the stool.<br>
<br>
&quot;We start in the Feeroot, Ramluk. Your birth place. And then...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk smiled like a child. But River was not smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;...to the Plane of Fear.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;No need Whiz.&quot; River replied. &quot;One of my perks. I'll take us right to Ferroot itself. I don't know any safe area in Fear, so we'll go in the old fashioned way.&quot; He closed his eyes, and concentrated. A flash of light, and they were gone.<br>
<br>
They reappeared next to a large tree growing out of a hillside in the dank forest of Feeroot, home of the ogres. Crickets chirped and odd birds called out. The noise from serpents was so loud it almost sounded like one long continuous hiss. River pointed to the left of the tree. <br>
<br>
&quot;That rock face is illusory.&quot; he said. &quot;There are some spectres guarding the gateway to Fear. I'll just pull them out one at a time, and we'll dispatch them easily enough.&quot; And with that, River stepped through the rock as if it were air and disappeared from view.<br>
<br>
A short wait.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a spectre incoming....&quot; River called from within the rock. Ramluk drew out two wicked looking swords and braced himself. They waited.<br>
<br>
&quot;Add.&quot; River called out.<br>
<br>
Vven tensed up and peered at the rock, waiting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Add.&quot; River said again, this time a little more urgently.<br>
<br>
Pedi glanced nervously at Whizbang, whose brows furled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Add.&quot; River repeated, voice going up a notch in pitch. <br>
<br>
Ramluk shifted impatiently.<br>
<br>
And out came Riverdane, with four spectres in tow, swinging their long scythes at him, skeletal faces hungry from within their hooded garb.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk roared, stepping into the mess. &quot;Help me start barshin' a spectre!&quot; His swords swung up to meet the first spectre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep.&quot; Vven murmured, splaying out his fingers. One by one, the other three spectres stopped moving, mesmerized by the enchanter's spell.<br>
<br>
Ramluk and the first spectre battled, swords against scythe. River chopped at the spectre's back, Reaver cutting into the bone that made up the spectre, trying to split it open. It was tough work, the spectre being powered by some unearthly force.<br>
<br>
A swing, a chop, and the scythe cut a gash deep into Ramluk's arm. The ogre winced in pain, arm going dead, his sword dropped to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing a spectre!&quot; Pedi cried, eyes flashing blue as she chanted the heal spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you're done healing the enemy, &quot; Vven said dryly. &quot;You may want to fix the ogga.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops.&quot; Pedi said redfaced. &quot;Healing Ramluk!&quot; Again the flash of blue light, and Ramluk's arm began to mend.<br>
<br>
Immediately, the Spectre turned toward Pedi and began chopping at her. She dodged in a panic to the side.<br>
<br>
Ramluk kicked hard at the spectre, to no avail. He swung and connected on the spectre's back, but still it chased Pedi around the area while she attempted to evade it. Another kick from Ramluk went unheeded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe if you bothered to haste him, he may have some control.&quot; River called out to Vven. &quot;Or did you forget he was a warrior?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops.&quot; Vven said sheepishly. &quot;Warriors blades, dance!&quot; And Vven's fingers shot white light into Ramluk. Suddenly Ramluk's swings increased speed dramatically.<br>
<br>
The spectre noticed, and turned back to Ramluk. A slice of the scythe caught Ramluk in the side, and he staggered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing....Ramluk!&quot; Pedi cried out again, after a disoriented pause. Blue light, and Ramluk's side began to heal.<br>
<br>
And once more the spectre was all over Pedi.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk, didn't they teach you to TAUNT in warrior school?&quot; River cried in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me sorry.&quot; Ramluk said miserably, kicking at the spectre again. &quot;Me must have missed dat class.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough of this!&quot; Whizbang called out, leaping into the fray, hands glowing white. He glowered at the spectre. &quot;When you see your god, tell him Whizbang Dustyboots sent you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang's hands pulsed white light radiating from his body, disintigrating the spectre to dust.<br>
<br>
And pulsing out to smash the other three spectres out of their daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooops?&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;How many times do I have to tell you no area spells when we have an enchanter??&quot; Pedi sighed.<br>
<br>
Ramluk kicked at a spectre, but they ignored him, all chasing the now fleeing Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind, Ram, I'll tank.&quot; River said. his hands flashed darkly, as he called forth spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;Disease eat away at this foe....&quot; he called, shooting a cloud of green smoke from his fingers at the first spectre. It enveloped the spectres body, and it turned on him.<br>
<br>
River pointed at the second. &quot;Shadows, make this specter creep....&quot; And black smoke engulfed the second spectre, as it turned, as if through mud, and slowly came toward him.<br>
<br>
Then the third. &quot;Hellfire, boil the marrow of this spectre!&quot; And red smoke this time, surrounding the third and drawing it in a frenzy toward him.<br>
<br>
Good, River thought, got them off Whiz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice move, genius.&quot; Vven said, staring at him. &quot;You just dotted all three. Have fun.&quot; And Vven threw up his hands and sat abruptly down, watching.<br>
<br>
River opened his mouth to speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Whizbang said, running back, &quot;We know. 'Ooops'.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk, tank mez the left one.&quot; River said. &quot;I have the middle. Whiz, root and shoot the third.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang muttered something in gnomish. Roots suddenly flailed up from the earth, twisting themselves into the skeletal form of the spectre to the right. It held it fast to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Whizbang said to the glowering trapped spectre. &quot;You hate gnomes.&quot; <br>
<br>
BOOM.<br>
<br>
Whizbang blew smoke from his fingertips, having unleashed a firey bolt that all but destroyed the spectre.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Ramluk had one engaged and was methodically beating it down into the ground. The disease cloud from River was weakening its bone structure, and Ramluk's slices and pounding on it shattered it into little pieces.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, River was still locked in battle with the last spectre. It drew back its scythe high to chop at River's head. That's when River saw his opening.<br>
<br>
His hand shot out into the robe of the spectre, hand clamping around the bone that made the spectre's neck. His hand glowed with blacklight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bye bye.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
--PULSE--<br>
<br>
With a muffled pop, Riverdane's harmtouch blew the spectre's head off its body. The arms holding the scythe went limp as the body collapsed lifelessly to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Vven said, standing up. &quot;Don't we just suck.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Warming up.&quot; River said defensively. &quot;Shall we enter Fear?&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that he trudged back into the illusory slab of rock. They warily followed him, Whizbang in the back.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we're the only hope the world has for survival,&quot; he muttered to Pedi. &quot;I feel sorry for the world.&quot;<br>

Portal to the Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what's on the other side.&quot; Riverdane said to his four companions. &quot;And I don't know if it will acknowledge me as a god. Nor if it did if it would matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So basically...&quot; Whizbang began.<br>
<br>
&quot;....I don't know anything. Right.&quot; River finished. &quot;Shall we?&quot;<br>
<br>
With a nod from Whiz, all five stepped through the fire. It crackled and hissed as they passed through, but none were burned.<br>
<br>
Into Fear. A huge hilly area, with twisted, insane architecture and monoliths, with a large building in the center surrounded by a flaming moat. Fear, home of Cazic Thule, where when the skies wept, they cried blood rather than rain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Portal seems clear.&quot; Vven said, eyes darting around.<br>
<br>
River looked off to his left. &quot;So does the way to the west wall.&quot; River commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too clear.&quot; Vven added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone's here.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;This is too empty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AKETHADAR!&quot; A loud booming voice called, the sound echoing through the grassy hills.<br>
<br>
And then the sound of chuckling to the west, on the other side of a hillock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ake got owned again.&quot; said a mild voice, with an odd ogre accent. &quot;Who wants to get get him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not me, I have to med.&quot; said a second person, clearly human. &quot;Tremas, you get him this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizzie gets no love.&quot; the third voice, presumably Tremas. It had the rich bass tones of a Eruidite. &quot;Where do you think I get this mana from, Aamedor, my good looks?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought you stored it all in that huge forehead of yours.&quot; the ogre voice cut in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kiss my ass, Pron.&quot; Tremas said back. &quot;Alright, I'll get Ake this time. But give me a little downtime too, not like we doing this with a chanter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely,&quot; Riverdane said. &quot;Promethian Order is here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I take it this isn't a good thing?&quot; Pedi said, looking at the expression on River's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; River hedged. &quot;I'm fine with most of them. Aamedor is old Razor's Edge. Let's just say Akethadar and I have a little history. Let's go say hello.&quot; And they followed him up and over the hill.<br>
<br>
Promethian Order. One of the oldest and affluent military guilds of Norrath. Acceptance into the ranks of Promethian Order was akin to an adventurer coming of age. Its members had seen many things other guilds only dream of doing. And there were two of the members, sitting among a pile of corpses of the denizens of Fear. Dead scarelings, phoboplasms, nightmares, turmoil toads littered the camp site. And in the middle, Pron, a huge ogre warlord in full battle gear, and Aamedor, one of Promethian Order's high priests and former member of River's guild. Tremas was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
Aamedor saw them first. &quot;Hey, River.&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;And Whiz, Pedi. What brings you here? Alliance coming up?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, Aam.&quot; River said, clasping wrists with the cleric. Whizbang nodded his hello. &quot;Actually, here for Cazic Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehh.&quot; Pron chuckled. &quot;Promethian is coming here in a little while. The only thing left will be his corpse, I'm afraid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk was staring with his mouth open at Pron's array of weaponry and gear. &quot;Ogga!&quot; he said in amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Pron said in perfect common. &quot;I am of ogre descent.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You talk funny.&quot; Ramluk said, a confused look on his stupid face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was educated in the finest schools in the Plane of Knowledge, if that's what you refer to as 'funny'.&quot; Pron remarked loftily. Then his eyes narrowed as he looked at Ramluk's armor. &quot;My gods, man, where did you get your armor? Did you mother make it for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk looked at his feet with embarrassment, an emotion ill-suited to one his size. &quot;Ya, Big Momma make me armors.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then in came Tremas, dragging the dead body of a human. Tremas was dressed in an ornately decorate robe of many hues, his hood partially covering the freakishly high forehead that was the staple look of Erudite men. The corpse he carried in was dressed in the light garb of a professional monk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Riv, what's shakin'?&quot; Tremas asked. Tremas, publicity officer of Promethian, had dealt with River often in the past when the two guilds had bumped heads. &quot;And Whizbang....wiz power....!&quot; And Tremas made a symbol with his hand that Whiz smiled and emulated. Pedi sighed. Vven just watched quietly, looking around, waiting for anything to appear and leap at them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ake bit it again, Fright is up and deathtouching.&quot; Tremas said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Must be...unpleasant.&quot; Vven commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hah,&quot; Tremas said. &quot;I swear he likes it. I think he's a rez junkie. All pullers must be.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Rezzing Akethadar....&quot; Aamedor intoned, hands and eyes glowing with blue light. The light shot out from Aamedor's hands to infuse the corpse of Akethadar. And Akethadar's eyes snapped open.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO MED BEFORE I BEGIN PULLING AGAIN.&quot; Akethadar said loudly, pulling himself to his feet.<br>
<br>
Ramluk winced at the noise. &quot;No need to shout...&quot; Pedi said.<br>
<br>
Akethadar favored her with a dour look, and then spotted Riverdane.<br>
<br>
&quot;River.&quot; he said, striding up to him. &quot;So, progressing from stealing camps in The Grey to stealing them in Fear, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you last time, Ake,&quot; River sighed. &quot;I was new to the area and didn't...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you then, and I am telling you now.&quot; Akethadar cut him off. &quot;You will not stand in the way or interfere with Promethian Order or we will march across you like a rug. Stay out of our way and your lives can go on in the mundane way they always do. Get in my way and we will sweep you aside like the dust you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
River held his temper. &quot;We're not here to interfere with your raid, Ake. I just need to speak with Cazic-Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
Akethadar looked at him incredulously. And then laughed. Loudly. His three companions joined in.<br>
<br>
&quot;You five are going to walk into the home of Cazic?&quot; he asked. &quot;YOU five? We just cleared most of fear with four people and WE wouldn't just walk in there.&quot; He chuckled nastily. &quot;Remember to consent and after we destroy Cazic, I'll have Aamedor here resurrect your dead bodies.&quot; And then, not glancing again at them, he turned to his three companions.<br>
<br>
&quot;I AM GOING TO PULL. BE READY FOR SINGLES APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH.&quot; And he disappeared over the hill.<br>
<br>
&quot;MUST he shout like that?&quot; Pedi asked, frowning.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think it's all those rezzes.&quot; Tremas said, tapping his forehead pointedly. &quot;That can't be healthy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, River, he's right.&quot; Aamedor said gently. &quot;You guys are going to die if you go near Cazic Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane motioned for his four companions to follow him and headed north.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll see, Aamedor.&quot; he said over his shoulder. &quot;We'll see.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/15/03 5:59:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> A moat filled with flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright now,&quot; River said, looking at the wall of flame before them. &quot;How do we cross this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just cross.&quot; Whizbang said, walking through the flames. He disappeared from view. Vven shrugged and followed him. Pedi exchanged a look of uncertainty with River, and then lowered her head in determination and trudged into the flaming moat. Ramluk followed, and River picked up the end.<br>
<br>
COLD. The flames in the moat surrounding Cazic's home were freezing cold, cutting through to the very marrow in River's bones. He found his companions shivering on the other side. Except Vven, who was tapping his foot impatiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Next time, Whiz, a little preparation for that!&quot; River said, body still in shock from the freeze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you have gone through so readily?&quot; Whizbang asked, rubbing his hands together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, snowballs, whenever you're ready, I'd like to get my body back so I can freeze with you.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Can we move on now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;River,&quot; Pedi said. &quot;Do you know what you're doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; River said simply. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br>
<br>
They trudged up the sloping embankment that led to the pyramid-like structure that held the God of Fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Whiz said.<br>
<br>
Standing just inside the entrance to the pyramid were ten huge looming creatures, with humanoid bodies and heads akin to massive squid. They turned as one to face the group, and their tenticled mouths gaped wide with a collective roar.<br>
<br>
&quot;This, I think,&quot; Whiz whispered to River. &quot;...is your cue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Amygdalan Knights, stay your hand! I am Riverdane Wyldechylde, heir of Innoruuk, and Prince of Hate! These people with me are under my care and are not to be harmed!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really now?&quot; came a voice from the back. The amy knights parted with military precision to either side, revealing the figure of a huge golem, body dripping molten clay from which it was formed. Its red burning eyes glowed malevolently from under its deep brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely, Fright, Cazic's general. Here comes a deathtouch.&quot; Whiz said from the corner of his mouth. &quot;Vven, go do your thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What thing?&quot; Vven whispered urgently, as Fright began lumbering forward slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just...&quot; Whiz said, &quot;Be YOU.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, that's easy.&quot; Vven said, stepping in front of River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhhh, a mud thing! Aren't you a big one.&quot; Vven addressed Fright. &quot;Too bad I left four of your girlfriends dead at the portal. I must say tho, you are much wider in the hip area than they were. I guess too many pieces of cheesecake at the Spook Tea Party and your diet went all to Hells, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright's eyes scowled.<br>
<br>
&quot;VVEN!&quot; he shouted, voice booming across the landscape. Fright's eyes light with hellfire as he sentenced his deathtouch.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; Vven said, unharmed. &quot;With two 'v''s. People screw that up all the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright blinked.<br>
<br>
River surpressed a smile and stepped forward. &quot;I told you, they are under my protection, Fright.&quot; River said. &quot;Now take me to Cazic and do not attempt to interfere in business between gods again, or I will have Ramluk here in your position while you pick weeds along the moat for the rest of your existance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright seemed agitated. &quot;Well, the boss is not accepting visitors right now, your Excell...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NOW!&quot; River barked. &quot;Enough of your chatter! Or I will sic these rabid gnomes upon you to gnaw upon your ankles!&quot;<br>
<br>
River glance quickly at his companions. Pedi hissed at Fright. Whizbang just rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, your Excellence.&quot; Fright sighed, and motioned for them to follow him through the ranks of amy knights.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aren't we getting a bit dramatic?&quot; Whizbang said quietly, eyebrow arched. &quot;Rabid gnomes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go with it.&quot; River replied, striding foreward. &quot;I never claimed I was an actor.&quot;<br>
<br>
And they disappeared in the home of Cazic Thule. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_portrait.gif HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=120" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/03 4:49:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;Um, Boss, Innoruuk is here.&quot; Fright said from within the room he disappeared into.<br>
<br>
&quot;He is?&quot; came a small, high pitched little voice. &quot;Thank Us he's here! I heard he was dead! Send him in send him in!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright poked out his massive head. &quot;He'll see you, Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot; River said, not correcting him. He led the five into the room, brushing past Fright.<br>
<br>
And almost screamed.<br>
<br>
A huge lumbering behemoth of a creature was rushing towards him, made up of earth, mud, twisted roots, vines like veins running across its body, moving at a dizzying speed at him with its massive maw agape. Just looking at it almost drove River to insanity. Listening to the sharp intake of breath behind him he imagined the others were likewise terrified out of their wits.<br>
<br>
Cazic-Thule was rushing at them.<br>
<br>
And speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you thank you thank you Innoruuk!&quot; it cried in that high pitched girl's voice. &quot;I have been so worried that I was in this alon....&quot; Suddenly, for all its tremendous weight, it screeched to a halt, took one good look at them, and screamed like a woman. Cazic dove behind Fright and peeked out over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh My Us! Who the Hells are you??&quot; he cried, trembling.<br>
<br>
Vven burst out laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk is dead, Cazic.&quot; River said, stepping forward, shooting Vven a dirty look that almost silenced him, but not quite. &quot;I am the new Prince of Hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my, I was afraid of that!&quot; Cazic said, shaking. &quot;I heard Innoruuk was killed, but I didn't want to believe it! If Innoruuk could be slain, then how much security do any of us have? None, I say! We have none! Oh woe the day!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I seriously don't believe this.&quot; Vven commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have come...&quot; River began, searching. &quot;To....help you. I need to know, why are you in this state, Cazic? What has you so afraid?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Them!&quot; Cazic whispered from behind Fright. Fright rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is them, Cazic?&quot; River asked.<br>
<br>
A voice outside cut them off. &quot;Sir, that monk is getting close to the moat again, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonono!&quot; Cazic wailed. &quot;Make it go away, Fright, make it go away!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright sighed. &quot;AKETHADAR!&quot; he boomed in an earth-shattering voice. A pause and then, &quot;Ok, Boss, I bought you some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He'll be back....&quot; Cazic whispered in terror. &quot;They always come back...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a minute wait a minute...&quot; Vven said, a look of disbelief on his amused face. &quot;You are afraid of PROMETHIAN ORDER? That's 'them?'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are they here yet??&quot; Cazic shrieked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hahhah NO, but they should be, you COWARD, just to boot you out of this PLANE!&quot; Vven mocked. &quot;Boy, did I ever pick the right god to worship! Even if the great white hope here killed him,&quot; ...a gesture to a fuming River...&quot;....at least I bet he didn't go down screaming like a RANGER! What is WRONG with you?? You're a god, for gods' sakes. Stand up STRAIGHT!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DON'T HIT ME!&quot; Cazic shrieked. Even Ramluk sighed in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz,&quot; Pedi asked quietly, &quot;Do any of your books mention Cazic being a....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...sissy pants? No.&quot; Whizbang replied.<br>
<br>
Vven started pacing. &quot;So aptly named, the God of Fear. I can't believe they let a creature as pitiful as you run this plane! No wonder no one ever sees you walking around outside, you're probably afraid of the fire that surrounds your own MOAT.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't always like this!&quot; Cazic cried, chest heaving. &quot;Just they started coming, every week, Promethian Order, with their sharp swords and wizards with fireballs and...every week. Marching in, MARCH MARCH MARCH destroying everything in their path like a swarm of locusts! A wizard epic here, an enchanter epic there, always knocking me unconscious and ripping out my brain! Do you have ANY idea how painful that is, to wake up to find your BRAIN missing?&quot; He searched their faces for any sign of compassion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, can't say I do.&quot; Whizbang tried lamely. Only Ramluk was nodding in sympathy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then fight BACK!&quot; Vven exploded. &quot;You're a GOD! Ok ok ok, how many death-touchers do you have? Fat boy over there and who else?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dread. He's on a coffee break.&quot; Cazic said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's ALWAYS on a coffee break....&quot; Fright grumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;TWO death-touchers.&quot; Vven confirmed. &quot;And all you do is death-touch their scout, a monk. He's a trained PROFESSIONAL. It's his JOB to lead you into SUBMISSION!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, he's the closest one...&quot; Fright began defensively. <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course he's the closest, they MEAN for him to be the closest! Ok ok ok. You, Thunder Thighs, you go get your buddy Dread in here. I'm going to show your boss here how to be a god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright looked around a little lost, but then realizing Cazic wasn't going to order him or stop him, marched out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok first things first.&quot; Vven said, inspecting Cazic like a bug. &quot;That voice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My voice?&quot; Cazic said meekly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that 'I spent ten years in a Trollish Prison' voice. Gotta go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want...?&quot; Cazic asked uncertainly. &quot;An accent?...or something?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DEEPER!&quot; Vven exclaimed, &quot;Ferocious! Terrifying!&quot; He turned. &quot;Ramluk!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk roared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like THAT.&quot; Vven said. River just watched in amazement as Vven ranted. &quot;Think like an ogre, but more terrifying! Repeat after Ramluk! 'You will not evade me!'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU WILL NOT INVADE ME!&quot; Ramluk repeated a happy growl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please do not invade me!&quot; Cazic squeaked. Vven sighed in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok ok ok work on that. Next, strategy. Now get Dread and...&quot; Vven suddenly paused, and looked around the room. &quot;Um, guys, could you give me and old Cazic here a few minutes alone? We need to talk, bad guy to bad guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not on your life.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh this will NEVER work!&quot; Cazic said, throwing up his hands in despair. And then....he started crying. Big wracking sobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't HAVE a life!&quot; Vven hissed. &quot;And neither do any of you, unless we fulfill this quest and have Fear overcome fear. So CUT ME SOME SLACK!&quot;<br>
<br>
River stared at Vven for a long hard time. &quot;Ok, Vven.&quot; he said finally. &quot;All you.&quot; And he motioned for Whiz, Ram and Pedi to follow him out to the waiting area, where they waited.<br>
<br>
And waited.<br>
<br>
And waited.<br>
<br>
&quot;AKETHADAR!&quot; Fright bellowed from across the land.<br>
<br>
And waited.<br>
<br>
Then, after what seemed an eternity, they heard a small tittering coming from the room. Cazic presumably.<br>
<br>
&quot;LAUGH LIKE A GOD!&quot; Vven bellowed, but you could hear triumph in his voice.<br>
<br>
And then the titter deepened in pitch, into a chortle, and grew, insanely in volume.<br>
<br>
Vven came out of the room, with a smug look on his face. &quot;Let's go back to the Promethian camp, shall we?&quot; he said. &quot;My job here is done.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do?&quot; River said, following Vven with his crew in tow as Vven stepped out of the pyramid.<br>
<br>
&quot;I taught him all about fear.&quot; Vven said replied nonchalantly. &quot;Let's get to that camp, you won't want to miss this. But I guaruntee you, this part of the quest is done. That boy doesn't fear ANYTHING anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
And ringing in the halls of the pyramid, the deep malevolent insane laughter confirmed that it was true.<br>

<br>
&quot;For once you used your head, Wyldechylde.&quot; Akethadar sneered, seeing the five trudge back to his camp. &quot;Leave Cazic to the professionals.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're done with Cazic.&quot; Riverdane said evenly. &quot;Just wanted to warn you he may be...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're done with Cazic?&quot; Akethadar laughed. &quot;What did you go there to do? Take notes for your next wipe?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually...&quot; River began,<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Vven said, cutting River off. &quot;That's exactly what we did. Um, Whiz, you may want to prep for a gate outta here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang looked at Vven for a moment, and after meeting the enchanter's eyes, sat down immediately and started to recall the words to one of his portal spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea Whiz.&quot; Akethadar agreed. &quot;Port these losers out of here. And honestly, I thought Walkers on a higher teir than these amateurs. You really should watch what company you keep, gnome.&quot; Whizbang frowned, but continued to prepare his spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven, what did I need to come here to see?&quot; River mumbled angrily. &quot;Promethian Order's raid leader throwing yet another slew of insults?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'lllll seeee.&quot; Vven singsonged softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;ALRIGHT GUYS.&quot; Akethadar boomed, &quot;I'M GOING TO START PULLING THE GORGOLOSKS IN A SECOND. BE READY TO....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AAMEDOR!&quot; a deafening voice shouted from the north. Aamedor stiffened suddenly, and tipped over on his side, face the gray ash of the dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see,&quot; Vven explained with a smile. &quot;I explained why wait for them to come to your door, to identify whom to deathtouch, when I had the names of their healer....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;TREMAS!&quot; boomed another voice to the south. Tremas went rigid like a board, eyes wide in shock, and pitched straight forward, dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and their porter?&quot; Vven continued happily.<br>
<br>
Akethadar and Pron exchanged looks as Whizbang's chanting grew faster in speed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wyldechylde, what have you done?&quot; Akethadar began. &quot;If you meddled with...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU WILL NOT INVADE ME, PRON!&quot; came the loudest voice of them all, sounding like a thunderclap going off in a stormy sky. Pron suddenly winked out of sight, vanishing into thin air. And then the horrid sound of an ogre screaming somewhere in the distance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Close, big guy, close. EVADE.&quot; Vven sighed to himself.<br>
<br>
Riverdane stared at Vven in horror. &quot;You just massacred them...&quot;<br>
<br>
Akethadar had thrown himself to the ground and was laying very very still, the defensive position of a monk feigning death to avoid notice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nah...&quot; Vven said. &quot;Promethian Order has more clerics than the Temple of Marr. They'll have this recovered in an hour. But for now, our blubbering God of Chicken now has his confidence back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane shot Vven a venemous look and then turned his attention back to Akethadar. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ake,&quot; he offered urgently. &quot;We still have room, port out of here with us, before....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't port anwhere with you, Wyldechylde.&quot; Akethadar replied, his voice full of hate. &quot;You screwed up again and meddled in the business of Promethian Order.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh don't be an ass.&quot; Vven said. &quot;He's giving you a chance to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll pay for this, River.&quot; Akethadar swore. &quot;If it's the last thing I do, I'll have your guild destroyed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Akethadar....&quot; River tried again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot; Vven cut in. &quot;Have it your way.&quot; He turned and cupped his hands to his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;HEY CAZIC!&quot; he shouted, &quot;You know that monk that was giving you that trouble?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go now Whiz, hurry.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Going.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Hold onto your seats!&quot; And they began to shimmer from view.<br>
<br>
&quot;HE'S FAKING!&quot; Vven finished with a smile.<br>
<br>
And they were gone. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=akethadar>Akethadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/18/03 5:25:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> unrealistic.

Have you ever ONCE thought about USING IT?&quot; Whizbang swore.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't possibly be talking about me.&quot; Vven replied, honestly looking around to see if another Teir'Dal was nearby. All he saw was Ramluk looking confused, Pedi looking concerned, and Riverdane looking....dangerous.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see any other half-baked, sociopathic, hang-out-with-me-and-screw-up-your-life dark elves around?&quot; Whizbang exploded.<br>
<br>
Vven looked miffed. &quot;WHAT IS YOUR POINT?&quot; he replied testily.<br>
<br>
&quot;His point, Vven.&quot; Riverdane said in a low growl. &quot;Is that you just murdered four members of Promethian Order. And you were right, they have enough clerics and force to go back in concentrated, whether Cazic is no longer afraid of them or not. And they will rez Akethadar and his boys, and they WILL remember who trained them. And due to your little trick, you have put both Razor's Edge and Walkers in a very serious political dilemma.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, is that it?&quot; Vven said casually. &quot;I'm from Black Reign. We don't believe in politics. We live for this crap.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And we DIE from this crap!&quot; Whizbang fumed, the top of his bald head going red.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang, relax before you icecomet your foot off!&quot; Pedi commanded. Then she looked at Vven. &quot;That was very irresponsible, Vven. You have put our and River's guilds in great danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, I was doing what was necessary, ok?&quot; Vven cried out defensively. &quot;I just want my damned body back! And if Cazic didn't get over his cold feet, there isn't going to BE any guilds or politics in a month! My methods may not be to the liking of you goody two-shoes but they WORKED! So bitch AFTER I save the world, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
All the anger went out of River like steam from a kettle. &quot;Vven, for now on, talk to me first before you pull any more stunts like that. I thank you for helping us get past the first part of the quest, but you may have damned us anyway even if we do fix this. So no more surprises, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;River, are you mad?&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;This dark elf is going to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehh hehh, 'He faking it.&quot; Hehh. That funny.&quot; Ramluk suddenly said.<br>
<br>
They all went dead quiet, looking at the chuckling ogre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Faking. Heh.&quot; Ramluk said again.<br>
<br>
Pedi was the first to crack a smile. &quot;Brell help me, but that was rather amusing. The look on Akethadar's face...&quot;<br>
<br>
And she and River burst out laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation!&quot; Whizbang muttered.<br>
<br>
River got control over himself, and looked around for the first time. &quot;Whiz, where are we?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Plane of Knowledge.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Starting point for the next part of our journey. Have any of you been here before, besides Pedi?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven shook his head. As did River. Ramluk just looked confused. He pointed. <br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
And where he pointed, an ogre stood chatting with an armored high elf female. Then, through an arch in the impressive looking walls, a dark elf came marching through, turned to the high elven woman, and saluted crisply. Then the dark elf marched on past them, towards River and crew on the grass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine day we're having!&quot; the dark elf said exuberantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You saluted a high elf.&quot; Vven said in shock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; the dark elf said. &quot;I always salute my high officers!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to be sick.&quot; Vven said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the Plane of Knowledge,&quot; Whizbang said to Vven with an evil grin. &quot;All races put down their natural animosity and live together in the peaceful search for knowledge. It's quite a wonder. In this tiny plane, one can find trolls shaking hands with dwarves, and iksar studying with wood elves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a small world, after all!&quot; the dark elf agreed. Vven gaped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to see my betrothed.&quot; the dark elf said, saluting them. &quot;You've never seen a prettier halfling lady!&quot; And with that, he was off.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's marrying an assling.&quot; Vven said in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz,&quot; River asked. &quot;Why here? Where are we going?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Recall the prophecy.&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;...'And a Nightmare shed a single tear'...&quot; Vven said automatically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Nightmare.&quot; Whizbang repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;So that means we're going to...&quot; Pedi began.<br>
<br>
&quot;...the Plane of Nightmares.&quot; Whizbang finished. &quot;We're going to see Terris Thule.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tropicsdelight>TropicsDelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1033<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/21/03 2:15:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>unrealistic.

<br>
Twisted gnarled trees dotted the landscape, under a purple sky perpetually clouded over. Howls and eerie sighs carried across the winds. Tombstones dotted the entrance to the plane, the place they appeared after climbing into a huge hollow stump outside. Here existed things only glimpsed while deep in slumber, things that would wake you panting hard and biting back a scream.<br>
<br>
Only one person was within sight. He ran backwards, bow in hand, firing at almost a blinding speed at an uprooted tree that was slowly chasing after him. The tree's base was riddled with arrows. A huge knot hole in the tree began opening, revealing jagged edges of bark.<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't that one of yours?&quot; Whizbang asked, looking at the ranger as he drew near.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Riverdane said. &quot;Talvarien. I heard he likes to bow kite here.&quot;<br>
<br>
More arrows flew, thunkthunkthunk into the base of the tree. The tree waved two huge branches in anger and trudged on slowly toward the ranger and Talvarien passed them.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk cried in recognition.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Rammie!&quot; Talvarien said, spotting him, &quot;Hey Riv!&quot; Thunkthunkthunk. Suddenly Talvarien stopped dead in his tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;RIV!&quot; he exclaimed in shock, standing with mouth agape. &quot;Oh my gods, it's you...they said in the guild house that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Talv...&quot; Riverdane motioned to the tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Talvarien said, looking where River was pointing. The tree opened its mouth wide in anger. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh shi...&quot; Talvarien began.<br>
<br>
With creaking jerks, the tree tore both of Talvarien's arms off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ranja....down...&quot; Talvarien whispered, blood bubbling to his lips, as he slumped down into a bloody mess. Somewhere in the distance, a bell rang.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's true.&quot; Vven commented offhandedly. &quot;Every time a bell rings, a ranger dies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk roared, leaping onto the tree. River drew his sword.<br>
<br>
Weapons sang as they whistled through the air. Huge chips of bark flew off the tree as Ramluk hacked into it, sap running down its sides in a torrent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Matches don't start forest fires.&quot; Whizbang intoned, hands glowing bright. &quot;People do!&quot;<br>
<br>
WHOOSH........<br>
<br>
The fireball lept from Whizbang's fingertips, enveloping the tree in flames. Riverdane grabbed Ramluk by the shoulders and with a massive pull yanked him back off the tree, before he too was consumed by the fire. The tree mewled like a hurt kitten as the fire ate away at it. Its thrashing branches darkened and crisped to ash, as wizardfire finished its life.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my.&quot; Pedi said, looking down at Talvarien's destroyed body. 'Isn't this a mess. Rangers always die so....violently.&quot; She looked up at Ramluk. &quot;Ramluk, be a dear and collect those arms for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Miz Pedi.&quot; Ramluk said, prowling among the tombstones looking for Talvarien's arms. River just watched her preparing to do the resurrection.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such an incredible job you do.&quot; Riverdane commented. &quot;I don't know how you stomach this. All this blood and gore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi smirked as she accepted an arm from Ramluk and placed it next to Talvarien's crumpled form.<br>
<br>
&quot;Try dealing with Whizbang's snoring and you can stomach anything.&quot; she said sweetly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, woman!&quot; Whizbang exclaimed. &quot;I told you a thousand times I don't snore!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? UNLIKE ME YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT!&quot; Pedi roared. And then, taking the second arm from Ramluk, &quot;Thank you dear.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Death has become just an annoyance, thanks to you skilled clerics.&quot; River remarked.<br>
<br>
&quot;A lifetime of service to your god, it's the least they can do.&quot; Pedi smiled. And began chanting the resurrection. Blue light flowed from her hands into the pile of remains that was once Talvarien.<br>
<br>
And nothing happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Pedi said, brow furrowing. &quot;It's not taking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, maybe he didn't accept? Maybe he wants to do like I did, and serve his god.&quot; Vven said. Then after quick reflection. &quot;Why would anyone want to serve Tunare?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nono.&quot; Pedi said, panic creeping into her voice. &quot;It didn't take. At all. There was no soul to call...nothing!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is not good.&quot; Riverdane frowned. &quot;Try again, Pedi, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again she chanted, again the blue light. Nothing. Pedi looked stricken, collapsing to her knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Brell, have I somehow offended thee? Please with your divine light help this fallen ranger see his way back into...&quot; and she went off in miserable prayer to her god, eyes brimming with tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is unheard of.&quot; Whizbang said, closing his eyes in concentration. &quot;I must check on something. I'm beginning to fear the worst.&quot; And after a short gnomish chant, he blinked out of sight, teleporting away.<br>
<br>
Pedi continued to drone on, tears dripping onto the destroyed body of Talvarien. Ramluk stood very still, confusion in its normal state across his face. River just glanced nervously at Vven, who shrugged.<br>
<br>
After a brief moment, Whizbang appeared again from over a tombstone. His face was ashen.<br>
<br>
&quot;What, Whiz?&quot; Riverdane asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's as bad as I feared.&quot; Whizbang said seriously. &quot;I checked in the local tavern for some news. Promethian Order did go back and recover Vven's little incident, and defeated Cazic Thule. Akethadar was recovered, as was Pron. But Tremas, Aamedor? Gone. Unable to rez. Several Promethians were drunk in the bar and talking about it, toasting to their memory. And looking quite lost.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That makes no sense, Whizbang, they had plenty of time to be rezzed.&quot; Vven said.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;There is much wailing in the temples. This is not regulated to just Promethian Order or Talvarien here. Resurrections are no longer working. The dead stay dead. Permanently.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang,&quot; River said, mouth dropping open. &quot;Is this....?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;....End Game.&quot; Whizbang whispered. &quot;It has begun.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane took a sobbing Pedi by the shoulders and gently pulled her away from Talvarien's remains. Even Vven had nothing to say as they looked down at the fallen ranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk.&quot; River said finally. &quot;Take your sheild and dig a hole and bury Talv. Please do it quickly.&quot; Ramluk nodded and dropped to his knees and began to dig. <br>
<br>
Whizbang put his arm around his wife as she cried into his shoulder. Riverdane started breaking up the ground near a tombstone with his sword to help the process along.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a month seemed very short. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/24/03 12:47:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> The gates to the Lair of Terris Thule.<br>
<br>
The crossing of the Plane of Nightmares went with no speaking except the chanting of the casters as they recalled their spells. From all sides they were attacked, blood ravens diving in out of the sky to pick out their eyeballs, more twisted trees to rend them, spiders the size of large dogs scurrying across the toadstool-ridden grass to drink their blood, wraithes like mutated, fearsome butterflies swarming them to destroy them. But Talvarien's permanent death had them all sober, and they worked quietly dispatching each of the new threats. But there was an undercurrent of panic and desperation to their fights, since the knowledge that the free ride was over. One mistake and there would be no coming back.<br>
<br>
Finally, following Whizbang, they came to the iron-worked gates themselves.<br>
<br>
The two customary guards that usually watch over the gates were dead, laying side by side in crumpled heaps on the ground. Huge skeletal figures, in full battle armor, now inanimate and broken. A warrior and a shaman were picking through the remains, as they approached.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail!&quot; the shaman called out hesitantly. &quot;Are you going through the gates? They're safe, we killed the guards.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; River replied, also noticing the bodies of four of their companions, strewn among the corpses of the guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just waiting on the cleric to get back.&quot; the shaman said a little nervously. &quot;Been a half hour. Heh, getting a little nervous.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven exchanged a look with River. Neither said anything.<br>
<br>
The warrior drew up from his seated position and pointed at Pedi.<br>
<br>
&quot;You, gnome.&quot; he said. &quot;You can save us some time. You a cleric?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a rogue.&quot; Pedi said flatly, pushing past the warrior towards the gates. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br>
<br>
She never looked back.<br>
