Ammelen is of course factually correct.  It is going to be extremely difficult to prove_ that anyone lied about anything.  I think this is a bad route for democrats to take.  They will wind up looking as ridiculous as Ken Starr did.  It's basicly a problem of doublespeak.  As long as we allow our leaders to speak to us entirely in euphemisms they will be able to define what they meant post facto forever.  I will say, however, that anyone who was living in the US in january feburary and march who did not recieve the STRONG inpression from our government and even moreso from our media that there were weapons in Iraq, and that we knew there were, was not paying any attention.  I would say that to beleive that there were no weapons during those months would mean disbeleiving probably 80% of what you read and heard during that timeframe.  That's a level of cognative dissonance not many people are comfortable with; this is why propaganda works.  Now, if you are going to try and deny that there was an intensive public relations campaign to convince us of Saddam's danger, and that WMD did not form a central part of that campaign, that_ is something I will go to bat about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1275<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/03 12:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=109.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It goes on and on and on</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now, if you are going to try and deny that there was an intensive public relations campaign to convince us of Saddam's danger, and that WMD did not form a central part of that campaign, that_ is something I will go to bat about.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Of course there was a PR campaign to convince us that war was necessary, and WMD's were a substantial part of that campaign.<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with that though, I think it's the president's job to try to convince the American people of his agenda, whether it be war against Iraq, tax cuts, or medicare prescription drug coverage.  Every president does it with every issue.<br>
<br>
One thing I do have to admit to the other side of the WMD argument is that their side, like Raolf says, is nearly impossible to prove.  On the other hand, it's not hard to imagine a scenario where the existence of WMD's is proven.  Regardless of the difficulty of proving that no WMD's exist, you have to have proof to be rationally justified in claiming it as anything more than a possibility.<br>

But not every president is ignorant enough to use false information and not have the proof to back up his claims.  President Bush is by far the biggest jackass ever let in the White House.

<br>
Dude are you fucking ignorant?  Do you think God himself bestows omniscience on the President, or even those who work for him?<br>
<br>
The president relies on those in position of authority (Quite often those appointed by his predecessor) to give him good intelligence and opinions on what is happening in the world.  I assure you EVERY president has used false information, perhaps knowningly, but most likely by pure ignorance that it was indeed false at the time and certainly all of them have had little or no proof at times to back up their claims.<br>
<br>
Bah nevermind, you think the world is run like a fucking nintendo game where everything can be solved by clicking A-B-B-A and pushing up.<br>

Well, yes, we all do.  So he's not the greatest orator in the world, I don't really care.  He even jokes about it himself.  For me though, &quot;orator&quot; doesn't make the top 1000 most important skills for a president.  I care what he thinks, feels, and does a lot more than I care how well he can spin it.<br>

Actually, I think he's one of the strongest and most decisive presidents in history.  If anything, he can be a bit rash in making his decisions, but he's far from weak.  In times like this though I prefer a man of action to one paralyzed by indecision such as Clinton.<br>
