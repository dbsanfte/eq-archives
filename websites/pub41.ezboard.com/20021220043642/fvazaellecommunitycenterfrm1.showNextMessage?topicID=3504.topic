<br>
#1. Yous hould know that all server status' EQ hands out are not real-time.  They are set manually by VI/SOE employees.  If you've ever looked at their own status pages during emergency patches this is painfully obvious.  My app doesn't use nor rely on their supposed status - it figures it out on its own, directly from your computer to the servers in question.<br>
<br>
#2. Go ahead and laugh at my PortMaker app, since I'm laughing at you laughing at it.  You don't understand what it is nor seem to understand what it's for.  It's not ghetto anything... it simply opens up responsive designated ports that you can try to reach from the other side of a router or firewall for testing purposes, i.e. to figure out of you're actually getting through another device/service.  Opening up a port with one mouse click is a whole lot faster than installing/initiating a service to use that port.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for the rest of you:<br>
<br>
I won't waste my time telling you all what I think of the way you've treated all my apps/scripts I've released on here.  Let me just summarize that between 6 posts resulting in somewhere around 900 views and over 400 downloads, only <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ONE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of you has ever thanked me for any of it, or given any other kind of positive feeback.<br>
<br>
However, at least two of you have outright flamed me for it.<br>
<br>
I won't post on this board anymore, including any of my software releases.  It certainly won't be my loss.<br>
<br>
Fuck you all, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.<br>

Look, I know from my experience in customer service that it's FAR easier for people to snipe or complain than to be bothered with positive comments.  It you want to over-react to a single post, or you feel amazed that people aren't fawning over what you've done, well, that's reality.  It sucks, but think of it this way...

<br>
When you do good things on the Internet, people will still line up to snipe and take potshots at you.  It happened with Annihilated.com, it's happened here on the VCC, and you know what?  You learn to control your emotional response and accept the fact that no matter how 'good' you are, someone is always going to attack you.  If you see my stating that as aligning with the flamers, well, then go for it, but I think you're mistaken.<br>
<br>
Conversely, if you don't think people take this forum seriously, well, we get 10-12k pageviews and 130-150 posts a day.  If you'd like to make a new, more serious forum for Vazaelle, then by all means, go for it - EZBoards are free to make.  Until you do, I'm going to continue to delete edited-to-nothing posts and feel free to voice my opinion, something you're more than welcome to do yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prybutok@vazaellecommunitycenter>Prybutok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1207<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/26/02 10:07:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3491.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://prybutok.homestead.com/files/djprymini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Software: Vazaelle Server Status and more</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ban me bitch, please I never want to see these boards again anyway.
