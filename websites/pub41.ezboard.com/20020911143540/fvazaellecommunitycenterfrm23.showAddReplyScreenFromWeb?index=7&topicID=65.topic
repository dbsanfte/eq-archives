The computer industry is littered with eula's and disclaimers for that reason.  Hardware/Software/Users are commonly not reliable. <br>

As much as you want them to be, MS will never be financially responsible for the 60 hours of work you lost because Windows fucked up, @Home isn't liable for a $200k ebay sale falling through because of e-mail issues, and so on.<br>

Without such agreements, the computer industry would be severely stagnated and small because computers still suck. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I'm glad you brought up the baseball in the head at a game example.  Fact - the small print <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> does not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> remove anyone from liability if you get whacked in the melon at a game. <br>

Yes, the computer industry is littered with EULA's and that is pretty much what they are - litter.<br>
<br>
MS would be responsible for the 60 hours you lost if you could prove it was them, which you never could. Ditto for the ebay example, you could never prove anything or show that you intended to bid, etc.<br>
<br>
Let the computer industry be small and stagnate.  Eventually quality will improve.  The strong will rise to the top.  Should we protect the TV antenna installation industry?  How about the Beta Videotape Market?  Maybe the steam engine guild needs a handout? It's Evolution Baby.

Plenty of people have tried to take action in regards to arena/stadium related injuries to no avail.<br>
<br>
The ebay example was one of @home's e-mail failing, which has happened a lot during their existence, and believe me a lot of people have lost business because of it.  However, internet access/e-mail is not seen as a required service, and the agreement that people sign when they have @home installed protects @home from people who claim that the fact that their e-mail servers were down for 4 days hurt their business.<br>
<br>
These agreements can be and are challenged, but they hold up the vast majority of the time.  If you don't agree to the terms, you don't need to use their product after all.<br>
<br>
As for whether the computer industry would be better without EULA's, I disagree.  A computer inside medical equipment is _very_ expensive because it is held to such high standards of reliability and is tested thoroughly.  The key in the home computer revolution has been mass production, and an acceptable degree of reliability.  To make perfect hardware and software would simply cost too much, and I have no doubt that the industry as we know it today would not exist.  It would be fringe and hobbyist.<br>
<br>
Survival of the fittest would have occurred, certainly.

I might also recommend you to back up anything business related and reformat the entire machine and start at square one software-wise... back on a past install of EQ after I had first gotten our new computers(no vid card change, but a CPU/mobo w/ diff AGP bus change) on Fel's comp I could not get ANY of the UI to show up, I could see the world fine, but no matter what view I was in I couldn't see any of the buttons, hp bars, etc, etc. Reinstalled everything and no probs(of course it was stupid to try to not reformat during a major hardware change anyhow.. don't preach to me about it please Ceros, I know...) <p><H2><B>--Vaclav Romanov--</H2></B><BR>

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and about 2 more weeks to iron out the problems.  Then I'll reevaluate if the entertainment received justifies the time and money I spend.<br>

They are not available to play anyother time, so they are making a last ditch effort at getting some compensation (free month) for them paying for a service that they have basically been denied.  If they are not compensated and this daily patch BS isn't resolved then there is a really good chance they will just quit.<br>
<br>
I myself have had to change my playing time and reduce the playing time because of said patches, and I am getting pretty annoyed at having to do so.  Like Zinj...I give it 2 weeks...if it doesn't change, my account will be on Player Auctions and I will say F EQ...I would hate to do so, leaving friends behind and whatnot, but I'm pretty fed up.<br>
<br>
Spending 6+ months planning and implementing this should have given VI plenty of time to work out all their bugs etc...I mean, WTF is Beta for?!?  Then they had their scheduled &quot;luclin patch&quot; that went 5-6 hours over schedule, and now we are going on 2 weeks of patches every night!  That right there is denial of product and delivering a lemon!<br>
<br>
Yeah, we don't need to have this service we are paying for, but really...why the fuck keep paying for BS?!<br>

All VI did was admit that their new graphics engine for SoL was a major system drain and that DirectX 7 is completely unable to do some of what they're having it do.<br>

The downtime/patches is nothing new. Microsoft comes out with a new critical security patch for something every day. Sometimes it seems like it's every 5 minutes. Why, then, should we fault VI for having bugs to iron out in a new product, too? At least VI is being frank, and telling us what they're aware of, and have set a schedule for when they're going to fix it.<br>
