<br>
BTW, correlation does not equal causal relationship. <br>
<br>
For example, I have found that students with pens do better on essays than students without pens. I've plotted my observations, done my statistical calculations and sure enough with the highest level of confidence I can show that the above statement is true. But...did the pens cause them to write great essays? <br>
<br>
Clearly there are other variables in my facetious example above and in the case of tax policy and tax revenues. Which variables are dependent and which are independent variables? The choice you make as a student of these issues impacts the results you get and the causal claims you make. <br>
<br>
I would guess that causal influences for tax revenues includes not only tax policy but also incentives for re-investment, monetary policy, trade policy, capital gains issues, short term versus long term issues in tax policy, employment issues, capital reinvestment incentives and practices(look at any study of the history of the American Steel industy for nice illustration of how gov't failed to give steel makers incentive to modernize), etc. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think when supplysiders look at the incentives created by things like capital gains taxes they overlook and ignore the fact that the beneficiaries of those tax breaks did NOT do what we thought that they would with the windfall. <br>
<br>
Consider the case where capital gains windfalls are not reinvested domestically. Lawmakers pass capital gains because they are told that it will stimulate the domestic economy. How could conservatives blame democrats for wanting to reverse those cuts in light of the potential that the objectives that the cuts were supposed to accomplish are not in fact panning out? A tax cut is the functional equivalent of a gov't spending program unless your Ammelen and want to defund the Federal gov't. This begs the question of &quot;if a program is not working&quot; why are we continuing it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    We all know what conservatives like to do with &quot;programs that aren't working.&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I have to wonder if what's good for the goose is also appropriate for the gander <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Productivity increases in both cases.  You can think of it as a multiple of time spent working and productivity per unit time.  Working harder increases both the time spent working and the amount of work done per unit time, whereas working smarter only increases the second.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>BTW, correlation does not equal causal relationship.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It is not absolute proof, but it is strong evidence.  If there is a strong correlation between a potential cause and result, and one cannot offer another explanation, it's reasonable to believe that the cause is probably responsible for the result.<br>
<br>

I agree, but I cannot think of any other factors that would explain the correlation.<br>

<br>
This is true, but to explain the correlation between tax cuts and growth as being of other cause, you would need to demonstrate correlation between one of your factors and tax cuts.<br>

<br>
We still think it's working.  You haven't offered any explanation for the correlation yet.<br>
<br>
Let me try to give an example to make my point clear.  We'll use Kultar's arguments here, which we both disagree with.  Kultar states that blacks are more likely to commit crimes because they are black, and that statistics show that they do commit more crimes.  Ok, so here we have a correlation, being black and committing crime.  It is mathematically true.  However, you and I both believe that the conclusion that being black causes one to commit crimes is wrong.  So let's follow why that is.  The fact is that there is a stronger correlation between being poor and committing crimes, and there is a correlation between being black and being poor.  Thus, the better conclusion is that being poor makes one more likely to commit crimes, and this is also logical because people who have less to lose and greater need for material goods are more likely to try to obtain them in illegal ways.  Thus, we've taken a correlation a -&gt; b and explained it instead as a -&gt; x -&gt; b, in other words being black does not make one commit crimes, but being black in our society often leads to being poor, and being poor leads to committing crimes.<br>
<br>
Do you understand my example?  If there is a correlation, and no causal relationship, you must establish an intermediate correlation.<br>
