I beg to differ with you.  They are quite capable of learning repetative tasks.  They are quite capable of doing the jobs that we as mentally capable intelligent people think of as beneath us.  They are quite capable of bussing tables in mall food courts.  They are quite capable of assembly work and I am not talking like car assembly, I am talking of say placing specific diodes into motherboard (only an example).  They do it without mistakes because unlike us they are not thinking of 10 different things they will be doing later.  They think of only that point in which they are working before they go to the next step.  Sure it may take them longer to learn how to do something but when they do they do not make mistakes. <br>
<br>
They are capable of janitorial work, simple gardening and much much more.<br>

Before you say who would hire them, try thinking first. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hstrial-kscavone.homestead.com/files/Sen_Doll_3.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=304142">magelo</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

It's good to see that your claim of facts includes what you perceive people should feel towards others.<br>
<br>
Dictionary.com <br>
<br>
Look up the word &quot;fact&quot; and pay special attention to it.  Your view of what a &quot;fact&quot; is, is quite skewed and far from reality.  <br>
<br>
People don't deserve respect.  I don't give a fuck if you've won a Noble Peace Prize, you have to earn my respect.  I don't give a fuck if you've been persecuted for 500 years, you have to earn my respect.  I'm an equal-opportunity type of person.  If you're a white piece of shit, black piece of shit, hispanic piece of shit, asian piece of shit, or arab piece of shit, I'll dislike you just as much as anyone.  I didn't persecute blacks so I don't give a fuck if they feel they deserve special treatment due to their color and history.  <br>
<br>
The most racist people in the world are the ones who claim others around them are racist.  The black person who gets arrested by a white cop and claims he was arrested because the white cop is racist.  The white person who gets a dirty look from an Arab for being loud and obnoxious, who claims &quot;that towel head is just a terrorist that hates Americans.&quot;<br>
<br>
My uncle is slow due to a result of eppilepsy when he was very young.  I personally don't give a shit if people want to make fun of the mentally handicapped.  I think people who don't even have a close family member become more sensitive to the retard-bashing than those who do.  It reminds me of the poll in which like 75+% of American Indians had no problem with the warlike sports mascots while over 50% of caucasians and blacks found it offensive.  Uhh, hello?  Why the fuck are you feeling offended if the people who it's directed at don't give a shit? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arkazzakra>Arkaz Zakra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 2:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2107.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /sigh</span><hr size=1> So your say when you first meet a person you treat them like shit??<br>

Honestly, answer that question.<br>
<br>
In my town, a Video Store, Mcdonalds and Safeway contribute to a local community college project attaining work experience doing menial tasks.  Cleaning tables, rewinding video casettes, gathering shopping carts etc etc.  It was a pilot project that was supposed to run for six months.  Mcd pulled out in less then a week, and the other 2 before the end of the month.  These M/C were approx 23 to 25 at the time, not severely handicapped, just mental between 8 and 14.  It failed because attention related problems, with the very little being accomplished.  People actually got fire over the fiasco.<br>
<br>
Its a great idea on paper to help those handicapped people, yet it failed. Horribly, and actually helped put the college in debt.<br>
<br>
I don't really see how I don't know what i am talking about.<br>

<br>
When someone calls someone else who is not mentally disabled a retard, it is not meant as some sort of slam against actual retarded people. The person being called this is most likely not brain damaged, but is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>acting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like it in the estimation of the person giving the insult. Obviously, someone behaving as if they were retarded when they are not is subject to derision, whereas someone actually mentally handicapped and behaving as such is not. <br>
<br>
Using the term retard or retarded in the setting of an insult really has nothing to do with the truly mentally handicapped. For example, if you call someone a bitch are you really thinking of a female canine, or is it just a generic insult? Words over time come to carry different connotations in relation to their use, and are not always meant in a fully literal sense. <br>
<br>
Until someone is directly causing distress to a mentally handicapped person, I see no sense in getting worked up over it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sendaenea>Sendaenea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hstrial-kscavone.homestead.com/files/Sen_Avatar3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 6:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2107.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hstrial-kscavone.homestead.com/files/Sen_Avatar3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ack</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Would you hire them?

Most of it is innate though.  There are very highly functional retarded people who can function quite well as grocery store baggers, janitors, etc.  There are also many that simply cannot function on their own in society.  You might be able to help a little bit with training, but for the most part, the issue is innate capacity for learning.<br>
<br>
It's also not as simple as intellectual potential.  You might have an autistic who has a 175 IQ on paper but cannot relate to other people well enough to function in any type of job.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you just can't train them to function in society though.  The handicap can be too great sometimes.<br>
<br>
When I was in middle school I volunteered to help a retarded girl learn to shelve books in the school library.  She was Down's Syndrome and was high functional retarded.  However, explaining the dewey decimal system (the concept of decimals itself) was exceedingly difficult.  I do believe she was able to do it at the end of a year or so, but it was very difficult, and she was as high as they come among those classified as retarded.<br>
