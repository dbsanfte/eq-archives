- Discuss</span><hr size=1> I'm aware of two lawsuits against UO.  The first in 1998, was by a small group of gamers claiming that UO did not meet the expectations of stability that the box indicated.<br>
<br>
This was settled out of court, no details of the settlement are known -- that I'm aware of anyway, and I never paid much attention.<br>
<br>
The second was in 2000 by UO's volunteer guides (whatever they're called).  They believe that they were treated as employees and thus felt that they were deserved to be paid as employees, including backwages.  This is laughable for so many reasons.  I don't know how this was resolved, but I don't believe that it got very far.  I only really remember what I read on Lums.<br>
<br>
Verant may not be a smart company, but Sony is a very smart corporation and has likely been very aware of what's happened with other games and I'm sure that EQ's EULA reflects that.  Don't doubt that changing the system requirements for the game wasn't passed before a team of lawyers before they announced Luclin.<br>
<br>
I'm not anywhere close to a lawyer, but I do believe that Sony is covered.  I believe in the strength of EULA's.  I don't believe that a country that is *famous* worldwide for insane and successful law suits that they would not have been rendered useless otherwise.<br>
<br>
I'm against law suits of this nature.  Progress comes at a cost, and I think that problems that VI has experienced were almost unavoidable.  I think they've learned why so many FPS games have limited content test versions available to everyone to download months before the release so that they can nail down bugs that come with modern 3D engines.  At the same time, it's understandable why a company wouldn't want to do this.<br>
<br>
Despite the problems that they've had, I do applaud VI for pushing the envelope the way they did with this engine.  A lot of people love to compare FPS game engines to EQ, but those games are marginal in terms of the sheer number of textures and displayed polys.  I think that the expansion is technically and graphically impressive..  but that's totally subjective.<br>
<br>
I would prefer this over an outdated looking game that no longer attracts new gamers to its community and dies a slow death.<br>
<br>

VI has taken a huge step ahead with Luclin and it is by and large an awesome product in my opinion. Sure there are problems and they are doing their best to work through them. Some of you are unhappy because you have lost some play time. Although it is unfortunate (I enjoy playing as much as anyone), it's not the end of the world. You want reimbursement for your $9.95 per month? Let's see, 6 hours/day x 30 hours = 180 hours/month (more or less) $9.95/180 = $.055/hour - now, how many hours did you miss out on? 20? Here's a Buck!!! What a bunch of wasted energy.<br>
The best way to get even if you don't like the product is to cancel your account and go elsewhere with your $9.95 of leisure/disposable income. You can go see one more movie a month, rent a batting cage for 30 minutes, Have a steak dinner at Denny's, A Margarita at El Torito, Take a 2 hour Drive, lots of stuff. The point here is, instead of rallying to lynch the people at Verant for introducing a new product that was not perhaps ready for release(I am glad they released it anyway), you have two choices; Play or don't.<br>
I feel your pain on the frustrations associated with this new release, but in time I think they will work it all out. Until then, I am still going to play and deal with the minor hassles and frequent patches. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umomur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 2:11:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neverquest - a Class Action? - Discuss</span><hr size=1> The logic behind your math is F'ed. You pay per month not per hour.  It's more like $10 for the month lost + $30 for Luclin which doesn't work + $?20-40? for the other disks which are now cup coasters. ~$70 stolen.<br>
<br>
Have you ever returned a game to the store and when asked by the manager,&quot;Why are you returning it?&quot;, looked them straight in the eye and said,&quot;Because it sucks.&quot; I have. I got my money back. I'm not quite ready to do that with EQ, yet. I have faith that they'll fix it.<br>
<br>
Yes they did make a business decision to move quickly with a new engine.<br>
<br>
If those who can't play are the vast minority, then why do I keep getting a daily form letter from EQTech telling me to reinstall DX8.1 and reference their &quot;knowledge base&quot;. Instead of a real answer.<br>
<br>
I guess everyone on this board is smarter than me and fixed their PC's.  I can't get it going yet. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umomur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momur</A> at: 12/13/01 1:13:55 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm23>SoL Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
