<br>
what makes me mad, is that people have to buy into these stereotypes, that for a guy to get a girl, he needs to be powerful, a social stud, just the right amount of nice, blah blah.. and a girl needs to be a flawless beauty, blah blah. it just isn't really true <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
and it puts too much pressure on people who don't have it that easy. i guess i just like to believe that there is a match out there for all personality types.<br>
<br>
a guy shouldn't have to feel like there is something wrong with him and will never get a girl, if he is more emotional than most guys, or has high standards/morals, or is too nice. and he shouldn't have to feel like there is something wrong with him, if he isn't very social, powerful, but instead is shy or needy. sure maybe the &quot;typical girl&quot; might not want that in a guy - but it does not mean he can't find an amazing girl that just likes him for who he is. &quot;too nice&quot; to some girl, might be just right for another.  it all just depends. you can't always help who you fall in love with, either. <br>
<br>
and just the same for girls having to feel like they will never find what they want because they have physical flaws. i'm not the most beautiful person in the world, if i really believed all guys prioritized looks first i would have absolutely no hope to be with someone. and i have felt that way growing up, i don't think that it is right that people have to feel that way. i may not be beautiful to most guys, but i know i am to the ones that will matter.<br>
<br>
nothing is that black &amp; white.<br>
<br>
i totally agree that confidence is key, though. but it is no wonder so many people lack it when they are constantly being reminded if their personality doesn't fit what is &quot;normal.&quot;<br>
<br>
for me personally, i wouldn't purposely seek out a guy who i thought was above me. i want someone who i can consider an equal. and i wouldn't look for traits like &quot;power&quot; , &quot;money&quot; , but things like how well we understand each other , honesty , passion, security, etc.. but i understand the genrealization you are making. <br>
<br>
and i agree , clingy is not a personality trait someone would normally look for. what i was trying to say with that was more just me thinking about how much girls crave attention and twisting it around somehow. i didn't really say what i was trying to say. but i still believe that for a lot of girls... even if she may be wanting space, there is a part of her wanting the guy to want to spend that time with her anyway...  if that makes sense.  <br>
<br>
and i do think there are definitely people who prefer some level of clinginess, over distance. it really just depends on personality types. but yes, it's just a matter of knowing when to give space. <br>
<br>
and you are completely right in saying no one wants someone who acts desperate. people want to feel special. but i think generally, when you have a strong attraction with someone , if they are wanting that from you, you are likely interested in sharing that anyway.<br>
<br>
i guess the confusion comes in with this when i don't just automatically assume that someone who is not a super confident bad boy social stud, is a weak desperate pussy.<br>
<br>
i understand what was said about girls wanting the &quot;bad boy&quot; because of wanting him to share his sensitive side with only her. i totally agree. just i hate when it is said that is something all girls want... i am a girl, i don't want it. at least not the image i have in my head of a &quot;bad boy.&quot;  i have too many expectations when it comes to people. i try not to set myself up for disappointment (though i still do all the time :/)<br>
however, the idea of a guy opening up to me in a way that he wouldn't anyone else is appealing for sure. with that , i guess is what i apply to the dorky loner type, just in a different way. i can think of a lot of nice fantasies of finding  the perfect guy in some shy mysteroius guy, better than some bad boy. just how i am i guess. <br>
<br>
and i don't deny i have issues :P but it just goes to show that i am not like all girls i guess. maybe if i were perfect i would want what you describe as all girls wanting, but i know i am not and i am okay with that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hawkyhawke>Hawky Hawke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/15/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: celeah</span><hr size=1> I agree with banderas<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> So Ammelen is a self-proclaimed genius, is too above a financial career that deals in &quot;chump change,&quot; has worked on Wall Street for years, and knows everything about what women want, yet has never been married.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I suspect that most guys know largely what women want.  The difference between *knowing* what women want and *possessing* what women want is huge.  For most men, the problem is more a matter of possessing than knowing.  For example, Anywon probably *knows* what would be required to be intelligent.  The problem is that he doesn't possess such qualities.  All of this of course is theory.  I do not claim to really understand women, no man really understands women.<br>
<br>
As for what careers I'm above, I'd certainly consider a job paying only 100k or so a year.  I'd do a job for much less.  However, it would have to have some other alluring qualities.  It would have to be interesting, or contribute to the world in some way, or have something...  If you had an option of choosing a job that 1) made way more money, 2) lacked the negative moral characteristics of the job paying less, and 3) was more interesting than the job paying less, would you consider the job paying less?  I doubt it.  If you would, you're an idiot.  I left Wall Street.  At the moment, I'm leaning towards a career in academia.  It won't pay shit, but it will be interesting at least and I won't be making a living scamming people (not that I did on Wall Street, but the guys on Boiler Room did).  A job would have to meet the standard of moral neutrality for me to consider doing it.<br>
<br>
As for having worked on Wall Street for years and being a genius, well, those are factually true.  (I don't care if you like IQ tests or think they are completely worthless, but genius is *defined* by IQ test results.)  My results on an IQ test put me in the genius range and I actually did work on Wall Street (Convertible Bond Sales and Trading, Structured Finance Investment Banking, and Risk Management).<br>
<br>
If you choose to believe me, or to not believe me, I don't particularly care.<br>
<br>
Celeah-<br>
<br>
Most of us aren't saying that people with any of these traits cannot find a mate.  The truth is that the vast majority of people out there can find a mate if they really desire to do so (nearly 100 percent).  The real issue is more &quot;finding a mate up to one's standards.&quot;  Traits such as lack of confidence lower your desirability as a mate, and can force you to settle for a mate lower on your own desirability scale (whatever that might be).  For example, it is good for your chances at dating if you look like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt.  Many people that don't look as good as they do successfully find mates.  However, if they did look that good, they'd be able to be more selective.<br>
<br>
Another thing is supply and demand Celeah.  Maybe your own personal preferences are unusual.  The preferences of one person, or any small minority of persons, do not determine the qualities that make a person easily attract mates.  A few people really like to date fat people.  This doesn't make it easy for fat people to date.  There aren't enough of those people out there; there are way more fat people than people that are extremely attracted to fat people.<br>

The person I know in my life who's closest to being a genius is a person that says he's never scored above a 120 on an IQ test.  Therefore I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>know</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it's meaningless, you only consider it worthwhile because you score so high on it.  If you were to consistently score in the 100-110s on it, yet knew that in everyday situations that your mind functioned on a different level than the average person around you, you wouldn't believe in them either.

<br>
That's not possible.  That person may be, in your opinion, the most intellectually gifted person you know.  However, if you score over 140 on an IQ test, and he doesn't, then you are by definition closer to being a &quot;genius.&quot;  What that's worth is highly debatable.  Personally, Marilyn Vos Savant doesn't really impress me.<br>
<br>
I liked when she came out with the criticism of Wiles proof of Fermat's Last Theorem on the grounds that it was based on elliptical geometry.  Better to be silent and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen, the most intellectually gifted people always test high on IQ tests, but not the other way around.  There are people (such as Marilyn) that test very high on IQ tests but aren't all that impressive.  That's just my opinion though, there is no rigorous science supporting it.<br>

I don't claim either is better.  I claim only one thing.  I claim that you are a genius, and Joe Shmoe is not.  Being a genius doesn't make you a better person.  It doesn't make you more important.  It just makes you a genius.<br>

Well, that may not be entirely true. Forgive me if I've misinterpreted your views, but you seem to me to be a pretty staunch capitalist. Well, modern American capitalism is driven largely by the rampant consumerism endorsed by, well, everything. Therefore, me being a rampant consumer, and you being a modern American capitalist, I assumed you'd encourage and approve of spending vs. saving for the average wage slave. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2035<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/03 11:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I support maximum personal freedoms.

i don't know what people say about me to other people. so i can't give you much insight, sorry.<br>
<br>
long winded version:<br>
by &quot;people&quot; do you mean friends of mine ? or just any random person i have interacted with. and were they asked to describe me - what is the context of their conversation ? should i find it insulting if they would just say i have a good personality ? what would you think of yourself if that is how someone described you ? what if they said &quot;she has a great personality. she is cool.&quot;  is it better that way ?<br>
<br>
i'd choose someone saying just &quot;she has a great personality&quot; over just saying things relating to my looks if that means anything. does that mean i am hideous ?<br>
<br>
tell me what you think it would mean if someone were to describe me that way to their friends.<br>
<br>
what do people tell their friends about you ?<br>
<br>
what is the point of this question again ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raiyaeq>RaiyaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1133<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/03 1:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=140>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bad boys?</span><hr size=1> I don't believe any mature girls in their right mind would rather have a guy who doesn't give a fuck about them.

To have a partner who won't let you always have your way is one thing, have a partner who just treats you like nobody cuz he's an asshole that's another.<br>
