Not a hard camp, just takes a little time if you want to be safe. There was a placeholder in the room instead of the mal when we got there so it was going to take and hour. We were just about finished on the 2nd clearing of the area when Monoxide sent me a tell asking if i was camping the Mal for the spell? I replied yes. He sent another tell asking the spawn rate and i told him about 45 minutes and it should be spawning soon. Thought that was the end of it. So we finished clearing and went back into the room and was waiting for the Mal to pop when Monoxide came in. I was about to ask if he was waiting for the camp and wanted our help after we were done when the Mal poped. Me and my bud start pounding and debuffing when Monoxide jumps up and starts to pound on the Mal. Thought maybe he was just helping out when suddenly he HTed it. The Mal drops, Monoxide loots and gates just that fast. <br>We are both WTF? I send him a tell and he says the spell didnt drop. Do any of us believe that? Neither did we. My bud knows some peps in his guild and this dumb ars is already laughing how he just KSed us. So i sent him a tell asking if he memed the spell yet and i want it. He denies again but wants it real bad and will buy one for 500pp. Then i let him know we knew he told his giuld about KSing us. He says he is tired and Logs. An hour later we were out of there with the spell and alot less trusting of peps. If this guy is willing to do this, is he safe to have on a raid with no drops? I know after this I would never allow him anywhere near my camp.<br><br> <p>NO!

This all hearsay to me. <br><br>I know Monox, and I know quite a few peeps from his guild.  I don't see Monox doing something like this, and I don't see him not giving you whatever dropped in case it did drop.  Does this mob reportedly drop the spell EVERY single time?<br><br>If it did drop, he would have given it to you.  He's a nice guy like that, beleive it or not.  You sure seem to try to stick it to him in this post w/o alot of 'proof' other than your assumptions.  I also asked around and found an inaccuracy in your tale.  From what I understand, he laughed that he OUTDAMAGED a SK a few levels his senior, not that he KS'd.  Difference being in the intent of his boast.  KS'ing suggests he went for the jugular.  Being surprised at outdamaging suggests he didn't see it coming.  And if he's laughing about that, I doubt he would have used a HT to get the edge for those bragging rights.  Doesn't add up from what I know of Monox.<br><br>Let's see some 'proof'.<br><br>Can we get this thread removed due to inaccuracies, which was probably posted in a crying fit, and prevent this whining little baby from further trying to tarnish the rep of a good friend of mine whose only mistake in this was trying to help out some ppl at a camp he was interested in, but probably didn't bother to stay at for another hour and a half cause maybe he was REALLY tired and would try for it later?<br><br>/em summons cheese for all the victims of the boogeyman AKA Monoxcide <p><div align="center"><image src="http://home.swbell.net/jmorato/sig_image2.jpg" height="105" width="430"></div></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udroak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DrOak</A> at: 1/24/02 7:39:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urexron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rexron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Pie Guy </span><br>  Posts: 584<br> <font color=#333333>(1/24/02 8:40:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Be careful if Monoxide comes into your camp</span><hr size=1> I wasnt there .. so I dont know what happened.<br>I will say this:<br>1)Mono left our guild on Monday the 21st ... wasnt kicked out, left on his own will<br>2)He didnt come back in the guild<br>3)He couldnt have &quot;Bragged&quot; to his guild that he KSed anyone, he didnt have a<br>   a guild to brag to.<br><br>If it did happen, i am sorry that it did and hope that someone was using Mono's account.
