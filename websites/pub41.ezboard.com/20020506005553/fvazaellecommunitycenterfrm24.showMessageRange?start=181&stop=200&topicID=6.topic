I supposed the answer is so obvious, that my question is almost rhetorical.  <br>
<br>
I understand while you would take this personally and try to make a joke of my question--since this directly pointed at you and your EQ validity.  <br>
<br>
I recall a post made by you earlier and being the lazy individual that I am, I won't go digging around for it.  This post stated your intention to join an uber guild.  Or at least that was your intent.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Most people like to win and be on a good team.  <br>
<br>
My problem with that--is you make rant and flames.  These rant, flames and attacks made by you imply that your team was successful--and that you were a part of that success.<br>
<br>
I would like to argue that you are bandwagon, uber wannabe.  All you did was hop on the winning team and go along for the ride.  It's like some scrub signing a contract to play for the Yankees.  Granted, you may suck--but damn straight your team kicks ass.  While you can talk all the trash you want to the Devil Rays &amp; Angels--you sir are a minute cog to that powerhouse machine.  The Yankees are gonna win with or without you.  You sir were just fortunate to be on that team.  You belitting all those who are not on the team is silly--because before you were on that team, you were not too different than any of them.  You puckered up to The Tactian's ass and got picked up for the North ToV express.  YaY for you.  <br>
<br>
I think I have a grasp on the situation sir.  I think the clue purchasing is something you need to do.  <br>

<br>
Although each person is a small &quot;cog&quot; in the mighty whatever the fuck uber Devil Rays Yankees US Military Mom's apple pie whatnot, you still make a contribution.  Yes if you take away one person that guild will still most likely kick ass.  So now take away two... three... four?<br>
<br>
  I think you can see where that goes.  Everyone's fucking contribution to a guild is minutia when compared to the whole.  Yes there are some &quot;the leaders&quot; as it were, who make more of a contribution of time and/or tactics, but let's be honest, this isn't fucking brain surgery.  <br>
<br>
Given an amount of time, a team of chimpanzee's could take out Vulak, and probably more efficiently since all they are thinking about is that goddamn banana that the dude won't give him.<br>
<br>
As far as banging on someone for their class, keep in mind that if gimp_02 wasn't playing him you'd be gimp_03 being forced to either find gimp_04 or raise one yourself so you could have it.<br>
<br>
Concerning Vehn, I suspect that you perceive his motives wrong.  He doesn't rant about uberness because he has some self delusional pair of brass everquest cajone's.  He rants because he gets a rise outta everyone, and he's fairly accomplished at it.  Asshole.<br>

BUT, my point is that it is a tad annoying hearing the trash talk from certain individuals who, in my opinion (which you can discount or not) just hopped on for the ride.  <br>
<br>
ALTHOUGH...  after some thinking.  Maybe Vehn was just the IV cheerleader.  Or Mascot.  Perhaps he was the guy who puts on the Chicken Uniform &amp; does all those silly things to make people laugh?  <br>
<br>
I know I have been amused...  <br>
<br>
I will give props when they are do.  He does make some good rants.  He is often very amusing.  BUt, when he makes his trash talking, belittling rants, you sometimes gotta consider the source, it only makes sense that poop spews from poop.  <br>

Personally, I envision Vehnn as more of a &quot;Dancing Homer&quot; than a chicken guy, but they're both really really cool and we all know your hurtful tone was only jealousy.<br>
<br>
Moving on, don't speak about what you don't know.  You were obviously talking out of your ass when you talked about Vehnn's skill as an enchanter - Procax was gracious enough to show you the error of your ways.  Surprisingly enough, you owned up to it - in the very next breath insulting him again (see my first point).<br>
<br>
Now, I know you don't want me to proove you wrong about all of it - because I can.  Vehnn isn't an uber-wannabe hangeron anything.  If you had called *me* that - fine.  When I started on Vaz I choose druid for the very reason that I'm a lazy slob and wanted to be able to leave when I wanted to leave and go where I wanted to go (luxuries I didn't have on my first character, a cleric).  Vehnn picked enchanter because he: a.) was sick and tired of depending on incompetents to perform a vital role, b.) unwilling to ever again click the &quot;ranger&quot; button, and c.) wanted to be in the thick of things (I know, very hard to see that about him, huh?).<br>
<br>
Finally, as for picking the winning team and going with it, this was in no small part due to having already played with the best - who wants to be a part of the rest after that?  While you were trying to figure out where the bank in Kaladim was, Vehnn was enjoying the opening of PoH, PoS, the first Trak, and Inte's Sword of Death.  Never heard of it?  Color me surprised.  My suggestion here is that you hold up a mirror - chances are you're a reflection of your words.  I'm just glad that it only took you a few months of sending both Vehnn and I ass kissing tells every day to get the clue that neither of us really wanted to be your best friend - without that hardwon clue, this post would be even more like kicking a dog. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubakxs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakxs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 6:02:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=193>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> JEALOUSY?</span><hr size=1> Please.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I may be mistaken...  but I am not jealous of the accomplishments of Vehnn in relation to IV.  I admire IV for what they did in such a short amount of time.  Heck, I may be jealous of IV.  BUT to imply that I'm jealous of Vehn and his contribution/accomplishments in IV would be a very large mistake.  <br>
<br>
I may have made an error when I aluded (sp?) that Vehn lacked skill as an enchanter, by comparing him to being a scrub on the Yankees.  I know that Vehn is a very good enchanter.  But that wasn't the real basis of my argument.  <br>
<br>
My argument was that Vehn intended all along to get on the uber guild--something that he wasn't on his old server.  And in doing so, he talked a lot of trash, belittled people--just because he FINALLY weasled his way into THE guild on the server.  <br>
<br>
He didn't get in IV from the beginning, because he wasn't hard core enough.  <br>
<br>
Due to the level camp, he eventually caught up to be of a level that would be relatively productive to a raiding guild.  <br>
<br>
He was brought on--possibly due to the fact that the other enchanters in the guild were burnt out of bein the buff/tash bitch on raids.  <br>
<br>
Granted, I don't know the entire situation--but that sounds 'bout right.  <br>
<br>
I'm very happy for Vehn on his accomplishments on his old server.  YaY for him.  I'm very happy for Vehn's accomplishments on this server with IV.  YaY for him again.  I LAUGH at him belitting and mocking other players--when all he did was jump on a team IN ITS PRIME.  <br>
<br>
As Malathor posted in his quote of Procax--this game doesn't take a lot of skill.  It takes a TON of time, energy and common sense.  It also takes some timing and luck.  <br>
<br>
You and Vehn started playing before me.  You did things before me.  Whooptie f00k'n do.  Yay for you.  <br>
<br>
Did I claim to be a better player than Vehn?  Did I claim to be uber?  Did I belittle Vehn's guild?  <br>
<br>
Vehn jumped on the IV Express.  Vehn talked a lot of trash.  Vehn, while a skilled player that he is--isn't as important to IV's succes, nor as great as he IMPLIES.  <br>
<br>
So what's your point?<br>
<br>
Attack me if you wish--but it seems like the pulling of straws to me.  It sounds like Vehn's girlfriend trying to put down that mean man that made him look silly.  Once again, I'd like to refer to my previous post:<br>
<br>

I didn't respond to your obvious enrapture with me because a) you're boring, b) I don't like male stalkers, sorry.<br>
<br>
For the 4th? time, I never said I was important to IV's success.  I never took credit for anything.  I guess you're objecting to my original post of &quot;we're better players than you&quot;?  But you never got around the whole &quot;attack vehn personally instead of his idea&quot; like poor supa.. and then you say you're not good at EQ anyways?  Uhm ok?  <br>
<br>
I mean you don't even make sense, you accuse me of &quot;bandwagon hopping&quot; but where are you right now after your self proclaimed unswerving loyalty to the Endless you quit for 4 months and hop onto PO?  And the &quot;invites to groups&quot; were more like you: &quot;HI HOW ARE YOU&quot;, us: ok, grouping etc, you: &lt;crickets&gt;, every day for 3 months, and then the couple times we make an effort to group with you you ditch us within an hour to go on guild raids?  Yeah great way to make friends.  Whatever.<br>
<br>
Seriously just get a clue and shut up or feel free to, you know, actually contradict what I'm saying with actual logic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukyrana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kyrana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 7:31:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=195>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: JEALOUSY?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyway, I'm jus' curious.

Pardon me for crashing your party after getting the invitation, spud.  The funniest thing is you chose to harp on the &quot;JEALOUSY&quot; portion of my post, which was in referance only to Dancing Homer vs. a man in a chicken suit.  However, if the shoe fits, far be it from me to prevent you from wearing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umojokynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mojokynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/6/01 3:23:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=196>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wikmans.se/family/milvas3.jpg width=80 height=70></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: JEALOUSY?</span><hr size=1> for being female kyrana isnt half-bad at penis waving.. <p>-Milvas</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uamadar75.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amadar75</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/6/01 4:00:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=197>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: JEALOUSY?</span><hr size=1> You two should form a tag team and enter the WWF. <p>Amadar

Sir, first of all I don't think you fully understand what loyalty and respect are (okay, maybe you do--but you certainly do not show it).  Secondly--you have ZERO idea of what you are talking about.  In your hasty defense of your enormously large, overinflated ego--you failed to do the research to back up your incorrect claim (unlike Mr. DancingHomer, I'm more than willing to admit when I'm wrong--I don't spew our more unfounded accusations off the top of my head just to get back at my accuser).  Anyway, I'll be more than happy to break things down for you, if your thick skull still will not allow you to understand how incorrect you are.  <br>

I think I have used logic and reasoning in retorting your shallow rants.  Maybe it's below your elitest logic--but it is actual logic sir.  Re-read it again.  Use some of that intelligence you have.  I know it's there, unfortunately it's burried knee deep in the ass of a personality you present of these forums.  <br>
<br>
I hear you are a nice, smart guy in real life.  Too bad your poor attempts at humor and huge ego presents you as a big ol' tard.  Some may laugh at your jokes...  heck, I've read some good ones.  Unfortuantely, it seems like your wit and intelligence goes down the tube, once the joke is on you.  <br>
<br>
Then Ky gets tagged in to throw in her two cents...  Unfortunately her retort isn't even worth a copper.  She tried (feebly) to try to take apart of response...  but she didn't get very far.  Maybe there's a bit too much truth in it?  Or maybe I'm too below her for her to waste her time on...  <br>
<br>
I shall end this with a quote from someone I find pretty smart and witty:  <br>
<br>

P.S.  Still wondering if you got that invite to PA...  Or did you turn them down due to your unswerving loyalty to IV?  <br>
