Thanks fer the info<br>

BTW I would put em on my friends list so I could take my druid to whatever zone he is in and let the group he managed to get know of his actions, LOL also whatever guild he may someday manage to get into. <br>

bah, nobody ever remembers me ....<br>
<br>
anyway Hoek did go LD that time in warlord's room while we were sitting around doing nothing (waiting for pops). Pretty much a safe time to intentionally /quit. I only learned later (after the LD) that Div lent Hoek his T-staff. <br>
<br>
like you said, the saddest part about this is that Hoek can just make a lvl 1 monk, pass all his stuffs and start all over again. <br>
