<br>
The simple fact that you find it with in yourself to end your messages with comments like 'Happy Quading' is evidence that you are a very angry person.  I don't know why you are so angry with wizards, and you will probably deny you are, but the wording in your messages leads me to believe you have extreme personal angst against the whole wizard class for some reason.  You do know you can start one, right?  It's not an exclusive society bro.<br>
<br>
Show love for your fellow players... save the angst for VI. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
For the people who for some reason thought he was actually arguing the points about Manaburn, on behalf of the wizards of EQ (who are all represented by the voices in my head):<br>
<br>
1) Yes, Manaburn was pretty damn powerful.<br>
<br>
2) No, that did not mean TMB kills were trivial, although they could be fairly easy if everything goes right (much like any raid, really).<br>
<br>
3) The lack of triviality has to do, in part, with shitty coding by VI. Talking about the theory and ignoring the practice in this regard is pretty pointless.<br>
<br>
4) No, most wizards with MB did not spend their time farming Kunark content. They had better things to do.<br>
<br>
5) No, most of the Kunark content on Vazaelle did not fall to TMB. Asserting this is just another way of saying you're slow and disorganized. Stuff that you don't see up was ganked by someone. Even at its peak, Vazaelle only had two handfuls of wizards with MB, most of them playing at Euro/US times.<br>
<br>
6) Yes, MB wouldn't work as-was in PoP. Either it needed to be disabled in PoP (my preference) or retuned (what we got).<br>
<br>
7) Yes, pre-nerf MB had utility on raids where fast kills were important (Trakanon, Zlandicar, anyone who cycles DTs, et cetera).<br>
<br>
8) Yes, due to its 1 point of aggro (much like archery has diminished aggro for its damage), it could also be used in long Luclin fights where the wizard had time and mod rods to mod to full before they'd normally begin with their normal aggro-producing nuking chores.<br>
<br>
9) No, the nerfed MB is not useful in either of these circumstances. It was always very mana-inefficient, and now it's more so, with a hard cap of just over 9000 points of damage for a full burn. Considering even with my very average manapool, I can do more than 20k of damage with my full manapool, this is hardly some exceptional value, especially considering wizards' other tools for dealing with highly resistant opponents.<br>
<br>
10) Yes, the Kunark spawns are easy and people one group (or less) them before, during and after the MB era without MB wizards.<br>
<br>
11) Yes, this content is still prime material to many folks.<br>
<br>
12) Yes, they should probably have more parity between the classes and make spawned versions of Gorenaire, Venril Sathir and Servilious, just like they do Ragefire, Trakanon, Venril Sathir's Remains and Faydedar.<br>
<br>
13) No, wizards have never denied any of this. There's never been a giant conspiracy about MB -- in fact, on a stickied thread at Graffe's for two weeks before Luclin came out, people hashed out how this could work, picked targets, and as the targets were knocked down, posted full info usually within the hour the kill occurred. None of this has ever been done under a veil of secrecy and none of it has ever been denied to be happening.<br>
<br>
14) Yes, we have denied that these kills went from demonstration/stunt kills (see Sontalak) to an ongoing, and cockblocking, farming session. This is because it didn't happen.<br>
<br>
15) Yes, people claim it did. Asking them to provide proof, even such insubstantial and fakeable proof as rants on a server's R&amp;F boards -- where things like the mythical pre-change Ragefire ganks would almost certainly appear, especially if they were taking place in large numbers -- results in insults and declarations about how proof isn't needed, because it's &quot;clearly&quot; true.<br>
<br>
16) No, it's not clearly true. Put up or shut up.<br>
<br>
17) Yes, Verant said point-blank in multiple Fan Faires that they saw no problem with Manaburn and had no intention at the time of changing anything. This is well into the MB era, when the urban myths of &quot;my best friend's server&quot; being held hostage by rampaging MB wizards were popular.<br>
<br>
18) Yes, they either changed their mind or lied. They do both.<br>
<br>
19) Yes, this exact same cycle is beginning again with other classes. Instead of bitching about it, figuring out what's important (letting lower level folk farm their own epic pieces, probably) and making the needed changes (more spawned versions of these jokers) is a better solution than the same stupid cycle of hysteria and nerfing, with nothing really changing in the end.<br>
<br>
20) No, no more paladin, warrior, bard or even wizard epics showed up on Vazaelle after the nerf. These spawns left the game at about the same rate as during the MB era, maybe a little slower.<br>
<br>
21) Yes, this has gone on too long, and I'll STFU in a moment.<br>
<br>
22) Yes, Team IHT, I need Disintegrate and Winds of Gelid. Let me know if they drop and you're not asking an insane crackhead price for either (20k is insane crackhead territory for either, btw).<br>
<br>
OK, bring back the picture of the dead horse, please. I'm out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=owwiefixer@vazaellecommunitycenter>Owwiefixer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/19/02 7:29:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3503.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Noobs</span><hr size=1> bigemnose-<br>

No, I have no hatred for wizards.. yes I have two of them myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    &quot;Happy quadding!&quot; means exactly what it says- it means enjoy quadding.  It's of the same vein as &quot;Have fun stormin' the castle!&quot;<br>
<br>
You obviously don't know my character (being one that enjoys lava diving in Sol often for fun and joviality), but I can easily understand the mininterpretation from the prior context of the post.<br>
<br>
Whizbang-<br>
<br>
Thanks for that post.  I'll simply reiterate the large amount of common sense and reality in your pointlist contradicts the &quot;INJUSTICE!&quot; cry you spew at every turn where possible.  Your first post on this very thread (not even related to manaburn):<br>
&quot;The MB nerf was always a joke.&quot;<br>
&quot;They just nerfed MB in Kunark (yes, yes, it would have to be flagged unusable in PoP or something too, I agree) to shut up all the whining morons who'd been lied to and told that the reason they didn't have their epics was because ebil wizards were &quot;holding them for ransom.&quot;<br>
<br>
None of this really agrees with your points list, IMO.<br>
<br>
I do have specific disagreements with a couple of your points, but 90% of what you have is what I'd consider mostly correct or at least closer to reality than tromping around town asserting the manaburn nerf was a &quot;joke&quot; (outside of the needed nerf/change for PoP or big raid encounters- specifically against &quot;trivial&quot; kunark content).<br>
<br>
That's truly our only difference of opinion.  I agree the content in question is &quot;trivial&quot; by a standard group- heck, no less trivial than your average pickup vox/naggy style raid where a bunch of random noob 50/51's can form and drop these with little difficulty most of the time.  BUT- I disagree that manaburn didn't make them substantially LESS trivial, as &quot;content&quot; in the form of aggro, summoning, mob retaliation/AE, and some mobs even with cheal... is totally bypassed.  The equivalent triviality could only be arrived by gathering 15-17+ noob wizards and executing a synchronized nuke, which doesn't even figure from the sheer numbers involved and efforts to orchestrate such a synchronized nuke fest.<br>
<br>
I never said mobs were &quot;ganked&quot;- just that there were hit by a group of people less interested in the encounter, and usually without any personal need for the result of the encounter.. and done so by bypassing any content the already trivial encounter had to offer in the first place.  A small, low-tier guild may actually have some members interested in taking down an epic/kunark mob rather than buy the drops from a wizard's alt bazaar mule, or have to &quot;warm up&quot; to a TMB member in hopes of getting a hand-out.  And there is no denying the fact this was the case on Vaz from the entire time TMB was around. (read some of the other posts in this thread and try to deny this, not to mention the influx of scales, RBBs and whatnot that occurred and could be specifically linked to a TMB hit).  I don't care if the intentions of the group were &quot;Robin Hood&quot; of hand-outs to niche-pal rings for free, or the extreme TNZ fallacy of &quot;holding hostage&quot; drops- both scenarios are equally wrong and for the wrong reason, IMO.<br>
<br>
Those were my points.  Plain and simple.  You have the right to disagree with them, or instead can simply do ghetto teenage &quot;gangstah&quot; retorts of juvenile nature concerning levels, titles, raid hit target credentials, and a whole slew of completely incorrect/false labeling.   Your last post at least shows you have some form of civility left at the end of the day, so that says something.<br>
<br>
And yes, bring out the dead horse picture again please.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
