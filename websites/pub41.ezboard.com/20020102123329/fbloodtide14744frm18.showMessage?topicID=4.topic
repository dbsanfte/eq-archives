It glittered and shone throwing off glittering diamond sparks. The trees whispered softly in the almost still night, and even the sounds of the wildlife seemed quiet as if in respect for this night. Two figured sped by along the frozen river, their feet not touching the ground, but their passage whipping the snowbanks into small hurricanes behind them. As the river forked they seemed to run up the nearly vertical incline and then shot off into the deep forest. The trees blurred past like a fence as they skimmed in and out, between and around the trunks. Finally they came to a great cliff, enclosing a valley within the high mountains. Far from the reaches of most men, these two had travelled almost two weeks since they had provisioned themselves in Halas. Rocketing off into the air, their feet churned and when they had reached the centre of the hidden vale. They stopped, descending slowly to the craggy snow covered bottom. They finally reached the rock and stood hunched over by a pool of gleaming water. The stillness reflecting back a perfect mirror Gasping raggedly from the effort their supernatural run had cost them, their breathed fogged in the night air. It was some moments before they could catch their breathe, and then they stood and looked at each other.<br>
<br>
"Are you certain this is the place?",said Zalbar<br>
"Aye it is. I can feel it in my bones.", replied Harcon<br>
" It doesn't have to end like this, Harcon." said Zalbar slowly<br>
" The time has come."replied Harcon, " Wasn't it you who said that in each person's life, there comes a turning point and we have to make a decision that will forever change it?"<br>
" I did, but I didn't expect it to be thrown back in my face. Why now, of all times? There is still much to be done." said Zalbar with a stern look in his pale green eyes.<br>
"My time has come. I knew that this onus lay on me. It is something that has been passed on from father to son for generations in my family."said Harcon simply, his face showing stern resolve and at the same time a boundless compassion for one <br>
" You can't mean the Hordan'Chi?" said Zalbar with a look of shock on his face<br>
" Yes", he said simply.<br>
"That means that we're standing...."said Zalbar<br>
<br>
Quickly, Zalbar threw his hands wide, arcane chantings rolling off his tongue like thunder. " LET THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN BE REVEALED!" he shouted as his arm raised his staff aloft. The tip began to throw off small motes of fire that slowly circled the tip and grew wider, and wider in their arcs. Like little imps, they multiplied and grew into a blazing circle of fire that rose higher and higher as the whirling, flaming racetracks grew wider and wider. Soon they encompassed the cliff walls and seemed to coalesce at the four points of the valley. Clinging to some sturcture that could not be seen, then suddenly the fires faded away revealing the grand wizard spires. Higher, and taller then those of the Dreadlands, whiter and purer than those in the sylvan forest of Faydark. <br>
" Something is....wait...the runes, the runes are wrong..." stated Zalbar peering intently at the carved mystic rock.<br>
" Yes, they were not placed here by mortal men, but rather by Mithaniel Marr himself." said Harcon, " It is said that though the spires themselves were crafted by the greatest wizards of the old days, it was Marr himself who had tasked them with this commission. How can one refute the will of a god?"<br>
"You're not coming back are you?" questioned Zalbar a tear gleaming in his eyes<br>
<br>
Harcon grabbed Zalbar's arm in his own burly steel encased one. "One day, the gods willing, I shall return old friend. You shall not be forgotten." he said." Now my time has come. Marr has called me and I must go. This battle is more imortant than my own life, but the ties of the blood stll sing in my veins. If the bonds of loyalty and friendship reach into that other place, then I may once again walk amongst my bretheren here on Norrath." Harcon grabbed Zalbar in a rough embrace and then strode to the other side of the pool.<br>
<br>
Drawing his flaming sword, Soulfire he turned and lowered it to the calm pool of water. As the flames touched the still pool it rippled out and the water caught fire, rising in a pillar of white fire. Suddenly Harcon was engulfed in the holf fire and his very body began to glow as brightly as the sun. Zalbar took a step back and raised one hand up to shield himself from the burning form.<br>
<br>
"MARR! I COME! LET THE VILLANOUS PREPARE FOR THE MIGHT OF A PALADIN OF THE BLOOD TIDE!!"<br>
<br>
The spires pulsed once with a soft blue light., and then he was gone. The spires had faded from sight, and the water was once again flat and still. Harcon, had gone to that other place. Called to fight another cause, for there was no one else that could fight it for him.<br>
<br>
"Farewell old friend...",sighed Zalbar his head lowered.<br>
<br>
His eyes came up at the sound of boots crunching on snow, and he waited patiently as the two armor encased forms approached, their own flaming swords held lightly in their hands. Finally coming to a stop by the water, they knelt in genuflection before rising.<br>
<br>
" Spioctor, Argonious what are you doing here?", asked Zalbar<br>
<br>
"We were summoned.", said Spioctor, "Now I know why. It has long been a part of our lore, this place." he said gesturing all around him."However it was thought but a myth. A tale told to inspire courage and valour in flagging spirits. This leaves me much to think upon."<br>
<br>
"Aye." agreed Argonious," We are surely blessed this day to have witnessed such a miracle."<br>
<br>
" Let us leave this place, as to stay here o'er much may in some way detract from the sanctity of it." said Zalbar," We have much still to do, and the Blood Tide have many weary miles to travel as yet. Our ancient enemy Cazic Thule awaits us, and we must prepare to assault him on his own ground. The plane of fear where our forefathers banished him so many eons ago"<br>
<br>
As Zalbar began his incantation a powerful male voice drifted to them from out of the air above.<br>
<br>
"Know that I am well pleased with thee, and the tasks of the Blood Tide further the cause of good and justice. Perhaps once his task is finished Harcon may be restored to thee. Hail and fare well chosen of the Blood." it intoned in a rolling sonorous voice. But before the trio could stop and gasp in amazement, they faded from sight as the mystic portals whisked them away to the woods of Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
The wind picked up, and the valley was soon gripped in a whirling blizzard of snow. Yet the area around the pool of water remained calm and undisturbed. Lying next to it, almost half buried in the snow was Harcon's holy symbol, and it gleamed as ferociously as his spirit had while he trod the realms of Norrath serving the will of Marr, and that of the Blood Tide...<br>
