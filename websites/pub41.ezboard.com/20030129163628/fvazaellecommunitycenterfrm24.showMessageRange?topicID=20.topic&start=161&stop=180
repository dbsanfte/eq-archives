Now while the 12 or so people are clearing a group of 40 people from a rival guild zone in and say <br>
<br>
Rival guild states &quot;welp, you clearly dont have the force here to kill Tunare so we are going to plow this place and kill her&quot; <br>
<br>
Of course the couple groups in the zone from guild 1 are not going to be impressed and state <br>
<br>
Original guild states &quot;yes, we cannot kill her with 12 people but more people will be logged on by the time the clearing is complete and therefore we will be fine when the time comes&quot; <br>
<br>
Rival guild states &quot;that is crap, we could have this cleared and Tunare dead way sooner then you as we have the force to do it right now&quot;<br>
<br>
Original guild states &quot;/shrug, we were here first&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I grant there are only 8 mobs to clear in this situation but it is still a similar type of thing. You have two hours from the death of the first taskmaster right? That means if a guild kills one taskmaster and within 2 hours will have the force to handle the named it is kinda in their right to keep going as much as the guild who starts a PoG clear has the right to complete it and kill Tunare.<br>
<br>
I have alot of friends in CC, and I am a member of PO. All in all this situation got way more hard feelings brewing then it warranted and should just be forgotten. CC knows they have the advantage in both the spawn times after patches, and the fact they have afew mobs that they kill that PO cannot. When the Creator is up and the THO is up it is in the best interest of CC to do the THO since PO can kill him and remove that content from the game on CC. The Creator on the other hand is ATM a free spawn for CC that they can kill at leisure. I am sure this is the way CC thinks (heck it should be if not). Kill the mobs that PO can kill first and then when all the contested mobs are dead CC can kill those mobs only they can handle atm at their conveniance. It is this attitude of course that makes the race all the more important and will add to the tension in some situations such as this.<br>

People that often clamored against the bullies, often had the worst attitude once they were on the other side of the fence.  <br>

PoG is very different tho. If you put 2 groups in there, clear all but Tunare, its every guilds right to just go in and kill her. This happened in PoF many times and to Tunare on other servers. Tunare isnt a part of a spawn chain, neither is Cazic Thule. We killed both in the past with a large number of mobs still up in the plane. We never did it to PO because its too gay to take Tunare when so much time is spend on clearing PoG. Any amount of loot isnt worth sinking so low.<br>
<br>
But its just as low to pnp 45 players, ready and buffed, when you have 12 in the zone. I hope someday Akethadar will apologize for that move. A similar move would be to run in and kite Shei Vinitras with a SoW while another guild was in there and then PnP them if they pulled him off.<br>
<br>
The beauty of this rant is that there isnt 2 sides of the story. Its was a wrong move and I hope it never happens again. Vaz have been spares most of the crap other guilds deal with like following eachother in North ToV and taking every 2nd spawn and lame stuff like that. Training isnt seen common on Vaz but it is on some servers because it can never really be proven.<br>
<br>
I hope this isnt something PO will do ever again.<br>

I guess some po officers asked us not to make this post blow up out of proportion but as you can see, some of us post anyway? So I ask you: Whats the big fucking deal, bitch?<br>
<br>
Wyndigo: I didn't flame you, but I couldn't and still can't figure out why you would even bring that up on this thread. As far as me saying you're on KB now, that wasnt to suggest youre feelings about po were because of who you were with and what you are doing now, its more me pointing out you aren't on vaz or in po now.

On a technical lvl, you could not claim Tunare by killing other mobs in PoG, no GM would enforce it.  The taskmasters are part of a triggered spawn cycle, so technically, that is different.<br>
<br>
I would never have gone into PoG with another guild there having cleared most/part of it and being still present in the zone.  However, I would no longer have any problem zoning into PoG with PO having done half the work, finishing the clear, and ganking Tunare.  Not that CC will do that, as I'm not an officer and have no role in the decisions, but if they did, I'd be right there with them.  If you want to play the game that way, fine, expect others to treat you with the same lack of respect.<br>
<br>
After getting the right to engage, they didn't bother to, they just let it despawn.  This shows that their intention was not to engage, or they would have, but rather to despawn and postpone the cycle.  GIMP.<br>

That fight is not hard and we -- sorry, you guys, should be able to do it no problem.<br>
<br>
If you were referring to the &quot;why we left PO&quot; tirade, Ravendawn, who barely knows me, called me out.  I got pissed off.<br>
<br>
For the people that wonder why PO's officers tell people not to post in these threads, I think I have an answer.<br>
The officers are (rightly) afraid that some idiot will make a complete ass of himself and the guild in the forums.  The people with enough sense to know when they did something wrong (or if not wrong, at least devious) usually won't post.  It's almost always the biggest idiot in the guild who feels compelled to defend its &quot;honor.&quot;<br>

Sure, BUT! we all know that half the people that post here are sitting at work pressing refresh, WAITING to stir up shit.  I mean, you could post topic: &quot;hi&quot; Subject: &quot;hi&quot; Comment: &quot;hello&quot; and have 10 people RIP on you from work just because &quot;they can&quot; or they are bored.  So, why throw out opinions on something when it REALLY doesnt mean anything, it is just fodder for people to make fun of or whatnot.  If you dont even have self esteem, or dont care of what people think of you, or go here under a secret code name, then post all the time.  For people that like dignity while playing the game USUALLY dont post here much because in all honesty I think (my own opinion) this is just a section to be an ass and do nothing but try to hurt others.  <br>

This is complete and utter bullshit. PO may have had 12 people in the zone when we engaged the first taskmaster, I don't know I wasn't in the zone, but I zoned in just before CC engaged the 2nd(thier first) and CC had 26 in the zone and PO had 24 + at least 1 guest.<br>
