 if this is indeed truth, how dare you add insult to injury over this person's loss? 99% of people tell the truth online. remember how the u.s. court system is setup? you are innocent untill proven guilty?<br>

- Way to pull statistics out of your ass, buddy boy.  Proove to me that 99% of the people online are telling the truth.  You can't possibly do it, and you'd only believe it if you'd never been MUDmarried to a chick who turned out to have a dick.  The internet is anonymous and people LIE CONSTANTLY.<br>
- Vehnn asked respectfully for some way to verify this story.  Granted he has a very suspicious nature (which I taught him to have!), but it isn't an unreasonable request, and it was made in a respectful tone (especially if you know what Vehnn is usually like - love ya hon!).<br>
- The story does have red flags - I read it before Vehnn did, he emailed me this morning asking if I had seen the &quot;post&quot; on general.  I replied something along the lines of &quot;that would be &quot;the real female spellfyre fuzzypuppyshit who pretended she was single just died of cancer she didnt tell me about until 3 days ago&quot; post from &quot;her&quot; &quot;husband&quot;?&quot;  Honest to God, if it's verifiable, I'll toss another $25 memorial at the ACS in her name.  I've just seen it happen too many damn times that the story (be it death, divorce, whatever) is a scam because someone is mad at someone else.<br>

<br>
If this story does indeed to turn out to be true you have my deepest sympathies.  However,  I found it hard to fathom that a woman with a husband and 3 children would leave those she loves in complete darkness with little time to make preparations and hide from them the seriousness of such an illness.  There are cancers that can show minimal outside effects (with treatments) however if her cancer was that progressed, that widely dispersed and to such a degree it was untreatable or unoperable ... I again find difficulty in seeing her symptoms would not have been noticable by those she was with.  Cancer ravishes the body and causes great pain.  At her stage her illness should have been very apparent, even if not cureable .. they would undoubtly given her multiple medications to subside any pain or minimize her symptoms as best possible.  She would have had a huge extent of doctor visitations upon the discovery of her cancer and most likely hospitalization. <br>
<br>
As upsetting as someone questioning this might be (if indeed truthful), I found nothing demeaning or harmful in what Vehnn posted.  He simply asked for verification.  <br>
<br>
If this is untruthful I find it to be truly sick.  Cancer is nothing to be taken lightly.  To use such a thing for whatever reason and to upset many people on a lie is &lt;place various derogatory words here&gt;.<br>
<br>
Im sure I'll get flamed for this by some but the truth is a great deal of that story leaves itself open to question.  I am simply stating some of the things that I could see that would lead to such questions.  Maybe a great deal was left out of the post...or mistated.  Again if this is true, you and your family are in my prayers and I am sorry for your lose.  My father heads cancer research and surgical pathogy at Johns Hopkins, I see and hear the tragedy of cancer often and can only imagine what those close to a cancer patient have to endure.  I would wish it on no one.<br>

That's the nail in the proverbial coffin if ever I've seen one - it could have been privately verified by a well known member of the community without releasing any personal information to the general public.<br>
<br>
In my ~8 years of online gaming experience, I've read a lot of these stories.  Not a single, solitary one has ever been verified as the truth in my experience.  Anything from leukemia to AIDS to cancer - most of these people are still alive and well, but they did get a lot of sympathy for a while.  You'd think that a wife and mother would make some sort of provisions for her children (well, they could be grown, but then she'd most likely make provisions to see them before the end, and grandkids aren't mentioned so I doubt this).<br>
<br>
When September 11 happened, we all worried about people we knew in the NY area, like you Samir.  We knew you lived in NY because people had called and spoken to you, comments you'd made offhand during the course of conversation, and stuff like that.  Things like that lend truth to the situation - stories like the one BH blessed us with just make my BS detector beep at a high pitch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usamirthestinky.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samir the Stinky</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/31/01 2:36:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=675.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Out of respect - </span><hr size=1> Nice comparison Kyrana.

 not to be rude or disrespectful ( though i have to admitt it is my nature ) but after seeing a couple of people in the community die every server for over a few years and later finding out there were no genuine deaths makes my eyes tend to glaze over on these things.<br>
 <br>
 people do alot of things for attention.. whether its fake death messages with long contrived stories or the long drawn out quit posts where they come back a few days later ( no im not talking about anyone in particular, just in general ). i mean really, if you want some attention go burn someones house down dont prey upon peoples sympathy.<br>

<br>
We have a *female* character, who just happened to be played by a couple, although the &quot;woman&quot; playing it purported to be single.<br>
<br>
This &quot;woman&quot; dies of cancer, leaving her husband and three children.   Yet with all the emotional grief that he must be going through, and the trauma that his kids face, and all the arrangements that must be made, he makes sure to hop online a  messageboard and say &quot;Oh, hey, if you see Spellfyre, it's actually me now, so don't hit on me and stuff&quot;.  That's his priority?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, if you have suffered a loss like he supposedly has, or has watched someone struggle with cancer (ESPECIALLY near the end), it's NOT something that you just don't notice.  And hopping on a messageboard to let people know that it's you playing her character now is just NOT much of a priority.<br>
<br>
Was she not getting any kind of therapy?  Was she not visiting the doctor?  As Caylan said, there are a lot of arrangements that need to be made, both before and after.<br>

I've been on the Internet 10+ years.  Anyone who has and has been involved in chats/gaming/muds/etc. KNOWS this story; we've seen it all too often.  There's a slim chance it is true, but extremely slim, when you look at how convenient all the aspects of it are.<br>
<br>
If they guy wasn't playing the character anymore, I might believe it.  At the very least, his deception would not be so grevious, as he wouln't be using the gain from it, and it would make the story more believable.<br>
<br>
It is possible for someone to have cancer without symptoms, to not tell anyone until the very end, to die suddenly... but it's very unlikely, particularly when it also happens to be half of a couple that secretly played a character in classic &quot;mangina&quot; fashion.  And this is coming from someone who has crossed the gender barrier online before.  I know what it's like.  I also know the stories others will resort to to cover their tracks when things get out of hand.<br>

Actually, duh, I can find out.<br>

Okay, checked the security log, the post was deleted by EZBoard.  Looks like there was some corruption somewhere:<br>

There was about 150 of those entries, all from forum 5 (R&amp;F) and forum 8 (The Gallery), and they all deleted within 3 seconds of each other.  /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uraolfcq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/1/02 3:57:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=675.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I said it all before</span><hr size=1> Ive grouped with quite a few dual played people over the couple years I played, and it is usually pretty obvious when one person takes over for another, so I guess Id ask the people who played with her/him whatever.  Course I guess how would I know if it was too good to tell ect but it just seems like youd be able to tell most of the time, and really if you couldnt, wouldnt that be pretty weird in itself, theyd have to be like triyng to sound alike.<br>
<br>
That being said the 1st post just seems extremely fishy to me, people dont just &quot;die of cancer&quot; in a vaccum, the like see doctors, ect, and that costs money, people arent &quot;in the dark&quot; about it if they live together and share finances.  To say nothing of physical changes.  To say even less of how damn convienent this would make it to stop playing a mangina^^  Bleh I hate that Im this cynical and even tho I saw an (apparently) genuine case of eq player death less than a year ago, I just have to call bullshit on this :/<br>
