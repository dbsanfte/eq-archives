This is gonna hurt</span><hr size=1> Ok, There is no telling how many toes I'll step on with this one, or how many friends feet they will connect to. But here goes.  Some of you may have seen &lt;Dragoon Warriors&gt; running around.  Windjammer, 51 bard; and I, 41 monk; were the original founders.  After a while WJ grew bored with leadership and passed it on to me.  I did numerous things for the guild.  Members, a website, organization, you name it.  Over time i also became bored.  So i passed leadership to Scaeth Bloodreign, which seemed to be a great choice at the time.  I decided to remain a regular guildie.  Not even an officer.  Recently I applied and was accepted (thank god) into Guardian Alliance, this pissed Scaeth off horribly.  So I gave her control of the site and left.  She then decided to start causing me and my fiance problems.  Constant tells to my fiance about things she had &quot;heard&quot;.  anyway, I've made a short story horribly long. Point is, today she sends my fiance a tell saying &quot;guildmember_01 is an officer now, don't you wish we would let you into the guild?&quot;  And now the flame (gonna try to delete the cuss words) what kind of immature ***** sends a tell like this? My fiance doesn't even want in this guild anymore.  I did EVERYTHING for this guild. Now most of the people (and I emphasize MOST) treat me and my finace like dog piss.  This is begining to sound like the LoP (is that right?) post.  I'm going to stop now.   I'm pissed, you don't care.....oh well.  Night folks.  BTW, her husband in-game and fiance in RL Falgoth Bloodreign is not only one of the best players I know, but also a wonderful person.  Hope he can either look over this or not even see it..

More often than not people are bitter about losing someone and feel them leaving the guild is leaving the friendship that was developed.  There are other reasons, but that one seems to be most prevalent.  I won't comment on what kind of person this Scaeth is, but I would imagine that losing someone who has put so much into the guild isn't going to make them happy.  If it has become too much for both of you...there is always the nifty /ignore feature. <p><center><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117254">Ciffu Longwinded</a></b><br><I>The Token Monkey</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ulalalronfakindeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lalalronfakindeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/02 2:45:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh!

This is gonna hurt</span><hr size=1> The below are a general series of observations<br>When someone leaves a Guild there is always that bad taste in the mouth of those remaining that maybe I/we weren't good enough. In reality though its very stressful to leave your friends and move on to (hopefully) something that will give you greater enjoyment in the future. And that's what it is about, having fun, executing that perfect pull and having a group that works in harmony.<br>People feel differently about their Guild. Some want it to grow to some Uber group of 60s as soon as possible. Others prefer a smaller family sort of feel. Some will play 15 hours a day and want their epic NOW. Others want to grow to 60 with others and helping others. Some View levels as obstacles to be rushed through while others want to watch the scenery. Its almost impossible that one guild can be all of these things. So people leave for something that (they hope) more closely matches their ideal Guild.<br>Now when people leave a guild it sometimes diminishes the direction I (I'll use the personal pronoun here as an example) feel the Guild should be going. Its only a small step from disappointment to hurt to anger and generally its directed against those those leaving. Now this is selfish, as I wish them to change their actions so that I will not be inconvenienced in what I expect the guild to do. Angry and Hurt people say stupid things to those who were once friends.<br><br>So what does this big ramble mean?<br>1. Don't accept claims made by people who are angry at you as Gospel<br>2. If you aren't enjoying the GAME have a break<br>3. Wish people well when they change their direction and keep their friendship (and don't make them feel worse)<br>4. Watch what you say in guild say. Never be personal or take something personally<br>5. A harmless comment or advice can be construed as critical if you want it to be<br>6. Its easier to believe others are wrong then that you are wrong<br>7. Its natural to expect others to feel as you do (but they probably don't)<br>8. Generosity is about you. If you feel good about being generous do it. But expect nothing back and you will be (occationly) pleasantly suprised.<br>9. You have an Ignore function. Use it<br>10. People invest in their guild. Don't be surprised if you can't withdraw your investment<br>11 Reread 5 if you feel I'm being critical of you!!!!<br>12 Someone leaving the guild is not about you.

This is gonna hurt</span><hr size=1> Falgoth Bloodreign here, Ok, First off, I still consider Lala a very good friend of mine, despite this, But, I must defend my fiancee..  what this all amounted to was a HUGE misunderstanding...  and normally as to be fair and keep away from vauge heresay I would not use real names but you did have to post her Toon name in the flame..<br>and if this is goin to be aired in PUBLIC, let them hear the other side of this and have a little more to judge from than just what you've heard (I do trust what Lala has heard.. just not the source)<br>First off let me say.. this is a GAME.. I just wanted to have fun, but we all did make real life friends, and for some reason, real life .. dare i say.. drama.. resulted.<br>Ok, here goes...  Guild started by Windjammer (great guy).. left for guardian alliance (awsome guild).   No prob so far..<br>Lala takes over (dragoon warrirors)  with his fiancee Sweetpeaches..  They share same computer so they are never on at same time.. but no problems.<br>Lala does an awsome job with guild.. very friendly and works very hard on web site..   About two weeks latter.. He tells Scaeth and I that he no longer wants to be guild leader.. so he hands it to Scaeth (who only NORMALLY wouldnt play EQ.. )  It was right AFTER he gave guild to Scaeth that Sweetpeaches thru a HUGE fit.. She wanted control of the guild and because Lala didnt give it to her.. she quit the guild and her character (quitting the character might have been for a diff reason..)  She created a new bard called Windhammer and joined Fae Vicus (something) Everything goes fine for a while.. then one day he says in guild chat.. &quot;hey has anyone seen Guardian Alliance's web site?&quot;     .. that got me curious..  I send him a tell asking him if he was interested on leaving the guild?  His response was &quot;No way.. i'm a Goon for life bro..&quot;    My response &quot;I was just wondering .. because so many people here really like you and if you just up and left moral would really suffer..  and if you would want to join a bigger guild give us a good warning about it..&quot;   Lala said &quot; I'm not leaving&quot;     ... Next day he had Guardian Alliance tags on..   Does it matter.. not at all.. I still grouped with him.. and we still had tons of fun ...  <br>Ok.. now on this end of the game.. Scaeth and I play on computers right next to each other.. 99.9% of the time we look at each other's screens.. mainly so i can keep track of her manna... I pretty much know everything that someone tells her or that she sees..   It starts with Windhammer (Lala's fiancee aka Sweetpeaches) sending tells for us to powerlevel her..  then its tells on how $*%*#@  Fae Vicus (her guild at time)  is...  because they are always talking about their personal lives..     THEN.. oh and i love this....  She tells Scaeth how HAPPY her and Lala are in real life and that how she wishes that  Scaeth and Falgoth can someday be as happy...                  <br> uhhh... ok?   wtf is that about?<br>So then.. Yesterday I log in and talk to Lala, He tells me someone said that I was leaving the guild for some other guild.. heh i wasnt aware of that..<br>then he tells me some.. (hint) told him that Scaeth and I were fighting in RL  ..   hummm we werent happy??    OMG if that that ever happened.. if we ever had a hint of arguement on EQ... its EQ OFF BABY!!!!<br>So now.. lets play connect the dots and where do you all think these things are being generated?   Love is blind bro.. but never underestimate the power of a PO'd woman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>I NEVER SAW scaeth type anything of the sort of what you've seen.. it is so FAR out of her character its not even funny..<br><br>could she have... sure..  but i would really recommend checking your sources (COUGH windhammer/sweetpeaches)before posting on a public board and throwing names around  <br>Lala I trust what you've heard.. but not where you've heard it...<br><br>Sorry.. I have to stick up for my woman, She's a wonderful person for putting up with me playing EQ .. shes awsome for playing along side me.. I dont want her to leave the game for some misunderstanding..<br><br>Added note: Lala is still a good friend.. even if i'm now on his /ignore list..<br><br>Falgoth Bloodreign<br>&lt;Dragoon Warriors&gt;<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uscaeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scaeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(3/26/02 3:04:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Message From Scaeth, Leader of the Dragoon Warriors</span><hr size=1> Greetings,<br><br>I would like to take a moment to apologize to all who have become entangled in this situation via these message boards. Honestly, this appears to be a small personal grudge between a few people, that became inflamed and grossly exaggeratted by too many open mouths and not enough open ears. <br>As guild leader, I take full responsibility for this mess, and it is my deepest hope that no other dragoon warriors reputation should take the fall, for all who carry our guild tag are worthy of it, and worthy of knowing. I have some really wonderful guild members, and they dont deserve their reputation to be marred by something like this, especially over a messy grudge. <br>For the record, since reign has been passed to me ( something I didnt just jump at mind you, I took 2 weeks to decide, Lalalron knows that is 100 percent true.) I have worked harder than ever to keep the guild going, to keep what members we had at that point still together. And since then, I have increased our number by at least 10, I learned HTML just so I could enhance our website, and as far as I have seen, have earned respect and wonderful new friendships both within and outside of the guild. I took the promotion to guild leader, only because I would not see the guild disperse for lack of morale after two leaders had passed ( and I dont hold it against them, its a game guys) I would n ot see these good people guildless, so I took on the job. And I was completely scared. I still am, because I know I dont know everything, I havent been playing for 4 years, I'm not &quot;uber&quot; like some. But in being guild leader, I have learned the most important lesson in leadership - I am nothing, if not for my guild members. And if that means going halfway across norrath for a corpse run/rezz, or taking the brunt of a misunderstanding so that my guild members can play in peace, so be it.<br><br>In retrospect, I hope that all of this can be cleared up in personal chat and email, instead of multiple public postings, for really it is between only a few people. Again I apoligize for this drama, and I hope whenever you see a Dragoon OR a Guardian Alliance member, you take a moment to say hi , for both are honorable and worthy of mention. <br>Thank you very much for your time,<br><br>Scaeth Bloodreign - Leader of the Dragoon Warriors<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utokenmonkey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TokenMonkey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#333333>(3/26/02 5:50:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Message From Scaeth, Leader of the Dragoon Warriors</span><hr size=1> I have to say that this is probably the nicest flame on both sides that I have ever seen.

These things WERE said to Windhammer/Sweetpeaches.  The person that said them OBVIOUSLY has some issues. ill leave her outta this.  I hold no grudge over Scaeth of Falgoth because i trust and believe what they tell me.  And i retract some of the rude things i posted earlier.  I know how some of you folks hate to see flames end in a good way, but I ask that this post be delted due to the fact that i reacted hastily and rashly.
