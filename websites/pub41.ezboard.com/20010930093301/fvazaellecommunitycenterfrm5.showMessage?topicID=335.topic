It only makes you sound childish and naive.<br>
<br>
I read post after post, &quot;blah blah blah I'm a wonderful person and you level 60s are such asses because I only play this game for friends and all you care about is loot!&quot;<br>
<br>
Why do you come to the conclusion that a guild only cares about loot? Let me guess, because guild A doesn't help guild B, and will even step all over eachother to get their way? Let's create a little imaginary situation here...<br>
<br>
*You're with your friends, a group of you, you know eachother well and hang out all the time. You're walking down the street with your group, and there's another group of people nearby. You only know these people in passing, they don't mean much to you compared to who you are with now. Both groups of people see a pile of money laying in the middle of the street....chances are you are going to make damn sure you and your crew gets that cash before any lamos you don't give a shit about give their paws on it, let alone HELP THEM take it*<br>
<br>
Yes, there is LOTS of friendship on this server, but it is mostly inside guilds, just like circles of friends IRL....you may hang with people from other circles...but you back your crew when the time comes =P<br>
<br>
So you play this game for friends only? Then why even level? Seems to me you can have just as much fun chatting in Crushbone on an Orc Trainer raid as you can on a Temple of Veeshan raid....something doesn't add up here. <br>
<br>
The insentive to level is loot and new experiences in game...not friendship...stop jading yourself to think otherwise.<br>
If you play Everquest and level to 50 solely for the purpose of interacting with online friends, maybe it's time you examine your social life away from the keyboard...because it takes MASSIVE amounts of time to level 50+, and I see a lot of people that have 50+ chars ranting about how they play this game to shoot the breeze with friends and care nothing about loot. Maybe you should pay more attention to reality, and makes some friends you have access to outside your house.<br>
<br>
Seriously, I have RL for my friends...but IRL I can't kill someone and take their watch with a group of my buddies...any way you cut it, EQ is a game with challenges, objectives and insentives, thats what makes a game fun. <br>
Chances are if there was no online chatting at all, I'd still play a game like EQ, RPGs are fun.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, yes, friendship is a LARGE part of this game, but stop saying you only play for that one reason, you and I both know that is total BS. And please, if that is why you play, stop announcing it to the world, because I really don't want to hear it anymore. OK you're a great person, want a trophy? <br>
<br>
Wumple's final thought, cut the holier than though bullshit. Thanks for your time.<br>

Here's the problem with your scenario - you say 'both groups of people see . . . money' hence both are aware that it is there.  Which group is willing to forgo common decency and respect for others, and is willing to have a fistfight/gunfight for the money?  Not my group.<br>

And no, nobody's post hits close to home, I am just sick of my friends who happen to be level 60s getting picked on time after time for being &quot;loot whores&quot;. I've never actually been accused of it myself, eventhough I am probobly one of the best equipped druids on the server at the moment...Maybe it's because I don't wear a guild tag, it seems that having a certain &lt;blah blah&gt; beside your name automaticly draws a lot of hate in your direction.

<br>
There are too many zealots on this server.  People who want everyone else to respect their philosophies and ideas, but belittle others for playing the game in the way they choose, in a way which is fun for them.<br>
<br>
Despite the claims that IV members play only for loot, I can tell you that it's the opposite.  I've been in a lot of guilds during my EQ life, of all shapes and sizes, and I can tell you that In Virtue is the closest guild I've been in, and has by far the coolest people.<br>
<br>
Again I say, people play this game for a variety of different reasons.  As long as they respect the rules of the game, the way you play is no better or worse than the way/reason anyone else plays.<br>

<br>
Yes, there is nothing wrong with being loot oriented, and yes the rules of the game are very hands off, but when a guild publically advocates one set of rules and then reverses those rules so they can get 3 or 4 bits of equipment while ruining 50 or 60 other's folks nite, they have passed the bounds of what anyone would call resonable behavior.  Everyone likes loot, some just take it too far.  <br>
