OBSESSED. He thought Terris, sensing we were coming for her by tapping into Ake's dreams while he plotted her takedown, arranged for a likeness of Riverdane to throw him off. Fortunately, we never even saw it till it was all over, 'cause I think Ake would have lost it had he seen it. Ever since the Fear thing during End Game, he was on an anti-River kick, down to warning against us attending the funeral, nice try, and actually celebrating with some of River's political enemies when Razor's Edge was disbanded afterward. It was an ugly side of him, but that was between him and River, normally he's not as bad as his public image sometimes presents, and he IS a damned good raid leader.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the statue came back with us after we defeated Terris. The news travelled fast that we had taken out the Goddess of Nightmares, even had we wanted to hide the fact that we took out a goddess, things of that scale don't go unnoticed long. But the statue is something we kept quiet. Some, like me, suspected what you've confirmed just by being here: the statue wasn't created by Terris to taunt Akethadar, but actually taken by her from a memorial. I have to admit, with my schedule lately I haven't been to the river in Kithicor, so I had never seen that you had put one up. But I had a feeling you were the one, and I've been dreading the day one of our people slipped with the tongue and you came looking for it. I'm so sorry Cami, I was mortified; I didn't know what to do, and I'm more than a little embarrassed it wasn't me who told you about it, but....how can I apologize enough? It was my job, you know, on the line. Work for bards is hard enough to find, especially with the pay as good as it...<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I'm drifting. The statue came back to the guildhouse, and Ake had Quarken place it in his private chambers. Then, rather than attend the post-raid party, Ake just locked himself up with it. I was busy with the rest of the guild, and I'll have to admit, I was getting a buzz on. It's not every day you take out a god. And suddenly, Akethadar sends for me.<br>
<br>
So, there I am, head swimming, when the maid ushers me into the room. Akethadar is in his training outfit, covered with sweat. One of the lounge's pianos has been wheeled into the room in a corner. And Ake's knuckles are bleeding, dripping onto the floor. I mean really beat up. And his eyes are sort of flat, odd, but not too odd for Ake. He gets that look when he's heavy in planning or just before a raid moves. People say he's a little crazy, his brains scrambled from all the rezzes when he pulls, but it's not that...people don't know him like I do. He's just very very focused. I see you don't agree, but like I said, you have to work close with him like I do to understand it. I'll stop singing his praises, this is something we'll never agree on....<br>
<br>
So he's bleeding all over the marble floor, and I'm standing there, partially wasted from too much ale. All I'm thinking about is going back to the party a little and getting some good smoke, and then passing out in my room. And Ake points to piano and asks me to play something classical. So I do. What do you say when your boss tells you to play? You just play, so I played.<br>
<br>
As I begin, Ake starts circling the statue, like one of those big cats from Iceclad. Round and round he circles, breathing evenly, eyes closed, but feet still guiding him in a perfect circle. You can tell he's getting into the music, and I have to tell you, playing it, I watched him, and I felt hypnotized, watching him circle like that. I think we were both hypnotizing each other. I don't know...<br>
<br>
Then suddenly, like a snake, Akethadar takes a swing at the statue, right into River's face. CRACK. I heard bones crunch in Akethadar's fist, and the statue's nose splits open a new wound on his knuckle, spraying blood onto the statue's face. I stop playing, it's obvious Ake just broke his hand.<br>
<br>
PLAY, he says. I think I mumbled something about him needing a cleric, but he just fixes me with that flat look. PLAY he repeats, so I do.<br>
<br>
Now I'm feeling really uncomfortable, but he starts that even circle again, and I see his muscles loosening. He's leaving this bloody trail as he walks around the statue, ringing it in red. And then, again with no warning, he plants and kicks to the statue's chest. Nothing, the statue doesn't even budge, so much so that Ake is thrown off balance and lands on his ass.<br>
<br>
Then he goes nuts, getting up, going into some crazy monk posture and goes to town on the statue, pummelling, flailing, like a wild man. And all the while I'm scared out of my wits, trying to keep playing to calm him down or something. I even try using my magic to soothe him, but nothing is working. And meanwhile, the statue is unyeilding, and blood is all over the room, as Ake practically cuts himself to ribbons. It's splattering everywhere, the bed, the piano everywhere. Ake is swinging wildly, and missed the statue, and puts his broken fist THROUGH the stone wall. Cami, I don't know what the hells you had that statue made of, but it was harder than granite. And seeing his hand in the wall and the statue unbroken, Akethadar just redoubled his effort. I don't know which was more unbroken, the statue or his rage. Finally, after the blood started getting on ME, I couldn't take it anymore. I just stopped playing and ran out; I don't even think Ake noticed. I found Aamedor and quietly sent him to take care of him, and then went to my room and washed the blood off of me and passed out. The next day I saw Akethadar, and Aamedor had done the job, he seemed healed. Ake didn't say anything to me, like it hadn't happened, and I wasn't about to bring it up. For the next few days we didn't see Akethadar around the guildhouse; he stayed holed up in his room. But he didn't call for me. Aamedor I did spot heading that way several times during that time. Ake's maid quit near the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is....horrifying.&quot; Cami said, finding her voice. &quot;All that hate....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Akethadar is an intense man.&quot; Katarin said, as if that explained it. &quot;Quite honestly, I was freaked out, but not surprised. He and River had a lousy past, and Akethadar treats all of his enemies the same, without mercy. It's just that Akethadar wanted to split that stone, it was a matter of pride, and even in death, River defied him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille smiled without mirth. &quot;Yeah, that was River, he could get a rise out of a corpse.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But...&quot; Katarin said, &quot;All that craziness aside, that's not the bad part....&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille just stared at her, willing her to go on.<br>
<br>
And on she went. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27>Artistic Endeavors</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
