I post to ask for some input in regards guilds on our noble server.  I am but a humble and frail cleric, servant of the Light, but I am questing to become 60 without being guilded.  I am finding (as you might imagine) it a difficult challenge.  <br>
<br>
I love the solo life I live, being free to roam, in service to all, indebted to none.  I know that eventually I will probably have to join a guild, especially for my epic (/sigh).  Do not get me wrong, I have friends in MANY guilds and the people are indeed strong, generous and wise.  My problem is not with any individual but rather with the politics that exist in all guilds.  It takes but one or two individuals in a group setting to ruin a camp, the same goes for guilds I am sure.<br>
<br>
What I seek is input from those people who can be as unbiased as possible and give me a little advice on guilds that are as &quot;undemanding&quot; as possible.  By that I mean guilds that require no set time played, that are easy going and above all are kind and generous to all players regardless of them being guilded, and regardless of level.  Please post advice / experiences so that I might learn about the mighty guilds on Vazaelle.  If I can, I will remain unguilded, but I am beginning to have doubts, hence this post.<br>
<br>
While I have this post up I wish to take a moment to thank the mighty Epic Heroes.  For without their help I would surely not be the level I am.  In particular thanks to Kajira, Eriul, Clarrissa, Methodor.... heck, aaaall of Epic Heroes are my friends.  Also thanks to some others in other guilds... Cowcrust of In Virtue for taking time once to chat, Diabolous (ack, cant remember your guild), Tamlyn the mighty... and all others for their continuing support of this frail and weak cleric.  Sorry friends if I missed any of you.  <br>
<br>
Be well friends,<br>

<br>
Storm Legion is a guild of casual players. Average guild level is mid forties currently. Highest is a 57, lowest about level 10. Casual players so there is no set time anyone plays, but we do try to do a raid per weekend and pickup groups nightly. Several of us have begun the long process of doing our epics, but no one anywhere near completion.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you in your goal, but if you seek a casual guild, look us up.

<br>
I have known you for awhile, yet not too closley.  You rezzed me once, and you had to travel a great distance to do it.  Any guild you join will be forever changed for the better.  I started out as a solo player, thus I chose to be a druid to kite, quad, whatever.   Got me to lvl 51 pretty easily, with some grouping on and off unguilded thru level 42 or so.  <br>
I joined a guild to be able to talk to my friends and people I care about.  Frankly, we hardly ever group together, because atm I am too high in level.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to other higher level friends, not in my guild, I can be guilded with my friends and still travel the lands grouped and having fun.  I believe you can make it to level 60 unguilded and I think you can get your epic without actually being IN a guild.  It will just take some strong friends and major help, which throughout Norrath, You undoubtedly have.<br>
<br>
If you are looking to join a guild, join some friends.  If you want to stay unguilded, put me on the list of people to help you get your epic.<br>

  Your are going about it the right way though, some guilds want your time with them. Some are more laid back. Find the guild that matches you, but diffenitly give it a try. Nothing more entertaining to be in a boring camp listening to a guildmate talk about something funny they just did. I wouldn't wait till 60. <br>

Just like to add ... I've seen a few Guilds out there with nice people .. Epic Heroes */wave Buhamut* Eternal Advocates, Storm Legion *Gluas doesn't play anymore does he?* And many more ...

I don't know much about SL or VD (never want to know anything about VD except how to avoid it *chuckles*), but my rogue was in the Order and left when I got bored playing her and made alts on two different servers plus a couple alts on this server.<br>
<br>
One of which is Ristin, my shaman who will form his own guild someday.  Anyhow...<br>
<br>
What I do know of the Order, is that they are a great, friendly roleplaying guild.  They have buff/first-aid stations all the time.... and are sponsoring a serverwide gnaked gnome race sometime in the future.  I think they're still working out the plans for that.<br>
<br>
And as I said, they are heavily into roleplaying.  Just check out their message board.  <br>
<br>
Tempest of Fate is the remnant of another guild that had to disband when the leader was unable to log on for quite some length of time.  I'm not to clear on all the history yet.<br>
<br>
Right now, Tempest is a loose roleplaying-casual guild.  Not enough members online at one time to do much, but we are raiding the Chancellor this Saturday sometime.  I wish my shaman was high enough to join them... it'd be great to get the Jade Chokdai Prod.<br>
<br>
Those are some of the more laid back choices.  And always go read about the guild and membership requirements on their website if they have one. (Tempest and Order have no requirements, but do like to see their members online semi-often and able to make a weekend raid or two.)<br>

There are a LOT of good guilds out there.  It ain't easy making it to lvl 60 on 3 hours per day, but it's doable.  You may find life at lvl 60 is a bit boring since there's not a lot to do other than raids and due to what is (in my opinion) sloppy game design, that means a lot more than 3 hours per sitting.  (for the love of all that is holy, if you disagree with me start a seperate post rather than turn this one into a flame, k thnx).<br>

Epic heros, regression, revealed all have good people, they raid a fair amount but seem fairly laid back.

Your words are the kindest ever heard by these frail cleric ears.  I have never been so humbled.  From the Dreadlands to Lavastorm, from The Hole to Mistmoore, you have been a great help and more importantly a true friend to me.  I have enjoyed your humor, your laughter and your kindness to me, especially when I was doubting my skill as a healer.  I will never forget your comment to the mean player with whom I have had some trouble.  &quot;See this whip?  Don't make me use it on you&quot;.  was what she told him.   hehe, my defender.<br>

I am forever in your debt, forever your friend and always shall Epic Heroes be my unguilded home.  Thank you all for the wonderful comments in this post.  I feel a little guilty for not joining Kajira now after her post *sniff*.  People like Kajira are what make this game so truly wonderful and fun.  Should any member of Epic Heroes, or anyone else for that matter, ever need the services of a frail but dedicated healer, they need only let me know.  If I am not grouped or otherwise indisposed, I will travel the length of Norrath to help you.  Tis my sacred duty after all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think the attitude, way of life, and raiding, and the &quot;free for all&quot; mode of language, seem very fun to be in that environment thereof (worded wrong).  Dont hate them just because they are the uberest guild on da server and like to have tons of fun (i know raiding and hangin out with friends is a blast)  <br>
<br>
But also, just like to say about Robaz, dont feel rushed into getting into guilds.  Raids might be tempting, but where is the fun in one if you dont enjoy the people's attitudes and personality i know i see a few raids like Regression does where they accept guests.  Get in on a few raids with various guilds, read their charters on their website, and find one that tells about what you like to do, and what you like in a guild.  I know i joined VD cause i knew a ton of people from before in it whom i know are very cool and i seemed to made a good choice, cause most of them are quite nice and been in VD for a while.  <p><BR>(51 Cavalier) Bauldor (Human) {Vengeful Dragons}<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/unokraenom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nokraenom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/28/01 1:00:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guild advice</span><hr size=1> What Sly said.  I cannot agree enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even with a &quot;more laid back&quot; guild, you will have little time that is your own as a cleric even when not raiding.  There is always a mini quest, almost an epic quest, and of course always always a rezz request.  If you aspire to be level 60 in a reasonable time frame, do not join a guild until you are there or almost there.  Get to level 56 at least before making a decision, at that stage you will likely have the choice of guild that bests suits you if you have skills and havent trashed your rep.<br>
