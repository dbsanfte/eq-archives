 This is for Talandra. I've said as much to you in game (god forbid we deal with issues one on one *gasp*).<br>
These message boards are a nasty place and it can be easy to  let yourself be drawn into the feeding frenzy and end up posting to the flames. If you do post to them, which she has, then expect the flak because it will always blow up in your face. If you can't handle people deriding you then stay away from these flames because they paint a target on you. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you cried about it, but this(message board warfare) is a game all in itself and when you play it you have to do so expecting to be bitten. You chose to hit enter when you added your voice to the flames so I have zero sympathy for you. I fully expect people to bite back, so when I post here I do so very guardedly and try not to do so in anger. <br>

If you are around IV people or read their boards you will notice they insult each other waaaay more than anyone else.  <br>
<br>
If you aren't insulted in some form by them then you don't rate.  Its like a bunch of brothers who can't show affection in the normal ways. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Herder

Take a look back on this thread Alyen, around oh page 5 and your 20ish response out of what? 50?  What do you &quot;prove&quot; about me on this thread?  Hmm lets see, you accused me of talking smack in OOC, which I do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do.  I inform you of this and you accuse me again.

<br>
Talandra, I am sorry if you have taken personal offence to things that have been said to you.  Being a female, I think sometimes I take things too personal, so I know it happens.<br>
<br>
Rants just dont help most situations.  I have seen ppl say &quot;wow I wrote the most awsome rant&quot;, then I would go and read it and say what an ass they sounded like.  When writing a rant, you always think it looks great.  Thats also what the ppl who write the rants you laugh at thought while writing it.<br>

We'll never change, it just won't happen, I (and most of IV eventhough I won't speak for them =P) will always be an elitest asshole in game, it's just how I am. =)  I think it comes along with the guildtag, we still have a few people to corrupt, but they'll come around. ^^<br>
<br>
We've had a few people leave in the past for not being able to deal with it, eventually people will either get used to it or leave, whichever, it's the best for everyone.<br>
<br>
We actually were talking about this in guildchat today, we are sooooooo much more brutal to eachother than we are to out of guild people.  Like we'll get our tank order set up and Samir will be listed as like #2 and everyone will just laugh cause we know it's a joke.  =)  I seriously doubt he takes it personally, anyone who can't laugh at themself...well I can't think of what they should do but they should be able to!! ...I mean seriously look at all that goat shit that gets posted about me on our mb, DO YOU REALLY THINK I FUCK GOATS?  Do you think it makes me mad about them joking about it?  Why would it, like that video posted that was funny as hell, it's a great laugh.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Its like a bunch of brothers who can't show affection in the normal ways.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is so true, for any number of reasons, we are in many ways a big family.  And, yeah, I do think it's a way of showing affection (although, no, it doesn't apply to Alyen eventhough he amuses us).  We're very comfortable with where we are and we love it.  I know if IV broke up 75% of the guild would quit everquest, I know I would.  It just wouldn't be the same in any other guild.  Without IV this game is not worth playing, atleast it isn't to me.<br>
<br>
That's also the reason we have so much fun here replying to these flames against us, we know we're not going anywhere and no matter what everyone posts we're not going to change how we do it, it's getting the rise out of other people like we did Alyen that makes it worth while. =)<br>
<br>
Look through this thread again, he's got like half of the posts, this is what a rants board is about.  Vehnn I think is very much like this too, I don't think he takes any of this shit seriously, but he has so much fun pissing you guys off, look at all the posts about what an ass he is...it's fucking great. ^^ (believe it or not he's not actually an asshole =)) <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

<br>
You were a clueless nobody before you joined IV, now you're a clueless nobody with a guild tag, uber loot you could never have gotten if you weren't carried and a way overinflated feeling of self importance.  Congrats.<br>
<br>
Yah, we went to disc fearless on that talendar raid 'cause we had no bards there and we were getting owned by the aoe fear.  We failed that day, we've succeeded on others and we don't have IV's &quot;leet strats&quot; so vehn, when Menexia finaly figures out what a cock is and finishes blowing me, step up to the plate and take your turn.  I'm sure you at least know how to do it.<br>
<br>
Maggye, /gu != /ooc.  <br>
<br>
And Rhyu, once again... mad props to you and IV for moving so far so fast.  Nobody gonna deny that you guys have insane skills and the drive to put them to use.  But I don't frankly care what you say in guild chat or how hard you rag on each other.  We do the same thing, in guild chat.  To each other.<br>
<br>
Zerric, props to you today for blowing off Rakot.  Laughed my ass off.  I'll give you this, you're consistent in your actions.<br>
<br>
BTW, yes a gm will intervene if you pull aoe mobs onto another group that was already there.  How do I know?  Because when we did tell you not to pull them onto us Jaydrox was there watching (you called him there, not us... he came to give Cassiana her title).  He confirmed for me that pulling aoe mobs on to us would be considered intentionaly training.  He also said that if you guys didn't move in soon he'd ask you to either move in or leave the zone since even he could barely move in the lag caused by having that many people zone in on top of us.  And don't give me the &quot;you gotta expect that when you fight at the zone line&quot; crap 'cause I do expect it.  What I don't expect is for 40 people to zone in and sit there for over an hour waiting for everyone else.  You wanna pass through?  We got no problem with that, even though it means you gotta kill some of the mobs we were camping.  You wanna park 40 people on top of us for an hour creating lag so bad casters can't cast and then pull aoe mobs on top of us?  yah... that I got a problem with.  Situation was handled fine that night.. you obviously had no trouble moving right past us and into the hall, so.. np.<br>
<br>
The situation between PO and IV couldn't get much worse.  You've already pushed the rules about as far as they can go to cause us problems, not a whole lot more you can do but flame, and I got asbestos undewear on so bring on the flame throwers and pack a lunch, 'cause it's gonna be a long day.<br>
<br>
On the other hand you COULD take note of the fact that when IV is right, I come out and say it (like I did earlier in this pos thread).  You could also remind yourself that relations weren't always bad and that while we were never as strong as IV we did on many occasions help IV in ways that we were able to.  You could even come to realize that nobody in PO hates IV because we're jealous... we're just sick of the crap.<br>
<br>
Krimzin ain't on my /ignore list (hell not even Vehn has made it there).  You wanna make things better?  Message me.<br>

I'm pretty sure the fact that in 4 days this post went from an advertisement to a set of rants and flames with almost 200 posts, is a sad statement about the mentality of posters on the VCC.<br>
