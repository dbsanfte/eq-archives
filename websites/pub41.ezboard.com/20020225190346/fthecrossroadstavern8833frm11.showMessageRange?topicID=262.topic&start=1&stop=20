I no longer have much if any stake in the fantasy world of Norrath any longer.  I made a commitment, however, to provide this board as a forum for the server, and I intend to honor that commitment until such time as it no longer needs to exist.<br><br>I have tried to be very hands off with this board, and more or less leave the administrative duties to those a bit more in touch with the game.  But when I get email with the names of lawyers attached, it tends to get my attention.  What in the HELL is going on here, kids????<br><br>Let me be blunt.  I don't really care who likes who, or who stalks who in Freeport, or who dicked who out of 1000 plat. You can rip one another up one side and down the other daily.  But for the love of God, keep the G-A-M-E in perspective.  Do not use this board or Everquest as an extension of your personal vendettas or fetishes in relation to one another!<br><br>For better or worse MY name is on the user agreement that brought this board into existence, and while I am quite confident that my legal culpability in any matters relating to it would be nil, the sheer hassle of dealing with lawyers is way more than I should be asked to contend with!<br><br>So....what is Shaelyn to do?<br><br>1.  Ignore this until some joker in a pinstripe Armani knocks on my door or I get a summons?  <br><br>2.  Ban everyone involved in the issue? (you know who you are)<br><br>3.  Delete the offending threads and try to forget this ever happened?<br><br>4.  Shut down the board forever?<br><br>What is it going to be?

I hate to be a hardass, but I have to be.<br><br>I have been very pleased by the level of support this board has gotten, and 98% of the users have no involvement in this matter.

The most that a lawyer could do is force a court injunction on the post (which would require you to lock it, or even possibly delete the thread).<br><br>Internet law is quite interesting and very undefined (extreme lack of precedence), especially in regards to public areas (IRC, IM, message boards).

If you are going to threaten a civil suit, do so against the individuals that posted (I would assume slander?  verbal abuse?) such remarks.  Threatening the board mods is just plain stupid.  You wouldnt sue Verant if someone in game called you a slut.  You wouldnt sue AT&amp;T if someone called you a slut over the phone.  You wouldnt sue your Internet provider if someone sent you an email calling you a slut.  Capiche?<br><br>Obviously whomever it was didnt talk to their lawyer friend (whom I am going to already assume doesnt do civil suits, no money in it, its a law practice for lawyers that are unable to find a practice doing anything else), or else he/she would have laughed at you to begin with.  Even then, most attorneys wouldnt touch an internet slander (or verbal abuse) case with a 100 ft pole.  You simply dont win them, they are a waste of time and money.<br><br>Completely off topic *cough*.  Does anyone know if someone underage can file a civil suit?  Im uncertain on this point.

Better safe then sorry, ya know?<br><br>I assumed it would be a civil proceeding since I did not see anything that would warrant anything else.  You defer to a lawyer directly for civil proceedings, you do not defer to one (typically) for stalking or threats of bodily harm (in which case you would talk to the police and it is the responsibility of law enforcement to handle the situation).  Harassment and slander are the two civil possibilities I could pinpoint (slander is a tough one, I didnt see any of it to begin with, but Im not a lawyer).<br><br>Either way, you wouldnt bring such a case against a moderator of the message board.  You bring the case against the individual harassing or slandering you.  Again, whomever it is that sent in this threat needs their head examined in a bad way.  They obviously arent fit for community interactions.<br><br>Oops, I said something bad about them.  Guess this thread gets deleted as well and another lawsuit will be brought up.  Dayam, tricky how that works. <p>Sharak'Duom 51 Ghost<br>Keroppi'Duom 60 Warlord</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usharak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sharak</A> at: 12/3/01 5:12:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uelmasoulseer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElmaSoulseer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#333333>(12/3/01 5:59:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: [CENSORED]</span><hr size=1> Yay for free speach! <p><div align=center>(\__/)<BR>(='.'=)<BR>(")_(")<BR></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ushaelynwyldheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShaelynWyldheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poo-Bah</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#333333>(12/3/01 6:04:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://allencaron.com/clients/oldclients/telepad/shae.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More thoughts...</span><hr size=1> It is a strange world in which we live, gang.  Everyday you hear about somebody getting sued for something or another.  Maybe the coffee was too hot at the gas station.  Maybe the loud music rattled the urn containing the ashes of their dearly departed Uncle Elmer off the mantle and caused emotional trauma.  Whatever the case, lawsuits are filed by the truckload every single day.<br><br>When it comes to the internet, the already gray area of civil and criminal liability gets even fuzzier.  Let's all be logical and look at this from a hypothetical standpoint for a moment.  Suppose the litigation in question was filed.  Suppose I had chosen to keep the thread in place after being asked by the litigator to remove it.  What types of things might happen?<br><br>I was not intimately aware of the facts of the dispute in question.  Had a minor been stalked?  Propositioned online?  Had meaningful threats been made?  I saw nothing like that in the thread I personally deleted, but you have to realize that I had NO way of knowing the full scope of this.<br><br>Now, you tell me what is easier and safer for me, as a person, to do.<br><br>1.  Ignore the request to remove the thread and write off the legal issues as many of you are so quick to do? <br><br>2. Delete a more or less meaningless thread, and thus remove any possible liability on the part of myself and my moderators?<br><br>I think any of you that truly value your real life commitments would come pretty quickly to the same conclusion I did.  Is it more important to remove a risk to my personal, real world life or to avoid offending a few posters on a message board that I have sunk a couple hundred bucks of my own cash into?<br><br>I can tell you right here and right now that I place my career, my family, and myself waaaaay over this board.  If you cannot understand that now, I hope someday you will.<br><br>It has been my ongoing policy (supported by my mods and most posters) to forbid ALL personal, real life information from being revealed by a poster about another poster, regardless of intent.  This is called Covering Your Ass..and when minors are involved it becomes ten times more important.<br><br>So, while I take no sides in this dispute, I also do not apologize for the actions of myself or my moderators.  You can post about EQ and the Taliban, and egg cookers, and Jesus Christ for all I care.  But don't do things that place the life, privacy, or security of others at risk.  Simple enough I think.<br><br>Thanks again for all your kind support!<br><br> <p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#0066cc"><tr><center><td bgcolor="#2C522C"><center><strong><font face="Ariel, sans-serif" color="#D0FED0">Shaelyn Feather</font><br><font color="#2CF42C">Grand Pooh Bah of:</font></strong><br><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833" target="_top"><FONT face="Ariel" color="#2CF42C">Crossroads:Raves, Raids, Rants for Zeb Server!</FONT></a><br><strong><font face="Ariel, sans-serif" color="#D0FED0">Requiem of Souls</font></strong></td><td bgcolor="#2C522C"><div align="center"><strong><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/" target="_top"><font face="Ariel, sans-serif" color="#D0FED0">Zebuxoruk</font></a></strong><br><strong><a href="mailto:cbuswell@ascpl.lib.oh.us"><font face="Ariel, sans-serif" size="1" color="#D0FED0">E-mail</a></font></strong></div></td></tr></table> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uraene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Battle Druid, Artist</span><br>  Posts: 452<br> <font color=#333333>(12/3/01 6:15:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ldnews.kyid.net/images/members/raene.jpg HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More thoughts...</span><hr size=1> Will future threads about this person be deleted by you Shae when involving in game matters?<br><br>I do not support inappropriate RL info, and have edited it when brought to my attention.
