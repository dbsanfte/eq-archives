The Plane of Growth raid started better than the last two, with no other guild fighting to be the first one into the Plane. The early time did help with that.  However, the early time meant none of our clerics could make it on time, and we had to wait for them for the break, so we were about an hour late on the actual break.  This total of TWO clerics was to be a problem all day (Thank you Ezrick and Snagor for showing up!).<br>
<br>
We started with 18 people, and ran into the zone.  We got aggroed on the break by a named Unicorn, two Protectors of Growth, and had three more adds during this fight.  During this fight, we had a mage from Balefire and Petr of Kel'Daoine leap into the fray and fight with us as our own adds.  We fought the good fight, and killed the named, both Protectors of Growth, and at least one of the adds before the last of us fell or feigned.  Ezrick managed to camp the 'lucky' way by /quitting out as he knew if he sat down he was gone, so we were able to restart the raid and get enough res'd to handle the next Protector of Growth spawn.  The raid was underway.<br>
<br>
For the next 8 hours we fought, killed, and looted with a total of one death on our side, and a great many of the local inhabitants on theirs.  Temet's chain pulling was amazing, and our clerics rarely if ever hit full mana other than the two 'Bio Breaks' we called.  <br>
<br>
As the day turned to early evening, Ezrick had to leave of extreme lack of sleep, leaving us with just 'The Mighty Snagor ™'.  We luckily managed to convince Yabba to head on over from Thurgadin to join us, so we were going to scrape by with two clerics again.  As was the case all day, our two Clerics did their job extremely well, and two were enough until the end.<br>
<br>
The end consisted of us pondering that we had cleared the entire west half of the zone ( the side that drops boots, wristbands, gloves, and hats ), and the southern half of the east side ( focusing on Breastplates).  The named creatures and treants were halfway cleared, leaving us only the really tough ones that we couldn't take on with only two clerics.  We decided to make the end run all the way around to the NE corner, where more Breastplates and Robes dropped.  This is also the most dangerous section of the zone.  We tried to move in, and got too many adds.  We were down to two clerics and one enchanter, and it was not enough.  We went down and went down hard.  Corpse retrieval is tough in the Plane of Growth, so we had to wait to get someone inside to kite around the Protectors of Growth, before we could start ressing.  Citronella tried this for us admirably, then Muzikal, then Asharp (who was AMAZINGLY kiting at 40 hp for almost 20 minutes!), and finally Talonfist.  During this whole time, the ressing was underway (need more clicksticks), and we were able to get everyone ready to go.  At this point Yabba needed to go and people were getting tired, so we called it a night.  Everyone was able to port out safely.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Notes:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We did GREAT with only two clerics two chanters (one for the last third).  However, as is usual for the Plane of Growth, people started to wane before we hit the big Breastplate and Robe mobs, and some of us casters never got a shot at the mobs that drop our stuff.  WHEN we go back, not if, I plan a new attack.  Since as you'll see below we got a few items that no one could use on the western side of the zone, mostly collected in Thurgadin, I propose this.   Next time we focus ONLY on the east side of the zone.  This means we'd ONLY be fighting mobs that were dropped arms, legs, and breastplates/robes.  This raid would be tougher, we'd need a minimum of 18 people, with a good number of 55+ people, we'd need 3 clerics and 2 enchanters, and we'd need 24-30 people to try for the named treants who have GUARANTEED drops of breastplates or robes.  I plan to talk to Temet to see what a good strategy to do this would be.  If this could be done and done well, I think we'' have a 4-6 hour raid, and we'd see a minimum of 4-6 breastplates and robes.  Sound interesting?<br>
<br>
PS - A HUGE thank you to Scyllithe, who handled all loot and recording for the raid, which allowed the one hour rule to work smoothly, make sure no NO DROP loot rotted, and made sure that everyone there for the duration got at least one nice gem.  The trivia contests for the last few gems were a nice added touch as well. ;-)<br>
<br>
PSS - Thanks also to Citronella who volunteered to be the raid A-hole even though one was not needed, and to Teralor the druid, who helped out as a non-KOS scout and corpse dragger.<br>
<br>
PSSS - I CRY that we had no rogues… look at the loot below.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Spells:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
We didn't have a ton of high level spells as we only got to clear half the Robe/BP area of Growth, and none of the named mobs.  We did however, get Occlusion of Sound for Muzikal, Gift of Insight for Scyllithe, and 13 other spells that were given away as random gifts and helpful bonuses to people's alts and guildmates.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Gems:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Gem drops were good as always in PoG.  Totals were, 8 Blue Diamonds, 6 Diamonds, 5 Jacinths, and 8 Black Sapphires.  Enough that everyone on the raid got at least one gem, and all but three got two.<br>
