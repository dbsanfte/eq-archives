I used to play a character on the Vazaelle server prior to quitting EQ only a few weeks back. I no longer play EQ, I simply browse various forums to keep up to date. But, these have got to be the meanest forums I have EVER visited. I just finished reading the &quot;Honor&quot; post by Akethadar. Now, a lot of you replied to that post with something to the effect of: &quot;Wow Ake, that was funny, LMAO!&quot; Okay, I must be missing something, because I do NOT see how that post was funny at all. What I see is pretty simple: One person wins, another person loses. One side is pretty hurt, the other side gets what they want and puts up a forum post to add insult to injury. <br>
<br>
Now, to be clear, I am not saying PO or RDoF is right or wrong in the matter presented. But, I do not understand why a guild officer in PO felt a need to shame a guild publicly as he did. What was the purpose? It was simply mean, and very low in my opinion. Anyone with some common decency would take the item they got, and move on. Especially a guild like PO, which is unquestionably the second most powerful guild on Vazaelle. What is the purpose of rubbing the RDoF faces in the dirt if you already got the spawned item?<br>
<br>
I guess I will ask Ake personally. Why did you post that? And for others... what was so funny? Do you not see anything wrong with this picture? <br>
<br>
Apparently, everyone believes this incident reflects well on PO. I don't see how a guild can get away with shaming another guild so easily on a public forum. Again, I am not saying one person was right or wrong in the actual situation... but what I don't understand is why Akethadar felt a need to author such a post, when your guild PO won the item anyway. Was it necessary to make RDoF look so bad? <br>
<br>
I may sound biased towards RDoF, but I am honestly not taking sides. And in my opinion, the actually incident is irrelevant to what I am asking. Does anyone think that the &quot;Honor&quot; post was a slight bit necessary? Again, I don't see what was funny. From what I have been told, RDoF was disbanded over the post.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qxired>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2163<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/20/03 3:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2162.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/gonuso-po-images/GaskMask.jpg border =0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PO post etc...</span><hr size=1> And you didn't post this on the already established 'Honor' thread because...?

Absolutely.   Again, this board is here so people can blow off steam (which builds up when mental midgets and drama queens spam you on a daily basis).    Secondly, Akethadar did us all a favor by exposing the retards.   The community wins in both cases.<br>

<br>
Not much of a fan of feeding stupid new-account trolls, but like... I have to say.<br>
<br>
If a guild broke up because of a VCC post, that cracks me the fuck up.  Another favorite of mine is the other day someone tells me that a RDoF member reading my post had a heart attack irl.... like ok... I'm not inhuman, and if someone died, that's sad.  But tell me you dont find it even slightly darkly humorous that they died outright because of a post on a messageboard about their eq guild? (hate to sound callous, but I think the odds of this one being true are fairly low, but wanted to throw it out).<br>
<br>
Nothing on these boards is necessary assfuck, your question wasnt fucking necessary.  This is a board to be mean and cruel and ill-intented, a board meant to cause ire in your enemies and humor in your friends, this isnt a board where &quot;Necessity&quot; comes into play at all sir.  I posted because I wanted to publically shame a guild that wanted to publically shame my guild.  Read the thread if you cant comprehend that.<br>
<br>
I'd say &quot;Dont come here posting trying to get sympathy for some guild that cant even hold itself together past some criticism on a messageboard&quot; but that wouldnt be right, cuz like.. you can post whatever you want here.  That's the point.  Let's see how necessary and right people think your post was.<br>

<br>
But, honestly, it fascinates me, the level of cruelty this board has. I mean, do I need to quote you?<br>
<br>
<br>
Akethadar writes: &quot;This is a board to be mean and cruel and ill-intented, a board meant to cause ire in your enemies and humor in your friends...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry dude, that's wrong. =( And it saddens me people buy into that attitude. <br>
<br>
Akethadar, you prove my point. And my point may be meaningless to people on these boards, but I do want to at least ask about it. I mean, it really is interesting. You are so well respected around here, but at the same time you are truly a sad excuse for decency. I know you do not treat people in real life as you do in game or on these boards or else you would have no friends. You hide behind your name Ake. You are anonymous. You can say the the things you do because you are anonymous. No one knows who, where or what Akethadar is in real life... you can claim you act as you do in EQ in real life Ake, but it can't be, or people would not want to be around you.<br>
<br>
In real life, there is a such thing as acting simply decent. You sir, cannot do that as far as I have seen. I have talked to you in game once before as well, and you carry the exact same attitude. I honestly don't care, because I don't play, but like I said, it is interesting how people here respect you and your guild despite your personality.<br>
<br>
And for others, they immediately rip apart my post. The first two replies to this thread were simply rude. My original post did not invite such. People here are cowards in the truest sense. They hide behind computer screens to let out the nasty personality they can't have around family and friends. You wouldn't talk to a stranger that way... why do it on these boards? I welcome any explanation. And this is not trolling, it is curiosity.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eastenith>eastenith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/20/03 4:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2162.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> meant to say also...</span><hr size=1> Forgot...

And the other orginal replies to my thread... what's with the name calling? I don't dislike you guys. I am actually just stating an observation, and want some serious feedback, I mean maybe there is something I am not getting. But, don't call me retarded. That's not nice. It's cowardly too. You wouldn't call someone retarded in real life who was a stranger. I don't understand... I was simply responding to some things that bothered me in regard to one post as an example. <br>

<br>
You want to talk about decency?  A guild was condemning my guild in shout and ooc everytime they zoned out of spite for a situation in which they were wrong.   They turned this public, not me.  You can come here and talk about how different I must be in real life, but in reality?  I'm a lot less angry, but no less blunt in real life than I am on here.  I call them like I see them.  This has nothing to do with hiding behind an anonymous name, this has to do with using the name most familiar to the community I'm addressing.

That's the point dude.  It's a rants and flames board.  People post here to rant about or flame other players/guilds.  Some people enjoy it, others don't.  If you don't like it, just don't read the boards and they won't bother you.  If you come here and post, expect flaming.  I for one have fun on a rants and flames board, or I wouldn't be here.  I get flamed my share, but I don't care, I just have fun with it.  I laugh at it, flame back, and go about my business.  Basically, I don't care enough about what other people on this board think about me to have it affect me in any way.<br>
<br>
Most other servers have much nastier r&amp;f boards than Vazaelle.  This is one of the most tame, let's all hold hands, nursery school type servers anywhere.  The pvp's of course take it to a whole different level, it would be fun to see you on Rallos for a few months.<br>

<br>
Saalroning - Depositing NPCs near or around others so they train themselves while not breaking any EQ rules.<br>
<br>
There's got to be some more, hmm.<br>
<br>
Krimzining - Propelling a guild through content at a rapid pace emulating a torrent of fire that has too little fuel to burn for any real length of time.<br>
<br>
Mioshing - Purchasing EQ chars/items/plat and then reselling to make a profit.<br>
<br>

 <br>
However, it dawned on me after a few times reading this forum that some of these flames are along the lines some of the more outspoken comedians. I'm sure you can name a few who trash everyone.. they talk about their families, friends and people in the audience. Nothing is sacred.. and it's funny! It isn't meant to be taken seriously and those people who do take offence just don't go back.<br>
 <br>
The other reason this board is so popular ( I think) is because it's a place where people can come to vent, whine, moan ect.  Sometimes people will moan with them.  Sometimes posters get flamed, but either way it's pretty humorous because people are just funny when they are all worked up and red in the face and steam is coming out of their ears.. hehe.. wish I had the knack  but I'm flame illiterate. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
