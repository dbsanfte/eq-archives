Ever been to Kael during a CIW Tormax raid?  Well it was about the same.  Anyways back on the subject.  They move ahead of us, training shit to where telk's corpse was.  One AoA attempted to ninja Telk but died to AE's.  Eventually they all die.  While this is happening we ended up killing part of there train.  They start to do CR.  <br>
Now a leather bracer dropped from their little train that took a few minutes to derail.  Once everything was fine we go look for the leather bracer and it is nowhere to be found.  Hmm a few AoA here also..Gee i wonder where it could of gone.  No one in our guild looted it but there is another guild here...So it's not that great of a loss but just shows how low people can be.  So we keep waiting and waiting for them to get there CR act together, think they onyl had 1 ebayed cleric that lived.  Now we can't pull anything at this point because we are not the bad guys.  We would of just trained there CR.  Personally i wouldn't of minded doing it but we did not.  So anyways we where forced to move camp.  Otherwise we would of had to wait another 30 minutes for them to finally get there act together and move.  So in the long run this whole leap frog bullshit cost us an hour of fun.  It got late for some so we had to call it a night.<br>
<br>
Just want to give props to AoA for ending our night the way you guys did.  Now go back the fuck to Wuoshi where you belong.<br>
<br>
Also i hope other guilds learn from this mistake.  Give fair warning to the people who are at the spot that you are coming thru.  That way the raid can say hold up, give us a few minutes, it's not really safe atm... <p><table width="300" border="0">

We were where we were to kill dragons.  You expressed interrest in a go at Gozzrem, and we were willingly going to give you your shot.  You proceded to train us, which was nothing more then a pull with the exception of half our people going LD because of you all storming through.  <br>
<br>
We asked you to go past which you did, until someone decided to try and ninja a dragons corpse /cheer that.  Then when you agroed half of west wing most of you died, and the rest trained more shit back on us.  What we get for gratitude for saving you is ninja looting something...sure it was a leather bracer...what if it was a breastplate?  To rectify the situation what do you all do....you respectfully tell us that you would leave and let us kill the dragon if we so choose....of course you never left and it pretty much ruined our evening.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, this could have been a minor screw up...the training (TWICE) could have been just an unfortunate, unintentional circumstance;  a learning experience for you all.  But then WTF was your guild doing on my dragons corpse.... I'm happy you did train, otherwise that guy wouldn't have died to AE and probably would have ninja'd something off Telk.  WTF did someone ninja a bracer off a drake for?  And WHY did your officers lie about leaving? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukjice.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KJ ICE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EC Pimp</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#333333>(8/12/01 2:42:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoA gets the Boner of the month award</span><hr size=1>  Maybe you should get all of the facts right before posting eh?

They tried to train us out of Hate once.(when we beat them.   They ported a Monk and Rogue up for the sole purpose of training us)   After we derailed the train (a few people in their guild thought it was pathetic and was sending tells to us telling us what they were trying to do so we were ready for a big train, heh) we were actually asked to CR the Rogue and Monk because they died in the proccess.(under the pretense that it was an 'accident', after six or seven of their guildmates warned us ahead of time that they had the Monk and Rogue up to start a train)       AoA is the only guild I avoid at all costs as a whole.

Stubborn people with big mouths are the ones who ruin it for everyone stuck in between the mishap. Not fair for the people who did'nt start the shit to have to suffer the consequinces of others.......<br>

KEG is a good guild yes but full of very stubborn people. If your lvl 60 and have epic that does'nt mean your so much better than everyone else.<br>

<br>
None of this is, 'Some guy told me..' type crap.   I was one of the people in Hate when it happened, and I was contacted by a friend in your guild before it even happened because he thought what you guys were planning was the most childish thing he had ever seen.<br>
<br>
Apparently you guys tried VS and got beat by LD, tried Trak and got beat by Clan Icewind, and then tried Hate and got beat by us(with a few LD people too) all in the same patch day so your tempers were rather high.    That's really the only 'bad' incident I've ever had with AoA, but it ten times worse than any other incidents I've had with other guilds. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usnootay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snootay</A> at: 8/12/01 4:27:26 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ushiknew.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shiknew </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.frontiernet.net/~wolfden/shield.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tenacious D</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#333333>(8/12/01 4:35:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> &quot;think they onyl had 1 ebayed cleric that lived&quot;<br>

<br>
You obviously are just basing all of this on assumptions.  We are greatly insulted by your accusations of training / ninja looting.<br>
<br>
2) We would NEVER EVER train any guild or group of people on purpose.  We're not like that.  Nor would we try to ninja loot someone elses kill. <br>
<br>
What happened in ToV was this:  We were being lead to Gozzrem, as we were going to make an attempt at him.  We had no idea that KEG was in that pit area.  I can't believe you would even think we'd go there just to lag you or whatever.  The lag got us (AoA) killed.  Yeah I'm sure we wanted that.  <br>
Now as for the bracer, that was off OUR kill.  How do I know?  Because I was in the group that got the exp for it, and Gadfly, a member of our guild, announced the loot.  A leather bracer.  That was our drop, not yours, off a glimmer drake.  <br>
<br>
&quot;One AoA attempted to ninja Telk but died to AE's. Eventually they all die. While this is happening we ended up killing part of there train. They start to do CR.&quot; <br>
<br>
Not much later, Llysar, a Wizard in our guild, told us in guild chat that KEG was accusing him of ninja looting Telk.  He would never do that, simple.  That accusation was just out of the blue, and based on spite from the so called trains.  It made many of us laugh, thanks for showing us how childish you people can be.  After that, we moved ahead.  We pulled a wurm, and then got two adds.  With the unbearable lag, we got wiped out.  We did not get wiped out because we were busy trying to &quot;ninja Telk.&quot;  Again, get your facts straight before you start talking all this shit.    <br>
<br>
An officer of AoA contacted many KEG members, including your leader Nagatsun (who said KEG would leave Gozzrem to us), informing them of our intentions early in the day (going to attempt Gozzrem.)  He said he received no reply regarding Gozzrem, so we decided after a bit of armor farming to attempt Gozzrem as planned.  Believe me, if we had known you were in the pit area, we would have never gone in there.  You think we'd go there and lag everyone on purpose to get everyone killed?  Please.  As for the person who says we trained them in Hate, what makes you think we'd send up people to intentionally train people at the cost of CR'ing them later?  It makes no sense, and we would never do that.  We aren't a bunch of inconsiderate bastards that you are making us out to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;So it's not that great of a loss but just shows how low people can be. So we keep waiting and waiting for them to get there CR act together, think they onyl had 1 ebayed cleric that lived. Now we can't pull anything at this point because we are not the bad guys. We would of just trained there CR.&quot;<br>
<br>
Say we had trained you on purpose.  This statement, based on pure bitterness and childishness, shows that you would be no better than us.  So why are you bitching at us?  An ebayed cleric?  Bitch, moan, cry.<br>
<br>
Camoman, we were in contact with your officers during the CR.  Ask Nagatsun what they discussed, you'll see that I am right. <br>
<br>
3) Bouncer, please go back to school.  Take English class a few times, maybe you'll learn how to use proper grammar and spelling.<br>
<br>
4) Get your facts straight.  Did I say this already?<br>
<br>
Go cry to your mom all you want, it doesn't make any of this shit you're accusing us of true.<br>

It was unprecedented and should not have happened.  <br>
<br>
But let's get a few things cleared up first.  One of our officers cleared it with KEG officers that we would take Gozz.  We had your consent.  So we proceeded to move towards Gozz (which happened to be right next to your camp).   For some reason there was confusion and a few AoA entered your camp bringing some mobs.  We fought them, and killed a glimmering drake in which we looted a pair of gloves off of.   By then 70% of us were already dead so we proceeded to CR.<br>
<br>
While we were ressing near the firepots outside your door, a red wurm comes charging in wiping us out a 2nd time (fits in line with your story about the 2nd training).  The only thing is, we never brought that red wurm.  It was a KEG member named Nagatsun who brought it.<br>
<br>
How do I know this?  Because he told me in tells that he brought it.  Now as to the reason why he brought that wurm, I'm unclear.  You might want to take it up with him.  <br>
<br>
We should have never entered your camp.  We screwed up there.  But did we ninja your loot?  Absolutely not.   We looted off a mob that we killed ourselves.   Did we check Telk's loot?  No we didn't.  We were too busy trying to get the other mobs away from your camp and dying, not that any of our members would do a thing like that anyway.<br>
<br>
As soon as we got CR'd we promptly left the pit area.  I know this because I was doing the COH's.  I'm not sure where you got the idea one of our officers lied about leaving, but I can assure you that's what we did.  <br>
<br>
The thing I see we're guilty of is running to your camp and annoying you all quite a bit. Nobody likes their time to be wasted and we certainly do not like wasting other ppls time. <br>
<br>
Please accept our apologies. <br>
<br>
sincerely,<br>
<br>

I see people every day having RL issues and we choose to get on an electronic board and complain about cartoon mistakes on a &quot;game&quot; that makes little difference to our lives as a whole.  It's incredible that this stuff even gets started.  The maturity of public floggings in today's society amazes me.<br>
<br>
Folks?<br>
<br>
WHO CARES????<br>
<br>
Accidents happen.  Stuff happens.  It's amazing we are getting on with this and I am even more amazed that I am posting here.  I think I am fed up.  I happen to know people in each of your guilds.  I happen to know each guild is very good in fact.  You take things seriously while trying to have fun.  Let's remember this is all about fun.  We can't leave our kids our gear after we die.  This is only temporary gang.  If I believed everything people say, I would believe KEG was &quot;forced&quot; off Rathe and has several secret Ebay characters.  If I believe everything I hear, I would believe AoA is filled with a bunch of kids who don't know what the hell they are doing.  I don't believe any of it and if it were true WHO CARES???  If KEG didn't get along with certain guilds on Rathe - WHO CARES?  If KEG has Ebay characters - or AoA according to this post - WHO CARES???  Does it really matter to you and your family or career or your LIFE?<br>
<br>
Please people.  Let's have fun.  Stuff happens and we move on.  So... MOVE ON! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucamoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Camoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(8/12/01 11:06:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoA gets the Boner of the month award</span><hr size=1> Like I said, everything probably would have been cool except for one incident of Ninja'ing, one incident of attempted ninja'ing (of a dragon mind you), and an incident of you lying to us.<br>
<br>
It probably was a learning experience for you...you can't just have 40 people rush by a group of 40 people in ToV without warning because it causes mass lag.  You guys wanted to try a dragon, we had agreed to give you your shot.  But how can you come here and tell me there's two sides of every story?  Did you kill Telk?  I coulda swore we did so why the F was someone on AoA on the corpse.  Did you kill the drake?  Obviously not otherwise how would we know immediately after it died what was on the corpse?  Did you not say you were leaving?  Why were you still there 2 hours later?<br>
<br>
The rest is quite forgivable, you caused massed lag, leap frogged without letting us know yada yada yada.  That's quite forgivable, understandable since you guys are a bit newer to ToV then KEG, NO BIGGY.  I'd really like to hear the side of the story that makes ninja looting and lying right though... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udrenthaod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DrenthAoD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(8/12/01 11:31:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoA gets the Boner of the month award</span><hr size=1> Let me address the ninja looting issue on the leather bracer. I spoke with a KEG member about it and didn't know the issue was still not settled. <br>
<br>
In the confusion of the 70 people in the pit area a drake was killed and looted. I spoke with Antoch and told him we looted the drake, I asked him to confirm it with his guild if it was a KEG kill. He told me KEG  couldn't confirm it. They weren't sure if they killed the drake or not. I spoke with my guild and we are 100% sure the drake killed was ours. I offered the bracer up to MQ if KEG could confirm the kill was theirs, it was refused. <br>
<br>
As to trying to loot Telk, I hope you have some screenshots of the person on the corpse, because I'm damn sure no one in AoA touched his corpse. I'm also damn sure no items were missing from Telk's corpse. <br>
<br>
Surprises me you don't speak with your guild members before posting such a lengthy flame. I blame the whole issue on miscommunication. If anyone from KEG has any questions about it, feel free to e-mail me at drenth1@mediaone.net or message me in-game and I'll go into details on what exactly happened.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

They had no idea that is where we kill Telkorenar and that he had just been slain.  I explained to him about the corpses of AoA littered from the pit to around the corner and basically everywhere in the vicinity since apparently the entire group/guild panicked and ran all over the place, in turn training themselves.  <br>
<br>
I offered the solution that whoever is doing CR for AoA to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  immediately</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> start pulling the corpses to Telkorenar's lair since it was empty and would remain so since we had just killed him.  Reilnkur (who was on Keeba) said that he told *CR Dude, let's name him X&quot; to do this but X would absolutely not listen to reason and was &quot;too pissed&quot; to do anything to salvage their own CR.  We then moved our entire group to Telk's lair and I advised Reilnkur that respawn was imminent and that we had moved to Telk's lair, thus allowing them to CR in the pit.  Time goes by and we're fighting respawn.  Just to let you know about ToV, especially with wurms, even if a wurm is snared it will still take off around the corner and stop only when it reaches the doorway to the pit.  Had AoA's CR team, at the very least, moved the bodies out from the middle of the platform and into the pit there would not have been the unintentional &quot;AE train&quot; of a red wurm since it would have stopped before reaching the pit.<br>
<br>
All in all, poor communication, poor handling before and after of organization and corpse retrieval/recovery/dragging and definitely some problems between the AoA CR dude, X and their ToV puller.<br>
<br>
Why the suggestion and advice of moving your CR to Telk's lair was ignored, I have no clue.  Why the suggestion and advice of moving your CR 15 feet to the pit was ignored, I have no clue.  I think emotions got the best of a few people and they couldn't use common sense even though that advice was given by &quot;the bad guys&quot; because of whatever power struggle was going on intra-guild or in tells.<br>
<br>
I hope there isn't a next time and a specific person or officer from each guild be the &quot;spokesperson&quot; before something like this happens again.<br>
