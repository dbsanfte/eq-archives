BP.  Barsh got the BP, I was glad he got it.  Why I said it's a wrong call?  Cuz first of all, Barsh doesn't play as much as rula/wahaka and a lot of other PO warriors.  I didn't say it's wrong cuz it didn't go to Ayiar.  Ayiar has a tov bp, thank you very much.  Barsh deserve one, but it can be even better of use for other warriors who attends raid regularly.  <br><br>If you want a prove of this, you can ask keadaian and/or any wizards were in group that night (ammelen and kulkin were still in the group after you dropped off the group without hearing why).  Drop off from a group in mid raid is no thx.<br><br>2. ST mob key.<br>I have to agree I made a mistake on deguild over a key.  At the time it happened, it was a big insult to me, still until today it's an insult to me.  I didn't want this to be on VCC or whatsoever so I never posted anything after I deguild not even on PO public board.  But you pushed me today.  I have to give my side of the story now.<br><br>I was one of the hardcore PO members, you have to agree on this one.  I hardly miss any raids except halloween when I was out for GM events stuff.  Many times I was the only druid present in tov raids.  I was on every ST mobs kill.  Even after keadaian gave the order of Mage, druid, wizard, someone else for the next few keys, druid gets skip, skip, and skip.  Why?  Cuz I was there for all of those kills.  <br><br>One saturday night I had a plan to go out with ayiar to have some RL fun, sont was killed.  The key was immediatily awarded to the newest human hierophant of PO.  Miena and fippun both were at the kill too.  But the key went to the newest human hierophant.  If you want to argue how long a player in PO then he/she gets loots, this one erase that point cuz Miena and Fippun were way old school PO than me or the newest human hierophant.  <br><br>The newest human hierophant was hardly on any ToV raids and/or a lot of dragon kills.  Why a druid who hardly done anything for guild gets the ST key was the part I didn't understand.  But then later on I found out through the chat with PO officers cuz that was the order from Keadaian 3 days before that key drop.  The newest human hierophant will be the druid who gets the key.  Cuz the newest human hierophant works hard to get to lvl 60 and he doesn't have full spell book like what Raiya has.  <br><br>Hello...So I must had bought all of my experience from some secret vendor to get to lvl 60 and I must didn't show up on many kunark/velious dragon kills that's how I got all of the spells in my spell book.  <br><br>Omfg, give me a break Audacity.  I've never argue one loot for myself until the ST key.  I did say something for ayiar before cuz I think he deserves it since he's always there when guild needed him.  Just an example, He's always on the Fear break team when we went take on CT.  Have he gotten any loots from any fear mobs?  No.  dont even think about CT.  And you know, this is not your business how I complain about something cuz I didn't /tell you.  I can careless about what you think.  I /tell to PO officers, sometimes people made bad judgements, we all do, and they did say that in guild board before.  There's no big deal.  We asked, we get a reason why, we pretty much dropped right there.  That has nothing, nada to do with you.<br><br>And sure, you are not a greedy asshole yourself?  Who's the one wants every drop that it drops?  Who's the one always says gimme, gimme?  Yeah, it sounds like a joke, but if you have to hear that in every raid, it doesn't sound funny anymore.  nuff said.  You just made a big fool out of yourself and PO.  This kinda of stuff shouldn't be brought to VCC.  I hope Keadaian and the rest of the PO officers like what you just did.  Have a good one.   <p>Raiya -- the Treeslover of Vazaelle<img src=http://ftpusers.flash.net/~bigdon0/raiya.jpg height=66 width=314></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaudacitybarebottom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Audacity Barebottom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/30/01 4:43:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=599.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Audacity's one side story</span><hr size=1> Yes im greedy!
