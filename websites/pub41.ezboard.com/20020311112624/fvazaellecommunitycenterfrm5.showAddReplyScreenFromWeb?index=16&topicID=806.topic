------------------------------------------------------------<br>
There has been alot of debate on different methods that trigger his spawn and most concur that killing all the undead will create his trigger. In a small way, they are correct. Below I will list the methods to run through the rotation needed to make him spawn however, I will remind people that this is still a rare spawn and even doing the correct methods could take hours, or minutes. It is a random spawn but this has a proven track record and will get you your JBoots in time.<br>
<br>
The grass area is a newbie hunting ground and has nothing to do with the AC spawn. The entire desert does though. <br>
<br>
Commons<br>
Desert Tarantulas, Shrivelled Mummies, Desert Madmen, Zombies, Cistern Asps, Drybone Skeletons, Zombies, Orc Warriors, Sand Scarabs and Pumas.<br>
<br>
Rares<br>
The rares are a little bit more complicated. There is a rather large rare list. When a rare is killed, the next rare will spawn. Now remember, these spawn percentage numbers are not accurate but will give you a general understanding of the frequency of which rares will be seen. Included are some anomolies I have noticed over the countless hours I have learned this method. <br>
<br>
Rare Monster  Spawn  Comments <br>
A Crypt Mummy 20% This is the main PH. Always ensure these die and rares wil continue to spawn. There is also a Crypt Mummy x2 spawn and usually they will both be on opposite sides of the desert. <br>
<br>
A Dune Taran... 20% Clearing the spiders is always a good idea and if you can't find any crypt mummies, kill these and crypts can pop on the next spawn.  <br>
<br>
A madman  5% One of the singular named rares. Can spawn anywhere. <br>
<br>
an asp  5% One of the singular named rares. Can spawn anywhere. <br>
<br>
a giant rattlesnake 5% Also, a rattlesnake. Kill either, hard to see in sand at times. <br>
<br>
a jackal  5% No, he hasn't wandered over from the newb area. He is a rare. <br>
<br>
an orc raider 5% Is a rare, may be a Terrorantula spawn trigger as I have had 2 Terror's after killing 2 of these in a row. <br>
<br>
Dervish Cutthroat 3% Not the ones in camps, but there is a wanderer that can pop. basic rule is, if you see one wandering the desert, kill it. <br>
 <br>
A Sand Mummy 5% The rare mummy. Crypt mummies are the common rares. <br>
<br>
Erg Bluntside  3% Is on the rare rotation. Drops a orcish mace. <br>
<br>
A drybone skeleton 5% Will usually see this spawn in the tower. he is also the PH for Obretl and pet, who will always spawn in tower.  <br>
<br>
Scrounge  2% Low level named wolf that drops claws. Won't see him too often. <br>
<br>
a young ronin 2% Used in a monk quest, he is also believed to be on the rotation. <br>
<br>
Sandgiant Husam  2% Low level rare giant spawn, used in 2 quests. <br>
<br>
Terrorantula  2% Giant spider, will scare the hell out of you if he pops near you. His aggro range is enormous and can pose problems for someone not ready for him. Drops silks used for Erudite only tailoring.  <br>
<br>
A Sand Giant 8% These will pop in place of rares occasionally hence the reason you will sometimes see 2 or even 3 at a time. Good source of income while waiting out this camp. <br>
 <br>
An Ancient Cyclops 1% The reason your here. It could be debated on his spawn percentage but I am willing to wager it is the same as the OOT one and that the only reason he is seen more in SRo is due to alot of people hunting in these parts and the randomness factor of the mummies / orc s/ma dmen killing each other which can make pop at anytime if the rotation is run, even by the in-game A.I. <br>
<br>
Some things to add to this equation. Occasionally during one of the rares popping, a multitude of commons will also spawn. It is also part of the equation but I am unsure if you need to kill these waves of commons, it hasn't seemed to matter so far. Multiple times I have seen a wave of 3-9 desert tarantulas spread out of one spawn point or a desert full of scattered ghouls. Don't be alarmed, this is just an addition to the rare spawn. What this signifies is that there is a rare or rare PH up. Find it fast. Another thing to note is killing the mob isn't what triggers the next pop. I know, seems strange but actually just pulling the mob is what does it and also explains the high rate of KS's on the AC. basically, you see that sand mummy and engage it. Sure, it's green and only takes a few seconds but you turn around to see the AC fall and you'll understand why. Although, the most KS's I have ever seen to the AC is due to the Dark Elf merchant camp in the middle of the desert. If the AC engages them, the battle is lost. <br>
<br>
So, your method for making him spawn is simple. Find the rares. There can be 1-3 up at once. Killing the commons can speed the process but isn't needed if you don't want to. There will always be 1 rare up and killing it will spawn another either instantly or in under 1 minute. All spawns remain in place for a few seconds before wandering. The most common you'll see is the crypt mummies so continously hunt these down. Having a tracker helps considerably but is not needed as you can comb the desert quite quickly. The best vantage point for medding is in the tall peak beside the dark elf camp. You can see the entire zone from here except for a few spawns behind ridges. The ridge beside the Sol Ro followers camp is one of the most common AC pop spots so I'd recommend always running a lap around the desert after each rare kill. <br>

There ya go, either that or go kill the bugger that spawns in OOT<br>

All of the &quot;kill this&quot; &quot;kill that&quot; &quot;spawn this&quot; &quot;pop that&quot; is a load of crap. Someone at Verant is laughing his ass off.
