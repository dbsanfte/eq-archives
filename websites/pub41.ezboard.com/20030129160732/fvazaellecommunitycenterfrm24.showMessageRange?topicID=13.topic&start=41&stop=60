  You won't have to go far to ask different people on this server where they got that item or where they got that part for their epic, because alot of the time it was because IV allowed them to loot it. I don't think this is something they had to do, it was because they wanted to.<br>
Individually if ya get to know them, they are jus like you and me. Eq nerds. I get tells from diff IV people almost daily, asking me wuts doin, how goes or just a friendly Grats on this or that. <br>
 As a group they are like a quick moving plague, whiping Mob_01 to Mob_100, they do it with quickness and precision. And yeah theres a chance to get caught in that wake. But honestly, theres nothing stopping any other guild from doing the exact same thing.<br>
Hell i wouldnt be surprised if ya got to know them, they'd show you how certain mobs are done or at least offer a few helpful tips. <br>
Keep attempting those mobs, keep trying to get stronger. This server is made of many guilds, with time we should all have the chance to do everything we want. So don't be upset with a group of people that can do these mobs NOW, worry about doing your own thing. Chances are you'll be better off.<br>

1) It took significantly longer then that.  Clear 1x fully &lt;Server crash&gt;  Wait for everyone to come back, begin clearing, hook up with TE and work out the trillion details that arise when 60 people with 2 different leaders, get groups together, buff and finally fight.<br>

What happened was you called camp check and I called NG from the zone as we were heading down in about 5 mins.  You got kinda upset when you got there and if you remember, I apologized, and said you could have the camp if you want, but you were nice enough to let us have it.  I certainely wouldn't have been ticked if you just said to me, &quot;since you're not at NG my group is taking it&quot; - I was wrong for calling NG from the zone, and in the future I've said &quot;we're heading to xxx&quot; for camp checks when I'm at the zone like that.<br>
<br>
As far as what do I think about leapfrogging?  I dunno, but that's not the point of this thread.  The point of my post to miri was that its amazingly hypocritically to rip on IV for leapfrogging when they do the exact same thing.<br>
<br>
And for the record &quot;leapfrogging&quot; isn't killing a mob that someone just failed on, or killing a mob when there's 10 people and a COH mage there from another guild while you have your whole force there in my opinion.  Leapfrogging is killing VS when another guild pulls his guards, leapfrogging is camping out a mage in a safe spot to coh your guild down while another guild in full force is clearing the mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utanthvaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TanthVaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 1:30:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I think the original point of this thread was about respect.  There are rules and there are morals, and sometimes things that aren't in the rules are still immoral.  If you're on the subway and manage to get a seat when the car starts filling up and an old lady with a walked comes in, there's no LAW that says you have to give up your seat to her, but that's what most people would do.<br>
 <br>
These people are not saying that anyone broke the rules, they are saying the acts lacked common courtesy, so if you want to address that you'd do better defending them from a moral point of view, not a in-game rule point of view.<br>
<br>
Now since this thread has morphed into a &quot;The Endless&quot; are hypocrites thread, I'll just share a few things.  <br>
<br>
1) Agony on Sev.  We had 2 failed attempts for whatever reasons, Agony tried to kill him, they failed as well.  At NO time did we pull Sev after this, they fought him close enough that their fear path brought him to us and he aggroed on us.  What were we supposed to do? Evac?  None of our people rushed him, he rushed us and that is undeniable fact because I was on the pull team.<br>
<br>
2) PO on VS.  If you did any research at all, you would realize that after PO failed, we TALKED to them and they gave us the go ahead to kill VS.  We told them we would share loot BEFORE any loot dropped.  IV zoned in with two guilds obviously waiting on VS, then while our guild was assisting PO with rezzes in the prep room started pulling the mobs surrounding VS.  I'm sure people will respond with rules, but I'm not disputing that IV acts within the rules of the game.  I do think that most people recognize this as an act lacking in respect.<br>
<br>
3) Agony on Trak.  In this case, both guilds were at the zone in at around the same time.  Agony had 7 people in zone when we had 2, but shortly after that the number evened out while BOTH guilds were at zone at around 20 a piece.  I'm not sure how this equates to anyone having any rights to Trak as neither of our guilds can do Trak with 20 at this time.  <br>
<br>
4) IV on Trak.  The incident that started this all.  I wasn't on the actual raid so I won't comment other than to say that the accounts I've heard differ wildly from Befb's description on another board, which I assume is what all IV believe happened.  What I do know, without a doubt, is that after the dialogue between Krimzin and Kaminya in TELLS, Krimzin started publicly flaming Kaminya in ooc.  I don't believe a single person from our guild responded to this.<br>
<br>
5) IV on Cazic.  Yes we tried and failed.  Clearly we aren't as powerful or experienced as you guys so if you want to mock us I have no problem with that.  If IV hadn't shown up would our guilds have made another attempt?  Probably.  I believe it's really just a calculted move on IV's part to deny other guilds the learning curve that they had.  So be it, we'll deal with it.  The goal of that raid wasn't to kill Cazic necessarily but to see how our guilds worked together and I think both sides were pleased with the result.<br>
<br>
6) IV vs The Endless.  At one point our two guilds were really close and I'm not entirely sure why that changed.  I know the Trak incident had a lot to do with it, but I don't think that is responsible for the hatred coming from a lot of IV members.  Based on these &quot;blacklist&quot; comments, I believe that IV &quot;heard&quot; from one of our members at the time who is no longer with us that our guild was blacklisting them or something.  Our guild, has NEVER attempted to blacklist anyone.  The idea is as laughable to us as it is to you.  As it is, I can live easily without assistance from other guilds, why should it be any different with you guys?  If you guys had talked to Kaminya or anyone in power for that matter, you might have realized that this whole blacklist thing never occurred.  What did occur is that people asked what our official position regarding IV was on a private board and Kaminya responded that there is NO official position and each member is free to do what they want.  If the &quot;blacklist&quot; thing was indeed what set IV against our guild, then it's unfortunate that all this conflict arose from something that never occurred.<br>
<br>
It's basically a question of morals.  Ghol asked why other people act differently towards IV these days and I believe it's because you guys play only by the rules of Verant while others play according to their morals.   Actually that's deceptive, it is more accurate to say that your morals are such that you don't feel the need to impose restrictions on yourselves above what the official rules are.  It is your right to act that way, but surely you must see why others who view your actions as immoral are unhappy with them.<br>
<br>
As far as this forum goes, it's kind of a catch-22.  If you want to discuss things such as those I've mentioned in a calm manner you have no outlet.  If I post something like this on the general board, it would likely be moved to rants, yet when you post on rants, well what you get back are rants and flames, not discussion.<br>

<br>
I am kind of dissappointed in myself, see, earlier on when the server was still young i was against the traditional calender.  I thought maybe people would be able to figure it out on their own, and not TRY and piss people off.  OK ok, at least try and communicate a little more without retarded name calling.<br>
Then if a situation came up, maybe the people involved could figure out a solution.    So i gave people too much credit.<br>
<br>
Why not be happy for a guild that can at least attempt a tough critter, instead of make fun of them for failing.  Give them a couple of shots, tell them to kill it, and if they can't...maybe they could let you know so your Uber PHAT L33t Guild could go in and do it.  don't have to sit and wait for them to fail, tell them to send a tell.<br>
<br>
I HAD A DREAM!!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
seriously though, people &quot;should&quot; try and be a bit more helpful, or at least understanding.  Why be an asshole about it, if it pisses you off......well, maybe you are too intense about a damn game.  <br>
<br>
Why not let groups of people that may have a chance to kill something, do it!  You people have to share, and not get so pissy when someone comes in.  You will get other shots, and there is plenty of other high level mobs to keep you occupied.  so they fail 2 or 3 times in a row, I am pretty sure if a guild went and failed any more times they would give up(maybe even let someone else know).  <br>
<br>
As for the start of this thread, and someone pulling around other people, i think that is just arogance.  Why wouldn't you all just move past the group that was in the pool room.  Real easy, and you wouldn't have to talk to them if you didn't want to.....go to pull, see some group there, why not just move past them?  or here is a novel idea, pull up to that point, and leave them alone....seeing how you wouldn't get experience for it anyways, and if it was just for faction, hell you could have had fun just hitting the mobs once or so buffing and healing the group even,  while they killed them, ewww no that's like being nice, playing around...<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to me, just don't be so childish.  I mean who the hell cares if a guild gets together, and can't kill said uber_mob3442. let them have a shot, and ask them to let you know when they are done.  If they killed it, maybe even a congrats would be in order.<br>
<br>
I have friends in all the forementioned guilds, and i do know there are alot of fun/good people in them....along with a couple cock-smokers in there.  Kind of strange for me to see fun/good people on all sides, get all stressed out over something so small.  Of course the pole-sniffers are expected to act that way, you would just think the others would point them in the right direction or something.<br>

<br>
Guilds and players tend to choose policies that suit them the best.  If IV was to disappear, with every member vanishing, another guild with similar policies would appear.<br>
<br>
There are exceptions of course, of note, Zozz leaving IV because he didn't agree with our policies.  I admire him for his conviction, even if I don't agree with his motivation.<br>
<br>
There's an amusing situation on Lanys.  The big guild there, Conquest, was disbanded by Verant, and most of the members quit EQ as they felt the decision was unjust.  There was another guild, perhaps once the second largest on the server named Inner Fire.  They battled with CQ on the message boards, fighting for opportunities to kill big mobs that CQ killed quickly and efficiently before other guilds.  <br>
<br>
With CQ and almost all of its members gone however, the bulk of IF disbanded and formed a new guild in CQ's image, with many members forsaking the values that they preached for a year, while fighting CQ while in IF.<br>
<br>
There are stories like this on many servers, if not all of them.  If it's not the top guild falling, it's people who opposed that guild joining.<br>
<br>
The fact is, high level EQ is played in a certain way, and this is it.  It's a reality.  Please don't bitch and whine to IV because you don't like how the upper level game is played. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uskirm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skirm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 2:48:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> I really don't think publicly flaming TE/SF for failing is needed, imo, but I only speak for myself. Like people have said, we die all the time, and will continue to do so cause that's how the game goes. So other than to respond to a perceived or real slight, flaming them on a public board is pointless, again imo.  They learned (I'm guessing) that zerg tactics don't work in all situations, and they said they liked the way their cooperation between the guilds turned out. Ok. no problems there. Having said that, I don't see why we'd ever just waste our game time by leaving something up (like CT) that we wanted to kill, while people try again and again to take it down, when we're in a position to kill it. If something pops and we only have 6-12 people online and someone else has 40+, great, try til your hearts content. But if we have the people for it, and dont have anything else going at the time, we're most likely going to take a shot at it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usilvirthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvir the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 2:50:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Umm ok.

<br>
And that my friends is why I am staying independent of guilds.  There are a lot of cool individuals in EQ.  Guilds have sort of fucked up everquest in my opinion.  The six person group is the best organizational structure in my opinion.<br>
<br>
The creation of guilds has spawned the uber encounters.  The uber encounters require guilds.  Its a vicious circle.<br>
<br>
The original rant was aimed at IV.  Other guilds then came to the party and a guild-rant was born.<br>
<br>
Its about people, not the guilds.  I have no doubt in my mind that every single guild leader/officer is a decent person but they have people clamoring for loot and shit.  Its a burden on them to keep everyone happy which leads to bad decisions and stepping on others to obtain loot.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty happy with the six man group thanks and if I ever did join a guild, it would be purely for the chat and not the uber encounters. <p>Herder

<br>
Yeah if you actually read the thread you'd see that the whole point is you do exactly the same things you accuse us of.  Your morals mean leapfrogging over a group fighting down to trak with COH?  Your morals mean pulling VS when another guild is fighting his guards?  Yeah I'm so sure PO didn't want another shot at that VS, but we're the bad guys because we kill CT after you fail?  Whatever, same old BS.<br>
<br>
The real reason people act different towards IV than a couple months ago is because they now have the levels to want a slice of the pie that IV has been eating.  Well fine, go for it, but we're going to compete for it too.  Just don't get on this &quot;moral high horse&quot; crap its bullshit.<br>
