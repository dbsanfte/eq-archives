Guys, the calendar is going bye-bye if people keep grabbing up everything worth a damn well in advance and, best yet, in large blocks of time. There have already been people clearly checking the calendar just to jump raids (no, not a coincidence when you start raiding 30 minutes to an hour before other scheduled raids repeatedly throughout a week) by people who turn around and post their own stuff on this board.<br>
<br>
FFA is FFA, but this board has been and could still be a polite way of making content available to everyone. If you're a pig about it, that's gonna end, by all parties. I've spokent to a number of people who are already in the &quot;screw it, let's kill it if it's up&quot; stage and they're in a number of guilds, and are pushing to get their guilds to go this way. Unless you're 100 percent Euro and 100 percent fulltime EQ players, little piggies will all lose out when this happens, either a little, or a whole lot.<br>
<br>

So your going to make that call for all of vaz?  I missed the vote where you were annointed spokesman for the server.<br>
<br>
Fact is Guilds will ignore the calendar, as forsaken unity did when Munin posted the storm legions Raid for Hate.  In the end that turned out to be lucky for storm legions, because FU was really cool about us being there at the same time and helped us out a bunch.  Still, if you reserve a place and someone beats you there thats an issue between your guild and their guild.  You can always take it to the flames section, or you can raise a stink about it here to let others know.  Right now this is the ONLY system that we have.  Propose another, or live with it.<br>
<br>
Making this blanket statement really serves no purpose since you are not speaking for &quot;walkers&quot; (as you state in your post).<br>
There are plenty of guilds that do still respect this calendar and try to coordinate time amongst each other.  I assume your outburst appliest to exactly one person, and that is you.  So in the future you will not respect events on this board, and everyone can feel free to ignore events you schedule as well?  Is that what your declaration means?  Please be a bit more specific.<br>

I'd suggest the escalation for guilds who decide to pop in just before another's scheduled raid is to name names and cry &quot;asshole&quot;.  Besides, all the retirees on the R&amp;F board are whining that there's no good rants anymore.<br>

I would hope that the guilds that are just now getting into the tougher raids would remember the cooperation and courtosy that has been going on as they progress.<br>
<br>
That way we will only have a small crop of guilds jumping spawns "because it's FFA"...<br>
<br>
Here, by the way, is a great example of how well FFA works...<br>

Closed raid.</span><hr size=1> IMO this server needs one thing, cooperation between the guilds, especially the high-end guilds.  I hear tell nearly every week of uber-guild-A &quot;ganking&quot; uber-guild-B’s raid.  Quite frankly, this is annoying and why guilds that I routinely hear mentioned even though they get the UBER drops and always hammer away at the northern area of ToV and such become less and less desirable to be a member of.  They appear to lack the respect and honor that should be associated with a high-end guild and the qualifications necessary for membership in one.  A few bad eggs are the problem.  I believe a few have moved to the Legends server, if memory serves my right and my sources are correct, and hopefully this will begin to cure the problem.  In effect this sort of thing is making the game far less fun to play and by and large a more stressful environment (which is IMO what a large number of players are using the game to avoid).  I think a little bit of respect and effort to check this board before planning a raid and respecting others postings will be beneficial for all guild members server wide.  In this way we can more efficiently equip guild members and proceed to more and more difficult portions of the game.  If you want to be an ass find an appropriate PvP server and go play with yourself.  Show some respect to others and you will likely find them doing the same.<br>

I agree. We should set up a calendar, and be done with FFA. And that calendar should cover every raid from Crushbone to Grieg's End. But the problem is that there's people who won't respect it, because they don't give a damn about their reputation. And thanks to the random timer on spawn times, what are you going to say to the group that booked Naggy and he's not up?

Closed raid.</span><hr size=1> My apologies to whizbang for my initial reaction to his post.  I interpreted it wrong, Its my thick warrior skull.  I Have to read stuff twice to get the point.<br>
<br>
Still this discussion is somewhat pointless on a FFA server.  We don't have an alternate system.  A calendar, while nice, is not enforcable.  To use a recent example,  I posted a kael raid, and midsummer knights posted their raid on the same day a few days after my post.  They did not change their date, and we didnt change ours either.  We still raided Kael, but only because our raid ended up starting very late.  Worked out for both guilds.<br>
<br>
If Midsummer nights had  been in the arena at the time that our raid started, I wouldnt have had some divine right of kings to ask them to leave.   So what was the point of me posting the raid on this board?  Well , I did it because I wanted to let other people know what our intent was.  There was no expectation other than to inform the people who do pay attention to this board that we would be in kael that night. <br>
<br>
Similarly I have gone to kael with a group to find the arena uber camped with no announcements on this board.  As far as I am concerned this board is only here as a convenience for communicating intent to other guilds.  It also serves to get the word out for open events if you are having one.  I guess with &quot;the alliance&quot; and &quot;the union&quot;, and whatever other multi guild cooperatives spring up, there will be less need to recruit for open raids here. <br>
<br>
We can all gripe about the system as much as we like (me included), but without an alternative that works, there really isnt much point to it.  someone beats you to a camp, grin and bear it.  Its an honor system, plain and simple.  It will not work all the time, and we can not expect it to.  It will work some of the time, and that is better than having no system at all in place.<br>

Closed raid.</span><hr size=1> Vaz has a calander? ;P<br>
<br>
As I've told a number of other guilds who have asked as we're forming to do something/kill something:<br>
<br>
FU does not read, follow or in any way respect a 'calandering' system on the Server.  This is a FCFS server, and has been from the beginning.  <br>
<br>
Calenders suck.  People use them to jump other raids, or people without the ability to schedule crap they can never do.  The Innoruuk calander has hate booked twice a day for 3 MONTHS in advance.  total crap.<br>
<br>
I for one am glad the calander on this server was never really used. <p><table border=1 cellpadding=4>

Who actually considers themselves uber?  Just curious, mind you.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, here's a few quick ways to tell if you're uber:<br>
<br>
1) If you're wielding a Centi Longsword... you're probably not uber.<br>
<br>
2) If your favorite raid zone doesn't require a key of some sort...  you're probably not uber.<br>
<br>
3) If your main tank can take off his armor, and give it to someone else... again, you're probably not uber.<br>
