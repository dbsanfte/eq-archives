We all vary in levels from 40 to 43 and we are all European or Australian and are playing early in the US morning (our peak time) with most dungeons empty or near empty.  We decided we needed an FBSS for our War and that we were the perfect level to go and beat the Frenzy around in Lower Guk and have a fun night with nice drops and good xp.  We port from City of Mist to SRo and make the run down, do a camp check and are promptly told by a 60 Warlord that he is camping the Frenzy while another 60 War was taking Hand, AM, and Lord.  I'm a bit pissed off at this so IVU and head to Frenzy to have a chat to the War.<br>  This guys has all the nice stuff, very well equipped and is there with a 57 Cleric.  I have a chat to him (his name was Slambam, an Ogre) about maybe sharing the spawn so we can get some xp and a chance on the FBSS.  During our entire conversation the Cleric doesn't say a word or stand up so I'm thinking he's multiing them.<br>  This tool says that he won't share the spawn and if we're after xp there are plenty of mobs outside the room that we could take but that the Frenzy room was his.  I point out that we're an xp group of four after a needed item which he is just pharming and he basically says &quot;Conversation over leave&quot;.<br>  I take it to ooc to see what everyone else thought and it turned into a high level vs xp level fight over who was in the right.  I then threatened him with PnP and he called me an asshole and threatened retribution regarding my reputation and how I'll never get a group pulling PnP on people.<br>  Now I have a regular group and have a long list of friends so him threatening my rep is the last thing I'm worried about.  I ask him why he's here anyway can't he get a group up and hunt more profitable spawn points and he says no groups are available at the moment seeing it's so early.  I tell him maybe his bottom feeding ways and selfishness mean that maybe he should be more concerned about his own rep and ability to get in groups rather than mine.<br>  I've had enough of his idiocy, so I port back to CoM while our Druid does the same with the rest of the group and stew for a bit.<br>  I hated to pull PnP on him (not that it worked anyway) but I'd really like an opinion of the community of what the correct action should have been?  I never would have said a thing if there was another group who were xping there and had the camp but pharming for another 8k pp when you already have loot that looks like it's worth a couple of 100 k is just being greedy to my way of thinking, especially when we had a War who needed the item.  Three 57-60 players bottom feeding and taking all of the camps from one of the busiest 40-50 level dungeons in the game is just stupid to me.<br><br>Auros <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uscy46.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scy46</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/17/01 9:22:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=432.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blizzard.com/images/war3/units/demon-hunter.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pharming Idiots</span><hr size=1> Let Slambam keep it? lol ...

Does he think he will be able to really sell the FBSS that fast?  I don't know how fast they actually move but when I spend a day (and I mean full day) in EC I will see no less than 6 different people there selling it.. and they are there ALL day as well.. Not sure if it is that profitable anymore.. Think a higher level would be able to farm something that sells.. any character that wants to camp for it is not going to drop 8k unless they are a twink.. but since there are so many FBSS out there there will be plenty left over even after people do their twinking..

Some things he doesnt mention would be: have you ever in your life met someone would genuinely call pan directed?  Maybe gandi or mother teresa I dunno, no one I know.  Everyone basicly works to help themselves and thier friends, clearly doods as he calls them arent his friends, so basicly his essay boils down to &quot;boo, people who arent my friends!&quot;  Yay.  Also, &quot;boo people who dont talk like I do!&quot;  Thanks for the tolerance.  Been about a year since I read it but that was my impression at the time.<br><br>Now as for this issue.  Bottom feeding is sorta gay but theres no law against it, and its certainly not something you are going to be able to blackball anyone over.  Just about every high level does it.  If you want to experience level appropriate camps my advise is to start over on the next new server and level fast, sad but true.  It will never get any better only more 60s every day.  Gotta adapt I guess. <p>Procax the Illusionist<br>Phantasmist<br>In Virtue<br>Vazaelle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 809<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/01 9:16:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=432.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pharming Idiots</span><hr size=1> First off, Slambam is a great guy and a great tank.  <br><br>Secondly, unless someone is at the camp 24/7 and never leaves, it isn't farming.<br><br>Farming is getting an item mulitple times and selling said item and repeating the cycle.<br><br>Slambam was genuinely wanting an FBSS and instead of buying one off an EC auctioner, decided to get his the old fashioned way, earning it, just like you wanted to.<br><br>Don't be surprised at the reaction of the community here because Slambam (or anyone else for that matter) has a right to camps just like you.

However, it is just one more &quot;feature&quot; in this game.  The fact of the matter is that we all must balance our rights with others.  I do not mean to sound disrespectful, but it almost sounds like you are just upset that you didn't get your way.  I have been in the frenzy camp several times now, and sometimes you just have to wait your turn.  It is like that in any spawn.  Just last night, I tried to go back to the Minotaur Hero for the Hero Bracer (one of those farmed items!) that I want.  It went something like this:<br><br>Ciynn:  /occ Is minotaur hero camped?<br>Someone: /ooc Yes<br>Ciynn: /tell Someone Thanks... would you mind sending me a tell when you are done?<br>Someone: /tell Ciynn Sure! I will be happy to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>And he did....<br><br>The fact of the matter is that once some hits 60, experience isn't the name of the game anymore.  One of the things that keep you going is getting those items you were trying to get. (I would imagine... not being the level 38 expert on what level 60 is all about!)  Those items are SO rare in many cases that one may have to buy them if  they ever want to see them.  These things cost platinum.  Sometimes this is what it takes to get it.<br><br>It is a simple matter that it is his right to work towards his goal as much as it is yours or mine.<br><br>(Side note on PnP... I've never PnP'd anyone and I personally never will.)<br><br><br>Good luck and hang in there!<br><br>Ciynn Souljaded<br>38 Warrior <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=432.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=432.topic&start=41&stop=53>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=436.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=432.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=432.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=432.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=432.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
