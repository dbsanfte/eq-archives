<br>
No, the non-farmers won.  People that have a single main character.  I've got a level 60 gnome enchanter.  If they add some nifty quest for an item I could use, I shouldn't have to start up another gnome enchanter just so I can use the item.  If they add a quest that ups factions that I want, I shouldn't need to start a new gnome enchanter just so that I can have my guy non-KoS somewhere.  And, yah, that sort of crap happens quite often.  Low level zones frequently have some nice resist gear or quest rewards.  I've got 1 gnome enchanter... and that's all I want. <br>
<br>
And then there is tradecraft supplies.  I kill many, many greens for tinkering.  Most of them are ones people don't kill.  The only way to raise skill is to kill these things in mass quantities.  The only way to succeed is to make mass attempts.  Ever seen anyone killing sifaye?  How many people killing holgresh hang onto the furs, which weigh 3.5 and don't stack?<br>
<br>
Thankfully, 200,000+ people saw the folly of Verant's idea and voted it down.<br>
<br>
If you want to talk farmers... there's a simple reason zones are farmed.  People of the right level don't use them.  Now, those people like to blame the farmers for that, but the reality is it's the reverse.  When people in the 20's and 30's used the Temple of Cazic Thule and had it all camped, there were next to no farmers.  Now they don't use it and so high levels farm it.  Don't blame the farmers.  Blame people who should be in the zone but aren't, who instead are all hanging in some outdoor zone.  They are to blame for not using their dungeons.  They've got no right to complain that that one day they wish to use it that the spot they want is camped by a high level.  They abandoned it.  Want to see the farming end?  Get outdoor zone xp nerfed to half or a quarter of what it is now.  Get people out of Lake of Ill Omen and OT... and back into the dungeons.  Then the camps will be taken and so farmers will go elsewhere or be able to buy what they want for a reasonable price.<br>
<br>
Use your dungeons and they won't be farmed.  It's that simple.<br>

<br>
I'm used to the Diablo system where most items were usuable at a certain level and only if you had the right attributes. Not so much restricted by race/class like EQ, although this has been changed slightly in the Diablo expansion.<br>
<br>
I hear most grieve players express their problems concerning the balance in this game. Personally I think there is only one big reason for unbalance in this game : equipment. Like a lot of others I couldn't understand why people twinked their characters until I could, and did, it myself.<br>
<br>
This game is all about min/maxing, most damage, uber loot ... the game invites you to do so because you will level faster and die less with the same payer skill. You can't gauge the skill of a player unless you spend time playing with him. A simple inspect will show you how well equiped he is. And I did hear remarks of others shoosing twinks over others or peeps advertising their uber outfit clearly when LFG.<br>
<br>
Of course there is nothing against a high level character trying to get his polar bear cloak himself instead of buying it in EC. Or doing a quest that could have been done ages ago. <br>
<br>
The &quot;farming&quot; I'm so concerned with is using a high level character almost exclusively to get uber items for a twink. I don't blame people for doing that, I blame the game for allowing it.<br>
<br>
If you look at the rules of the new Roleplay server, Verant is seemingly trying to implement a different system. Trivial loot and more no drop items are clear signals. Not to mention you only have one character on that server. <p><BR>Felinity Venomblade</BR>

Yah and without limiting who can use what, they are going to screw it up big time<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Consider the drop rate on Umbral in Fear.  And the number of SK's.  What happens when that stuff isn't no drop?  Can you imagine RV being tradable?  It'll be a very good server to be a melee on.<br>
<br>
That server has some serious potential for going out of balance so fast it won't even be funny.  To properly pull it off, I think they'd need to put a minimum level to equipt on most high level items, at least most that used to be no drop.<br>
<br>
The one character thing is a mistake as well, I think.  If you are going to do a raid and you camp, you'll have no way to communicate with your guild.  Instead, people will set up chat rooms and people with 2 accounts will relay info.  Bigger hassle.  If you get bored playing your main for a bit, you've got no options.  If a buddy of yours starts playing, you can't make a new character to play along (but hey, you can twink the hell out of him).  If you can't find a group with your paladin, you can't play your druid/necro for a bit.  Giving people at least 2 characters would have been better, I think.<br>
<br>

Farmers CAN be stopped... it's in the PNP, if someone is farming and they dont get xp off the mob, they can be asked to move by players that get xp from the mob.<br>
<br>

I suggested they go there and work for decent armor for their levels and get some xp in dungeons. They were all, of course, too lazy to do it. Now I cut through there and do a /w I see maybe 5 people in zone, probably passing through also. What a joke. Then they complain about high levels farming? Remember when lower guk had like 50 people in it? Now you can zone in even on a weekend and see 16 people in there. Nobody wants to work for their levels or loot anymore. they all want to beg, work the outdoor (safe zones) and buy the stuff. Where are they going to buy it? Hmm, maybe from people who actually go to these places and quote &quot;Farm it&quot;. I suppose if we all started doing the same thing, nobody would have any good equipment. I think things are just fine the way they are and that is why I voted on every possible board against it.<br>

Negatory.  They've got as much right to it as you do.  You can make them share.  Alternating kills, that's all.  And they can do this right back to you as well.  That's right, a level 60 can stroll up and demand a bunch of level 10's share an orc camp with him.<br>
