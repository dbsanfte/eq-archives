And these are my idiot underlings Zorak and Motar.<br>Zorak: Ahh Shove it up your ass.<br>Motar: Yea yea shut up Space Ghost.<br>Space Ghost: *Smiles and Sits in his seat* Well now Motar who is our Guest Speaker for today?<br>Zorak: Your mom heh heh<br>Space Ghost: *Quiet for a moment* Was I talking to you Zorak? Maybe you want to be blasted?<br>Zorak: No<br>Space Ghost: Good. Motar?<br>Motar: Our guest speaker today is some guy named Dethen. Something bout being used and such and many people already know bout it.<br>Space Ghost: Well bring him in I know I have been double crossed and used in many of my great episodes. <br>Zorak: What makes you think your not being used in this show now?<br>Space Ghost: You know your getting on my nerves Zorak.<br>Zorak: So?<br>Space Ghost: *Stays silent for awhile* Alright send him in.<br><br>Down Comes a Screen and Dethens Picture comes on.<br><br>Space Ghost: Greetings Dethen. I am Space Ghost the host for this show.<br>Dethen: Hello Space Ghost Glad to be here.<br>Zorak: .....why is he wearing a Winged helmet on his head?<br>Space Ghost: *Tells Zorak Silently* Its his super hero helmet Zorak.<br>Zorak: *Blinks* oh.<br>Space Ghost: So anyway Dethen to start things off what Super Hero Powers you possess?<br>Dethen: Simple Paladin Package. I can Heal others, I can Paralize Enemies for 5 to 10 seconds, my specialty is the slaying of Undead.<br>Motar: wow. Better then what I can do at least.<br>Zorak: *Blinks*<br>SpaceGhost: I see. Well tell us about this &quot;using&quot; Prob you had.<br>Dethen: Well to put it quite simply theres this Girl who pretty much is used to being PLed and Twinked in my realm. Pretty much all her time spent in the realm she been Givin items and being Pled from people and pretty much screws them over later on. <br>Space Ghost: Ahh yes. Women like that do give a bad name. Makes them look Feeble and defenseless like the many women I saved.<br>Zorak: Yea Feeble like you.<br>Motar: *Chukkels*<br>Space Ghost: What was that Zorak?<br>Zorak: *Looks away*<br>Space Ghost: *Looks at him silently* Alright Dethen Continue.<br>Dethen: Well you see I been with this girl for bout 5 months. Befriending her and giving her all she wants. I Pled about over Nineteen of her toons since she couldnt decide what to use and I gave her bout 8 toons worth of twinks. Although she was aware of my Rep caused by flamers which im repairing as we speak she stood with me. But till she found a some guy who pretty much bought her friendship and He is pretty much her Computer Boyfriend which she told me she would never want. She then went and only be friends with him. Now it hit me that all the people who know bout this were right all along. They said I should have just ended it and not be around her anymore since she uses people. I have about 16 people saying the same thing. I didnt want to believe it hell no it took me over 5 months to finally believe it. Now she goes with him because he bought her the keys to the Velious and Kunark Lands. So pretty much she will use him all up till he has to go or she finds a better subject to her whims.<br>Space Ghost: Women like this make me sad dont women like this make you sad you two?<br>Motar: Definitely.<br>Zorak: Yea id tell her to kiss my ass before I give her anything.<br>Space Ghost: Tell me my friend. Did you try to battle this Snootay before?<br>Dethen: yes Space Ghost I have. But he kept declining. It seems he uses his Daddys toon to play. His Druid is not his its his fathers.<br>Space Ghost: Ahh a Daddys boy. Pretty Pathetic really.<br>Motar: Yea Pathetice heh heh<br>Zorak: I recall you being a Daddies boy Space Ghost.<br>Motar: *Bursts out Laughing*<br>Dethen: *Laughs a bit*<br>Space Ghost: Thats it Zorak! *Shoots his Laser at Zorak!*<br>Zorak: Ack! *Boom* ouch.<br>Space Ghost: Well now that thats settle you like to continue?<br>Dethen: Yes Space Ghost thankyou. Well after getting frustrated with her and she just screws me over I decided that its time she gets a little justice. But then after I cooled down I realized shes just a lost girl who lives in Maine and doesnt understand that people are not trusting like they are in Maine and that people are different. Shes merely a lost little girl. I thought of her as Tough but she clearly isnt.<br>Space Ghost: Ahh I see<br>Dethen: So pretty much I dont care anymore. Im free from her and she wont get a single Item or PL from me again. Her name is Savannah know it well she may try to screw you too.<br>I tried to ask her for forgivness again but she proceeded to have her Pencil dick, Weakling Daddies boy Comp BF which she never seen pics of post a flame of me on here and since this time I may have people backing me up I will post.<br>Space Ghost: You are Fearless I give you that.<br>Dethen: Always have and this is just a Dumb game after all. I dont give a damn what people think bout me only need to give the truth. Made no threats only threat I made is to bring there reps down if nessecary cuz I dont want to see other people used not even Snootay even though he deserves it.<br>Space Ghost: Thankyou Dethen. That ends the show for tonight folks I am Space Ghost good night!<br><br>Not posting again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubaddorranany.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Badd or Ranany</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 12:51:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://verbalsabre.50megs.com/images/fingersmiley4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Talk Show with Space Ghost Coast to Coast (A.S Version)</span><hr size=1> why the fuck is this here? i stopped when i found out Dethen was the guest.. *flips through channels* id rather watch Opera than you. <p><left><a href=http://pub49.ezboard.com/bdbn><img src=http://www.sonic.net/~goodrow/nation/sig.gif border=0></a></left> <center><font color="yellow"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7690" target="newframe"> Baron Badd Inglorin</a></font><br><font color="blue">Level 60 Grandmaster </font><br><font color="#48fe34">Train Lord!</font><br><font color="blue"><a href="http://www.sonic.net/~goodrow/darkbreed"target="newframe">Dark Breed of Norrath</a></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udadethemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dade the Mad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.theglobe.com/Dade_the_Mad/WEEDISINFO.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 12:54:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.miratos.com/forums/avatar.php?userid=121&dateline=1013055285 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Talk Show with Space Ghost Coast to Coast (A.S Version)</span><hr size=1> right, this day was comming *takes TV outside and prepares to shoot it*<br><br>little timmy: no... let me do it...<br><br>*timmy shoots TV*<br><br>Rabbi <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bryre>Bryre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 1:10:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Talk Show with Space Ghost Coast to Coast (A.S Version)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Not posting aga</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->[/b]<br><br>this is what? the 100th time you have said this on these boards?  /yawn<br><br> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><img src=http://www.miratos.com/images/midandthanboardavs/b_msig.gif><br><b><i>Bryre Blackmoor<br>53rd Wandering Dr00d<br>Senior Officer<br>Black Death Legion<br><br>Midniight<br>45th Cleric of the Healing Touch </b></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udarhews.showPublicProfile?language=EN>darhews</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 1:25:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Talk Show with Space Ghost Coast to Coast (A.S Version)</span><hr size=1> well personally, anyone that gets so worked up over a &quot;girl &quot; in this game is pretty pathetic. 9 times out of 10 I will be tthat &quot;girl &quot; is really a guy.

This is really not his style unless a) he is now taking his meds or b) that remedial English class has actually worked. <br><br>Also, Dethens thoughts tended to be scattered and fragmented to the point that he had to re-post 2 or 3 times in a matter of minutes in an attempt to write down all that shit pinging around his head. That did not happen here either. This was a well thought out, solid piece of drivel with a definite beginning, middle and end- all in one place! Highly unusual and suspect in my mind re: anything attributed to the &quot;Big D&quot;.<br><br>Another underlying problem is the actual length of the piece. Big D, due to what I perceive as a short attention span, found it almost impossible to create a long rant (which again led to his frenetic multiple posts within minutes of each other as alluded to in the previous paragraph). Again I believe this to be related to his rather spastic, Type B personality which would hinder and inhibit his ability to focus on the completion of such a magnus opus as this. This further lends credence to the theory that someone is attempting to gain glory by attempting to obtain the mantle under which the Big D is known to us.<br><br>Another flag that this may be a Big D imposter is the board name. I dont think he ever got banned from the boards (suspended by Raene yes but not banned, iirc) so I'm not sure why he would create a new board name to post under. The Big D use a 007 name but, iirc, it was Dethen007 and not Detho007.<br><br>However, the infantile nature of the posting vis a vis the use of a most beloved cartoon (Space Ghost) coupled with the Big D's penchant for /cyber with anything pixelated into a female form is well known. This lends a small amount of credibility that the poster is the Big D.<br><br>While I'm not a Dethen fan- those of you around for the Dethen post from hell should remember that- I'm not sure that this is him. If it is... then /gofuk. If its not then I pity the poor ass that has to create a name for a known soft target that will get a rise out of the flame forum population.<br><br>(Curtsies to the masses)<br><br>Hunt Safe <p>Haelion Caduceus<br>49 Cleric of Tunare<br>Black Death Legion - Officer<br><p align="center"><ahref="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/test3.htm"target="_blank"><imgsrc="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/mythresult/wyvern.jpg"border="0" width="330" height="175"></a><br>I took the <ahref="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/test3.htm"target="_blank">What Mythological Creature Are you?</a> test by<lj user=peacefulchaos> !</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzylc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zylc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 2:34:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Talk Show with Space Ghost Coast to Coast (A.S Version)</span><hr size=1> <br>The only mistake I made was not listening to my friends when they told me the first time to get the hell away from you.<br><br><br>/gofuk k? thx bye.<br><br><br>~ Sav<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umiratos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miratos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 2:58:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmm.</span><hr size=1> That is a lucid, intelligent, well-thought out flame.<br><br>Admittedly it doesn't fit his style though.

Your continued disregard of this advice has gotten you in more and more trouble.  You are digging your own grave my dear Dethen.

It occurs to me that he has a bad rep. So, hes done some not so bright things in the past, but maybe.. just maybe.. this time, hes telling the truth? Think about it, some girl knows his reputation well, decides to be the one who will stick by him, take everything she can get and move on. I  mean really,who would believe Dethen over her anyway? I am not defending him, or bashing her, but this is a possibility.I tend to rely on facts, and the facts are, she was informed of his reputation amd still spent time with him. If she was aware of his reputation, then why would she take PL'ing and items from this guy? Furthermore, WHY is she allowing Snootay to buy her extensions of EQ? How did Dethen find out Snootay bought her Velious and Kunark? He isn't a psycic, is he? There is something amiss here. I am very careful about who I trust and who I will allow to help me out in any given situation. I am the kind of girl who doesn't like to owe anyone anything. Just my thoughts here based on the human behaviors I've spent alot of time obseving in my career studies.  Very creative post by the way. Not like anything I've seen from &quot;Dethen&quot; in the past.  <p><p><table width=400 height=102 bgcolor=red><tr><td bgcolor=black rowspan=2><center><img src="http://www.trueborndesign.com/katsig.jpg" width=130 height=98></center></td><td valign=top bgcolor=black> <table><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=black><a href<img border=0 src="http://www.jeffschickenshack.com/images/LegendsTitle.jpg" width=320 height=30 style="color:#000000"></a></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=center bgcolor=black><font size=3 color=red FACE="Verdana,Arial"><b>Katrinity </b> 56 Beguiler</font><font size=3 color=red FACE="Verdana,Arial"><br><b>Kabrielle</b> 42 Shadow Knight <br>BONDS OF TRUST<br><i>"The Diva Inside"</i></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uelmasoulseer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElmaSoulseer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 6:08:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting...</span><hr size=1> Ever heard of the story of the boy who cried wolf? <p><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://home.mindspring.com/~matthewshears/linked/fontbehavior.css"type="text/css"><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD CLASS="mysigtable" ALIGN="CENTER"><AHREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50839">	(\__/)<BR>	(='.'=)<BR>	(")_(")<BR><A Href="http://www.raarcentral.com">Crusaders of Plilo</a><BR><A Href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/bflamecentral">Mystkal's and Alystin's Cyber Cafe</a></A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usnootay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snootay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#333333>(4/18/02 7:30:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting...</span><hr size=1> LOL..<br><br>The Druid was mine before Kunark, when I leveled him to 50 and was stuck there, and never had the desire to play him again.
