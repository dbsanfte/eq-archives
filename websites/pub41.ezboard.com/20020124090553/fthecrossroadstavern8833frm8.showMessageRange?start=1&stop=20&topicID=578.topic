I dinged 44 in RM doing the events. So I got to thinking, now that I'm nearing mid 40's is it just totally radical to not call myself a newb, eventhough there are still some parts of the game that confuse me.<br>
<br>
I know there are those who think once you hit 40 your considered not a newb. Then there are those who say 30, even 50. If I recall 50 sounds extreme since that used to be the games level cap. So Whats your opinion?<br>
<br>
Another question is why are there so many jackass monks lurking around? I saw one wearing one of those velious dragon helms and I asked him what it was called. No reply. Course I could have inspected but I know a lot of people hate that. He's not the only monk I've met who seems to get pissed off when someone asks him a question. I only know a few who are not like this.  Manazz, and Sushido are the only two who come to mind (thats not including me). I've met more Myrmidon's who are always more then happy to answer a question of mine then monks. Its a little sickening to be in a class that IMO is not too far from getting a stereotype of jerks.<br>

At 56, that means anyone that cons blue to me i dont listen to.  Of course, I'm just being a d!ck when I say that.  Luckily, Dizzee who's 57 hasnt shot back the same reply to me :)<br>
<br>
I will admit that the game changes post 50.  It changes again around 53.  And IMHO, it changes yet again 55+  THe mobs you go for are tougher, have more hps, take more planning and tactics.  The zones you fight in for exp are busier, you spend more time in dungeons too.  Raiding changes the game yet again.  There are people who strictly raid.<br>
<br>
As for not answering .. people are assholes.  Dont take it personally.  Manazz is cool cause OoH let him loot the monk BP/Robe and Legs from PoG .. other than that, he's a suckapants ;p  <br>
<br>
As for inspect, fuck em.  The ones that bitch about it i spam-inspect.  What's the worst they do, ignore me?  Christ, you'd think people with cool gear would be Flattered you are impressed enough to check their gear out.  To aspire to get it one day.  I only hope everyone has their velious graphics on when I get my BP or Helm and ask me where I got it :)  BTW .. PoG armor is Golden, you find that out when you turn those Velious graphics on /blush.<br>
<br>
You're always a noob man.  There are always people that know more than you, play better than you.  Never forget that.  For all the knowledge I think I have, there are tens of dozens of people who have twice as much.  I may be a half decent cleric, but someone like Baffles or Harthek or Success or omg the dozens of people i /Salute daily have SO much more knowledge.  I may know which way to Disco and how to not aggro mobs on the way there, but I dont know shit about King ... So to answer your question, when the Yellow bar of Exp doesnt go any higher, when there arent any zones you dont know without a map, when you know and have killed every mob in the game atleast once, and when Verant asks you if you want a job, then you're not a noob.  Until then ...<br>

I don't hear blue cons :p<br>

By level 20 you SHOULD have a firm grasp on the concept of playing EQ. The learning curve isnt that high. Those that make mistakes in their pre-20s are indeed N00bs. Those that make mistakes post-20s are inept, and should consider going back to Quake or UO.<br>

Or is that being too critical, and expecting too much?<br>

<br>
I would think by late 40s people should shed their noob status.  I would think they've gone on one or two big raids, whether it's The Hole or a Plane.  You dont learn a TON by exp farming.  Assisting isnt critical, as 9 times out of 10 you're pulling one, maybe two mobs.  I mean shoot, i was playing my level 19 twink monk in omen yesterday and when 4 came in, i just picked off one and soloed it :)  Not that I'm amazing or anything, just that the mobs can be more easily handled.<br>
<br>
Now be in Fear and get a few Apes and FF's and dont assist, and you'll be sitting in Feerott a few hours :( <p><b>Never argue with a fool.  People at a distance won't know who's who<BR></b><body bgcolor="#000000">

The first time I played the game I got lost in Felwithe eventually fell in the water.  Drowned.  Found my way back into the city.  Fell in the water.  Drowned.  Found my way back into the city.  Then an UBER level 10 magician saw me wondering around and offered to help me find the guild.  Shocked and amazed I gladly went with him.  Fell in the water and drowned on the way.  Found my way back into the city, and eventually followed him right to the guild hall.  At the time a level 10 magician was trully Uber and I was a Newb.  Since then it all keeps changing.<br>

<br>
I thought there were 5 planes, Fear, Hate, Growth, Sky and Air (Mischief .. yah right .. what is that?)<br>
<br>
There are just alot of things I have yet to see or do in the game. But that's just my personal point of view<br>
<br>
Most people however think newbie = lack of experience, ... not experience you gain from killing monster, but from doing stuffs in the game. <br>
<br>
Let's say as a monk (puller) like you .. from my experience in City of Mist and Black reavers<br>
<br>
ExperiencedMonk01, pull reavers one at a time, well coordinated with the rogue (picklocking FYI)<br>
<br>
NormalMonk01, must be told on what to do by guild, but know how to split pull.<br>

I am sure you have played the game long enough to realize that the minute someone disagrees with how you are doing something (I.E. not in alignment with their vision) they will most probably be calling you a newb.  Knowing that, and knowing that I have played the game since it's retail inception it's just a term that carries little weight.<br>
<br>
Unless of course you pay money to worry about what others think of you?<br>
<br>
There was no 'pissing match' that you speak of so go find your drama elsewhere.<br>

<br>
It doesnt have to do with your Lvl or the fact you think you know everything about the game .. cause lets face it .. EQ is like Autocad ...   I dont care how many years and how good you are at Autocad .. There is just so dam much you will never know it all.<br>
<br>
Newb to me is also like you stated .... Ask Someone a question (provided its not something stupid like Hey can i have money? or can you come Powerlvl me?)  And they ignore you  Becuse they feel they are Uber and you are Beneath you ..,  That to me is a Newb .<br>
<br>
I play the High End game .. im 60  ..  There is a HELL of a lot i dont know about EQ yet .. i dont care im having fun ..  And responding to tells even if to only say "sorry im busy atm" is only courteous.<br>

Regardless of the event that took place I'm interested to hear your point of view. Maybe we can clarify a missunderstanding. I for one am not afraid to apologise when the occassion arises for it.<br>
