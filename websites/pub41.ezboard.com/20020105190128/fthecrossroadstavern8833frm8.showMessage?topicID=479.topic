In a way, they are the simple things I have always enjoyed in this game.  Enjoy and add to this list if you want. =)<br>
<br>
1.)  Ever been to Qeynos?  There is a named gnoll there called Fippy that regularly yells his disdain upon us.  Then, he makes a mad dash for the gates leading to the city.  Where the hell is he going?  Doesn't he know he has to zone to even get to the other part of the city?  Is he being a martyr for his brother gnolls?  Doesn't he realize he's going to be killed yet again by the guards, thus denying us the pleasure of doing it?<br>
<br>
2.) Ever notice the apparent lack of disrespect Orc Pawns get in Crushbone?  No?  Attack one!  It always shouts out for aid from legos and cents, and they NEVER come to their aid.  DO the legos and cents laugh behind the poor orc pawns' backs?  Such ridicule, I am glad we of the more "enlightened" races don't exercise. *coughs*<br>
<br>
3.) How the hell do I forage ANYTHING while levitate hundreds of feet above anything?  And where did I find the time to skin the entire rabbit?<br>
<br>
4.) Yes, my shaman DOES own the "True North" spell.  No, no one has offered me any donations for me to point north out to them.  Why isn't there a true south, east and west, with maybe a research or quest spell called True North East?  And WHY oh why does this spell cost around the same as a compass? =p    The only use I have found for it is if a n00b is begging off of me from the south and I want to turn my back on them REALLY quick.  Still is quicker to turn around normally, but with less of a dramatic effect.<br>
<br>
5.) If I catch a fish scale, while fishing, does that mean I was THAT close to actually catching the fish to whose scale that belongs? And how are we fishing anyway if we didn't buy string or a hook?  A pole and bait is all we need?  Looks like I got ripped off at the sporting goods store.<br>
<br>
6.) You ever notice how quick the hostile races promote from within?  "You have slain a Solusek King" --- 28 minutes later, "KING!"  Again?  Didn't we kill their last one about thirty minutes ago?  This goes for all positions, tactician, curator, etc..<br>
<br>
7.) Bixies...What's the POINT???!?!?! And where is that damn hive of their's?  They always remind me of that video by Blind Melon, song is called, "No Rain" I think.<br>
<br>
8.) Finally they are bringing horses to Norrath.  Great!  No bring some cows, I am sick of rations and could use a nice big steak!  Fish rolls?  Bleh!<br>
<br>
9.)  Why do some mobs accuse me of ruining my homelands?  Last I check, my homeland was fine, and I don't think I am there enough to even contribute to any digression to its state.  Why am I so falsly accused?  It's even worse when they say, "I really hate monks like you."  Like what?  They don't even know me.  <br>
<br>
Final observation:  How the hell do the guards of ANY city across Norrath, KNOW religion I am just by looking at me?  Here I am in inky disguise...guard of Neriak says, "Bill, can't let this guy through, it's obvious he worships Brell. " Other guard says, "Damn, Chuck, you got a good nose for houses of worship!  Attack the infidel!"<br>
<br>
Ok, had to get that off my chest.  Have a great day everyone. =D<br>

<br>
It's also funny how while flying and foraging berries, grubs, and other assorted stuff is up there with us.  "ACK radar is tracking a bunch of grapes flying right toward us."  "VEER LEFT!"<br>
<br>
While I am still on foraging, how come, in all my years of foraging, did I NEVER forage a fish while underwater?

Fippy's a loser but he still keeps on trying. Have you heard? I actually calculated that, given a spawn time of 5 minutes, Fippy dies every 7 seconds if you count 41 servers.<br>

2.) Orcs would help the pawns but they're chronic procrastinators. It's the same reason they haven't overwhelmed Kelethin yet. They haven't gotten around to it.<br>

6.) What bothers me is how they reproduce so fast. Have you ever seen a female orc?<br>

7.) I could use a variety of puns here, but I think I'll just skip it.<br>

8.) I'm just wondering when the first Antonica Derby will be held.<br>

OMG!  HAH!  You are right.  Someone call the labor board!  These guards are overworked.  No wonder they are so grumpy.  Why are there so many citizens of Highhold homeless?  All they do is stand outside, come rain or sunshine.<br>
<br>
I also have a question about who are our enemies.  Maybe it's just me, but I feel kind of guilty for having to always go to where the "bad guys" live to keel them.  What makes them so damn evil?  It's not like they ever attack our cities?

A great kobold15 leaves and is slain right outside their door.<br>

"Looks like they came back before we could get reinforcements at the door.", says a solusek champion01<br>

"Crafty buggers", growls a solusek kobold21<br>

A solusek kobold03 looks around, "Why does it take us about 30 minutes to reinforce the door?"<br>

A solusek shaman09 shrugs, "It is written.  I am just glad you didn't ask where they came from.  You are not ready for THAT talk yet."<br>

All is quiet!  Too quiet!<br>

A solusek champion01 "WTF?  They got the King? How? Why?  OMG!  I have failed!"  He begins to sob!<br>

A solusek kobold03, "Looks like 06 is going to be promoted!"  <br>

A solusek kobold21, "Give him the axe!  We'll show these infidels the true meaning of disappointment."<br>
