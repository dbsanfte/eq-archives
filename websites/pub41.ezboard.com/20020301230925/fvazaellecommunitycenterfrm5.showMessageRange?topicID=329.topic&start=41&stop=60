Of course we are not talking of life and death, I think that is pretty bloody obvious, and anyone who would use that as an attack against it is missing the point of the message or trying to sweep it away.<br>
<br>
Lets take a look at feudal society as an example for you narrow minded people who could not grasp the overall concept in Thumps post. The people at the top will continually gain in wealth and power and the people at the bottom will consistently struggle and stay at their low status. The system allows for little movement between classes and The landowners can ensure they stay atop the totem pole, while the people under them always remain there. The economic example is much more accurate to the world of EQ and the effects people can have on one another.<br>
<br>
If you want to be a greedy selfcentered player then just admit it. I am sick of people saying the game forces to be the way they are. YOU decide how you act in the game. This is not a PvP server and if it is a dog eat dog world that is only because certain players in control have made it so. <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 11:32:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The servers attitude, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> I get it, I just don't agree.  You simply cannot compare real life suffering and starvation to people not getting to kill a monster that they want to kill in EQ.  That's such an incredible slap to the face to anyone who has ever faced starvation.<br>
<br>
In fact, it's incredibly ignorant to even use an example like that.  I mean, seriously, if you brought this up to someone who has faced a real tragedy and attempted to compare, they're have every right to throttle you, heh.<br>
<br>
&quot;when I was young, we had to duck under our dinner tables while we were being bombed.&quot;  &quot;if you think that's rough, my EverQuest guild couldn't raid the Plane of Fear last night because some other guild took it from us!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Hah.<br>
<br>
The point you're not getting is that none of this should hurt anyone.  The second that anything in EQ causes you pain and suffering, you need to stop playing right away.  If you're hurt by what anyone in this game does that's within the rules, you need to stop playing.  Right now.  I mean, delete it from your system and break the cd.  If you're hurt by things that happen in EQ, the fault lies with you.  You're the one not playing the game properly.  Step back.  Talk to someone about it.  <br>
<br>
This is why you can't apply real life examples that involve suffering, oppression and pain to EQ.  These are all very serious things that destroy lives.  EQ should not have the power to do that to you.<br>
<br>
I see real suffering in life, and I have a lot empathy towards those suffering.  It pains me to see people really hurting.  It will never pain me when somebody sitting in front of their computer cannot get a chance to kill the god of fear, Cazic Thule.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugenobi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>genobi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/01 4:55:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server's attitue, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> Did you even read what Tropic's wrote Ceros?

Your guild prepares 60 people for an event, all excited, spent weeks discussing what they are about to do for the first time,<br>
they have done test runs, training, e-mail, guild postings, baby sitters hired to care for the kids, this is real life excitement for those doing it the first time.<br>
People are even truly nervous and some scared, yes scared.<br>
This is what makes the game fun, this excitement, this part right here.<br>
This is real life part we are talking about.<br>
Then some uber guild says, hey lets go take Fear 4 hours before their posted scheduled raid. A raid scheduled on the calendar for over a month. And why you say? Because you could.<br>
Do not think that does not affect real life people, and real hurt.<br>
Because if you do, then you are in denial trying to justify your own actions.<br>

No one here is right or wrong. Everyone can push the rules to the limit if they want to.<br>
<br>
My guild was once trained with Lodizal while buffing up for it by a guy who post alot about rules on these boards atm. Most of us were lvl 50 and after Lodizal had eaten us, the other guild, now disbanded, killed him. We petitioned cause its not right to train other people. I dont like whining and PnP but training is lame. A lvl 40 monk can make sure a full IV raid fails to Trakanon. I have a screenshot where a guild on Fennin Ro gets trained with 6 other dragons while trying to kill Myga.<br>
<br>
In neither case did a GM observe the action and nothing happened. Well, they get angry but move on. But this just gets a circle going. Manners gets worse and enviroment gets spoiled. Like Topics I played on TZ and even though a guild had the power to kill Trakanon it was prevented several times by a single monk from a cross teamer guild. Petitions are rare on a PvP server and some may call it whining but when 1 individual ruins the game for a whole guild......thats too lame just too ignore and move on. (If you played PvP you will know that you cant prevent a guy hitting you with 20+ mobs even thought you can attack him.)<br>
<br>
This is stuff that can happen when moral is going bad on a server. I dont say thats right or wrong and I'm not to judge. What you do within the rules of the game is up to you and not me. But what I do within the rules is also my own choise. So lets get down to the point.<br>
<br>
I played a little game with some persons of a guild on this server (Fill in the names yourselfs, it shouldnt be very hard). I told someone that if they jumped (by my views not verants rules) my guild taking down something I would bend the rules to the extreme to suit my own needs towards them. An example could be. I order my guild to follow the guild in question on their Vulak raid. Its always nice to observe and since Jaydrox statet at Ragefire that everyone can be whereever they like at all times it should be no problem. They jump Vulak and almost succeeds after a huge effort, but alas, they lose in the end with Vulak at low life. Vulak loses aggro. Hey, its non aggro. I means, wow, CHARGE. We kill the mob. Thanks for the preparations, would you like to see our loot?<br>
<br>
So later on I was contacted by another member of that guild trying to convince me that it was wrong of me to take such actions. One of the arguments was that guild B waiting for guild A to fail couldnt kill the mob alone, but Verants rules dosnt mention this anywhere, so again its subjective views and who cares about those? Nobody, we use the rules. I asked why I was wrong and he was right? It was merely the same as his guild had been doing just on a grander scale. After a few minutes exchanging arguments, in a friendly manner all the way, he wasnt able to prove me wrong. Its easy to argue when you can use peoples own arguments.<br>
<br>
This is not a rant but a try to open some eyes. This game is played for fun and you cant guarantee fun for all but its only fun as long as it isnt YOU who get stomped. Its easy for the big guys to stomp the small but its not impossible for the small to stop the big guys.<br>
<br>
This server is far from ruined. Its a good server and just as Wumple points out, I have lots of fun playing. I'm even proud of the uberguild from Vaz when I speak with my friends from other servers. I have many friends and few enemies though I see the risk of this post getting me a few. (Dont visit the boards if you dont want enemies, people comin here have way too much time on their hands, including myself) As many people seems to have forgot I was one of the people that 'forced' this server to become FFA. I'm a strong supporter of FFA but I'm also a strong supporter of mutual respect.<br>
<br>
If guild A made a load of work to get to mob X, I belive its good manners to let them have fun trying it. If guild B wants to kill it while guild A is doing CR, fine with me but expect everyone else to play by those rules and try not to point out why you can and they can't.<br>
<br>
Draw whatever conclusions you want from this post. I was bored at work and had to post something.<br>

<br>
Just like you need to be a certain level before you can kill various mobs, you also need to have a certain level of dedication to do some of the bigger activities in the game such as plane raids.<br>
<br>
The calendar isn't part of the game.  It's a communication tool, not the law.  It may suit your play style, but it's not ideal for others.  Personally, I don't like calendars.  However, this isn't a debate about the calendar.<br>
<br>
You're depending on a tool which is unreliable.  It's not going to guarantee your guild a trip to a plane.  Believing that it will, depending on it to do that for you will lead to the disappointment that you and your guildmates felt.<br>
<br>
There was a high end game in TeamFortress.  There were top clans and leagues.  In order to play at that high level, you needed to be dedicated.  You needed to play a ton to get your skills up to make the clan, and once in, you would usually need to attend two practices and two to three matches a week.  It was relatively demanding, and not everyone could cut it.  Most people wanted to be in a top 10 clan, but most would never be.  That was disappointing to a lot of people, but that's part of the nature of the game, that's life.  You get back what you put in.<br>
<br>
The high end game in EverQuest requires dedication too.  You need to play a lot.  You need to be in a guild who plays a lot, and if you want to kill the same mob as another guild, you will either need to make arrangements with them or race them to it.  Most players want to see Veeshans Peak and Sleepers Tomb, most players will not.<br>
<br>
In the case of Fear, it is a plane that you will usually get away with scheduling.  The respawn is only 12 hours for most mobs, so most guilds don't mind waiting a day or two.  The only time a guild like IV needs to be there is to kill Cazic or to kill a mob needed for an epic, and Cazic will usually only be up one or two days a week.<br>
<br>
You seem like a nice guy, and I empathize with you and everyone else,  but life changes in the high end game.  Sometimes things change in ways we don't like or in a way that doesn't suit us.  That's life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugenobi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>genobi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/01 11:32:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server's attitue, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> Ceros,<br>

And that we are the ones causing it cuz you had fear scheduled when CT pops, try something.  Try putting Trakanon, VS, or Ragefire on the calendar.  I am willing to bet that PO, SF, TE, IV, Agony(you guys need a two letter abbreviation btw), or CC would get there first.  Why?  Because you can't schedule uber mobs.  People race.  All those guilds I listed race.  All of those guilds have lost a race.  I'm sorry CT pops in fear, but to say we are evil for racing to a mob, or expect us to have to defend said racing, is wrong.<br>

If you feel guilty about what I said, cool, but do not try to push what I said further than I said it. My comments were based on Ceros statement about not being able to help himself grabbing all the goodies. And no I do not feel that is representative of IV. If there are individuals that believe that it is their obligation to grab everything that can requardless of what they do to others, that is them, not the guild.<br>

Hope that is clarified.<br>
As Ceros said, he understands, we just do not agree, and hey that is cool. There is no need for everyone to agree. I would think when you are stepping on someone, you would not expect them to like it or agree.<br>

I simply believe that guilds have the right to play like this, and believed that even when I was in a guild that was being stepped on.<br>
<br>
A distinction needs to be made as well.  Large guilds or 'uber' guilds generally aren't loot driven, we're accomplishment driven.  We're ambitious.  We have goals, and need those items to accomplish our goals effectively.  It's not about personal greed.  I, like other members, gave my best items back to the guild when I left EQ -- even knowing that I'd probably be back some day anyway, heh.<br>

<br>
As many have said due to the climate of the server, people have no choice to race.  I'm not trying to argue the merits of scheduling/not scheduling--but to say that The Endless or any other guild you listed race for any other reason than being forced to race, in my opinion is less than correct.  <br>
<br>
You are not evil for racing to a mob.  Racing is not necessarily wrong either.  But Baldrik put it the best...  it is about respect and having fun.  <br>
<br>
I understand the desire for competition.  I know what it feels like to get pumped up before a match.  I just wonder if the thrill is in accomplishing something--or ruining someone else's fun.  Or is the thrill in a piece of gaining an item.  Yes, I understand that X item is important to do bigger things.  But is it worth taking away positive experiences from others.    <br>
<br>
BTW, I honestly do believe that most people like to earn the goodies they get.  Just tossing someone &quot;scraps&quot; isn't really rewarding--except for the individuals that are truely loot-centric.  <br>
<br>
As many have expressed...  I fear that things can only get worse from here.  With the level cap of 60--eventually things will level out.  When everyone is on a fairly level field, things will get even more competitive.  Things will get ugly.  You know the training, KS'ing, PnP'ing that happens on other servers--prepare to see it in a zone near you....  UNLESS, people take pro-active steps to fix things.  <br>
<br>
You don't have to do anything really...  As long as you play by the letter of the law, you can play the game as you like.  But I believe, like everything--there is a spirit of the law which is lacking and that will eventually turn Vaz into major chaos.  <br>
<br>
G'adventuring to you all.  <br>

<br>
As far as IV goes they should not take this as an attack on their character alone. There are lots of guilds/people on this server that would stoop to any level not infringing on the PnP (and sometimes stepping all over it) to get what they want. IV does not really affect many people on this server for the most part. They are usually camping in zones where they have no competition because noone else can fight in them. I do remeber the attack of IV members both current and old when SF took a schedueled PO naggy raid. They stood up for PO and said that was wrong, I commend them for that and will say but for one instance they have always treated people I know with respect. I have received a free spell from IV when they had no use for it, one of my best friends in the game was brought to PoG to recieve a free BP when IV could not use it, and a large portion of my friends and ex guildmates are now members of IV who I know are honorable. IV has done a ton of good stuff in the game and that is what made me so shocked on the one instance I saw that they took advantage of their power. They nevertheless are still up in the long run for being a decent uber guild. I dont see them becomming one of the feared Ebay famring guilds of old server horror stories.<br>
<br>
Let us not forget though that the calender was created by a IV member and for the first two months of its existense was in use and followed by IV. If the stance of IV is now FFA then it has changed to that from the old policy they once held to. <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukruizigrrl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KruiziGrrl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/01 8:51:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://serun.homestead.com/files/verasmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The servers attitude, not a rant but a plea!</span><hr size=1> Honorable?<br>

I have been in IV since January, I don't remember a time when we were in interested in using the calendar as anything but a communication tool.  Let's not turn EQ into a lethargic clockwork tedium.<br>
<br>
You're certainly right in saying that IV has done a lot of cool things for non-IV people, and will continue to do so. Still, we have our own goals and beliefs, and I don't expect our philosophies, as a guild, to change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uhasuuuu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hasuuuu</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.vazaelle.dk/menybild.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/8/01 3:24:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I would like to beg to differ...</span><hr size=1> ---------<br>
I just have one note. If we fail on a mob, you are more than welcome to try that mob. However, if you don't wait for it to regen to full, by verant's rules, that is a ks. I know as it happened to my old guild on Lanys. Your guild will recieve a warning. If you just wait for it to regen to 100% health, you can then try that dragon we cleared to solo. If you don't believe me, be sure and check with Brettan before you do anything crazy  <br>

<br>
&quot;You may not steal kills.<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission.&quot;<br>
<br>
From everquest.com. Dosnt state anything about a mobs life so its up to the server GM to resolve the issue. Maybe you're right and maybe you would try to petition the party involved, but if the GM didnt see it I'm not sure he would do anything.<br>
<br>
But if you really are rulemongers did IV contact a GM when they pulled CT in front of TE/SF? Cause:<br>
<br>
&quot;You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br>
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would&quot;<br>
<br>
Again the answer is no even though rules stated they should. I agree that following those rules to the letter is boring. But again we return to respect. I'm sure that TE/SF could be persuaded to take one more try and if they failed, IV could have the spawn. That would prolly be what the GM would have told the involved parties but was dialog attampted? I doubt it, from what I heard the puller just took the mob.<br>
<br>
Its the name of the game, competition, and Ceros points our Trakanon would be, and is, a race. Thats cool, we wanted to race TE to Trakanon once but we didnt have the people online before TE was at reets and pulling the lair. At that point its their try in my book.<br>
<br>
Again I'm not trying to whine or cry cause noone stole anything from CC yet and I have no reason to belive it will happen often. (I'm sleeping when most of this stuff happens) What makes me rant at this issue is the double moral.<br>
<br>
Lets say that you are camping Fingerbone hoop in Howling Stones. I pop by with a group and begin to pull mobs in south wing, the same spawns as you want. Would you just say: &quot;Hey, thats competition, cool.&quot; or would I be called lame and gay in ooc for stealing your camp? I think the last because it would suck for everyone if the server became like that. Its again a question about respect just at a lower level this time. Competition is nice but friendly competition is prefered.<br>
<br>
But again, clearly I have too much time at work.<br>

Loot wasn't the goal in fear that night, it was fun and helping out your fellow guild mate.  If we wanted to breed vultures, we could create another guild to follow In Virtue around called In Vultures who's gear consisted entirely of IV's droppings.  Or Promethian Disorder for ours, or Scavenger Fires for SF.....etc etc. <p>Galadriiel<br>

As far as the cazic thing, I wasnt there.  but I do know that there has been a gm present at the request of one of the parties involved at every other contested spawn I have been around for on this server, so I would not be at all suprised if there was a gm there for that.
