It should be 6 hour respawn MAX. The only reason Rydda'Dar is a big freaking cockblock of progression is because of the respawn time, nothing else. What if you had an instant respawn on failure? How many days would it take you to beat it? Not that many.<br>
How are they buggy though? Has something changed? I don't remember CC having any problems with direct bugs when doing HoH trials.<br>

It's been posted on PoN at least twice, CC officers never wanted to try the strat though thinking it required too much healing power I think it was but it only requires 6 clerics + spotters (no, not unreasonable many :P).<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For the CoD Script, personally, we've had almost 30 adds from uptop during a bertox raid and come out with a win, but that doesnt mean it's fucking right.

It's still something you deal with though and as someone said, if you don't have access to CoD you haven't tried. I think there actually was a pretty mobclogged zonein on one of our Bertox raids but that only resulted in a few death of nekkid people zoning in.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Promethian Order doesnt need any of these flags anymore (Cept RZ), but I'm seriously pissed that a bunch of retards that cant complete simple quests to get into these fucking zones are going to be in there fucking shit up for Triality, Appotus, and Walkers, Agony, EoD. It's just not right. We did the content without having to deal with hordes of newbs lagging out zones and training our fucking raids. You did it without hordes of newbs lagging out zones and fucking training your raids. Dont sit on your high and mighty seat from Elementals and tell people just to deal with it, cuz you wont ever have to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I manage fine grouping in BoT, even when there's 4 groups camping the zonein, 2 groups fooling around in earth plus people being lfg. I've done raiding there when there's been several groups in the zone. The whole design of PoP is wrong, you're cramming a whole servers population of 61+ into a few zones and it's just stupid. Maybe there will finally be a reason for these shitloads of people to finally level past 62 cause if I was somewhat casual I sure as hell wouldn't. I symphatise with the people who got the flags the hard way but that doesn't mean I think they should keep a stupid design. Fyi I do most my grouping in a couple of these zones: BoT, CoD, PoStorms and PoTactics. I won't have to deal with it? Maybe I'll feel it less as I only exp maybe 2 days a week but I'll notice it for certain and I believe it won't be a problem, especially not on Vazaelle. Hopefully there'll be more tainted planar essence farmed and sold to vendors for me to pick up.<br>

Seriously, if you refer to previous threads where I agreed with Lirael on that underequipped people should get the hell out of PoValor I still think so. Just as I thought that level 50 people activelly doing the VT key quest was kinda stupid.

I never had a problem with the &quot;rabble&quot;, heck I was a member of the rabble forever, /wave all you velk HOs thank you for the exp.<br>
<br>
You've gotten all nice and comfy with your &quot;this is my zone only&quot; but hey, you're almost past RZ already yourself, you'll smack SolRo without even noticing him being able to sting then you have elemental access. Then you'll have 4 new zones, 2 are easy to exp in, 1 is tricky and 1 requires some stunts but it's a helluva lot of exp spots and loots for you people. In the end it won't be that big a deal, you're all insulted with how your efforts are diminished but the fact is, PoP is just one freaking timesink before the elemental planes, you're almost through it and be happy for that, don't wish the shit PoP is on others, cause you have to agree with me, PoP is shit in shit out below elemental planes, dubious rewards, constant reflagging and ornate armor is basically nonexistant. With the change they're supposed to upgrade loots in tier 1-3 planes, maybe you'll get retroactive upgrades, maybe you won't but when it's upgraded maybe you can actually do the shit because you GAIN something from it beside 2 people getting a flag, so that people can spend they dkp/vdkp on actual items rather than trash that belong on twinks at best. Sure Anonymous Dominus, Triality and Walkers can try RZ, but can they beat it? I must say that's kinda doubtful, I mean, you don't exactly go from VT farming or less to killing RZ in a month, VZ and TZ would be more contested though.<br>

Have more faith in the content winnowing out these people. <br>
<br>
Also, groups themselves can help out by not taking ppl below a certain level for a given zone. <br>
<br>
In other words, let the players arbitrate this. I think they can do it. <br>
<br>
Personally i think these zones being opened up should have levels limits in place of flag reqs......i think it strikes the appropriate balance. <br>
<br>
At any rate. EQ is winding down for those for whom the game was a quest for &quot;who did what first&quot;...now it will become a home for those who simply like to master &quot;the game&quot; and nothing more. Oh, and don't forget the ever lovable farmers keke.<br>

Is any of these zones a challenge now? Hardly, what is so great about PoP zones is they actually REQUIRE gear, aa and levels. I had my first Seb group at 50 I think, velketors was np to get a group at 50 and exp sucked past 55. UP at least carried a semblace of a challenge but was it hard? no. Fungus Grove is the prime example of everything that's wrong in SoL, somewhat good exp mobs that hardly hit back and that most classes could solo... The only zones the would be acceptable are probably Cazic Thule and Umbral Plains, the rest are so easy and have such a &quot;crappy&quot; exp modifier that most won't go there unless they're nuts, this does of course not include situational exp like necros in maidens or paladins chopping skellies in acrylia. <p><center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpaddding="0"><tr><td><img src="http://cc.alderaan.nu/images/upload/elaenya/sig2.jpg" width="400" height="80"></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 9px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48007">Elaenya Holyglory</a> <<a href="http://www.vazaelle.dk">Caer Cadarn</a>> - Lord Protector of Vazaelle<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=256385">Moemi Twinklemming</a> <<a href="http://www.vazaelle.dk">Caer Cadarn</a>> - Archon of Vazaelle</td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pokerstroker>PokerStroker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/11/03 8:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2058.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fohguild.org/forums/avatar.php?userid=1463&dateline=1042134379 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMG!

Say gay SoE!</span><hr size=1> The timing of the announcement is kind of interesting for my guild...  We're a smallish, more family-oriented guild, so a lot of the stuff &quot;uber&quot; guilds plow through can be quite a pain for us.  We've had various members trying trials in pickup groups for months now off nad on, but have had no luck.  We finally got a core group of people within the guild to sufficient level to attempt the trials, and knocked it out on our 4th try.  This was, oh, 4 days prior to that announcement.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm happy that we won't have to go back to the trials to reflag other guildmembers as they're ready, but I also know that not all of our guild should be in those planes, either.  I hope that SoE maybe level-restricts those zones at a level higher than the 46 required for other planes.<br>
<br>
In any case, I'm at least happy I passed before this change - it was a nice feeling of accomplishment.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gotmayhem>gotmayhem</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2rwd9/patch.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 566<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/11/03 11:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2058.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2rwd9/patch.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> HAHAHAHAH</span><hr size=1> HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH...<br>

I can sit here and just about feel those 13 hour days raiding just to get flagged. In the mornings with CC and at night with PO. I know I'm not the only one who had spent so much time doing this.<br>
<br>
I didnt read everything here, Im one of those selective reader types, so if I repeat something that has been already posted or if theres another change that im not aware of. Then please just ignore me.<br>
I honestly think they should make those zones 60+ zones if they are going to open them up for everyone.<br>
Why?<br>
Well I know as far as chanter classes go, they are not going to be able to mez any of those mobs until level 61 when they get apathy, and im not really sure if that will even hold. I use level 64 bliss on all. Crowd Control is going to be real scary.<br>
I will not be grouping in those zones with any Pick Up groups (please dont send tells). I think everyone should be looking real close to the levels that they are inviting to group with them and definatly not invite an anon person.<br>

I still think there'll be a lot more lt blue stuff, old dark blue limit at 60 was err 46 I think and would likelly be 50 or 51 at 65, this would still make loads of those old exp spot contain lt blue mobs since the best exp was where you tried to kill the lowest blue con mobs possible as fast as you could. <p><center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpaddding="0"><tr><td><img src="http://cc.alderaan.nu/images/upload/elaenya/sig2.jpg" width="400" height="80"></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 9px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48007">Elaenya Holyglory</a> <<a href="http://www.vazaelle.dk">Caer Cadarn</a>> - Lord Protector of Vazaelle<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=256385">Moemi Twinklemming</a> <<a href="http://www.vazaelle.dk">Caer Cadarn</a>> - Archon of Vazaelle</td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=atong>atong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/11/03 9:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2058.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: blah</span><hr size=1> I only have PoV/S/BoT flags. You would imagine I would like this idea and have 5 or 6 more free flags for me but I don't.<br>
<br>
PoV is already as crowded as it can be. Every time I zone in there and do a camp check, every single camp is taken with 10 more people waiting for group.<br>
<br>
PoS is too quiet, I agree. Those giants are usually only be killed while people doing BoT flag quest.<br>
<br>
However, those zones are still not for people who doesn't have the skill or equipment to pass the trail. I've seen some not appropriate equipped or AA'ed tanks in PoV go from 50% life to dead in less than 2 seconds with a single 50% slowed mob (my bard slow) on them.<br>
<br>
Good thing is, those kind of tanks are still pretty rare. I don't need to worry too much while I do &quot;/ lfg all 60 65 shadow&quot; or paladin or warrior when looking for group tank. If they have PoV flag, usually they are good enough to tank there. If the zone is opened up to everyone, then I'll have to start asking what ac / hp / AA this tank has before inviting.<br>
<br>
And with the great feature of GY and easy to find 96% rez these days, it's no risk for anyone who wishes to attempt for phat lewt. To be honest, if I am level 50 and suddenly BoT becomes available to me, I will not hesitate to start organizing pick up raids on one of the four mini bosses every 6 hours.<br>
<br>
Heck, I'll bring in 20 of my level 50's guild mates (my guild isn't that high level) and raid the minis myself. I am sure they don't mind letting me loot all the spectrals and runes to complete my song book; beats /ran 100 in pick up groups...<br>
<br>
You will not see 10 ~ 15 level 50's lfg in BoT, but you will see 30 ~ 40 level 40's and 50's raiding there every 6 hours.<br>
<br>
This is just one random thought I came up with. I am sure there will be other major problems with opening those zones up to everyone.<br>
<br>
The only good thing that I may like about it is, this may actually stop the annoying farming team. (2 persons (?), multiply boxing 7 - 8 characters total, logs on within mins every time a mini spawns.)<br>

<br>
Actually, here is what they said..<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> To correct this, we will be increasing the level range of NPCs that will give 61+ level characters experience. They will have approximately the same range of NPCs available to them as they did at level 60, and should be able to gain experience in some of their old hunting grounds, as well as in Planes of Power zones.<br>
 <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now, I'm not a literary scholar or an English major, but it seems to me like they are going to increase the range that mobs will still be blue con to level 61+, allowing decent xp for level 65 to be gained in places like CT, DN, velks (castle), seb (juggs), and even some tier1 planes where crap turns light blue at like 63.  <br>
<br>
Of course, I highly doubt any of these places will still yield the xp of 2nd/3rd tier planes.  If they did, it would be a terrible move as these places are much much easier than 2nd/3rd tier zones and so shouldn't give the same level of xp, so I expect there to still be the same crowding in PoV, BoT, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyone know how they are going to &quot;reward&quot; us for already having all of these flags?  Not that I think any kind of reward will make up for all the bullshit we'll have to put up with as 2nd/3rd tier planes become even more crowded than they already are, but it would be nice to know what they plan on giving us for our hard work of flagging, flagging and more backflagging.<br>
<br>
Planes of Power was a high level expansion, it was geared towards raiding guilds and high level players.  So fuck all you little shits that got pissed off because you couldn't pass the fucking PoJ trials and complained about this, rather than getting more levels in tier 1 (still fucking good xp compared to the days of xp in CT and velks).  Fuck all you bitches that were too lazy to spend 20 hours on an alternate flagging quest to get an ENTIRE GROUP flagged for these 3rd tier zones, and whining to Sony about it.  While I'm on the fuck you warpath; fuck you, Venthos, not sure why, but fuck you.<br>
