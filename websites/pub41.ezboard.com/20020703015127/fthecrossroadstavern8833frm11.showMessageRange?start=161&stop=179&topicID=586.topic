People look to the past when there is a problem in the present and they cannot bear to look to the future. Have known people from every continent, and those that cannot show pride in their country without boasts I tend to avoid. The reason? Those who boast usually have the biggest problems, and to deal with their problems they overcompensate and glamorize their situation. <br>
<br>
To me, the adage of evolution is a strong one, I believe in reconstruction and improvement...history is a futile notion, entertainment at best for the people who know the truth are those that were involved...and here's a hint:  If you think you knew who shot JFK, or who invented radar ORIGINALLY (hell, if you believe the History Channel, Nostradamus came up with the idea of nuclear fusion) then you are behaving EXACTLY how the people who fed you &quot;history&quot; WANTED you to behave.<br>
History=story created by an individual to perpetuate an ideology...and don't look that up in Webster's or any other &quot;definitive&quot; text. It is my opinion based on independent thought, and another opinion of mine is that this world would be much more tolerable if more people relied on independent thought than forcefed propaganda.<br>
<br>
Sure, the Bible is fiction; you may think that your local news program isn't...or that the professor who taught you things didn't have an agenda...or that your government always gives you all the information they have at their disposal. At the risk of sounding like one of these who thrive on &quot;conspiracies&quot;, I say that nothing I have read here truly shows any independent thought. Everyone is in a rush to throw out statements that they can support because THEY WERE SAID BEFORE! AND BY PEOPLE WHO &quot;KNEW&quot;...<br>
<br>
Want an example? Here's one-On Sept. 10th, the strongest individual in the Northern Alliance's (Afghanistan) rebellion was assassinated by two men posing as journalists. They were allowed to meet him on the pretense of conducting an interview-the camera was in fact a bomb. This information was not, in all the hours and days following the World Trade Center bombings THE VERY NEXT DAY, disseminated to the public. Now, almost immediately, it was assumed that Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the bombings, and the media &quot;ran with this&quot; notion. Why then, would they not associate the death of the major figure involved with the resistance against the Taliban, with the bombings of the towers? Simple..because it would confuse the issue. Y'see...Osama Bin Laden was funding the Taliban in exchange for sanctuary for his terrorist group, the Al Qaeda. He was focused on crushing the Northern Alliance and with the death of the figurehead of that Alliance, Massoud, he was merely weeks from his goal. After a bloody civil war, Afghanistan would now be controlled by the Taliban unequivocably, the rest of the world was not interfering at all, the U.S. had backed off the support of Massoud (who was their conduit for funneling weapons/strategy in the Afghani resistance against USSR which was key to the fall of the Communist regime there) and the Alliance was sure to crumble. People might ask themselves:  Why would bin Laden, the very next DAY after finally ensuring victory over the Northern Alliance, instigate a war against the world which would certainly destroy the Taliban and all he had worked for in Afghanistan? In point of fact, the events after the Tower bombings were a foregone conclusion..the leader of the U.S. would do the politically expedient thing, focus the blame entirely on bin Laden and use strong public sentiment to back him in a &quot;war&quot; whereby he could shower a mid-east countryside with bombs, declare himself a victor and give &quot;closure&quot; to the issue. Tell me now how you know the &quot;truth&quot; about what happened, tell me now that the events of Sept. 11th didn't benefit the only group it could have benefited...the Northern Alliance. Tell me that there is &quot;proof&quot; that the individuals who piloted those planes were in fact funded by the Al Qaeda, tell me there aren't double-agents from every damn sphere of influence whether it be the Al Qaeda, Northern Alliance, CIA or even &lt;gasp&gt; Everquest guild. So...the events of Massoud's death were never highlighted, a quick blurb on the back pages of the newspapers, perhaps a quick line of text underneath all those images of the towers going down...because it certainly wouldn't be PRUDENT to confuse the issue, now would it? To me, this highlights the way history works, how democracies work (or dictatorships, for that matter) and is a simple irrefutable fact. You have to be compelled to find truth, you have to be able to dissolve any preconceived notions or aspirations of civic or national pride and be prepared to wade through a lot of BS if you are, in fact, interested in the truth and not just some support for your misguided boasts and rants, which then give you the ammunition to commit violence (thru actions or speech) against others. <br>
<br>
Because that's what all this inevitably leads to:  man's primitive desire to be violent, and all the history and subtext are just the means we use to achieve that end. Doesn't have to be this way.....but as long as people are intent on it, we will forever be mired in the past. This has been a public service announcement-NOW GO EVOLVE, DAMN YOU!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usnootay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snootay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/02 12:48:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=586.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a bunch of Sheep.</span><hr size=1> What the fuck did he just say and why the fuck did he take such a long time to say it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uscytheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScytheEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/02 12:48:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=586.topic&index=165>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tsk tsk</span><hr size=1> You were doing just fine until the words &quot;Want an example?&quot; popped out and you turned into a conspiracy crackpot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Are you a fucking idiot?  The Northern Alliance benefited absolutely nothing from September 11th.    In fact, they lost quite a bit.    They used to control about 10% of the country, but gave that land up to the central government and now control none at all.     And since they were an &quot;ethnic minority&quot;, they have very little push in the new government.<br>

Several cells may be given the same mission however they may not know what other cells are doing or even that who or where those cells are opperateing.<br>
<br>
Therefore the cell that went after the northan alliance leader most assuredly had no knowledge of the cell or cells that were hitting the WTC.<br>
<br>
Also something that is worth noteing that these cells are not strictly controlled  nor co-ordinated and no time limit has to be set to accomplish a given mission.<br>
<br>
To punch holes in your argument there was virtually no command and control structure for ther individual cells and the timing was set by opportunity not planning on at least the assasination attempt on the northern alliance leader. The Airplane crashing is something totally new and it took a lot more control and planning however I do not see a conspiracy here.<br>

<br>
&quot;tell me now that the events of Sept. 11th didn't benefit the only group it could have benefited...the Northern Alliance&quot;<br>

You may have intended to merely point out that facts are unknown, but this statement implies quite strongly that, yes Virginia, there is a theory.<br>

Elian, lol, doesn't quite count...but as to the countless times you've been lied to about significant matters (No, Monica doesn't fall in this category either) I suppose it is natural to be on the &quot;lookout&quot;. Bay of Pigs, Montgomery in Vietnam, Nixon, Iran/Contra, JFK assassination, Shah of Iran, Castro, the Phillipines, E. Timor, Trail of Tears, Ok City, Jefferson's slave children, Pearl Harbor, the Alamo...in one way or another, it took a LOT of time to get to the truth on these matters and countless others, and on many, it is still foggy. All of them significant in some way to the United States...and all of them involving speculation that was &quot;history&quot;, which wasn't true or wasn't expressed to the public. And yet Americans would fight to the death guarding the misperceptions...well, it seems to be a formula that has had some success, why not perpetuate it? As long as people obediently obey history, governments will always use it as a tool for motivation. It is in the powers-that-be best interests that we remain a divided globe, that people have notions that there &quot;country&quot; is superior to those around them, for how else would you get them to fight? And one thing I will grant history...it has always been the nations who are most willing to fight, to invade, to pillage, to conquer who have enjoyed the most spoils. My point remains...EVOLVE past this, give it a shot, it is inevitable that invisible boundaries separating countries be dissolved, that cultures meld, that individuals have a conscience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufeelyxdeekat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feelyx Deekat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#333333>(6/4/02 5:15:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=586.topic&index=178>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tsk tsk</span><hr size=1> DUDE,<br>
