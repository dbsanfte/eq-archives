<br>
Leather padding usually sells for 20-25pp apiece.  That's still decently low to make it actually economically viable.<br>
<br>
Swirling Shadows are not, though, at 85pp.<br>
<br>
At this point, I can only surmise that retards are selling to retards.<br>

I think I will add a comment here, though.<br>
<br>
The price of anything, whether it be a player made item, a dropped item, or tradeskill supply is what people are willing to pay for it.  That price is a function of supply and demand.  Lots of factors influence both the supply and the demand, and the market takes all of these into consideration.  Fairness has nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Lets look at one recent example, tae ew blood.  Farming tae ew blood requires a group of 50 plus characters, or a single pretty high level soloer, and its time consuming.  How much is a drop of tae ew blood worth? <br>
<br>
Well, the price of the tae ew blood is determined by the value of the end products.  Tae ew chain and tae ew weapons are pretty nice gear.  Not too long ago, folks were willing to pay 8k for a tae ew tunic.  Blood farmers could ask a price of 2k per blood.  At that price, my cost to make the tunic, taking the GM failure rate into consideration and the price of the other ingredients was about 6k, and I made a profit of about 2k.  The demand for tae ew gear has dropped significantly, reflecting many factors.  I can sell tunics for about 4k now.  If you want to price blood at 2k, I am priced out of your market.  I won’t complain about your price, but I won’t buy, either.  Are you willing to farm tae ew blood at 1k each?  Well, that’s your choice, and reflects the judgments you make about the value of your time and your other opportunities to turn your time into plat.  If you will sell for 1k, then I can make the tunics for an average price of 3500 pp, and so make a profit of 500 pp.  Its still worth my time to make tunics at that price, so, I’ll buy your blood at 1k.  And, for those following the tae ew market, you’ll see that it is now possible to buy blood for 1k.  There is now less profit for blood farmers and smiths, but a profit remains, nonetheless.  If demand for tae ew gear shrinks to the point where the time investment is too great to justify the return yielded by the price commanded by the finished products, then the farming and smithing will drop off.  <br>
<br>
Is anyone in the process guilty of “greed”?  Are the prices for the blood “fair”?  Are the prices the customers willing to pay for tunics “fair”?<br>
<br>
These value judgments are irrelevent.  A ranger will buy a tae ew tunic for the lowest price he can find, and no one should fault him for this.  If tae ew is too expensive relative to other comparable dropped or player made armor, he’ll buy something else.  <br>
<br>
A blood farmer will sell blood for as much as he can get, and will quit farming if the price gets too low.<br>
<br>
A smith will sell his tunic for as much as folks are willing to pay for it, and will buy supplies at the lowest price he can find.  If the profits get too slim, he’ll quit making that product.<br>
<br>
That’s just the way the world works, Norrath included.  Complaining about it is like complaining about the weather.<br>

If the end product doesn't give a product that has a perceived value higher than the bazaar prices for the components, then I'm not going to buy the components in the bazaar.   And no one else should, either.<br>

Oh, and don't think that just because you're doing it with a mule, know one will know who you are.

If you don't wanna pay that amount for tradeskill item you just have to farm it yourself or wait till the price drops. It usually does after some time...<br>

If they complain or get in my way, I train 'em. I take special pleasure in destroying assling druids, the shits. I just know the little sons-of-bitches would rip me a new one in the bazaar if given the chance anyway. They can petition all they want. Not like the volunteer customer service gives a rat’s ass these days.<br>
<br>
I just don’t flippin’ care anymore if it’s right or wrong to walk all over these jerks. This game has become too frustrating to put in the effort to deal with these pricks in a civilized manner.<br>

The reason people will pay 15pp for a silk swatch is because they feel their time is more valuable than their money. If you have 300kpp in the bank and would like to become a GM tailor... Will you go spend hours farming silks or go to bazaar and pay someone else to do it?<br>
<br>
On the flip side, if you have 0kpp then spending a couple of hours to get 200 silks and selling them for 15pp is a GREAT use of your time.<br>
<br>
It doesn't mean that one way is better than the other, it's just that people have different priorities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raiyaeq>RaiyaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1085<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/8/03 8:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2122.topic&index=58>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> yes</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you have 300kpp in the bank and would like to become a GM tailor...

I did most of my farming myself and I also found a person to farm for me with a reasonable price.  I'd say on my GM tailor route, I got pretty much 70% of the material that I farmed myself and 30% came from fair price sources. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=376166">Raiya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I bought my way to 250.  I ended up spending somewhere in the neighborhood of 350kpp.  I just kept watching in the bazaar for the components I needed and got everything ready for final combines as I went, then in one day I went from 188 to ~240.  I finished the last 10 points doing a few solstice robes and some cultural for sale.<br>
<br>
Farming is horrible.  Many of us really do not enjoy it, me included.  Raiya has a high tolerance for it, and it works for her, but most of us would rather kill Talendor, sell a CoF, and buy 15 points of tailoring components with the proceeds than spend 30 hours killing rockhoppers.<br>

The difference in price is time.  Time is worth something.  If I have leather padding and I want the plat in the next ten minutes, I sell at 10 pp.  If I want the plat sometime before tomorrow, I sell at 15 pp.  If I can wait a few days, I sell at 20 pp.  If I can wait forever, I sell at 25 pp.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to buy my leather padding at 15 pp and resell it at 20 pp, they are aren't gouging, greedy, or whatever.  They are trading time for plat.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the plat in hand now is worth the 5 pp to me.  Sometimes it is not.  <br>
<br>
Its not a moral question.  Its a question of how soon long you are willing to wait to collect your plat.  Time is money, in Norrath as anywhere else.<br>
