<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapter One - Robb</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Robb rapidly slid his dual blades from their scabbards and started for the portal out of the Wizard guild. All thought of learning had fled – this was instinct, pure and simple. He never thought twice about whether Loendar would be following… he had fought with the<br>
man enough times to know that he likely shadowed him both in step and haste.<br>
<br>
A brief moment of disorientation assaulted him as he leapt upon the glowing disc and found himself instantly outside the guild hall near the tunnel to central Felwithe. Loendar darted past him into the tunnel, being far more at ease with the feelings accompanying porting. <br>
<br>
The wizard is going to get himself killed charging in without backup, Robb thought as he quickly caught up to his friend. The sounds were magnified here, resounding off the structures that composed the heart of the Elven city, making it difficult to judge their exact direction. Loendar was still now - his head slightly cocked to one side…listening. Although not a tracker, Loendar had inherent abilities that being a child of nature granted elves and Robb was certain they were on the right path as the caster set off towards the city gates.<br>
<br>
That, at least, was good. If the fighting was still taking place at the bridge into the city, that meant that the defenders had managed to group and set up a perimeter. Getting past dug in attackers would be a lot more difficult than routing those caught without a foothold. His appreciation for the High Elf paladins increased a notch as he watched them rapidly deploying themselves – securing sections of the city in precise units.<br>
<br>
Loendar sped through the final archway leading to the bridge into Felwithe and the Paladin’s guild hall with Robb close behind….. too close as it turned out as he ran directly into the back of the suddenly immobile wizard. <br>
<br>
“Damn it, Loen – we can’t afford to stand here waiting for Tunare knows what to advance!” Robb swore. The fool caster was lucky he hadn’t been skewered on his long sword….in fact, Robb was lucky he hadn’t hurt himself trying to avoid it!<br>
<br>
With a grunt he moved to bypass the wizard which afforded him his first true sight of the guild courtyard and bridge – and he too found himself unable to move, indeed unable to process the carnage before him. In the space of ten minutes since the sounds of fighting had first reached their ears the battle had been fully joined, and the stink of death was already overpowering. Hundreds of orcs lie dead in the far tunnel and on the bridge itself, scores more floated in the waters to either side – their blood turning the water a sickly pink.<br>
<br>
The high elfs had their share of casualties as well, though thankfully nowhere near the levels of their attackers. Glints of elven steel – from armor and weapons could be made out buried in the piles of orcs but one could only guess at their numbers. <br>
<br>
The paladins had formed themselves into columns across the breadth of the bridge, upwards of 40 strong. Priests, clad in the blessed plate mail of their goddess were splayed out behind the lines… rapidly healing those who fell back injured. Watching the ebb and flow as the fighters charged forward with devastating effect only to be pushed back was reminiscent of the tide – a tide in danger of being broken by sheer force of numbers.<br>
<br>
And still they came…….<br>
<br>
Robb’s revere was shattered as a blazing pillar of fire plummeted from the sky, enveloping close to twenty of the orcs on the far side of the bridge in a thunderous explosion of stone and bodies. A quick glance to his left marked that Loendar was indeed the source of the attack and was in the midst of chanting another spell. Without another thought Robb tore towards the front lines, arriving just in time to wade into a fresh gap in the elven ranks. His swords slashed forward – one coming in high and falling away just as the shorter of the two blades flew upwards to eviscerate the closest enemy. Robb spun through the precise motions over and over, dropping any of the brutish foes daring enough to approach.<br>
<br>
Explosions shook the bridge beneath Robb’s feet as his friend continued his rain of destruction, sending hosts of the creatures to their graves. It appeared as if the press of the creatures had slowed – though due to a lessening of their numbers or some base instinct for survival he couldn’t be sure. Robb shot a look over his shoulder just long enough to see that Loendar had not chosen to relent – his hands working an intricate casting. Coated in sweat, his muscles taut from the battle, Robb returned his attention to those before him, catching a brief glimpse of something dark – darker than the orcs, moving on the far side of the bridge. Without having the time to worry about things lurking too distant to matter, he continued his progression into the body of the horde…slaying all he challenged.<br>
<br>
The nausea hit him like a wall, nearly dropping him to his knees. Through sheer force of will Robb maintained his grip on his swords and continued the motions that would keep him alive – slowly shaking his head to clear the cobwebs. Worry for his friend gripped him hard, as it had been many moments since he had heard one of the tell-tale blasts of the wizard. Allowing some of the paladins to fill in before him – maintaining the advances he had made – Robb dropped back and turned to check on Loendar. Where he expected to find his friend, instead he found the leering gaze of a dark elf in the throes of spell casting. With a howl Robb ran toward the creature, his swords ready at his sides. Quizzically, the dark elf seemed to glance over his shoulder, as if fearing that the attack was coming from behind… all of which afforded Robb with an unprecedented opening. With jarring force he drove both swords into the form of the frail caster… his short sword burying itself within the vile creatures belly as the longer of his blades found the space between the ribs to skewer its black heart. <br>
<br>
In that moment, the sickness that had washed over him faded… and in its wake Robb did fall to his knees. There before him, impaled neatly on his blades stood the form of Loendar, an expression of abject confusion upon his face. Without a word, the body of his friend crumpled to the ground.<br>
<br>
Echoing peels of menacing laughter rolled across the courtyard from the far side of the bridge as the dark elf enchanter reveled in his handiwork… <br>
