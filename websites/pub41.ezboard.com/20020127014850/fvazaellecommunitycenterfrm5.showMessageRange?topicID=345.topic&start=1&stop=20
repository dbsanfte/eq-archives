It leads to corruption and ass-kissing in the highest extreme. I don't like the idea of a guild awarding me loot that I have earned.&quot;<br><br>The only time this leads to asskissing, is if your in a guild of currupt assholes who do anything for loot.  If your in a guild of honest people, its not an issue.  IV is dictator loot(done by Krimzin)  It works out good, anything you say couldn't make me think otherwise about IV's loot system.  People who deserve the REALLY uber loot, get it first(Aegir gets a lot of uber shit first because he main tanks for us 99% of the time, as an example...)   As alwaysthough, there isn't enough loot to go around.  Most uber mobs drop 2 to 4 pieces of loot, and usually take 30+(sometimes 50+) people to kill.   Do the math.  It doesn't work.  sometimes you just have to wait your turn.  You can't always expect to be first.  <br><br><br><br>&quot;I don't like the idea of a guild claiming all gem loots on raids, then selling it back to me at a discount. I don't like the idea of a guild core leadership pulling certain individuals for their xp groups and leaving the necros/wizzies/mages/hybrids to fend for themself until they are needed as meat for a raid.&quot;<br><br>this really doesn't apply to one guild I don't think, but in general.  For the most part, if you have a good standing on the server, finding exp groups isn't an issue.  I think the problem with hybrids try9ing to find groups, is with *everyone* not just a guild group thing.  When people form groups, they look for warriors first, plain and simple.  If no warrirs are available, then you start looking for pal/sk tanks.  Its just one of those things.  People want to exp as fast aspossible, a warrior will use less mana for heals *usually* and give you more exp most of the time.  of course, if you have 0 friends on the server, its gonna make grouping REALLY hard for you...  go out, socialize, meet people in game, and you will get invited to groups if you have a good attitude and know what your doing(or if your a cleric/ench you'll get invited anyway)<br><br><br><br>&quot;If someone needs help with an epic raid, I don't like the idea of being forced to attend. If they need help, that individual should ask me as a friend, not as a laborer.&quot;<br><br>I'm not sure where your coming from on this one either.  Guilds are just a army of workers, hopefully if your joining a guild, you know people in it, and can call them your friends.  Which makes them = NOT laborers.  Not everyone can be the raid leader, I seriously doubt every cleric who has got their epic, could organize a raid to chardok.  So, what do you do?  You put it in the hands of a guild leader/raid coordinator in your guild.  They take the responsibility of leading hte raid. Everyone still knows what its for, to help a member of your guild.  (who should be a friend of yours....)  so... your not a laborer.<br><br><br><br>&quot;I don't like the idea of watching loot that could have been distributed within guild being auctioned in EC (you know who you are assholes.) If you are given an item by someone in your guild you don't auction that shit, you give it back.&quot;<br><br>I don't really need to say  much about this.  It sucks when  you see this happen....  <br><br><br>other than that i'm not sure what to say.  Just find a guild that you have friends in, and that you can live with.  I know there is some very dishonest guild leaders out there, but there are also some very nice ones.  It all depends on what your happy with.  Dictator loot or point loot or random loot.  Don't matter, if its done honestly, I see no problem with it.  Either way, be a little patient....   and it should work out.<br><br><br> <p><BR>"Don't try to making me speak of better English until the pot is not of calling you black, kettle.

Take the following example as my interpretation of what I understood of his post:<br><br>Guild_01 goes and kills lozidal and a shell drops for a cloak. Many people in the guild and on the raid could use the cloak and it would be a great increase from what they have. The cloak goes to the main tank in the guild so that he can do his job better. This is a fair move as it helps the guild and everyone do better things.<br><br>2 months pass......<br><br>Guild_01 raids Uberzone_03 and a cloak drops with 40ac and a bunch of nice stats. Many of the people who were at the Lozidal raid and also at this are still pretty weak in the cloak department using such items as Hooded Black Cloaks but the good of the guild requires the cloak go to he can use it to the best effect. The cloak goes to the main tank of the guild (same person as got the lozi cloak) as it helps the guild as a whole do better things.<br><br>2 hours pass.......<br><br>Ubertank of Guild_01 /auctions WTT/WTS Lozidal cloak for 40kpp or trade for a fungi tunic for my monk twink.<br>___________________________________________________<br><br>Now that is dead wrong if that happens. The use of the &quot;hand me down&quot; system in a guild is critical so that things such as this do not take place. The tank in question of course had the help of many guildmates in both encounters and was awarded the cloaks because he could use them to best effect when they dropped. BUT, when the Lozi cloak is no longer needed by the tank he should hand it down to another that can use it (and perhaps was on the raid if possible). If that warrior decides the cloak is his private property and should be his to sell for his own pleasure he is doing a major diservice to his guildmates that helped him aquire it. The SK's, Rangers, Pallies, and Bards of the world know we are the last people that will get loot on a raid when the people who can use it to great effect get first cracks. We have no problem with that but if a person who was given loot first decides they get to do with the loot as they wish once they no longer need it that is wrong.<br><br>I am not saying anything like this is happening as I have not wittnessed it but as far as what Herder said that is what I was able to grab from his post. <p>Tropics Delight Shadowknight of the Greenmist</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueeepersofregression.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eeepers of Regression</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/8/01 7:49:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> Argh..

You just said that a guild is &quot;for keeping a certain group connected so they can raid&quot; and now you're saying that it isn't for epic raids.  OKAY, maybe I'm taking you out of context, that's fine.  I'll give you the benefit of doubt and say that you're emphysis is on the &quot;source of labour&quot; for epic raids.  FINE.  Can't epic raids be fun? and not a source of labour? Maybe it's only fun when it's for your epic piece... /shrug.  I personally have never been on an epic hunt that I havn't had fun on.  Each one has its unique circumstances and situations, strategies to employ, how can this be labor?  Okay, so you're &quot;not in the mood&quot; to go help a guildy get their epic piece.  Then don't go.  what's so hard about that?  Just don't be upset if they're equally not as enthusiastic about helping you with yours.  And even if, &quot;you're not in the mood to go kill mob X&quot;, arn't you &quot;in the mood&quot; to help one of your good friend guildies get their epic piece and put a big smile on their face?  They're your guildy, so they're most likely your friend..  If not, you're definately in the wrong guild.  But saying you don't go, for whatever reason, the fact remains that if you don't participate much in your guilds activities, because you're rarely &quot;in the mood&quot; to, then what's the point of being in the guild anyways?<br><br>Guild coffer and kiss-ass loot whores? nobody likes them, but your definition of that is totally subjective to each person's point of view.  &quot;Druid A&quot; ports &quot;Leader&quot; is that kissing ass? I hope not.  Besides, most guilds give loot to people who deserve it, this is generally determined by how much time that person puts into the guilds activities.  I've rarely heard from any guilds that &quot;So and so shouldn't have gotten *this*&quot;.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I don't like the idea of an individual, whether guild leader or officer, determining who gets what loot. It leads to corruption and ass-kissing in the highest extreme.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Okay, under ideal situations, everyone would get loot every raid and everything would be fair.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't work that way.  This isn't kindergarten, everything doesn't always get split equally.  Inequalities will, and ALWAYS WILL exist when giving out loot.  It's a matter of minimizing these inequalities that is the goal of most loot provisioners.  To think that there's loot corruption in any guilds simply shocks me.  Once again, I've never heard of a respected, strong, guild that has had any cases of &quot;corruption&quot;.  <br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't like the idea of a guild awarding me loot that I have earned.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>I can't even fathom what you're trying to say with this statement.

Okay, once again, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that what you really mean is &quot;I don't like the idea of having to earn my loot before I get any&quot;.  THIS IS STILL VERY VERY VERY WRONG.

They assume all costs involved with that raid, whether it be peridots, pearls, porting stones, coffins, whatever.  You, as an individual, show up and fight and expect loot?  And even so, I don't understand what you're complaining about because many guilds give loot to non-guilded people at raids.  In my opinion, some guilds spoil non-guilded guests by feeling obliged to give them loot for coming.  Let me quickly say that if you're raiding with a guild for the first time, you really shouldn't expect much.. after a multiple # of times, yes, they should throw you something.  Reason being, a guildy will get loot, at best, maybe 1 out of 5 raids they attend.  So, a guest should be granted relatively the same courtesy.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I don't like the idea of a guild core leadership pulling certain individuals for their xp groups and leaving the necros/wizzies/mages/hybrids to fend for themself until they are needed as meat for a raid.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Well, obviously you havn't raided much.  EXP groups are non-existant in raids.  Do you mean the killsteal group? the killsteal group that generally gets a majority of the kills?

I will guarantee you that the exp that the average killsteal group gets LESS then 1/5 of the exp they would get if they were in a &quot;normal&quot; 6 person exp group in a &quot;normal&quot; dungeon.  Besides, in *most* cases, groups are organized for efficiency, not for &quot;exp fairness&quot;.  Verant has designed the game in such a way that the best loot in the game requires many people to attain it.  They have also designed the game so that these &quot;uber loot&quot; encounters do not yield much exp.  Please, don't confuse the words Raid + EXP.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;If someone needs help with an epic raid, I don't like the idea of being forced to attend.

Dictatorships don't work, people just say no and leave.  It's not about the guild leader telling the guild what to do, it's about the guildleader guiding the guild in a particular direction, its the actual guild that decides whether or not the goals are met.  Think about a guild the same way as a ship.  You need a captain to pilot the boat, simple as that.  The entire crew works together in whatever roll they have so that the entire crew can attain their common goal of reaching point A then point B, then point C.

The guild situation on Vaz is still very very new. Many guilds still too young and the old ones are either run by dictatorship (usually uber guilds) or run by votes (which usually ends up with ppl split in the end). The reason I am unguilded at 51 (Precarious feisty GNOME Rogue) is that the bigger guilds that I was invited to join were mainly already established cliques where all I could do was help on raids, rarely a guild group which left me LFG for hours on end. The other guild I was feeling the waters on was a nifty idea of Roleplay guild. They were still very young but fun loving and that was great but I was WAY over their lvls so again sat LFG hours on end unless I could support a raid somehow. Don't get me wrong almost everyone in those guilds were phenomenal ppl but after supporting many many many raids for everyone elses epic mobs and items, when it came time for me to ask for assistance, since I wasn't in a clique, all I got was the sound of crickets as in no one there to help or respond. /shrug guess since I have so many characters here no one knows me real well.
