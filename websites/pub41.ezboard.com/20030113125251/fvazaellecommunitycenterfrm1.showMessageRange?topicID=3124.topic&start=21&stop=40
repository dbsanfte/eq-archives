<br>
Like Baps said, adding complete heal allowed an evolution past buff-zerg kunark type encounters.  These encounters are basically &quot;kill it fast before it kills you&quot; while velious encounters are controlled and precise.<br>
<br>
I love complete heal, I even made a cleric cause I thought it was cool (not just powerful, but fun).  It introduces a level of skill and precision into high end encounters that was not there before.  I tend to believe that most people who dislike it would simply prefer to mass zerg everything because they lack the skills to use it.<br>
<br>
Aamedor seems to dislike it because it prevents him from getting upgrades, but I don't really agree with this view either.  Cleric get constant upgrades, every expansion.  Every time more hp gear is introduced for tanks, clerics effectively get a better heal, since cheal scales up with the increased tank hp.  Clerics now essentially have up to an 8k heal (if you're healing Furor) whereas pre kunark they maybe had a 3k heal.  Their heals have gotten better every expansion, even if it is the same spell<br>
<br>
As wizards gain levels, their nukes get bigger.  As tanks gain levels, their ac/hp increase.  Rogue/monk/ranger/etc dps increases with level.  Mages get better pets.  etc etc.  Clerics get better heals as they level.  Some people just see that they are casting the same spell, but that spell gets a lot better as they level up.  So wizard upgrades are very direct, cleric upgrades involve the upgrading of the melees they heal, but an upgrade is still an upgrade.<br>
<br>
Griping about cheal getting stronger as clerics level makes no sense to me, all classes get stronger as they level.  Spell ratios get more efficient.  It is after all the reason we level.  I think it's sorta cool that verant made clerics power increases slightly different, in that their power increases through the melees that they heal, much like the damage they do is indirect, it's also through the melees they heal.<br>
<br>
The bottom line for me is that I like how the game evolved due to complete heal, without it, it would just be a massive zergfest that would fail to hold my interest and that would require very little healing skill.<br>
<br>
Oh and BTW Rsisa, I don't think you're right about LoS and AL not using cheals.  It's my understanding that while they do not use chains like most guilds do, they do indeed use cheals, they just use them differently.<br>

No, Tanks have gotten upgrades Ive remained at the same effectivness since kunark. The fact that tanks have more hitpoints does make me more efficent healing tanks. However when I am forced to use a CH to heal monks and rogues because my 2nd best heal only does about 1k something is wrong.<br>
<br>
Clerics should and are the masters of healing unfortuantly in the end game this regualtes us to CH rotations. where is the skill in counting to four and jamming your finger on the button?<br>
<br>
Im not saying I hate CH, I love it, I loved it at 39 (till I cast it then got to sit oom for 5 minutes) I really loved it at 50 and I still like it at 60. However I dont think a spell we get at 39 should be the class defining heal. <br>
<br>
Remedy and devine light are good upgrades but in practice are little more than slightly more efficent greater and supperior heals. what I would like to see is a 2-3k heal with a 8-11 second refresh. A nice large fast efficent heal but not one you can chain effectivly. Or situational heals, ones that remove effects as well as healing over time like cel elixer used to do pre-nerf<br>
<br>
planes of power will add alot to the game I think it has a nice concept and it will be nice to see more than 3 gods, hopefully not all of them will be there to be killed karana sounds like its gonna be a blast however I highly doubt clerics will get any for of healing upgrades<br>

Cheal is not something I have a personal grudge against. It's an amazing spell, etc.<br>
<br>
The problem with cheal is this: it's mana/hp ratio will continually improve as the game grows. You can't balance spells out and balance encounters out properly when the thing you are balancing against is constantly increasing unless you create mobs who are also constantly increasing in effectiveness or zones that are always growing in difficulty. Cheal + time = work for verant.<br>
<br>
As the game gets older, if cheal remains (and it will because the retooling you would have to do if you removed it is basically 2 full expansions), you will see other healing spells created to keep druids and shaman from being laughable because cheal can now heal for it's full amount as mudflation has given tanks 10k hp.<br>
<br>
It's not a bitch from me tho, Baps. It's just the state of the game. Velious and Luclin would not be what they were if there was no cheal so it's not really possible to say what the state of the game would be if it never existed.<br>
<br>
The only way to make cheal slide back into balance without having to revamp the whole damn game is to assign it's mana cost based on the hit points it heals. Find the best other ratio heal spell in the game (is it torpor ?) and then give cheal the same cost ratio, maybe 25% of a better ratio since it's so definitive, and then put in a class aa for clerics to make it a smidgeon better.<br>
<br>
That, or just hope that the eq2 spell engine doesn't have preset ratios in the form of spells that will become obsolete because of mudflation. Instead, define spellcost as a ratio to hit points healed (or nuked for), with multipliers for casting time, recast time, and reagent usage and let players decide how to make the spells they want to use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uanikacrystalwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anika Crystalwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 1151<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 2:13:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=29>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10k hp tanks</span><hr size=1> Baldrik is right, there's a huge difference between a CHeal chain and a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> good</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> CHeal chain.  Smacking a button every 12 seconds is the ideal scenario, but there's a LOT of external influences that can throw wrenches into that perfect world, and learning to adapt on-the-fly takes practice.  6 months ago, PO's CHeal chains were pathetic as well - just like anything, keeping a tank up takes practice.<br>
<br>
That said though, let's take a look at Balance.  Yes, it turns CHeal into a 2500 HP heal, problem is, it cuts all our other heals by 75% as well, meaning CHeal is the ONLY spell that's useable.  Yes, they've ended up reducing it's effectiveness in that encounter, but as a result they've increased the need to use CHeal.  <br>
<br>
The problem with CHeal is that at L39, clerics get 'the' end-game heal.  There is nothing in my full spellbook that even comes *close* to healing 10k HP.  The next closest spot heal?  Divine Light, which is a base heal of 955 HP.  Sure, with AA skills and focus items, I can get that up to 1200-1300, but it costs 350 mana to cast.  CHeal costs 400 mana.  Why even bother?  For 50 more mana I can heal 10 times as many HP.  Verant made a 10K heal appear too early in the game, and cost too little mana to cast.  Unfortunately, they can't change it now, or they have to reture the entire game.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uammelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 2:30:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10k hp tanks</span><hr size=1> I guess I see the point in griping about cheal being lvl 39.<br>
<br>
Maybe they could move cheal to lvl 59 or something, and make a lvl 39 spell that is a 10s cast 2k hp heal for 400 mana or something, then clerics would not feel their endgame spell was at 39.<br>
<br>
However, what happens pre 60 has little if any impact on any of us anymore, since those days are so far in the past and it's hard to remember what it was like to be 39.<br>
<br>
At 39, I do remember that relatively few clerics even used cheal, because often tanks had 1kish hp and it just wasn't efficient compared to sup heal. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uammelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ammelen</A> at: 8/9/02 4:06:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 882<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 2:38:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10k hp tanks</span><hr size=1> I don't think that cheal was introduced too early.

<br>
cheal is a self scaling spell.  It becomes more efficient and useful over time.  I really don't believe that it's massively unbalanced.  Its effectiveness is limited by the manapool of the cleric and the hitpoints of the tank. <br>
<br>
When a major equipment upgrade occurs in the game, cheal is also upgraded.  Major equipment upgrades tend to occur during expansions when other spell lines are upgraded, so it's not a huge deal, especially because encounters are designed with cheal in mind.<br>

It's not like you can stick a level 39 cleric in VT to replace a level 60 cleric. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umeiren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meiren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 575<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 2:53:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10k hp tanks</span><hr size=1> Just want to say, that CHeal can not, in any way, be unbalancing to the game.<br>

You say you like CH chains and they make fights a challange? Bah, CH chains take no more challange then a well planned encounter where spot heals would be better. You say spamming the warrior with spot heals takes less skill? Well yeah but in a good encounter not only the warrior is going to be getting hit, creatures all over the place, rampage, the inability to break areas and fight mobs single all would make the game difficult while not relying on a CH chain. Tanks with 6500+ HPS, CH, Mobs hitting for 1000+, AC caps, No true damage mitigation for true tank classes, ect.... all screwed up EQ. A fight with spots is difficult if multiple things are happening at one time and many people are getting hit and gaining/losing agro. The only way CH chains are tougher then spamming spots are in a single mob fight where a single person has the agro and the mob has the power to kill the tank in 2 rounds.<br>
<br>
Honestly, a fight with CH chains and a single tank is the most boring bloody thing in EQ and it is the predominate way things are done in most fights. Every fight is pretty much the same no matter what mob you are fighting (ok a couple mobs in Ssra might be different, maybe VT). You set the CH chain to cast every 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, whatever and you get the tank in there and then the fight is pretty much staying awake and clicking your button at the correct time. This is the most lame strategical system a RPG could ever come up with. A cleric does not have to watch a fight, all they need to see is the chat box to know when to cast that next CH, they dont need actual graphic pictures on the screen at all.<br>
<br>
/target MT<br>

/em tells himself ok, 3 second chain, I am after cleric 2<br>
<br>
Raid leader shouts &quot;Inc in 10 seconds!&quot;<br>

cleric1 tells OOC &quot;Heal on MT! Cleric 2 in 3 seconds&quot;<br>
<br>
Cleric2 tells OC &quot;Heal on MT! Cleric 3 in 3 seconds&quot;<br>

one one thousand<br>
<br>
two one thousand<br>

three on thousand<br>
<br>
Click CH button with macro<br>
<br>
/em jumps for joy at the fun of it all<br>
<br>
Wash rinse repeat for 10 frickin minutes.<br>
<br>
Honestly, there is no game there. Fights have been broken down into mathimatical formulas where there is NO actual need for thought. A computer program could do the job of the best cleric in the game better then he himself could. The healing structure of this game take no ability to think or analize a situation or improvize, just pure timing of clicking buttons. If you think that is a good thing then I am not sure what to say.<br>

I like the fact that classes have to do very different and specific things, like tanking.  I would not want to see mobs running aorund hitting everyone as clerics all just spam spot heals on the various people getting hit.  Complete heal allows for a huge upgrade in efficiency, the price you pay is a need to coordinate cheals in advance, to time it all precisely, to react extremely quickly if things go wrong.  This separates the good guilds from the bad ones.  It provides the challenge in the game.  Any cleric can just watch th 6 hp bars in his group and as oon as one drops to 1 bubble target and spam a heal, but God would that be boring.<br>
<br>
I love the model of controlling and focusing aggro, and eq is designed around that, and it has made eq very successful.  It gives the different classes discrete roles.<br>
<br>
I entirely agree with Ceros, complete heal, though introduced at lvl 39, is not very useful then.  It self scales as the cleric levels and as expansions are released.<br>

<br>
Even for single groups, when I decided to play a cleric, I was inspired by regular clerics who I had grouped with in the past who would push cheal efficiency to the max.  <br>
<br>
I've grouped with clerics whose cheal would kick in at 3 bubs of health on average and clerics whose cheal would constantly kick in at less than one -- this is less difficult/risky than it used to be, now that tanks have higher AC and more HP, but regardless it takes a greater degree of ability than any other heal.<br>

I think the classes should be extreme in their differences. Right now there is no such thing as true damage mitigation, most melee classes tank with comparable efficiency with the differences based purely on hitpoints, even casters mitigate damage about the same as a warrior when ya get into the end game, the only reason the warrior can tank better is he has 3 times as many HPS.<br>
<br>
The fact a fully armored warrior can get hit for the full 1150dmg from the AoW while a naked wizard can get hit for no more is retarded. Armor and AC should decrease the absolute damage a mob can hit a PC for. The biggest problem with this game is the blending of the classes. Never did I say that clerics should not be the supreme healers, they should have a slew of different and interesting ways to heal people, through more HoT spells, DI type spells, fast smaller heals, some decent heals up to maybe 2000HPS for the best single heal, some rune type spells that create a divine barrier that the mob has to beat through ect.... Just not CH. All other healer classes should do their own things, noone should be able to heal as well as a cleric. <br>
<br>
I am not sure where you got the idea I want the class variation to disappear. Honestly I want it to get far more apparent. I want a wizard such as yourself to be a wet piece of tissue paper when a mob decides to start beating on you compared to a plate wearing class such as myself. I want rogues to get far more into their true RP role where they are required for stealth and secret attacks and they are not the damage kings of EQ. I want monks to be what they were supposed to be, low AC armor warriors of their body, the weapons they are getting are stupid and the armor they get has rediculous amounts of AC, they are virtually warriors that can feign death and dish sick damage atm, they also tank better then every class but a defensive warrior. Rangers should be kings with the bow (and they are), they should be decent at best with hand held weapons (they are way too good with them atm). Bleh I gotta go, I could talk about every class but if anything this game has the classes all far to similar IMO. The only reason a CH chain is necessary is because warriors and the other plate classes cannot tank like they should be able to relative to the other classes and the encounters are usually single mob encounters instead of truely difficult wars between a huge amount of PC's and NPC's. In a huge battle with huge amounts of level 50 or so mobs and afew higher level mobs with maybe one major mob the classes would be able to fit into their true varied roles alot more, enchanters could mez and charm things, rogues could sneak around stabbing things, wizards could stand back and nuke various mobs while trying not to get hit, clerics would be healing various people with different spells as the differnt classes would tank very different and have very different hitpoint levels, monks could just run around and kung fu stuff with their bare hands and feet, SK's and palladins could run around taking things on toe to toe tanking as they should be able to, Warriors could attempt to piss off as many critters as possible and basically wade right into the heart of the battle, ect...... Very different roles for the classes in a very different kind of fight. Right now in EQ there are 3 classes<br>
<br>
1) Damage dealers<br>
<br>
2) Tanks<br>
<br>
3) Healers<br>
<br>
Pretty much thats it. Classes that dont fit into one of those 3 areas are screwed, they are basically buff bitches, mana bitches, or expendable as a whole. By making the fights more of a war like I mentioned and altering their skills and abilities as needs to happen all the classes would be useful, as it stands right now the big 3 classes are pretty much all that matter in a fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubackster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Backster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 3:48:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10k hp tanks</span><hr size=1> You missed number 4 - crowd control - which is the reason that the game doesn't happen the way you foresee.
