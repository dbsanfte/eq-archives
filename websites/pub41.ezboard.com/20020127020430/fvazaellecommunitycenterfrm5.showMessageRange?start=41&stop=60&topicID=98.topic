<br>
5)Rezz'ing is a lot of mana.  When I'm doing nothing I  really couldn't care less if the victim pays me or not.  If I'm in a group or buffing getting ready to go somewhere, I do expect payment.  Going out of my way and giving you my blue stuff deserves some recognition.  It is a choice for us to rez you, not an obligation.  Most clerics, I'd say, have no problem with rezz'ing people.  It is a nice way to meet someone or some people and can really save people time.  The truth is...if you are a cleric who doesn't want to rezz people and is not LFG...just go anon or roleplay.  It'll spare you some tells.<br>

Love these.<br>
<br>
1) Why is it that Clerics always complain about not being able to get into a group?<br>
<br>
Because many tmes we can't.  You can typically use two warriors, two monks, two rogues, two whatevers.  However, you only need one cleric in a group.  The two classes that you don't typically gain much bebefit from having two in a group in 99% of situations are enchanters and clerics (and bards, to a lesser extent).  Two clerics or enchanters will step on each others toes and leave one of them with very little to do.  So, in Seb, if every group has a cleric already, you have 0% chance of getting a group unless a cleric leaves of a new group comes in.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Why is it that Clerics always claim poverty?<br>
<br>
Have you PLAYED a Cleric?  Maybe some of the more 'merchant' clerics have a ton of plat, but the only real dungeon where a Cleric can make positive cash flow is Sebillis.  Every place else, you don't end up making the 60-80 pp an hour you outlay on symbols.  Between buying peridots and now pearls for me, plus other this and the occasional item or two, there isn't a lot left over.  I'm now Level 53, and since level 42 or so, I think maybe once I've had more than 1000 plat at one time, and I ended up using that to by a ton of Peris while I had the chance.  Clerics have to worry about armor, symbols, spells, and wisdom items.  Fortunately, my guild has been generous to me in the areas of cheap jewlery and suppling my with Peridots, but nonetheless, if I spend a night XP'ing anywhere but Sebillis, I *will* lose money on the night, typically a few hundred plat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Why is it that a pure caster with nothing on but animal hides or cotton can take the beating but when a metal armor wearing cleric gets 1 Mob coming his way spams you with his OH MY GOD WERE GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT TAUNT THIS THING OFF ME. hotkey?  <br>
<br>
Any high level player knows that in a rough situation, you have two priorities - keeping the mobs off the chanter and cleric to allow them to do their jobs.  Now I have pretty decent AC for a Cleric, but it's *nothing* compared to the AC or HP of a tank.  If I start getting pounded on and don't see any indication that a tank/taunter has noticed, I'll speak up.  Then again, if things get too bad, I can always just DA/DB and I'm fine for a few seconds.  /shrug  At any rate, things can go downhill pretty quick if the cleric keeps having their heals interrupted by mobs.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) Why is it that Clerics always think they are Verants red headed step child and are victims of child rape on a daily basis?<br>
<br>
Hmm.  Okay, you're being a bit overly irrational here, but many people that play clerics, for whatever reason, don't anticipate life being as difficult and boring as it is at high levels.  Those of us that truly love being a Cleric knew what we were getting into, and take the negative with the good, because we know we provide a vital role in EQ.<br>
<br>
5) Why is it that Clerics res you and than complain about not getting paid for it?<br>
<br>
Why is it people go nuts and bitch and scream and fuss when a cleric says he can't/won't res them?  Espically at higher levels, a res can save a player literally hours of playtime via the XP return.  To do that, the cleric not only has to spend a healthy chunk of mana, but also typically needs to travel a decent distance to get to the corpse.  I personally never really 'demand' payment, and I've even gotton to the point I don't expect it either - as long as the person I ressed shows some level of appreciation for my trouble, I'm fine.<br>
<br>
Something I've always wondered about though.  Why is it people are almost always willing to pay for a port, but those same people would never pay for a res?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would you want to be one? To heal and buff others and med? Thats not fun. <br>
<br>
WOW I JUST ANSWERED MY OWN QUESTIONS.<br>
<br>
For the record, while saracasm can be a useful tool, sometime it can make you look pretty stupid.  Regardless, some people *shouldn't* be clerics.  If you want non-stop action and hack-and-slash, being a Cleric is a really bad idea.  On the other hand, some people couldn't imagine playing anything but clerics - I'm on my 4th actually, and I love it to death.  Just because *you* don't 'get it', don't run around insulting those that do.<br>

<br>
I have a few answers to give.  =)<br>
<br>
&gt; 1) Why is it that Clerics always complain about not being <br>
&gt; able to get into a group?<br>
<br>
I don't complain 'bout not getting a group.  I jus' chill and send irritating /tells to all my friends!  =P  But the truth is, there's a lot of skilled, 50+ clerics on this server.  Because of our defensive nature, it's rare to see two clerics in one group.  One solid cleric is all a group needs.  <br>
<br>
&gt; 2) Why is it that Clerics always claim poverty?<br>
<br>
Have you seen the price of Peridots?  Over 200pp a stack, I try to keep 5-8 stacks with me at all times.  Then there is the 2+ stack of pearls I have.  As someone previously posted, unless you get lucky and your Seb group gets a ton of gems and your group is generous, it's easy to lose money in an exp group.  I'm not crying out for welfare or anything, but I know that I'm always broke...  heh!<br>
<br>
&gt; 3) Why is it that a pure caster with nothing on but <br>
&gt; animal hides or cotton can take the beating but when a <br>
&gt; metal armor wearing cleric gets 1 Mob coming his way <br>
&gt; spams you with his OH MY GOD WERE GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT <br>
&gt; TAUNT THIS THING OFF ME. hotkey?<br>
<br>
First of all, only gimp clerics have a hotkey, either that or the cleric has some gime tanks and NEEDS a hotkey like that.  If you hang with good tanks/taunters there's no need to let them know you are aggro'd--they understand that if you go down, no healin' for them.  As for casters vs healer AC, I think a big reason has to do with casters being in control of their aggro, whereas clerics don't really have a choice.  When the tank needs a CH or the over nuking Wizard needs a heal, then you gotta heal or people will die--and once peeps start falling you are soon to follow.  If nukers play it smart and let aggro build on the tank, then they can be naked, nuke away and not fear getting hit.  <br>
<br>
The only pure casters who this doesn't apply to is Enchanters.  I feel bad for them.  Mez, Tash &amp; Slow are brutal aggros--and they have lower AC (on average) than I do.  BTW, if the cleric and/or enchanter goes down, things can get really messy really fast.  =/  <br>
<br>
4) Why is it that Clerics always think they are Verants red headed step child and are victims of child rape on a daily basis?<br>
<br>
I dunno why a cleric would feel that way.  I like my cleric.  We are a wanted/needed class and Verant has given us some cool abilities.  I think some of the nerfs were not very cool (like Donal's &amp; Velious BP's and the aggro nerf).  But for the most part, I'm pretty happy with my class.  There are people of all classes who cry, complain &amp; bitch, not jus' us clerics...<br>
<br>
5) Why is it that Clerics res you and than complain about not getting paid for it?<br>
<br>
I never ask for payment unless a person doesn't understand the words, &quot;Sorry, but I'm really busy right now.&quot;  Then I ask for ridiculous amounts of plat.  =P  But when I have the time &amp; I'm jus' walking around, I almost always check on a corpse to see if the person needs a res.  =)<br>
<br>
&gt; It is very rare that i dont see a cleric complain about <br>
&gt; something some time or another. I have had almost every <br>
&gt; character out there except a cleric. Why would you want <br>
&gt; to be one? To heal and buff others and med? Thats not <br>
&gt; fun. <br>
<br>
&gt; WOW I JUST ANSWERED MY OWN QUESTIONS.<br>
<br>
&gt; Please disregard this reply as i have just seen the <br>
&gt; light. <br>
<br>
Trying to keep 3 groups alive when they are 3 unmez-able mobs up and you are the only cleric is pretty damn fun &amp; exciting if you ask me.  <br>
<br>
To me, it's not really the job you do that makes the game exciting.  Most of the actual gameplay is sorta boring.  It's the thrill of doing things new &amp; exciting which pushes me.  Working as a team to do something no one person could do alone is what makes this game fun and rewarding.  But if you get your jollies pressing the autoattack key and get all hot and bothered while you anxiously press the bash key, more power to you.  I don't think that's any more or less fun than sitting-standing-healing-sitting.  (I'd like to give some props to monks though.  Single mob feign pulling is pretty damn cool.) <br>
<br>
I'm sure you didn't expect some dumb answers from a gimp, complaining cleric--but I'm bored at work &amp; figured I'd toss some wood into the fire.  =P<br>

Ranath by the way was in my old guild and is quite a good Cleric but should be the last one to defend himself here as he was 1 of the Clerics i know of that was unhappy with his trade.<br>
<br>
Comparing yourself to a tank is ludicrous. What im saying is that a Cleric wearing FS complaining about a mob on him more than a caster with half the AC is downright funny. I dont have a hot key with a GET IT OFF ME. Granted im only a 35 Druid, but ive been seeing Clerics with their spam going since they got their first heal spell. My heal spell was up to par with theirs in the early days and i did just fine without any spamming to the taunters.<br>

No money? A dungeon is the BEST place for a Cleric. They are needed most here. Best exp. Best loot.<br>

Did you jus' skim over it and figure you'd jus' go off, or are you jus' the tool you make yourself out to be?   <br>
<br>
I'm going to go with #2: you seem pretty darn ignorant to me...   I know I'm bein' suckered into discussing this with you.  But doing my boring research at work, has caused me to lose my mind.  =P  I figure I'll take out my bordem/frustration out on you.  heh!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I shall once again try to break down your statements...<br>
<br>
&gt; If its so hard to get into a group, nobody appreciates <br>
&gt; you, you are a victim of caps, you cant make any, money, <br>
&gt; and everything good for you is nerfed, QUIT BEING A <br>
&gt; CLERIC.<br>
<br>
It could be worse...  I could be DT-taking druid/pally/ranger.  =P  (Jus' playing!)  Anyway, I think I'm very appreciated and in return, I'm very appreciative when my group members do their job and we succeed in whatever we are doing.  I love my cleric &amp; have no plans on qutting anytime soon (to the dismay of many...  heh!)  Anyway, your rant could apply to anyone playing any class...<br>
<br>
&gt; Ranath by the way was in my old guild and is quite a good &gt; Cleric but should be the last one to defend himself here &gt; as he was 1 of the Clerics i know of that was unhappy <br>
&gt; with his trade.<br>
<br>
Being a cleric isn't for everyone...  maybe he should try to play something else?  maybe a different game entirely?  <br>
<br>
&gt; Comparing yourself to a tank is ludicrous. What im saying &gt; is that a Cleric wearing FS complaining about a mob on <br>
&gt; him more than a caster with half the AC is downright <br>
&gt; funny. I dont have a hot key with a GET IT OFF ME. <br>
<br>
Never compared myself to a tank.  I have neither the AC nor defense skill.  I don't have a &quot;GET IF OFF ME&quot; button either.  But if your tanks are not taunting a mob off you because they may be preoccupied, you have to let them know what is going on.  Please re-read my aggro statements I listed above regarding mobs attacking clerics while they attempt to keep you and the others alive.  I think Sly made the comment 'bout Cleric tanking--if the tanks/enchanter is dead and the wiz is trying to get an evac off--I'm gonna try to tank/ae/get aggro so he can hopefully get the evac off.  =P<br>
<br>
&gt; Granted im only a 35 Druid, but ive been seeing Clerics <br>
&gt; with their spam going since they got their first heal <br>
&gt; spell. My heal spell was up to par with theirs in the <br>
&gt; early days and i did just fine without any spamming to <br>
&gt; the taunters.<br>
<br>
It all makes sense now.  =P<br>
<br>
&gt; No money? A dungeon is the BEST place for a Cleric. They <br>
&gt; are needed most here. Best exp. Best loot.<br>
<br>
Dungeons are also more difficult than outside, and when you go into Sebilis, everyone wants a symbol.  I'm more than happy to give 'em out.  But just so you know, those symbols cost more than just mana.  I was wondering if you realize this.  I'm not complaining, but it is a fact that I have come back with less plat than I did when I entered the dungeon.  I'm fortunate, that I can afford it, but I know for some of my fellow clerics who do this all the time that it is very draining on their bank account.  I don't like their crying &amp; whining either, but the reality is they are purrrty poor.  <br>
<br>
&gt; Quit complaining.<br>
The only thing I complain 'bout are ignorant tards who don't know how to play the game.  =P<br>

You are right though, there are 'gimps' of all classes, and everyone experiences 'gimpy' moments.<br>

Guy was a gimp, his skills were weak (over healing and burning like mad, like CH at 50% on the tank).<br>

I didn't really want to continue to group with him, so I bowed out before we went back, gracefully. Then the gimp sent me a tell about how I should never ask him to group again (which I didn't in the first place anyways).<br>
