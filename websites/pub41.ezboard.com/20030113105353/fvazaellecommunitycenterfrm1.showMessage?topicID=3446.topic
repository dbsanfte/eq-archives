<br>
So basically, if you have your wireless AP connected to a 56k, then you'll have wireless 56k.. connect it to cable and you'll have wireless cable internet.<br>
<br>
Though a search on Yahoo.com or Google.com would probably answer many more of your question much better than I can. (And wow, would be so much easier too!)<br>
<br>
As for &quot;possible&quot; wireless access... if the neighborhood he lives in or building or whatever has it and offers it then you get to split it with the rest of the residents.   If he plans on mooching it off some unsecured access point near him, then that's just lame.<br>

But that's a different technology entirely: that's essentially a cellular inet connection that works anywhere in the province. Well, anywhere there's digital cell coverage, but that's about 95% of inhabited areas in Ontario. You're billed based on how much you use, $100 CDN/100MB is the most economical rate from Bell, the only provider in Canada. You also have to buy the modem, which is ~$600.<br>
<br>
To put things in perspective, I'm paying $70 for static IP, 2.2MB/512k ADSL, 25GB/month transfer, commercial-level connection (99.5% guaranteed uptime, if they come below that I get a refund) with permission to run whatever server I want, and that includes the modem rental.<br>
<br>
There's also a radio internet provider, Look, but they're not taking new customers at the moment. They're also expensive, but broadband. (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.look.ca)">www.look.ca)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Only reason to get Radio internet is if you don't have cable (as in, no cables actually going to the house, which is fairly common in the country), and you're too far away from the CO for DSL. 128k ISDN is cheaper than Radio, and it's more reliable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now... if he's talking about a wireless access point with a cable/xDSL connection, it's a whole different discussion. I'm using 802.11b for my home network, and the speed is 11mbit. Much faster than Cable/ADSL, and you won't notice a significant performance loss.<br>
<br>
A word of caution, though, be careful of topography when placing the wireless access point. If there's any concrete walls between your computer and the access point, the reception will go in the toilet. ATM, I have mine in the basement, and when I walk over the threshold between the original house and the sun room (added after the house was built, foundation wall between AP and sunroom) the reception goes from &quot;Excellent&quot; to &quot;Low&quot; and sometimes &quot;Very Low&quot;.<br>
<br>
The other thing you'll notice are nodes and antinodes. These are lines of poor reception (node) and excellent reception (antinode) that are caused by having two transmitter antennae very close to each other, and their radio waves cancelling each other out and stacking. You will see points in range of the AP where reception is &quot;Very Low&quot; or even no access available that are literally 5 feet away from an &quot;Excellent&quot; point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway.... if it's AirCard, don't get it. If it's Radio, *only* if there's no other options. If it's Cable/xDSL with a wireless Access Point, then get it.<br>
<br>

It's incredibly stupid if you only have like 2 computers and they're right next to your router.  But if you have computers all over your house and don't want to run wireing through the entire house, it might be useful.  Then again, you have to worry about that whole concrete wall issue mentioned above.  It's just like any normal network, except it's not secure at all.  You can tell me all the ways you can secure 802.11b, but as it is right now, every 802.11b network can be breached, I know this guy that drives around with a laptop and a 802.11b card in it running a program that hax0rz every wireless network he can get his hands on.  I don't know why he does it, probably for fun.  Then again, most people don't even know or care that other people can access their internet connection.  Hell, if I had a wireless network setup, I'd let my neighbors use it (provided that nobody does anything malicious) because I totally believe that you should be able to go anywhere, and have access to the internet.

You can run MAC address filtering on the wireless. If it's properly set up, they can't warchalk it because they don't have the right MAC addy.<br>
<br>
Of course, I'm far too lazy to do that, and it's not like I'm worried about warchalking. 128-bit encryption with the Broadcast SSID disabled is good enough for me.<br>
<br>
BTW, it's on the &quot;Filters&quot; page under &quot;Advanced&quot; for most Linksys wireless routers. Dunno about D-Link. Looks like this:<br>

Bottom line is you shouldnt have anything confidential on your computer, get a firewall, get AVSW, dont download files from shady places, dont open attachments until scanning them and always keep your OS up to date with security patches and stuff.  Some people watched the move &quot;Hackers&quot; too many times I think.  For those of you that say it is so easy please enlighten us as to what method you use to 'hax0r' ppls machines.  If it involves 3rd party software or a trojan just stfu and go back to watching Hackers. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198911">Corpsed</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cerosofvazaelle>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1025<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/02 9:37:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3446.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> WEP is pretty vulnerable.

The SSID, the channel, and the strength of the encryption.<br>
<br>
The Channel is easy. There's 13 possibilities, less in some areas. The strength of encryption is easy. There's 2 possibilities for most network setups. The SSID, however, is not, assuming the person setting up the network is wise enough to disable the broadcast SSID, and not use something obvious. Certain OS's have trouble if you've disabled the Broadcast SSID, but it's easy enough to configure them manually so they don't have to broadcast, and easier still to just avoid those OS's.<br>
<br>
When you can't find out what the SSID for the network you're trying to crack is, and the network is using a non-standard channel (by default, channel 6. Also really easy to change), the wireless network might as well not be there, because you won't see it. It's not like you turn on a computer and see all of the available SSID's. You need to broadcast, which is answered by all of the base stations in range which tell you, using standard encryption/channels, what SSID and channel they're working on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cerosofvazaelle>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1026<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 12:43:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3446.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I don't think that it's as hard to find networks without knowing their ssid's as you think.<br>

it's true what ceros said tho, your network is as secure as you make it.  I have xp/debian on my laptop and I haven't even patched the openSSH vulnerability on it yet.  :P  lazy me.<br>
<br>
oh and ceros don't forget freeBSD.  &lt;3 freeBSD.<br>

gaeelae is quite the artist tho.  wtb lessons. <p>Evie<br>

Plus, it's cheap. Well, the tools aren't that cheap, but the wires, the connectors, the NICs and the hubs/switchers/routers are. And, it's really, really, really secure. Unless someone breaks into your house and plugs in their own computer into your router...<br>
