<br>
To backtrack a little:<br>
<br>
How fucking dare you to presume and act like you know anything about playing a shaman at 50+? You obviously have NO FUCKING IDEA what slow aggro is like or how often we heal or clerics have to heal us during and afterwards. <br>
<br>
When you get done killing frogs in guard and move to kael and tov or hell even lower level of seb - start paying attention to the shaman in your group when mobs begin summoning. <br>
<br>
Shaman slow - you take the aggro and the xp loss from any deaths to get that slow in because an unslowed mob can eat through a raid/group fast. Slow usually gets you a ride on the summoning express and depending on if it was resisted or not - a ride on the Back to Bind Express. Slow is one of the few spells that can pull aggro straight from the chanter who mezzed it when mez drops.<br>
<br>
The you're slowing to early comment? Shut up.<br>
<br>
And that solo comment? Shut up. <br>
<br>
Lae I've known you since you got a surname and I have to say I'm stunned. This post has taken the cake(or pie). I hope all of rp's guild shaman take you out back and beat some damn sense into you. <br>

<br>
He is messing with the greedy ones.  A cleric, by nature of their component use, is typically de-facto ML in any pickup group.  In that position, they are able to easily abuse that role (moreso than anyone else).<br>
<br>
If any of you believe that in a pure pickup group (all strangers), a cleric has the right to keep more than their cover of component costs and a fair split of the plat/gems on top of that (ie, to cover their component costs in areas where plat is scarce in OTHER pickup groups), you are kidding yourselves.  Arguing that point, then turning around and arguing that NBG is a crock is being quite hypocritical.  Look at the root of both of those arguments, they are the same (the whole, helping me here will invariably help you later down the line schtick).  Anything above that is the group's generosity toward that cleric, which equates to NBG-ing the plat/gems for the cleric's future 'dots.  Of course, then, you dont know if that surplus cash is going to go toward 'dots for another group, or toward that OIV the cleric is planning on buying.<br>
<br>
*Shrug*  Pick-up groups are variable like that.  You get good fair people, and you get some jerks.  The cleric class is no different from any other in that respect.  If someone wants to take advantage of their de-facto ML status as such, find another cleric. <p>Sharak'Duom 51 Ghost<br>

<br>
how in your logic does a paper tank ranger (L52) deserve a symbol? isnt the point of being a ranger to do dmg, but NOT get hit? botton line is, only people who need symbols are cleric (if it stacks with that uber self buff) chanters, bards, warriors, rogues, shamans.... a RANJUR shouldnt be in the dmg path, and if you're getting hit on enrage thats your own dam fault. 90% of the rangers who know their part meelee from behind to avoid riposte's (enrage) so if you arent being riposte'd then why are you getting hit?<br>
<br>
chanters need it cause they have like no hp, shamans need cause by having more hp, they can cann further, and also have more AC to protect them from low hp aggro, war's deserve... well thats obvious, rogue deserve cause those guys build a ton of aggro and cant help it at times when evade fails, and if you dont know why a cleric needs (if it isnt overwritten by self buff) then you really should consider logging and deleting.... personally if i were a cleric i'd never waste my mana buffing a ranger unless he was the best meelee we had.<br>

<br>
I'm responding to you here after deciding not to reply in the flame forum because this post is not about Shamans, its not about good clerics, its not about anything like that. It was intended to root out the clerics who do bad things. <br>
<br>
As for shaman's slow. Hell, I've never been to TOV, so I wouldnt know, no. <br>
<br>
I never claimed to. This post was about what goes on in SOME groups in seb with respect to SOME clerics. I say clerics, because no other group CAN claim they need the money as the clerics do, so it hasnt been a problem with other classes such as warriors.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I was mistaken  about shamans not always needing a symbol if the case were in TOV. I did say SOME cases though, did I not? Did you   hear me say, NEVER GIVE A SHAMMY A SYMBOL? I wouldnt have written that. There is no reason to because it is stupid. If I were to spell out those select cases where shammies might need a symbol *gasp*, I'd be told that I am telling people how to play their classes. Heh, I am accused of that, yet people are telling me how I should talk here. Lets see, god given trait, talking, I'm being told how to do this and I'm not pissed. Game given right, playing a cleric. I'm not telling people how to play these classes, yet I am getting bitched out about it. I made suggestions so my original post didnt seem that irrelevent. <br>
<br>
As for the soloing comment? Hey Woadin, where in gods name did I say something about shammies and soloing. Was it because Darhews was telling me how I should be buying my equipment based on the fact that I solo rather than group for XP, or was it because I told him that I solo, and he should try it some time. Where did I say something about soloing that deserves a &quot;Shut Up&quot; from you. <br>
<br>
I swear, people take these posts, that dont even start in the flame forum, and turn them into a flame fest. These are discussion boards, but people cant seem to let them continue on as a discussion without exploding. It amazes me. <br>
<br>
I've freakin apologized if I offended people so many times, but people seem to have so much fun trying to roast people that it just doesnt end. That amazes me. I'm not being compared to Dethen by some idiot who likes to take private tells and put them up on the boards. If you like attention so much, I hope to see you on TV some day, but why in gods name would that have to involve private tells being brought to these boards? You want a cookie? You know how to copy and paste, Wow. <br>
<br>
I'm compared to Dethen now, why? Because this post got long? Holy crap, a post where people decided to start flaming the original poster who made non derogatory remarks got long, Say it aint so. <br>
<br>
Come on people. This post was never intended to hurt a damn one of you, but you see the need to jump on my back. Especially the shamans who looked at my line that perhaps in some situations one might not feel a shaman needs to get a symbol. Jesus Christ, please have me shot in the street. I'm suddenly the biggest dick to grace the side streets of North Calcutta. <br>
<br>
If you disagree with me, why must you post it in a hostile way? Was my post hostile at all? If you think so, I will sugar coat any of my future posts. <br>
<br>
I cant believe this post turned into a &quot;flame boards greatest read&quot;. Well hey, if you guys get &quot;Shamans dont get symbols because their slow doesnt pull aggro in TOV&quot; then hey, I guess they are right about these boards. It just isnt worth posting a word.  <p><table border="0" align="left">

Most people on these boards obviously don't see what you are saying as true. They believe I am completely wrong about people in groups not always needing buffs. <br>
<br>
You better back off, or you too will be accused of telling clerics how to play their class. Perhaps I was wrong about shamans not always needing symbol. If that was the wrong part of my post, then hell, I'll take it.<br>

<br>
&quot;To the person who said not everyone needs symbols and buffs .. you're still a n00b, go back to KC. Druids need buffs ... snares are more aggro than about 5 taunts from a level 60 warrior with taunt maxed. Get 2-3 failed snares and your druid has aggro for 1/2 the fight easy. With maybe 2000 hp and 800 ac, that's a dead druid if he isnt buffed. Shamans have a bit better hp and ac, but slows give them nice aggro too. So buff them. Wizards nuke, sometimes they get aggro because they cast faster than the tank taunts .. better symbol them too. Monks and rangers get hella aggro due to damage dealing. SK's have taunt raising spells. SO i guess that means I can not buff the Beast lords, mages and Necros. Cool. Here's your sign.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm a 60th level cleric who's been playing since 6/99, and I know how to play one.  Very well, thanks.   Some clerics play it safer than others; it's always been that way, and it always will be.  I never said clerics that do so were wrong, I only pointed out that symbol is more is situational spell than, say, heroic bond.<br>
<br>
Your comments are way out of line.  Perhaps you feel I was personally insulting you?  No, I wrote my original post while you were writing yours, and never saw it until I posted mine.  My post was a reply to Laenin. <br>
<br>
As for the newbie comment, I'll refer you to the Cleric forum where a certain 58th level cleric does not know that Mark of Retribution and Mark of Karn have different effects.<br>

All of this misses the original point of post that SOME clerics in Seb are GREEDY LOOT WHORES.  I think that was all he was saying.<br>
<br>
And as for the arguement of who does and doesn't need symbols WHO GIVES A FUCK!<br>
<br>
Get a good cleric in group and they cast group ageo or group symbol so everyone gets it by default at a savings of 2 dots per round of buffs.<br>
<br>
Monk definately prefers to have symbol but in seb I find it typically a waste of mana/dots because 3 out of 5 pulls it gets fucking dispelled anyway regardless of how many shit buffs you have above it.<br>

&quot;I also am not sure if this has happened to many others, but if the group is working properly, the cleric does not lose much other than cash, whereas the melees in the group, even if they do their job correctly, do die and lose xp. XP=Time. Time=Money or additional XP. So if someone dies, the time lost could have been used to further themselves. If you dont agree that the MT or other melees will most likely go down rather than the cleric. Where is the cleric in those situations where there is a wipeout many times? &quot;Hey guys, drag to me and I'll res. I'm back at the entrance. God bless Gate&quot;.&quot; <br>

You state that your post is about greedy clerics.  You also state this is not a flame on clerics and should not be taken personally.  Please reread your declaration above and maybe you'll understand why you've gotten some of us in an uproar.  I, like Woadin, have known you since you got your surname.  And I, like Woadin, hope the shamans in RP take you out back and knock some sense into you, and I'll symbol every single one of them.<br>

<br>
That portion was only to say that not only the clerics lose out on seb camps because they are usually not the first ones to die. That part had nothing to do with when clerics buff, and I still dont believe clerics NEED to buff EVERYONE in the group in ALL occasions. It is a waste if its always one full wash of buffs, coming up, IMO. <br>
<br>
Wait, am I not entitled to my opinion now? It is an opinion. I'm not telling you how to play your class. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see the hundreds of pp you go through buffing your entire group replacing your groups buffs up in fear taking out tentacle terrors . . . etc. That is one of many examples where you wouldnt have to. That is actually one where you should not. <br>

I split coins about every 10 min since I wanted to keep weight down, my splitting was to simply type /spit whatever I had in my coins so do the math I ended up splitting my split about 30 times ended up with 30pp after the group.<br>

Kanora got a diamond from group.<br>
You got an Earring of Woven Bark<br>
Offered Withered staff to Aadene (who suggested I give you all the copper too so you wouldn't whine so fucking much) she declined.<br>

It was MY group which you were invited to.  MY=whatever fucking loot rulez I want and if you don't like DISBAND/GOFUK.<br>

I got lots of xp 30pp and a ruby out of the group hmm... I feel my reputation speaks for itself on server and you will be hard pressed to find anyone who has grouped with me that would call me greedy/loot whore etc.  <br>

No Laenin, I'm not saying that melee will go down before the clerics.  I'm trying to point out to you why people are heated about this topic.  When I read this portion, escpecially about the gating to the entrance and drag the corpses part, I was taken aback.  You wanted to know why people are taking this out of the context in which you meant it; I'm showing you an example as to why.  The shaman topic spawned through the same manner.  I pointed this out to you so you could see through the flames.  I thought a freindly, familiar voice would help you focus on why this thread has turned in this direction.  I was wrong.  <br>

<br>
    That was a personal experience that happened to me about a week ago. It was not about how clerics are bad because they do that. It was written in order to show that melees lose something too. <br>
<br>
If other clerics saw that part and decided to flame, well they are reading too much into what I am saying and not taking it at face value. Noone commented on that portion of it either, so I doubt that was the reason people wanted to flame. <br>
<br>
The Shammy thing spawned from my comment that QUESTIONED whether or not a shammy/druid would need a symbol based on their healing abilities. Some clerics and Darhews decided to jump on me about this because god forbid in my post about clerics, I forgot to mention their slowing abilities. Wow, perhaps I WAS wrong to QUESTION this. I admit that I might be off about slows because I am not experienced with TOV. In Kael, I don't remember the last time our RP Shaman died. <br>
<br>
Somehow the post also got Woadin to tell me to shut up because I told Darhews to try soloing (because he obviously didnt know that Rangers could and do solo and dont need high AC gear to do it). Excuse me if I Am a bit defensive,but when a friend tells me to shut up and curses at me because 1, I do not know much about slow in relation to TOV, and 2, because I defended myself against Darhews for &quot;picking on&quot; my armor, I tend to get a little taken aback myself. <br>
<br>
Your friendly voice is appreciated, but I just didnt see the relevence of that quote in relations to why people got mad. It was a fact that happened to me. If they are angry, it is not me they should be angry with about that, because I lost the XP and time. He lost money on buffs that he got back when we split the loot fairly. Again, if that quote offended anyone, they took it the wrong way entirely. <br>
<br>
Your friendly voice also was questionable when you were addressing me and telling me that RP shamans should &quot;as woadin put it&quot; take be out back and beat me and you would symbol them all. Yes, that can be taken as a joke, but since Woadin was somewhat --ehem-- less than cordial with me, and you were putting it &quot;as Woadin&quot; put it, then I have to question whether or not you were joking. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Again, to Shamans. If I somehow offended you, I sincerely apologize. That was not my intent. You all deserve symbol buffs with periodot reagents on all occasions possible because of your slow spell. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> My feeble backround in a low lvl dungeon such as Sebilis does not afford me the wealth of knowledge of your slow spell, thereby making my original post null and void. <br>
<br>
Everyones comments have changed my mind. The clerics who decide to take more than they earn and spend deserve that, whereas the mere pawns standing before him/her who die, thereby losing experience, do not. <br>
<br>
I thank everyone for tolerating my existence. Please excuse my while I use my garbage disposal for a suicide device. <br>

I dont want to fight. Obviously I went wrong somewhere. People have been telling me to stop posting and this will be forgotten, but I dont like leaving things unhandled and unclear. Hopefully my bit of humor ending this post will make you smile somewhat and forget what a slimy bastard I am for posting this. After having a quick daymare about 40 spear wielding shamans coming after me with fear/death in their eyes, I have to admit, I'm afraid to post further. With a dream ending where I have to take the short bus to work every day because of how many times I was slowed, I'd just rather end this. <br>
