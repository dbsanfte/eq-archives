                The Life and Times of a Little Assasin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
   Upon a dark night in the deep mountains of Pennine mountains, awoman was running from the teeth and claws <br>
of a large brown drake. The drake closed in on her and begin to tear for her limbs to render her as his next meal. Bleeding and confuse the woman throws a pouch onto the ground,which brought forth a small light flash. The light pierce the night air enveloped the drakes vision  for a moment. The one moment was all she needed to disappear. Like the sun trying to set if you didnt keep your eye on her ......she was gone.<br>
<br>
  Walking back one night from a meeting of his guild, Aldarhan was taking a path that cut through the rough edges of Sauvage forest . Faint cries to the old wizard could be heard near some trees . He stops to listen for them one more time.<br>
Moving to to the shrubs heparts them with his ebony staff and produces a soft glow at its very tip. &quot;Well ! what do we have here?&quot; Aldarhan meant to self ask but some how provoked and answer  from a woman as she laid bleeding with extensive wounds. &quot; Alas dear sir i am a victim of the wretched drake of the pennine mountains ,however i need your help .&quot;she said as the blood and life exited her soon to be corpse. Aldarhan knowing there was nothing he could do to save the woman he agreed to at least help a womans last dying wish.  &quot;So, what is it i can help you with my dear?&quot; Aldarhan inquired. &quot;My son &quot;she says as she rolls over and off a small bundle of wrappings in a black cape.&quot;take him and find him a home. Aldarhan sighs and scoops up the child and his garbs that were around him. Hooves beating  on the road off to his side turned Aldarhan's attention over to a rider coming in haste. &quot;Do not fear my dear ,for i will...&quot; he stopped in mid sentence ,for she was gone .<br>
<br>
 Stepping quickly to his home based in a small hut near a farm in camelot hills,Aldarhan brought the baby into his abode . Finally removing the garb he realized the babe was of the sacren descension, yet at the same time he noticed a hint of death in the baby's smell. &quot;Tommorow we will find you a good home my little friend &quot; Aldarhan stated as if to calm the nerves of the child,or perhaps his own. And with that he placed the child onto his bed and and secured the little one with pillows as if not to fall from off the sides. Aldarhan then outside once more to retrieve some milk from one of his goats to feed the child for when the time came, for he surey does rememer that part at least in rearing of one so small.<br>
<br>
to be continued.............prt 2 ..Aldarhan misery and losing family.......................<br>
<br>
<br>
 Upon the next morning the light of dawn broke over Camelot hills and Aldarhan had already set forth to find the child a home within his guild. He arrived with the youngster at the doors of his guild and knocked once then twice then once more for this was thier way. The door gave way as a dead bolt of wood was slid off its locks and unleashed the oaken wall for him to pass through. Aldarhan spent twenty minutes inside and shout could be heard from passerbys for there was now was a discussion amongst the clan. &quot;I served this guild for 22 years and never would i have thought this would be how you welcome one so young.&quot; passionately Aldarhan stated.&quot;The child is of no concern to us and he is evil i tell you ,and besides one child cannot make the diffrence in this war Aldarhan ..&quot; argued back an officer. Aldarhan knowing his words were lost to ever find the ears or hearts of the clan decided then his fate laid with the child for he saw something different about him each time he held him. &quot;Thus i cannot stay here then for this child needs a home ,nor will i stay here with this guild to only betray the promise to a dying woman for  honor forbids my existence within these walls. Aldarhan eclaimed. The elders and officers tunred thier backsn and did not face him. To let him know his decision and thiers was now made .<br>
<br>
 Aldarhan left the hall upset and confused for he too was now homeless and unsheltered from the evils of the land . Across the road from Cotswold a little farm did exist and near it also was a stable where a hobbit named Nob lived and worked .<br>
Thus with the child in his arms ,Aldarhan stepped away from  Camelot and moved his way down the road ....<br>
<br>
part three ...Nobs deal........ <br>

<br>
Like everyday Nob was busy with his daily chores as stable master of all of camelot. He just finished a refusal letter from the council to rasie his horse rentals to ten silver when Aldarhan appeared at his office door. Rapping on the door withi his staff in one hand and still holding the young mystery child in his other Aldarhan cleared his throat.&quot;Nob my good fellow i have come for your aide&quot;. Nob rasied his left eyebrow up at Aldarhan with curiosity and motion Aldarhan closer so they could close the door and examine the circumstances without the prying rounded ears of his helper in the stable.<br>
&quot;I knew you were coming and so does half of cotswold my friend.&quot; he whispered. Nob then winked and sat up &quot; i got a deal my friend in need, a deal you will like indeed.&quot; rhyming to only amuse himself . &quot;The child must be left at the doorsteps so he can be found by a minstrel of a very nice guild&quot; he stated . I know they will take him in and bring him to his calling&quot; he added . Tearing off a piece of paper and handing it to Aldarhan  he pointed to it and said &quot; The address and the directions I already wrote down for you, and on you way I need one favor if ya dont mind . &quot;Hmm gladly me thinks &quot; replied Aldarhan knowing well this meant trouble. &quot; All I need you to do is see my old pal in Camelot and pick up my winnings from the local tavern from last fridays poker game &quot;. with his eye gleening with a supposed innocence Nob explained. Knowing that this was not a simple pickup of winnings and knowing Nob all to well, Aldarhan agreed and bidded Nob goodbye. <br>
<br>
 Outside the stable near the horses Aldarhan scured the reins tied to the steadiest of mares . Tossing the attendant some silver he snapped the leather and riled the horse towards the south to Salsbury plains. Wind blowing and hooves beating with the child nestled close to his own heart Aldarhan thought back to the night he found him . The mother said something he could not figure out ..Daehhh     tub..... The two words so scrambled he could not understand thier origin or thier composition but realized he may never find out . Stopping at west downs for a slight meal and nurish the child he avoided the stares of many onlookers ,who  wandered by watching him stir a stick into the ground  dae htt ub .. Then he scribbled again ,and again. His silence of thought was interrupted by another mage &quot; death to you be or is it death be to you &quot; realeased the old man who stared from the side of Aldarhans horse . Meeting eyes Aldarhan passed on  the message of needing more information and the man kindly moved towards him to deliver. &quot; It is the moto or family saying of Arthurs assasin guild from a long time ago my fellow made up small people  who were known for thier ability to hide and strike better than all in fair Albion.&quot; he said . &quot; Really and is ther any more you could tell me about this ehhFamily you spake of my good man or do they even have a name ? &quot; Aldarhan inquired . &quot; The name my friend come now no one ever forgets the Hidden force guild from Arbidard's ..my god man they were legendary &quot; the man laughed . Of course , now he remembers back tothe days when Arthur secured and enlisted the help of the Hidden force guild to find the ones who butchered his cousins on thier wedding night . With only a bow of his head the man walked away as if he knew Aldarhan wanted to be left alone with his new found knowledge . Then Aldarhan glanced the child for only a moment for his periferal vision has lost sight of him for second . The words kept playing over in his head as he gathered his things and wrapped up he child who now laid sleeping after his stomach had been filled from a nipple skin of milk sold to Aldarhan by a merchant there. Again on his horse and pointed south west ,Aldarhan cajoled the horse into a light gate. &quot;One more day till you are home my little one ,one more day.&quot; he said as he left the west down station.<br>

The night drew near as the gate of the horse carried him away from the Plains of Salisbury. <br>
 Stopping for the night , Aldarhan found himself at Caer  Ulfwych towers where he met an Infiltraitor named Regis<br>
Dewarn . Regis and Aldarhan spoke late into the night about the little one and his mother . &quot; Mayhaps be right about the child Aldarhan he may have the gift, but I say this to ye now&quot; Regis said in a warning tone.&quot; Get him to Adribard to have is training start soon fore he walks and learns to crush leaves like most inept lurkers of the shadows.&quot; Nodding his head as if in compliance Aldarhan agreed with the heed then sat back and thought in reflection of his own training when he was young.<br>
  Daylight broke from the eastern window of the tower and Aldarhan rose and readied himself and his little companion for the last leg of thier journey . Swinging his leg over the horse ,and recovering the child from Regis, he said his goodbyes and nudged the horse away from Caer Ulfwych.<br>
 With the wind at thier back the traveled the last of the canopy roads of the Forest of Campacorentin.<br>
  Suddenly a mist surrounded them and the horse stood still.<br>
A flash of light from the north east came towards them and knocked Aldarhan and the child off the horse . Many voices in a whisper could be heard loud but yet not for like they were coming from his head . &quot;Grabbed the child for he belongs to me nowwww&quot; a voice cried in his head . Aldarhan felt hands and arms prying and tearing the child from his grasp as he desperately clung on. To no avail the child was wrenched from his hand as he balanced himself on his staff . On one knee Aldarhan begin to chant his incantation. and move his stave into the air as he now stood erect . Flames erupted all around him perhaps ten to twenty flickers he could not count them all , but ready himself to cast again in case all were not dead. Shwappthoom! was the noise right as the light blinded him and he fell to the ground and saw the feet of his aggressors upon him. Stretching out his hands Aldarhan lit up the sky with a single flame dart rising high hundreds of feet above him as the kidnappers strike a final blow upon his chest . Aldarhan screams &quot; Daeehhhhh to you be&quot; , and succumbs to the light as a bolt of lightning hits him once more.<br>
 The mist dissolves and Aldarhan is no longer moving. Lifeless with no breath of the gods in his shell. The child he once held no longer in his hand . <br>
 The child screams  its cries  across the forest walls and none of concern could ever hear . The child was lost ,lost again. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udaehttub.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daehttub </A> at: 3/14/02 11:36:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFF0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukahylan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kahylan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#000000>(3/15/02 11:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: to arbidards</span><hr size=1> OMG!

<br>
 Lifeless a body lies as a screaming child was whisked away. Clouds of the night close in upon the man once known as Aldarhan Elminster . Owls of the fabled woods call out to sing his final song as peasants and passerbys move passed his remains. Saved one. <br>
 A knight from Camelot aboard a horse draws near to where the battle had taken place. Slowing his steed for dimounting brought  him right up to the corpse of the old wizard . Removed from his ride he steps over to the body and whispers in the ear of the corpse,&quot;Not yet old one ,you still have much to do.&quot; The knight of virtue then stands upright lifts his visor, and looks toward a streak of sunlight, as it burst forth through the canopy of leaves and limbs.Fighting it's way in to shine down upon the paladin. Gracefully the paladin lifts his arms and smiles and chants ever so slightly as soft golden light eminates from the center of his breastplate . The Hue of the light filled the dark forest with a rush of power as the animals gathered to see his presence . In curisosity or reverence it could not be certain to why they came. His chant grew louder and more eyes peered . A cresendo of notes floated to the air and the light moved from the paladin over to corpse of Aldarhan. With this in view and the chants of the paladin echoing amongst the trees the animals started to one by one lay down upon the floor of the underbrush in the forest . The paladin smiles as he stops his chant and so does the glow of light remove itself from him and the body . He glances and winks at the animals then remounts his horse in a swift movement. So fast he moved  that it would make one think his armor was  light as leather.&quot;Soon my friend , soon.&quot; he says. The paladin nudges his horse and they move away north along the trail towards the plains. An eye opens and a breath is made.<br>

Over in the corner whispers of war can be heard between two men of no concern. Lit by only a few candles shadows danced on the walls. Neighbors of the tavern drift in for the night's warm fire and warm drinks. The clinking of mugs ,chalices and the noise of conversation fill the air .  From outside  the tavern a lone  man walks from the forest . Hobbled and bent over to show his years ,garbed in a tattered robe the man made his way forward to the tavern. Weary from his travels his steps are slow . The last few days have not been gentle .<br>
  Patrons moving about didn't notice the door as it slipped open as Aldarhan moved through the meager doorway and along the wall to settle himself in the far corner away from most. &quot; I tell you , I heard he can even take your coin from thy own pocket &quot; says one man close enough for Aldarhan's ears to over hear. &quot; Aye , he is of the devil .&quot; said the other.<br>
Eavesdropping unintentionally Aldarhan learns of a new cuthroat terrorizing the hills , thinking how he had not knew of this information for he always was well informed had him a little confused ,but  with all the events and mishaps to him lately he perhaps forgot and chuckles about his age . A waitress wanders by and  asks him for his order and leaves. Promptly returning with a sniffer of brandy and a a a small candle to shed light upon his table. Before she could strike a match Aldarhan extends a finger and murmurs a slight word under his breath and a flame flickers from his finger and floats over to reside on the wick of the candletop and set the candle afire. The barmaids giggles and smiles back and once again dissapears into the crowd .<br>
  Hours pass and the crowd dwindles,as most make thier way out and back to thier own abodes for the nights rest and tommorows labor . Aldarhan remains in his corner.The candle still alit makes a glow around the hood of his robe as he had kept it pulled through out the evening trying his best to shut out the world. Staring down into his drink he notices ripples in the liquid,a pattern beat . Growing stronger by each moment advises him of several horses headed this way. The ripples stop and are replaced by low voices outside the tavern and the sound of swords as they swing upon thier sheathes against some metal armor. <br>
   Whether it was touched or if the wind had blown, the door gave way to a force and a Knight moved into  the doorway. The soldier turned his body ever so slightly to view the tavern as if searching for something or someone. The barmaid that once served Aldarhan approaches the man and whispers . The Knight nods and turns around and exits back  outside to the horses. Another Knight enters and turns towards Aldarhan and makes his way back to the small lit corner where Aldahran was seated . &quot;May I help thee sire? &quot; asks Aldarhan. &quot;Aye you can and lend your talent to the realm&quot; the man replied . &quot;What could happen in a day that would make the Army of Camelot search out one meager mage such as myself my dear man ?&quot; posed Aldarhan with his lips now accepting a small drink of brandy . &quot; A day tis not the time .&quot; says the soldier &quot; try nineteen years of our lord&quot; he added . Aldarhan stares with his eyes now widen and ask the man to explain .<br>
   The night air was now still and the crickets of the hills surrounded the tavern as Aldarhan discovers of his death and prophecy ,including how the guild of wizards and master Visur kept the knowledge of the prophecy away from his eyes for many years even while he was a student at the academy.<br>
Holding his head between his palms Aldarhans sighs trying to retain and understand what has been said this night .&quot; Sir , if you would come back with me to the academy we do not have much time&quot; the Knight asks in a way so to be understood that it was more of a command.  &quot;That I will &quot; Aldarhan answers, and stands up slowly to make his way to the door. Turning back to the glance once more to the interior of the tavern where the candle was still alit with it's now dwindling flame . &quot; Nineteen years.&quot; the old sage mutters then with a finger snap vanquishes the flame from afar .<br>
  Arriving in Camelot early in the morn as the sun rises on the moat of the large  citadel reflecting the same colors that he saw just a few days or years ago. Aldarhans legs carry him through the streets and down the corridor to the academy hall . In the courtyard as he rounds the corner he sees young promising mages casting defense shields on themselves and bright flashes of blue lights of that of a gem surround each of them.<br>
Passing by and moving towards the main hall Aldarhans senses the power of his mentor and friend. &quot; Visur !&quot; Aldarhan exclaims as he moves up the stairs to cast his eyes on the man who educated him in the ways of the earth and of fire .&quot;Aldarhan ! so its true you are the one chosen , tis good to see you&quot; Visur says. &quot;Come its time you knew the prophecy.&quot; he added and motions Aldarhan towards the library of lore for masters only. <br>
 Once inside the old mages sit together hovering over scrolls spread across them on a lowered table in front of them. &quot;All it says is that a child lost on a wizards death from whence a hero shall come&quot; Visur paraphrases . &quot; I dont know where the child is my friend I.... I .. I lost him on the night of my death nineteen years ago.&quot; Aldarhan sadly states . &quot; You didnt lose him Aldarhan&quot; Visur states &quot; He was wretched from your grasp by none other than the Green Witch and her followers of a religious cult intent on stopping the prophecy.&quot; he adds. &quot;You say this child is the one , you say this child has importance to more than just I , but how do we know he still lives ?&quot; Aldarhan asks. &quot; He has to be alive such so are you &quot; Visur explains &quot; thus the prohecy must be true  you live then so does the child &quot;.  &quot; I see who then was this paladin who resurrected me in the forest floor early upon this day? &quot; Aldarhans asks . &quot; Let me assure you were not brought back by one of the kings men for all of our paladins  are on the border protecting the sacred relics of our realm.For the war of the three realms have claimed a many of lives and all paladins have been  stationed there for the last seven years.&quot; Visur answers. Rubbing his chin with his thumb and forefinger Aldarhan begins to think deeply. Then slumber comes,still weak from his  travels and his current health. Slowly he breathes and others look on . Visur then motions for them all to leave and so does he but before he does he snaps his fingers back towards the room and the candles across the room douse thier flames as if a switch had been thrown,and thus the room grows dark.<br>

His rest at the Academy and the elixirs served removed the age of death and time from him and once more he felt as strong as ever before. Sentry guards ran by him. Running to thier horses the must be heading to a area of need . Stepping up his pace,Aldarhan grab the attention of one of the guards.<br>
&quot;What is the hurry my youung guardsman&quot; the wizard asks. The guard not breaking stride replies back ' The thief of the forest has struck again and this time he was wounded were off to catch him now&quot;. Aldarhan quickens his pace as if gliding over the pebble stone walks along the paths in camelot to the  stableman and gathers a horse . Saddled and set he nudges the horse in the flanks and moves towards the gates trailing the guards .Just ever so slightly for some reason curiosity of this thief of the forest has captured his day .<br>
<br>
  Near the tower in camelot hills  laid the forest of the eastern hills .Oak and Pines  sprouted all around giving birth to most the lumber for nearby farms. Guards were all around and more arriving every few moments . Blanketing the countryside in search of the one . The one who cant be seen.<br>
<br>
 Aldarhan arrives at the guard tower and greets the captain of the guards . Both smiling they laugh about the early days when Aldarhan helped his father get his medallion of honor for capturing thieves in these very same woods and now turn to a task of catching the one thief that cant be seen. &quot; And whos says history does not repeat itself &quot; the Captain remarks. &quot; Lets hope not my friend for if memory serves me right, your father lost a good man that day I helped him .&quot; Aldarhan said. The <br>
Captain nodded and moved his troops along the road sides and proceeded to form a line spread  a few paces .<br>
Aldarhan stood back and listen carefully and moved his eyes slowly in and about his surroundings . The horses shuddered as the wind blew and the guards proceeded on thier search. Dancing the tips of thier swords theu the underbrush as if they were blind men on a street begging in Camelot was the picture that came to Aldarhan's mind . Picking up a stone and palming it in his hand he turned back toward the horses. Now by himself since the guards were now deep into the woods Aldarhan moves back to his horse and grabs it reigns.<br>
With one hand free  he luanches the pebble towards another horse amassed in the group  the guards had tethered near the tower . Striking one in its flanks causing to buck and scare the other horses gave them all set free from the post and they move back all at once in different directions. ' Stealing a horse is beneath you young one don't you think?&quot; Aldarhan asks to the empty air . &quot;Come now I know you are here shall i cast area effect and prove it thusly ?&quot; he assuredly asks .<br>
Hand appear from no where and pull down a hood of a black cloak . &quot; Very well old mage tell me of who you are and perhaps i shall let you live. &quot; the now appearing man spoke. &quot; Tis not who i am that should concern you, but who you are I feel is what should .&quot; retorts Aldarhan.<br>
'come lets move away to a safe place and talk ,I wil not turn you in till i have heard your story my friend, that i will promise you.&quot; Aldarhan says as he tries to get  the young thief to join him on a horse as if to move away from the search and perhaps prying eyes .The young thief adonned in black and tan leather leaps on the horse with Aldarhan as the move slowly away from the eastern hills forest and down to a small abandon farmhouse a mile or so away . .........Thinking to himself along the ride Aldarhan has a feeling they have met before. ..............<br>
