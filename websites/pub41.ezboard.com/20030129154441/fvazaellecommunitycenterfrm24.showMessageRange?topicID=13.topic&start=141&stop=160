Furthermore dumbass read my post we dont have to have 30 members to take down VS we need one group and we had our one group which is 6 members Tanth if you didnt know..... well we had 6 members there way before you had the force to take him down. If you dont believe me we can do it wait tell next VS spawn and we will gladly show your ass.<br>
<br>
Mirirandar: Half my post was meant to you half was meant to Laminar. No you havent had desire to join IV but are you jealous as hell of the members HELL YES. I so remember all the trash talking you did of Ceneaa and Reks and Azzrael in the groups that I was with you on. As for the rest of my post you stated that is all facts and my opinions just cause they differ from other guilds doesnt mean they arent the truth so please as I know you werent at most of the encounters STFU ok?<br>
<br>
Kaminya: you damn right I am calling you a coward if you are going to say shit back it up please and best way to do that in game is to /guildwar. IMO its not joke you want to talk shit you back your ass up or get the fuck out. Also I honestly dont care about your epics or what loot you have gotten passed up etc... You talk about the trak and giving you a bp shut up please you got something awesome for a member no I doubt if a donal's or cobalt would of dropped would he of given it away no. What the fuck does that matter the point is he by no means had to give you the BE BP in the first place after you basically told him to fuck off and that you didnt need there help when you had no where near the force to even dent trak. Was I there no but I have heard both sides and many of your members say to me personally that you guys did not have the manpower what so ever. The starcraft comparison is called zerglings if you know what they are you send a mass amount of them to try to take down something. That is what we refer to you the endless and kead the hopeless order. Now actually I really didnt have much problems with you tell your guild members blacklisted me and several other IV members in groups. And then you kicked me out of the chat channel as I listening to how your members talk of victory and bashing  my guild leader where what was said had no ground. quote &quot;I bet Krimzin got jay to go take down fear so that we wouldnt kill his uber god&quot;, &quot;I bet IV found a way to crash the server so that we would have to clear fear again.&quot; after kicking befb out of channel &quot;Good glad you got rid of that asshole&quot;. <br>
<br>
Yeah I saw the comments and what was said its no joke and I saw the comments on how your victory was for sure. But I know its your first time and even I said that on guildchat guys dont say anything its there first time. Did you zerg it yes oh well you learn and get better does this mean if CT is up are we going to give you all night to try 10 times no I am sorry unless we are doing something else. BTW for all that dont know we were planning CT from the beginning of the day as soon as at least 24 got on. SF was in fear so we went and did other stuff waiting for them to get out. We still will and plan on doing CT whenever he is up. Have we failed against CT yes but we never failed against him tell he was upgraded to unslowable then we failed twice and won on the third. Like we do most things third time is the charm. However have we won a lot of our first encounters on the first time HELL YES we have and damn proud of it.<br>
<br>
WELL guess its time to wait for responses.<br>

<br>
Anika, we did call in for help when we needed it.  We did try many times to get it right.  There wasn't anyone there to make us have one attempt.  That is not our fault.  We were ahead in the game.  We got to do things first.  We did get a chance to polish our tactics.  Now other guilds are trying things.  We have exact rules which we follow when someone else is at a mob.  If they beat us there, they get a shot.  To say that this rule is only in place because we don't think anyone else will get a mob we lose to is wrong.  If we ever do get beat, and then someone takes the mob, that's what happens when you get beat.  Will we fail against ct again?  Probably.  Will someone be there to clean him up.  Maybe, if they are, good show.<br>
<br>
And the reason we have been butting heads with other guilds lately?  Other guilds are finally starting to do the mobs we really want to do.  Anytime more than one group wants something, heads are going to bump, egos clash etc.<br>
<br>
And some of our members like to flame.  Every guild has those.<br>
<br>
What did I say to a friend in SF?  I don't think that you guys will win, but at least you have the balls to try.<br>
<br>
We are in a good position on the server right now.  We aren't obligated to make sure others win, or get to try all the things they want.<br>

Ok let's look at that one.  I don't doubt you can do it with 9, I will believe you if you say you can do it with 6, hell for the sake of argument let's say you could do it with TWO.  You know what?  We had sufficient force to kill him in the prep room before you even had two people in zone.  <br>
<br>
Let's look at facts.  How much time elapsed between the time you guys entered the prep room and we pulled VS?  3 minutes?  5 minutes?  Is it your stance that prior to you entering the room we didn't have sufficient force?  In that case explain to me who we gained that was so crucial to our success in that time?  Obviously we had sufficient force at the time of the VS pull since we took him down.<br>
<br>
Now Vehnn go back and reread my post.  I've said that OUR position is that if you are in the prep room we aren't going to go after VS.  What I'm asking is what is YOUR position?    If you say we didn't have sufficient force then explain to me how we killed him.  <br>
<br>
Basically what it comes down to, is that it seems you are giving yourself a nice little backdoor from your policy.  You say IV will give other guilds one shot if they have sufficient force, but whether or not they have the force is up to IV to decide?  I guess maybe we better request a list from you guys explaining how many numbers and what specific classes we need to constitute sufficient force for all the contested mobs.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that both PO and TE were in the prep room before you even zoned in, stragglers from TE trickled in throughout the incident but we had a force in place that could have taken VS down when PO went in the first time, which was before a single IV member entered the prep room.<br>
<br>
On a broader note, the issue of judging people by guild tags has come up several times.  Yes I am guilty of assuming that all of the current members of IV must condone their behavior in game and on the boards since they consistently act in the same way time and time again with no dissenting opinions.  This is an open invitation to all IV members.  Read through this thread carefully, look at the repeated falsehoods and half truths stated as fact by IV members and the replies that showed them wrong.  I want to hear if all of you, as individuals, find the swearing, slandering, and lying that seems to pervade the IV presence on this board as representative of your feelings as well.  Unless I hear otherwise, I have to assume that all of you condone and support what Befb, Vehnn, Kaziqueal, Breill, etc. are saying and doing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utrazofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Traz of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 1:37:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=144>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> &quot;&quot;I guess maybe we better request a list from you guys explaining how many numbers and what specific classes we need to constitute sufficient force for all the contested mobs.&quot;&quot;<br>

2.Any halfling wariors not having a last name of &quot;house&quot; is a half person. <br>
3.Gnomes of any class besides casters are counted at 1/3.<br>
4.You also get a 5 man reduction in count if anyone present has flamed IV on the boards in the last 24 hours.  <br>
5.You get an auto reduction of 2 people if its directly after patch.<br>
6. Having a GM present when we show up you get +10 added to raid.<br>
7. 10 person reduction for having Barazon or Xlamo or Vumael attend raid. <br>
8. you get 1/2 added for every member having an epic.<br>
9. you get +5 if you have conquered this mob before and -10 if you have not.<br>
10. if you believe any of my post you have a -20 to raid count.<br>
<br>
 I hope this clears things up and glad that you asked for this list <br>

<br>
At the time we pulled, both PO and TE had a substantial force in the prep room.  IV had 2 members there.  We finished buffing and I announced our intent to pull.  TE sent me a tell saying they would back down for us.<br>
<br>
We fucked up the pull.  There it is, plain and simple.  It was our first time doing VS, we didn't have the experience and we goofed it.  Did we have force required to take down VS?  Yup, as evidenced by our post patch return when we took him down w/ one death.  <br>
<br>
The only reason that TE didn't rush right in at that point to pull VS is because they were nice enough to CR us for a second attempt.  They didn't have to do that, but they did.  In the mean time, more members of IV entered the prep room, along with a bunch of mobs that killed some of our freshly rez'd members.  Where did those mobs come from?  I don't know, I wasn't rez'd yet.  Could just as easily have been a TE latecomer for all I know, or some bad pathing.  Either way, The Endless continued to CR us.  IV moved in and started pulling the guards.  To say that IV was ready to engage prior to TE being ready is false.  TE was ready about the same time PO was ready and they stepped down for us.  IV had 2 members in the prep room at that time, so unless you are claiming the ability to do it w/ 2, you were not ready before TE was.  The one and only reason they hadn't yet pulled the guards was because they were going to give us a second chance.  Yes, we got the crappy part of a crappy loot drop, but it was more than we were entitled to.<br>
<br>
Kaminya and her guild acted with utmost class and respect with regards to VS and it's disgusting to watch her get slammed for it.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utanthvaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TanthVaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 1:59:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=147>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> Again, I'll ask.

<br>
TanthVaz don't ever assume the post by IV members are the feeling of all IV members!!  Will they speak out agaisnt each other ?  not publicly on the boards.  Its like a family you'll say things to your family that you wont say to your family in public. Does it happen in guildchat .. sometimes. <br>
   Look what happens when certain people leave guilds and THEN you'll see them speaking out about members of there guild. But it would be foolish to do so while still in the guild. <br>

<br>
Face it: your account of what happened and IV's account of what happened at VS do not mesh.  I wasn't there myself, but kyrana was and I trust her far far more than I trust anyone else.  She said you weren't ready to kill him when IV got there, and IV sure as hell was.  We pulled the guards, not you.  You pulled VS after we pulled the guards.  Facts.  It doesn't matter that you and PO decided to join up and form the ultimate VS destroying pokemon.  Lets look at kaedaian's post in this thread:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Kaminya tells you, consent me and Laminar, we're going to CR you for another shot at VS.<br>
<br>

<br>
Kaminya tells you, shit, IV is here in force, they're going to pull VS. Do you mind if we take him down with the help of the poeple we've rez'd and then split the loot with you?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To me that says &quot;TE isn't ready to take VS&quot;.  And don't give me that &quot;oh we were busy rezzing PO cause we're so nice =)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)&quot; crap - you KNEW we were in the zone and coming to kill VS, you WERENT ready until we were pulling guards, you NEEDED POs to have enough people to kill him (in your eyes) - kyr herself says there was MAYBE 15 people there when we arrived and a buttload of corpses.  If you were ready when we arrived, you would have been fighting his guards or fighting him, especially since you knew we were on the way in.<br>
<br>
<br>
So my good sir I'm going to ask my question for the 5th time.  It will be multiple choice this time so as not to addle your brain.<br>
<br>
Is your official policy that, if there is a mob up and is NOT currently engaged in combat, it will be attacked by TE?  In other words - if a guild is pulling a mob's guards, like us at VS, that mob is not &quot;claimed&quot; for one shot?<br>
<br>
And here are your multiple choice answers:<br>
<br>
a) Yes, if a mob is up and even if someone is pulling its guards or buffing, we do not consider it claimed.  In other words, TE would not be upset if, say someone brought some people down to trak's lair, and while the endless was killing the sebilite protector, they rushed trak and killed him - TE would be fine with that.<br>
<br>
b) No, we made a mistake.  We were not ready for VS when IV arrived in his prep room - that's why the guards were not pulled, that's why we weren't fighting them or VS himself.  We had to recruit dead POs who we ressed in order to get enough people to kill VS as shown by kaedaian's post.  We screwed up, and since IV pulled and killed his guards, we should have respected IV's claim to VS.  We apologize to IV for our mistake.<br>

He said he was going AFK for a couple minutes because some friends stopped by. He FD'd and I resumed pulling. About a half hour later, someone said to hold the pulls. I think it was Atro, but I'm not 100% positive. In any case, Atro removed Xarr from the group and instructed us to surround him and spam inspect him to cause him to go linkdead. That was part of the fun I was referring to in grouping with some members of IV last weekend. When Xarr returned, he apologized for taking so long, rejoined the group and started killing spiders while I pulled.<br>
<br>
As for my LD's and AFKs, I think you're distorting one particular instance in Sebilis, the last instance of when we grouped as a generalization of all the times we grouped in LGuk, Sol B, and Burning Woods. That one instance in Sebilis was not my norm. I was sitting at the zone-in with a LFG tag on. I knew that a termite inspect was going to be coming by to inspect where I live. I made this point to Kyrana when she asked me to join the group you were forming. She said it was not a problem since the entire group was not there. Yes, I was AFK quite a bit simply because the inspector looked for interior signs of termite infestation first. When he moved outside, I came back and started moving with the rest of the group down toward a camp. It was at that point that my connection went bad. It happens on occasion. Yes, I think I went linkdead three times total. On the third time, though, you never gave me the opportunity to bow out of the group because my connection was bad. You simply mem-blurred the buffed up frog you had as a pet, left it right next to where I would respawn, and moved on. Very considerate of you. <br>
<br>
Could I have handled the situation better? Probably. Could you have as well? Probably. Would you? I don't know.<br>
<br>
As for my typing, I've been ribbed by my guildmates about this as well. Knowing that there are people playing EQ that are not fluent in the English language, being specific about what you type can help alleviate potential communication problems. You consider it being slow, I consider it being courteous to others. It's a difference of opinion I won't lose any sleep over.<br>
<br>
Breill, I don't recall bashing Ceneaa. I did bash Azzazel and probably Reks. Why? Because the ranger class changes focus as you level. At low levels, a ranger can be the main melee in a group. At high levels, it's very situational, and not wise to have a ranger as the main melee in a group. Azzazel and probably Reks received items (i.e. Tolan's armor) that were well beyond their level. That added AC at lower levels obscures the change that occurs and to which people who play rangers have to adjust. Reks made the adjustment, obviously, since I know he's level 60 now. Azzazel apparently could not since the last time I saw him online several weeks ago, he was de-guilded from IV, only level 51, and reportedly selling off the Tolan's armor he received. Was there some envy that Azzazel and Reks had nice items? I'd agree with saying there was some. But bashing Azzazel and Reks at that time was mostly skepticism over their ability to play the ranger class.<br>

I'll address your post and then I am VERY curious to see if others in IV who WERE there are standing by Vehnn's analysis of the situation.<br>
<br>
PO and TE weren't there for a joint raid on VS.  Our guild camped out in the prep room with the intention of taking down VS.  PO camped out at the zone line with the intention of taking down VS.  When it became clear that both guilds had the same intent, we *shudder* talked and came to a compromise.  We didn't help them when they pulled VS although in hindsight we should have and probably would have had we known at the time IV was planning to come in AFTER and take VS.<br>
<br>
Reread your quote.  Kaminya isn't saying we're going to res PO for a JOINT attempt, in the first line.  In the second line she offers joint attempt mainly for the sake of giving them the loot, I sincerely doubt that anyone who was actually there at the time believes that our guild didn't have the power to kill VS alone.  <br>
<br>
One thing that MAY be causing some confusion is that when PO pulled VS, because our guild was intent on not getting involved in any type of KS situation, a large part of our group camped out to avoid VS aggro.  It is possible that the timeframe you are choosing to take your snapshot of our readiness is AFTER our people camped and before they returned.  This does not change the fact that we had sufficient force PRIOR to the first pull of VS.<br>
<br>
As far as I know PO didn't help us when we did kill VS, but I was busy doing my role and am not sure of this.  At the very least I stongly believe that we had the force necessary to take down VS without PO assistance. <br>
<br>
One thing I'm kind of confused is that it seems you repeatedly imply that we didn't pull the guards because we couldn't handle them.  Is this really what you are saying?  The guards are actually pretty trivial to kill and I'm sure that 2 or maybe even 1 person of the right class could pull out and kill the guards.<br>
<br>
Finally, as for your question:<br>
<br>
&quot;Is your official policy that, if there is a mob up and is NOT currently engaged in combat, it will be attacked by TE? In other words - if a guild is pulling a mob's guards, like us at VS, that mob is not &quot;claimed&quot; for one shot?&quot;<br>
<br>
I've said what our belief is.  Namely that if a guild is in the prep room for VS we acknowledge their &quot;claim&quot; and won't move in.  In NORMAL circumstances the guild pulling VS guards is the guild that was setup in the prep room first.  In THIS instance, your guild was  NOT the first, nor even the second guild to setup with sufficient force in the prep room, and because of that we felt PO had first claim and we had second.  <br>
<br>
Now do me the honor of answering my question.  To make it easy we'll be specific.  In the instance of VS what will IV recognize as a legitimate claim?  <br>
<br>
To the rest of IV.  Is what Vehnn is saying here representative of your guild's feelings?  I'm rather hoping he doesn't speak for you but it seems he is the most vocal and I haven't heard dissenting opinions...   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utrazofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Traz of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 3:16:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=157>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> &quot;fuck you skirmish, now I am beginning to remember why I quit this god awfull game in the first place.&quot;<br>

<br>
If you were anon in KC then yes I missed you and I freely admit I was wrong.  See what can come out of logical discussion? I mistakenly assumed there were no IV present because I didn't take into account the fact that some might be anon.  <br>
<br>
So given this new piece of information, how does it affect the discussion?  Well based on Breill's post, we now see that IV did indeed have ONE person in the prep room quite early on when PO had 2 groups and we apparently had 1 to 1/2.  In fact, Keadaian has also said there were 2 IV in the room.  So given that there were 2 IV in the room when PO and TE independantly had sufficient force to drop VS, does this now give IV a &quot;claim&quot; in their eyes?  <br>
<br>
As far as what I'm trying to do here.  Initially I lumped all IV together and assumed they all felt the same way.  Based on the posts of some level headed IV and some of my own guildmates I see I was wrong to do so.  What I am trying to do now is see who should be judged as an individual and who agrees with the majority of the posts we see from IV people in this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubreilldveill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Breill DVeill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 3:28:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=159>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> True that well in my eyes when did you the Endless have enough people there cause I know we had 6 in zone and at that point Prom had xxx amount and TE had xxx amount the te was far less. So here it is basically PO had first crack what we are referring to as the first shot then VS was open game since at the time and times it was TE and IV had force to do him well you guys pulled him and beat him. Grats nothing really more to say. Could we have rushed in there and disced and one of our groups gotten exp nope but we sure as hell waited to see if you would win or not. <br>

When I used the words Ganked in my previous post this gank was referring to yes you pulled him oh well it seems your argument was with Vehnn I dunno but the point is you beat us to the punch grats VS kill.<br>
