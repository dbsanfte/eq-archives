This is the fundamental problem with the way socialists think.  If you can't find a job working for someone else, then create a job.  No one would work if everyone had this attitude and sat around waiting for someone else to create a job for them.<br>
<br>
I think Merr is completely wrong btw.  If you can get 70% of your income to do nothing, a great many people would take that alternative.  (I've met some in everquest who do that!)  Even for the people just getting welfare, at any level of welfare, some people will choose it over working, and as the amount you receive goes higher, more and more people will choose it over working.<br>
<br>
If I could design the system, welfare would pay well under minimum wage.  You'd have to come in to work daily for the government and they'd find some shitty ass job for you to do to get your cash, i.e. cleaning streets, washing toilets in city hall, etc.  It would suck so much worse and pay so much worse than any real job that you'd find a job pretty fast.  This is sort of what Giuliani did in NYC and it reduced the welfare rolls considerably (though he didn't do it to the extent that I would have).<br>

<br>
By the way, 20 mins ago I heard that unemployment in the US is 6+ %, while here in the Netherlands it is still well under 5.5 %. UK is 3 % if I'm not mistaken (might very well be).<br>

Seriously, I know that in the 90's the US unemployment rates was 2 - 5 % lower than European countries, so I wonder why it is different nowadays. <p>---------------<br>

I thought you were an economic, Ammelen ? We're in a recession. In a recession, people and businesses aren't spending. Which means that it is a very bad time to start a business. Sure, there is always a little niche in which it might be possible, but this isn't a fundamental flaw of socialism - it's not like there is room for a large number of new businesses.<br>
<br>
I might be very very wrong, I consider you more knowledgable on this field.<br>
<br>
Or isn't that what you meant by creating a job ?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think Merr is completely wrong btw. If you can get 70% of your income to do nothing, a great many people would take that alternative. (I've met some in everquest who do that!)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think the problem is than the defination of &quot;a great many people&quot;. Neither of us have used numbers to back this up. Of course it is very hard to find proper numbers regarding this, because if it was known what people were abusing the system, they wouldn't get wellfare any more. Fact is, it happens. I can only judge this by what I see off this in my environment, which is of course not the broad view you would want. Fact is, it isn't a fundamental problem. Dutch economy was quite healthy in the end of the 90's and even though unemployment rates were a little higher than the US, that is no indication that there is a fundamental problem.<br>
<br>
I think the difference here is, you find it the number of people who choose unemployment unacceptable, I don't. I think I never met somebody who chose to be unemployed (I know they exist though).<br>
<br>
By the way, 70 % of your income is something you pay for monthly and only lasts 6 months (or 1 year if you worked longer).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If I could design the system, wellfare would pay well under minimum wage. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What makes you think that isn't the case ?<br>

<br>
Of course, that would be taking away jobs from people. Or, if those would be jobs that wouldn't be real jobs anyway, the very fact that you 'create' these jobs would be costing you money.<br>
<br>
You have to pay those people with those jobs more than standard wellfare OR you have to find these jobs for every single person collecting wellfare.<br>
<br>
I am all for the principle by the way. But I think it's hard to implement in practice.<br>
<br>
We have a system like that in the Netherlands. Jobs are funded (partly) by the government (for people who have low chance of getting a job) so that they build experience so they can enter the market again after a few years. This doesn't work well though, because the experience they get is not really useful for the market. They receive a little money than wellfare, but are under minimum wage.<br>

<br>
As much as I'd like to point a finger at those ppl in the UK for this, I can't...  This kind of thinking isn't limited to the UK, or Europe, or any other country.  Hell, I know 2 different guys here in the US who both think it's perfectly fine to sit there and shack up with their girlfriend, neither of them working, just drawing unemployment and child support from her ex.  Why work when the government will pay you to sit at home?  That kind of mentality I just don't understand.<br>
<br>
One of the big reasons I left my first wife...  She had a teaching degree, could work anywhere she wanted to.  But she flat out decided why work, if she could sit at home and get money from the government for being poor.  She threw all kinds of shit fits when I started climbing the corporate ladder, and accepted jobs that got her kicked off her government programs.  /boggle<br>
<br>
Same with my 2nd wife...  Really nice gal, but she's an &quot;office&quot; type person, and while she's been out of work for almost 9 months now, she refuses to accept any of the many jobs around here because they are &quot;beneath&quot; her.  I'm sorry, but if I lost my job today, I'd be in another job within a week, regardless of what type of job I had to take.  Hell, I've worked as a garbage man, factory worker, lawn care, dishwasher, lifeguard, computer operator, programmer, consultant, and finally ended up as the IT director at my company.  And if I lost my job, I have no problem going back to being a garbage man, because working and earning your way is part of what defines a person, imo.  Those that expect a free ride should get dumped by the curb, hard.<br>

How does that work ? Or is child support so enormous that they both can live off it ? Or are they lying to the unemployment office about their home situation and are they both getting a wellfare check ?<br>

<br>
Yeah, it's very possible, and unfortunately, happens all the time.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure of the numbers, but an unemployed, divorced mother of 4 draws enough money to live on from both government and child support (of course child support will vary according to how much he earned at the time of the divorce).  The government (as far as I know) doesn't take into consideration whether or not you are living with another person or not.  As long as the government continues to just dish out money for someone to sit on their ass, the problem will just perpetuate itself.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not some cold-blooded hard-ass who doesn't believe welfare in any form is justified.  I know there are cases where it is, but my view is it should be nothing more than a helping hand to help that person get back on their feet, and back to being a contributing member of society.  I've known people who have been on welfare, and worked their way back out of it, and now are drawing 6 figure incomes.  And I know people who have made welfare a way of life, and my taxes continue to sustain their laziness.<br>

Heh, that is quite amazing to me. Here if you receive wellfare, it is for one household - that means that no other persons in the household can have income (that would be able to provide for the household). <p>---------------<br>

This isn't really true.  There is always room for new businesses, though the types of businesses that thrive at different times vary.  For example, pharmaceuticals manufacturers do quite well in recessions.  There is always room for a new business.  The more new businesses you have, the more new spending you have, which creates need for even more businesses.  The idea that there are a fixed number of jobs in the economy is just silly.  Adding a business creates increases in both the supply and demand curves and balances out.<br>

See that's where you're wrong.  The thinking that there is a fixed number of jobs out there is the problem, because it's absolutely false.  If you hire these people, they will make money, they will then spend that money and create a need for more jobs.  It's a breakeven.  The same mistake leads to the xenophobia that is so much more present in Europe than in the US.  If you bring an immigrant into this country, and he takes a job, that isn't one less job for Americans.  Sure, he takes a job, but he also spends money.  He buys a house, he buys groceries, he works out at the gym, he watches the game on a big screen TV, he sends his kids to college, etc.  He pumps the money right back into the economy and creates more jobs in the process.<br>

If they're going to get the cash, the country might as well get something in return. Anything at all would do. Weed medians, run around Florida with flyswatters killing mosquitos, shit I don't care, just do something for the check instead of sit on your fat ass perpetuating the image of America as a rich country who pays for people to become obese.<br>

I'd even think that someone who draws money for nothing in return is being done a disservice as it pushes them farther away, mentally, from the idea that they should try and get into an arrangement where they get paid to do work.<br>

It fascinates me that despite this demographic, the GOP still tries to make welfare into a partisan issue. <br>

Welfare is on the way out w/ both parties.

There is absolutely nothing heartless about requiring people who are able bodied and of sound mind to work for their check.  We all do it, I don't see why laziness should get you out of it.<br>
<br>
Disabled I think is different.  If someone *cannot* work, that's an entirely different issue.  If someone just doesn't want to work they can be hungry until they decide that working would be a good idea.  Like Saalron said, it can be anything, give them flyswatters and have them go kill mosquitos, the point is twofold.  First, it should encourage them to try to get a job in the private sector.  Second, it should give us something in exchange for our money.<br>

Okay, but to start a business there HAS to be a market for them to sell their product to. There has to be money to fund those businesses, it takes time to stretch the market to be able to create a more healthy economic environment. There is a limit to how many new businesses the market can support.<br>

True, but this is a slow process, it isn't like an economy in recession can instantly support businesses for, say, the people who got unemployed in the last year. I am not saying it is impossible for anyone to start a new business at any time. But the climb out of a recession is as slow for any system, capitalism or socialism.<br>
<br>
Granted, in the USA there is an environment that supports this process much more than here in Europe, but that is mostly because of the ease to get credit in the USA. It has little to do with socialism vs. capitalism.<br>

Okay, so what you're saying is that the government should create jobs for those people. I agree, but there is a limit to what the government can do, or not ? I would think a socialist government would have more money available for those jobs and to sustain them. The extra spending alone won't be enough to pay for those jobs, so the taxpayer will end up paying more taxes. And what happens the next recession 5 - 10 year later ? Just create even more jobs ?<br>
