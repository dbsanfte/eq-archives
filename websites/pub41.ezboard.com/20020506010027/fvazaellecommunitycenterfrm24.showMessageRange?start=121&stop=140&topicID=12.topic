<br>
When you say &quot;Agony is the guild&quot; you are referring to my question to Anika correct? I'm pretty sure this is about the Plane of Sky stuff right? Well, I don't know what Keadaian told you but here are some facts about what happened.<br>
<br>
1. Agony had PoS on their internal caldenar for over a month before someone noticed that PO had it scheduled for the same time. this wasn't a &quot;Hey look we can screw them&quot; kinda plan<br>
<br>
2.Serafina contacted Kead about it and he said that we could come up the next day and follow behind you guys. He seemed to think that one guild following the other hours later was ok if his guild was going first.<br>
<br>
3. He also said that no one in his guild had been past the monk epic mob on the 2nd island. which equals no experience at all with Sky, which means wipeouts and delays which stop us from going there.<br>
<br>
4. Agony has been there and does know what to do. we've made a beeline to spiroc island before and know what to do.<br>
<br>
We did not want to cancel our raid but didn't want to hurt POs either so we went more than 8 hours before you went. Why? Because this allows us to move through and still have things spawning for PO when they got there. Many people had to get the day off from work/school to go up to PoS at 10am on a friday morning, but we did it. Did we do it to screw PO? Nope. If we wanted to do that, we coulda just gone up at 4pm since they were scheduled for 5 or 6pm.  So why did we go at 10am instead of 4pm? Could it have been that Agony was trying to not screw someone over? That they were trying to be considerate?<br>
<br>
I've never had bad relations with anyone in PO. I've partied with PO folk in many places and things have always been friendly. I really don't understand why Kead called your Sky raid off without even going in to check, but I can say in *all* honesty, that we made an effort to accomdate both guilds so no one would get steamrolled. I guess we're all just a little shocked to be flamed for it.<br>

And just like any other online game, there will always be people who compete in every facet of the game, as that's just who they are.  <br>
<br>
From what I can gather, it's not they're goal to directly fuck you over, just to compete as best they know how.  In a lot of other games, there's people who really piss me off.  Q2RA bfg/quad whores, cs snipers, any UT player (you know the game sucks, don't you?)  for example.  Sure, they're damn annoying and get repeated threats to be killed irl, but they're just out there to lead the board, and that's it.  And with that in mind, everyone understands that they suck ass to have to resort to those methods to kill people, but atleast they understand why they are doing it.<br>
<br>
Now, switch to EQ, and suddenly the game is much more open ended.  No longer is there just a frag count to lead, as some people don't play this game that way.  They're just out to have fun.  Now obviously, when these two people butt heads, it isn't going to be pretty.  But it definitely doesn't have to degenerate into stuff we've all seen on this rant board.  I mean really, take a look through these messages and try and go 3, 4 posts w/o some childing name calling involved.<br>
<br>
Now, it's really late at night, and I haven't gotten much sleep (sound familiar?), so .. I'm just goin out on a limb here.. but if both types of people recognized there are people who play for different reasons in this game, I think we'd be a lot better off.  Once in awhile, maybe either one will back down, and just let the other do their thing.  And if you get trampled over, just keep in mind that it's not personal.  And if you get asked to hold off on doing your killing or whatever, keep in mind that they're just tryin to have some fun.  And maybe once in awhile, let em have their way.  (whichever it may be)<br>
<br>
Anyways, this current shit sucks...  and I don't believe I'm the only one who thinks this.<br>
<br>

If that person's feelings reflect the majority of IV's opionons about what I'm doing in this thread, then you are mistaken.<br>
<br>
Someone asked what happened, I responded. No, I didn't leave anything out.<br>
<br>
Our raid was NOT called off because people were leaving, before the server crash there were 60 people in zone. We could've lost half of those people and still been fine.<br>
<br>
I posted some examples of the kinda junk I think we'll see now that PnP is a raid tactic. I did NOT say IV would do these things, nor did I imply it. I know you guys haven't been to PoG in just about forever. If you think I was implying something about you here that's all you.<br>
<br>
You're damn right I think it's funny the server crashed before you could loot. Poetic justice, you ganked our raid becuase CT was up due to a server crash, server crashes again and ganks up your raid? That's fucking hilarious.<br>
<br>
Wanna blacklist me for telling the truth? Have at it, I group 99% with PO anyway, you won't affect me much.<br>
<br>
Alyen is not the devil, Alyen did not lie, Alyen did not leave anything out, Alyen did not come here to drum up anti-IV support. Alyen did come here to answer a question posed by someone, Alyen did come here to let the rest of the server know we have reached a new low in raid tactics so they won't be as surprised as I was. <p>Alyen Stormrunner<BR>

Reposting:<br>
<br>
Well, last night as the events were unfolding I was angry and had a lot of opinions.<br>
<br>
I wondered how someone could knowingly and purposefully ruin another guild’s raid in the pursuit of loot? What kind of person is so loot-frenzied and self-serving as to trample over the other people who play this game? I honestly couldn’t believe it was happening. Surely the IV people sitting at their keyboards knew that they would sour the experience and crush the emotions of 50 other people sitting behind their keyboards? <br>
<br>
PO was in Fear. Half the zone was already cleared when the servers crashed. We knew that IV would want Cazic, but we had the zone. We were there first, doing our thing, and we were not in any way threatening the spawn claimed by them. We offered to clear a path to the god for them. The problem is, though, that we cannot clear as fast as they can.<br>
<br>
So, to save themselves a little bit of time to rush to an uncontested spawn, a decision was made by every IV member who zoned into Fear to ruin the night for a large number of people. Their justification: phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Why have a moral compass when you have absolute power? IV isn’t breaking any game rules, after all.<br>
<br>
Then I spoke to an IV person in chat room tells (Riaa). At the time, I thought to myself that she was trying to defend the indefensible. Here are her arguments:<br>
<br>
It’s getting late and some people from IV had to go to bed. She said that Fear needed to be cleared at IV pace to sustain the troops necessary to kill Cazic. If IV failed to kill Cazic, she feared that CC would grab him in the morning. The high-end game is about competition. After all, IV offered to kill everything in the zone and give PO all looting rights. PO is the one being unreasonable. This is how it’s done on other servers.<br>
<br>
And then it dawned on me. It really is all about the loot. No other thing was factored into the decision-making process, it’s all about the loot. I confess that I’m a noob. This is my first character to reach level 55, and my first foray into the high-end game. I stupidly imagined that the considerate, polite relations I’ve enjoyed with other guilds to date would continue beyond level 55. The high-end game – as played by IV – is a Quake-style competition against other people. The challenge is in defeating mobs, and in beating the competition who want to fight the same mobs.<br>
<br>
So, the bottom line is that IV will do whatever it must in pursuit of its own interests. Everyone else who plays the game either needs to conform or get the hell out of the way. That’s fine, I respect that now that I understand it. Just don’t deny that this is your stance when, in another situation, a different stance would suit you better.<br>
<br>
Back when I was innocent and foolish, I believed that it was an unfathomable breech of decency to enter a camped plane and slaughter mobs from under the noses of those there first. I’ve been told that this is not the lowest you can go, either. This happens on other servers with regularity. In fact.. isn’t that why many of us came to Vazaelle in the first place? To escape the very thing that’s become the norm here? If you wanted to make Vazaelle into Nameless_02, I wish you would have stated so earlier.<br>
<br>
Okay, so sorry I complained and whined. I didn’t understand the rules of the high-end game, thanks for making it clear. No one has to be nice anymore when loot is in the balance.<br>
<br>
I have friends in IV, and I have no enemies there that I know of. My friends are still my friends I hope despite my rant, and I sure don’t need any enemies. IV will do whatever it needs to do to advance its agenda. I will do my best to stay out of your way.<br>
<br>
No longer a complainer, now simply disillusioned.<br>
<br>

Procax, I would love to discuss this event with any member of IV. (No, your e-mail is not in your profile). Their silence on these boards is, well, surprising. I never thought that individual people with individuals opinions could be muzzled by their master. Your owner tells you to stfu, and you obey? &quot;Yes, it's a new policy (to keep silent).&quot; If you have something to say about this incident, say it here, no one owns you. If you don't want your opinions known to the community (and I can certainly understand this if your opinion is that the community &lt; you), then send me a tell.

They felt that they could clear faster and were concerned that if they waited for us to clear that there wouldn't be enough people on to drop him. Someone also mentioned to me that they thought we were trying to set up CT so CC could come after him.<br>
<br>
That came from someone who was there but in niether guild, take it for what it's worth. <p>Alyen Stormrunner<BR>

Your posts were good.  They made good points.  Points I don't agree with, but definately rational thought.<br>
<br>
And as to why to not post on the boards.  If you can honestly say that while reading everyone of Alyon's posts, and be happy that he is representing your guild, then again we disagree.  His and Vehnn's &quot;why don't you make me&quot; thread was probably a new board low that I had ever seen, heh.<br>

Certainly if anyone tried to prevent me from posting whatever I thought I would instantly deguild, and I'm sure that others in IV feel the same. That said, although it's none of your business, the general consensus within IV is that there are too many trolls/flamers/idiots on this board to be worth bothering with. The large majority of IV members don't even read this board. If you have a problem, send a tell in-game. Just bear in mind that we want to play this game too, and that we have goals and feelings as well. If you want to ignore that...well....more power to you. It's your right to play the game however you want. If you think otherwise, you probably need professional help, or at least a break from EQ.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm somewhat incredulous at people seriously discussing morality in the context of a video game, but my attempts at mockery have repeatedly been taken at face value and with personal indignation. Laugh, whatever. Honestly, when you get past the sub lev 20 crowd, people seem alot more mature on SZ, alot more willing to take a step back and laugh. I guess toons that haven't been corpse camped a bit have an exaggerated sense of self-importance. I'm not really sure, I haven't studied Toon Ethics, Toon Sociology or Toon Psychology for that matter.<br>
<br>
This has probably been my first serious post on the rant board, it will also be my last. If you ever see me post on this board, rest assured that I am merely being sarcastic, mocking someone's self-importance, or telling someone to get a life. Thanks, rest assured that in reality I love you all...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I totally agree with you here, to be honest. However, I kept that discussion seperate from this.<br>
<br>
Heck if you go back a few pages you'll see that I corrected a flamer who said the point here was that IV is suchandsuch and blahblah. My point all along is that Vazaelle has hit a new low with regards to raids and what is acceptable and that it's going to be downhill from here. If you don't think we'll be seeing more of this kind of thing happening, well, I think you're fooling yourself. <p>Alyen Stormrunner<BR>

<br>
I heard stories, though, about how important reputation is. If you get a bad rep, you’ll destroy your end-game life because no one wants to be around a gimp. Don’t train, don’t KS, respect camps, don’t ninja, don’t be a loot whore – break these rules and incur the wrath of the community, and at the expense of your reputation.<br>
<br>
All these anti-IV flames? It’s the wrath of the community, but you’re too powerful to care about it.<br>
<br>
“Personally, I'm somewhat incredulous at people seriously discussing morality in the context of a video game.”<br>
<br>
So, morality has no place in EQ. I have the answer I seek.<br>
<br>
Loot &gt; Decency.<br>
<br>
I &gt;think&lt; I know what’s going through the minds of most of the people in IV. “Yeah, we’re the school bully and we bloodied PO’s nose. I wish they’d shut up about it already and beef themselves up so they maybe can fight back next time instead of whine about it.”<br>
<br>
And, sadly, that’s what many in PO are doing now. Levels and xp-grinding. My what fun! I would never entertain the idea of joining IV, because they play a different game than I do. I’m just praying that PO doesn’t turn into IV Jr.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, because of IV’s power, they are in a position to set the rules for this server. And the rules they are laying down don’t suit me at all. I believe that morality DOES have a place, even in the context of a video game, and I say this with no incredulity. I would NEVER be involved in a raiding force that stabs 50 people in the back to get 3 pieces of loot.<br>
<br>
That’s just me, and that’s just one way to play the game. IV plays it differently, and IV is stronger than me. Like I said earlier, I’ll try to stay out of your way.<br>

In order to advance to the next island you need Sirran the Lunatic to spawn.  (The bunnies are angry!  Angry I say! /pwn)  And guess what, he stays up after you kill the island boss for (I think) 45 minutes.  During that time period, if anyone else kills an island boss, Sirran will *not* re-spawn or move for them.  Not that this entirely prevents two guilds from being in PoA, it just makes life a bit more diffulcult.  Anyways, just though you all should be aware of this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showPrevMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=140><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24>VCC Archives</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
