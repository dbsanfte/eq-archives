<br>
Do we actively attempt to shape the world around us and engage in nation building?  Of course we do.  However, I don't think that makes us imperialist, as we show a remarkably unusual quality among great powers of giving freedom to countries after they have been conquered.  This is not the behavior of imperialists.<br>

This is prolly what pisses people off the most, including me. <br>
<br>
Just because America doesn't try to &quot;politically&quot; control the world doesn't mean we aren't imperialist. I would venture to say that doing this through economic means is much more effective. Territory can change hands rather easily, but once you have all the money, its hard for others to take it away from you. <br>
<br>
The U.S. prolly could take over the world, and would if we thought we could get away with it. But people have tried that before, and it doesn't work. It instigates something called worldwide retaliation. Our country has found a better way of controling everything it seems.<br>
<br>
Still, America does practice true imperialism, just in a secretive way. We don't have to physically take control of a country, just have the CIA go in and oust the current regime to replace it with one that is more favorable to us. This is known to have taken place several times, and who knows how many more additional instances are kept confidential.<br>
<br>
The fact that we try to shape the world solely to further our own interests is utterly selfish, and it makes me ashamed of my country. But with as un-patriotic as I am, I am glad to be allowed to say these things without any fear of retribution. That is thanks, of course, to the people who started this nation over 200 years ago. I think its current state is a disgrace compared to that.<br>

Exerting economic influence through means that other countries can turn down if they choose is not imperialism.  Countries could choose to remove all of our influence by not dealing with us, and some do that, but most realize that it's still to their benefit to deal with us and that they are better off than if we did not exist at all.  Thus, it's a question of whether we help them not at all, a little, or  a lot, not whether we will hurt them.  No country has an obligation to trade with any other country, it's entirely within our rights to withold our economic support of those nations we deem problematic.<br>
<br>
Some of what we use our influence for is our own ends, but we use it for many very noble ends as well.  We use it against countries with poor human rights records as a way of pressuring evil regimes to treat their people better.  That's something I'm proud of.  We also use it as a preferred means of protecting our own people and overseas interests against those that would harm us.  It is because we love peace that we choose that over military conflicts.  Only when there is no other alternative and we perceive grave threat do we use military force.<br>
<br>
If the the entire world supported freedom and wished us no harm, then we wouldn't find it necessary to exert any pressure on other countries, and we'd likely cease to do it entirely.  However, we do not live in such a world.<br>

  The United States didn't make this one up on their own.  For the past 3 millenium or so regimes have been trying to get countries who border them or affect them to have governments positive to their interests in power.  It's not really imperialism since we don't ever take control of the country.  I would consider it more of a, 'Let's change their government rather than bombing their people into the stone age' approach.<br>
<br>
  If I'm not mistaken, we are the only country in the world to have a law that forbids the government from poppin a cap in the head of state of another nation except in time of war.  This mostly came about due to the plethora of Dictators and such we did blow away during the mid to late 1900's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1828<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/17/03 3:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow that's a big ass deficit</span><hr size=1> I believe it's actually an executive order and was signed by President Ford.

As far as world economy, we have pretty much made it so that alternative choices aren't very appealing. Aside from that, I think the real issue is that as our economic influence spreads, so does our cultural influence. I honestly think it is kinda sad how some people cling so tightly to their way of life, but they do. <br>

I don't think it really has changed all that much.  However, I still believe communism is the greatest evil ever to befall the human race, and I don't think our attempts to off Castro were really that bad.  He was a horrible tyrant.  I hate the idea of killing anyone.  However, Castro really was a threat to the US (/wave Cuban Missile Crisis) and he royally fucked his own people.  I find it difficult because I don't even support the death penalty (I am uncomfortable with us deciding who has the right to live and die).  However, if it's one death of a guilty man versus a thousand or ten thousand innocents, or more, then I guess I support killing the guilty man.<br>

This is life in the 21st century.  Cultural influence will spread, and there are general directions it will take.  People will do what they enjoy and what makes their life better.  The time of cultural isolation is gone.  Like it or not, the world really is going to be a melting pot of cultures, and in the end we'll probably emerge with one.  Granted, this could take quite some time before the lines of culture entirely fade.  I do see some sadness in this, but I also except it as inevitable and part of progress towards a globally connected society.<br>
