Can't make reliable decisions based on too little, or distorted information.<br>
<br>
Several problems with America atm.<br>
<br>
First, like most people, American's hate to make decisions unless they have no other choice.<br>
<br>
Second, like most people, American's hate to have to think intelligently about something because that might just cause them to have to change their position on something that that hold near and dear to their hearts.<br>
<br>
Third, most American's are complacent snobs.  They have the best standard of living in the world (or at least one of the best) and think that everyone else inthe world is inferior.  And because everyone else is inferior, the American way is best and everyone should do it the American way.<br>
<br>
Fourth, most American's are far too comfortable and lazy to do anything to change things.  Why help anyone in Afganistan when it's not going to do anything for me?  Arrest and imprison anyone suspected of terrorism without due process?  Sure. I'm no terrorist, it's those foreigners with invalid green cards, assuming they even have any. Gee, invade someone's home and download everything on their computers and bug their phones and computers without a warrent?  No problem, we think they are terrorists so it's okay.    Until it happens to be YOU who are getting bugged, or raided, or hauled off to a dark room someplace without anyone else knowing about it.<br>
<br>
I felt a lot safer when you had to be charged with a crime before they locked you up.  I felt a lot safer when the cops (local, state, FBI, etc) had to get a warrent from a flesh and blood judge before they could search or bug a place, even if they guy was only a part time justice of the peace.<br>
<br>
How many suspects from 9/11/01 are still being held in New York?  How many Al Qaida are being held on Cuba?  This is an international human rights issue.  It's been a damn YEAR since the event happened.  Either charge them, try them, and determine their guilt or innocence NOW, and release or appropriately punish them; or release them because you're still sitting around with your thumb up your ass and don't know what to do next.  If they have enough knowledge to say the person is a threat; but not enough to convict of a crime; then they need to record who the hell they are and deport their asses back to where they came from and never let them back in this country again.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ulinale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Linale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/17/02 2:32:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1629.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Zinj, think you could make a few more grand generalizations?!

Linale, generally, POW's are caught engaging in open (or covert if shown to be a spy or other such operative) warfare, and there is some measure of justifiable <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EVIDENCE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that merits detaining them and holding a trial.  <br>

This isn't your country.  This is just as much your country as it is mine.  I'm allowed to dissent.  I'm allowed to complain.  I'm allowed to bitch.  By raising question, voicing discomfort as the rights of other people promised by OUR country are being, or potentially being trampled upon, then OF COURSE I'm going to be vocal about it.  Your type of American needs to wake up and smell the fucking coffee.  This &quot;war on terrorism&quot; as Bush likes to call it is fast becoming a war on personal freedom.<br>

To read Zinj's post, we suck major ass, and there's not much worse a place to live.  That's what I got out of it.  I never said he had to love it or leave, but shit, he thinks we're all fucking demons working for the anti-christ.<br>
<br>
About POW's you are correct, but from my understanding, all those in Cuba are al qaeda or Taliban fighters who ENGAGED American forces.  But I guess not, they must have just gone out, rounded up a bunch of Afghans and threw them in jail.  Never heard of puttting a combatant on trial.  Held till the end of the war, yes, put on trial, no.<br>
<br>
By all means feel free to voice concerns or whatever.  i will too as soon as I feel my rights or liberties have been trampled on.  I read the link that was posted to the Patriot Act.  There's nothing there for either side to prove anything with.<br>

Perhaps I am missing something but that sure seems like a love it or leave it statement to me.<br>

While I am suspicious of conspiracy theories and emotional rhetoric, I am way more suspicious of anything that erodes personal freedoms regardless of the good it may be trying to do. <br>

And, with the notable exception of Headline News, there aren't many coma patients giving news these days.<br>
<br>
In fact, boys and girls, &quot;bias free reporting&quot; is actually a relatively new phenomenon in journalism, dating back to the Civil War.  Publishers used this approach because it allowed them to sell papers on both sides of the Mason-Dixon.  It was a purely financial move, it wasn't based in altruism, or a dedication to the truth.<br>
<br>
2) Mistakes are made in Live television.  I'm going to assume that none of you have been in a control room during a breaking news situation, so I will explain what happens:  The producer speaks in to the anchor's IFB (earpiece to you laypeople), people hand the anchor scripts and scraps of paper, the teleprompter gets updated, and the floor people use hand signals.<br>
<br>
In a live situation, anchors have been known to misspeak, misinterpret, or mishear information while tap dancing and explaining what's happening.  The producer has been often known to mishear, misinterpret, or misspeak something to the anchor, in the heat of the moment.<br>
<br>
The official on the scene has been known to do the exact same thing.<br>
<br>
In order to give the viewer the absolute latest on a breaking news event, a lot of things have to happen.  Dozens of people are involved at the very minimum.<br>
<br>
So, when a bitter print journalist sits in his solitary windowless room and Monday Morning quarterbacks live coverage, it's pretty easy to set himself on a high horse.<br>

It's not Monday morning quarterbacking to say that local TV news is getting more and more sensationalistic and doesn't devote as much attention to stories that don't have compelling images (shit on fire, kids, kids on fire, what have you). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uravendawn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RavenDawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/02 1:12:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1629.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Media Bias</span><hr size=1> Psst.... Zinj dont hate someone because they got a better straw when chosing whose womb to go into. People are not given the same chances when born as others. Some have silver spoons and some dont BUT, each has the ability to control his or her destiny.<br>

The "problem" with America is the freedom we were granted by our Founders. Im a "problem" child of this great nation because i am FREE to be a Bigot, Ceo, Teacher, or even a college student with the doors of life wide open to me to do with as i wish. If you chose to hate someone or generalize someone because they have made more of them selves or were born different, then in the end you've recieved what you deserved. <br>

I thank my ancestors for supporting the founding of this nation so that it can strive above and beyond those with simple minds. <p><img src="http://home.bendcable.com/dac/raven.jpg"><br>

We live in a capitalist society, money is supposed to grant a person more privileges.  That's what drives our society and gives us a competitive edge over other systems. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzexlos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zexlos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/20/02 2:23:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1629.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One point tho raven</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
