Need input </font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well would like to throw out some ideas and viewpoints. On ECI the public was a very large organization. The seemed to take precedence over the large guilds. This was one of the factors that caused lots of “problems” with feeling towards SOTS (I use them as an example because they were at the root of many complains on ECI). You know what SOTS, KEG, etc.. All have the same rights as everyone else on the server. They pay just like the rest of us to play. They shouldn’t have to miss out of Raids, events, etc just because the “Public” feels they have the right, we are all equal. We all pay, we all devote time to the game.  What I have noticed so far is the large and powerful guilds seem to be working out schedules VERY well. I could be wrong on this but that is the impression I have. The Public I think needs a representative, someone who can work out schedules with the guilds of Zeb.  I don’t think there should be the rotating schedules like there was on ECI, i.e. Public had Hate Mon, Tues, Sat, and Sun… This representative could be someone who is guildless or a member of one of the large guilds doesn’t matter as long as they can work with other guilds on scheduling.  This is in the best interest of the Public. I believe SOT’s moved to the new server because of all the political crap that had to deal with on ECI, not sure about the guilds that moved from Rathe but might be similar reasons. The Public is not going to be able to assemble a bunch of people, head to Hate or Fear zone in and them complain because a large guild is there.  I for one have no sympathy for situation like this.  Again they have the same right as everyone else, if they worked out something with the other guilds and found no problems with doing that then they can / should be able to. Without a representative for the Public not only will you have a hard time getting Raids but might end up at the other end of the whacking stick and enraging the large guild by disturbing their plans. I for one do enjoy Public Raids. Being only 53 I can’t participate with some of the guilds on Zeb due to lvl restrictions. But enjoy meeting new people and making new friends. I would like to hear of others thoughts and ideas on this</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#dcdeed><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udivinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Divinia</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Loud Mouthed Wench</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>21</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333>4/12/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333>10:28:11 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://www.nexus2.f2s.com/StandardSmall.jpg width=178 height=134></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: SOTS, KEG, Public - Community effort.

So here I am at level 52, considering guilds I'd like to join; unfortunatly 95% of the large guilds have level restrictions even on joining that would exclude me. So essentially if I'd like to go on a raid (something needs to break the monotony of leveling), I either need an invite by a guild or go on a public raid.<br>
<br>
The deal is that large guilds are organized in a serious way. I've been on Raids with KEG, CIW, and other large guilds and am impressed with what they accomplish. I've shown up for public raids and found them to be chaotic and most of the time never even start due to lack of interest.<br>
<br>
So where does that leave me? I've spent 2 year on this character to be able to go on these wonderful adventures called raids but now I find myself severly limited.<br>
<br>
As I have said on another post on this board; we need to find a system that will give everyone opportunity. We have a chance for a new start here and to create a server society that has a different mindset other than the "me first" attitude that seems to pervade other servers.<br>
<br>
I don't have any answers myself but this discussion is a great start!<br>

<br>
Guild raids tend to be well organised because everyone knows what they're doing and what they have to do. On the other hand public raids contain a high proportion of people that don't know what they're doing and a proportion of those are not willing to find out what they should be doing.<br>
<br>
But it's unfair to tar all us pubbies with the same brush. some of us do what we do very well, and even if we don't know what's going on we're willing to ask and listen if need be.<br>
<br>
As for a representative... if the Guilds represent the corporations of the world, then yes, we could do with a president to represent the public. Just don't mention the word &quot;calendar&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On E'ci we had various Guilded people that were willing to share their experiences with the public and lead raids.<br>
<br>
Or maybe we could have a &quot;For hire&quot; section, whereby a Guild going on a raid can &quot;hire&quot; the Guildless for a raid to fill missing spots maybe with the intention of recruiting?<br>
<br>
It is hard though, a lot of the major Guilds are as full as they want to be and getting in, even if you're of the required level for the Guild, is rather difficult.<br>
<br>
But yes, it is difficult for those of us in smaller Guilds or Guildless, and I think it would be a shame if I'd have to join a large Guild if I wanted a chance to raid. I like my individuality and I'd rather not just been seen as 1 in a pool of Shaman.<br>

<br>
From my perspective, it's not a matter of people fearing change. The Rathe guilds have been there, and know exactly what to expect. We have a very informed opinion on how a Calendar works, and how it eventually can turn out. As we lived with one for well over a year. Do you have the same experience from Eci? <br>
<br>
Personally I don't want to know 3 weeks ahead of time that I will be in a place anymore. I like logging in and having an actual *choice* of things to do for a change. This is such a refreshing change for the Rathe guilds. Where we had one plane a month if we were lucky, Trakanon on a rotation that turned into 6 guilds and one Trak every few weeks.<br>
<br>
I was one of the biggest supporters of the Rathe calendar almost up until the end when I saw just how ugly it had become. I helped get the rules off the ground with members of CIW and Bots. It turned very ugly, even if you threw out the Epic stuff, there was still enough ugliness left.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure you'll only see some of the main guilds in Fear/Hate on patch days when the Gods are up. That leaves probably 25ish days that the planes are free. Take the initiative and do /who all druid for Fear or /who all cleric for Hate to see if anybody is up there  <br>
<br>
Plane of Growth, my guild hasnt gone there in god knows how long. Not sure I've see many of the other high end game guilds in there either. That's a heck of a lot of open plane days for the people worried about a Calendar. And if you are interested in the high end Velious spawns, get your troops organized and there and *beat* the other guilds to them. My guild has about 8-9 options now when it comes to Patch days and the couple days following, if all else fails we can head to ToV and get some armour to make up for any "lost" opportunities.<br>
<br>
As for the high end game, there is no rotation or "Calendar" other than informal heads up communication between the guilds.<br>
<br>
If your problem is Trakanon or VS, talk to the guilds who are actually killing them now. There are only a handful killing them on a regular basis from what I see.<br>
<br>
Do a /who all count sometime on Zeb, when there was 1700 people online at peak time last night, 1200 of those were lvl 50 and under. I don't foresee a huge overcrowding problem on this server for a very very long time.<br>

We have about 20 very experienced planar folks, and about 15 more in the low 40's chomping at the bit.  Back on the Rathe with 2 other guilds, scheduled Fear and Hate once each per month and hand no problem clearing them and have a god kill (old inny) under our belt.<br>
<br>
Now on the Zeb, we would like to start doing Fear and Hate again because 95% of the people we raided with are here with us.<br>

I posted a message before asking what kind of communication the KEGS, AoA's, etc. are using and trying to find out about planning a raid with my guild so as not to interfere with anyone else's fun.  However, it got no responses.  I've also posted on CIW's forum, and again, dead air.<br>
<br>
So what's the big secret the large guilds have?  I don't want to plan a raid with our 36 experienced raiders only to show up to an empty zone or to KEG already raiding.<br>
<br>
I've talked to people in-game about scheduling zone crawls, to hear, &quot;I'm going with guild ABC to Fear on Thursday, so sorry I can't make it to your event.&quot; or some such.  Well, how do they know that Fear will be popped or another guild won't be there?  What's the rotation schedule?<br>

<br>
For those of you who weren't there or simply refuse to understand I will say it again - other than Hate (well after SoTS and other capable guilds had stoped going there) and more recently PoG, there were no &quot;public&quot; raids. The &quot;public&quot; raids on VS and Trak are not public - they are and always have been a couple guilds working together. I know. I was there and I attended them. <br>
<br>
This horse is long dead. Things seem to be working fine so lets not stir the pot with this &quot;public&quot; stuff. If you want to get into these types of raids, you can do it the way I always did - make friends and ask to go along. You can also try to join a large guild (currently the more popular choice by the sheer numbers of people begging to join them). If the &quot;being a friend of a large guild&quot; thing doesn't work for you, try to get a couple of &quot;sister guilds&quot; together to work together and try to mesh into the existing framework. <br>
<br>
The whole &quot;public v. SoTS&quot; melodrama came about as a result of public demand and a class envy mentality. Let's not start that here too. There are other equitable solutions. <br>

Need input </font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The thing is, the &quot;public&quot; system won't work well on a server like ours.  Why?  Because on Zeb, the uber raids are all based on who gets there first.  If you can mass the people and organization it takes to own a zone or uber mob first, then chances are you will get it.  However, most larger guilds are also flexible, and have several alternate targets in mind in case the first spot they are interested in is taken.<br>
<br>
In the past (on E'ci anyway) the public usually attempted to reserve a zone or mob in advance, and then would complain if they didn't get it.  On Zeb a reservation system will likely NOT be respected, at least not unless all the guilds sign off on the idea, and I doubt they will.  All zones and mobs will remain FFA regardless.  Hopefully that same failed reservation system and the complaints that accompanied it will not be taking root here.<br>
<br>
Now, if a public raid can be organized quickly and get a full raid party into the zone early enough to pre-empt anybody else who also has designs on the zone, then there probably won't be a problem.  If not, they may end up sharing the zone, or being forced to look elsewhere, like the other guilds do when something they plan on is taken.<br>
<br>
My advice to any public raid leader would be to be prepared to lead your group into battle somewhere, but don't count on it being the first place on the list.  Have several alternates in case the first spot is taken or empty, and have the people ready to move to whichever one is open as quickly as possible.  Make sure your followers have as much varied resist gear as they can so they can tailor it to whatever ends up being the final target.<br>

Yes it is working fine for now. Perhaps you haven’t been watching the chat boards, or haven’t been invited to a Public raid on Zeb yet… But I have already been invited and attended Public raids on Zeb. I have seen an increase in posts about Public raids and events. The “horse is long dead” is not true.<br>
<br>
This is not about ME, I have a guild, and I have lots of friends. What I need is more time to attend the things I get invited to if anything LOL.  This is for the Zeb community, perhaps you are right and this will not become an issue. But the trends don’t seem to be so. I personally think the Public does exist and will continue to exist and therefore should have some thought put into the structure in which they will operate. I don’t like the calendar thing and believe that is causes more problems then it really helps, but that is just 1 person’s view. <br>
<br>
&lt;The whole &quot;public v. SoTS&quot; melodrama came about as a result of public demand and a class envy mentality. Let's not start that here too. There are other equitable solutions.&gt;<br>
<br>
Woot, an agreement. Ya I think most of the problems were also stemming from envy. As far as starting it here, I would like to see a solution before it does get out of hand that’s all.  But if everyone wants to just wait and see what becomes that is ok with me also. I will still be doing raids with my guild, still wishing for more EQ time… We have a good thing right now and just hope to keep it.<br>

But a slight misconception is that the uber guilds have some formal rotation that a 'public representative' wants to be in the loop.  There is no such rotation.  If a raid leader from the community wants to raid something, they have to beat other groups to the spawn just like everyone else with a force big enough to tackle the encounter.<br>

<br>
For major encounters (Dragons, bosses, etc) it seems FCFS is going to rule.  You wanna kill VS.  Have the 30 people online when servers come up.  You can or cant be in the same guild, or any guild.  Just make sure your party is there first.  Period.<br>
<br>
My small guild held some decent (though not on the level of VS) raids with many people (other small guilds or, gasp, "the public") and they were successful and fun.  It can be done on about any scale. <br>
<br>
All it takes is someone with the desire to put it together.  Find X people who can be on when the servers come up to get to the spawn, and take it out.<br>
<br>
Planes ... same thing I would guess.  Comes down to getting there when ya can get there.  If you get there after UberGuild00, well, hope they've been up 12 hours and the zone in is respawning.  (I havent been to fear, and havent done hate since the changes, i heard 2 groups can fight there well now?!)<br>
<br>
I've always enjoyed the calendar system on Eci, because it allowed me to plan. I'm more of a casual gamer, and need to spend most of my time with my wife and kid.  So for me, being able to say "Honey, on Sunday i'm unavailble except to eat" was awesome.  However, i'll adapt.  If i cant be on when my guild does a raid, or when any group that has a spot for me does a raid, then I miss out.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, I feel the use of friends and allies speaks volumes for this game, as well as life.  I know of a very small guild on Eci that has 1 of their epics done, and another (ranger) more than 1/2 done (he has the off hand sword).  And it's mainly because they've got good friends and allies to help them along the way.<br>
<br>
I said this before, a raid isnt a raid because the commands are Green spam.  Using /GU to work it, or /ooc and /shout work the same way.  Find your people who can go, plan it, and do it.  Oh, and take screen shots!  I've still never seen Inny dead!<br>

Need input </font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">&gt;&gt;I posted a message before asking what kind of communication the KEGS, AoA's, etc. are using and trying to find out about planning a raid with my guild so as not to interfere with anyone else's fun. However, it got no responses. I've also posted on CIW's forum, and again, dead air.<br>
<br>
The simple answer is that there is none, really.  If you want some insight... well, I'm in DBN.  We're not quite as capable as KEG, SotS, Icewind.  Don't have quite their numbers of high levels.  But we are big, capable, and getting bigger and more capable.  So let's run through a typical set up:<br>
<br>
1.  We hear patch is scheduled.  Someone posts it on our board.  People read this and know they'll be busy that day.<br>
<br>
2.  We discuss what we want to go for.  We take into account what we believe we are capable of, what other guilds are likely to go for, and our needs.<br>
<br>
3.  One of our guild leaders/officers says: &quot;we go for this&quot;.  And maybe he'll throw out an alternate target or two.<br>
<br>
4.  We get on-line.  We head to our destination.  If it's busy, we go else where.<br>
<br>
And that's about all there is to it.  Now, maybe KEG and SotS chit-chat a bit about who goes for the dain and who goes for something else.  Or maybe they quasi-rotate.  But it isn't major planning or anything like that.<br>
<br>
One of the big advantages of a guild is that we can adapt.  We can plan on going to Hate, find Icewind there, and shift gears and rush to Trakanon.  Nobody minds too much.  They understand Icewind got there first and they know that if the situations were reversed, Icewind would head off to some second goal.  We also know that if we don't get Hate today, we might get it next month and that if we get Trak today, it still helps the guild.  <br>
<br>
For us, it isn't about the me.  It's about the us.  My guildies who I help get a Trak bp today will help me kill Inny next week.  This lets a guild shift it's targets very quickly as well as leap upon targets of opportunity.<br>
<br>
And we don't know if Icewind will be there.  We had a raid planned to hit the Kael Royals.  Patch that day so we bumped the raid a day.  And that next day, Icewind was there doing royals.  End result?  We did Arena instead.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I sort of like being calendarless.  Lots of things to kill.  Now, that may change when enough entities get big enough to cause serious conflicts.  But until that time, we've all got things to do and SoV sort of rotates people through things... once you can do ToV, PoG becomes pointless, for instance.  Which lets the next bunch of guilds use it to the fullest, getting the max benefit from nameds.<br>

I know that many of the uber guilds go to one uber mob, knock it out, then move on to the next uber mob knock it out etc. (Like VS, then the Dain and so forth.)<br>
<br>
This really doesn't give the smaller guilds that may take longer to gather their strength over the evening a chance. (Take a guild that has high amount of members they will naturally be able to have the neccissary amount of people to take out a givin mob than the smaller guild who may need to wait for people to come home from work, etc. to have the amount of people on neccissary.)<br>
<br>
This all goes to my original post of the "me first" attitude. Whats the problem with taking out one uber mob post patch and letting the smaller guilds have a chance at the others?<br>
<br>
On another note - Essentially from what I'm reading, there are two options? Calender and Public Raids. Both whom have major guilds saying they will not respect one or the other system. Lets all think hard for other alternatives.<br>
<br>
One serious issue (probably our biggest problem) on Zeb is the sheer amount of high level players that made the /movelog - Look around and most of the 40- areas are almost deserted. This poses an interesting and serious problem - There is probably more competition for these major mobs/raids than on either of our respective ex-servers.<br>
<br>
Again, I really don't have any answers but I think it is clear that these issues need to be discussed.<br>

<br>
Well, VS is a write off.  A skilled guild can go in, kill him, and be gone in under half an hour.  He doesn't take many people to do either.  <br>
<br>
However, something like the Dain takes more time.  Yes, the big guilds are going to move from one target to the next.  But it takes time.<br>
<br>
If you can't have a respectable show of force at a target during this time...  When your guild is ready for Velk, you will be able to claim him while the other guilds are off killing the Dain and whatever.  If they want Velk, well, you go after the Dain.  Until you reach a point where the number of targets is less than the number of guilds that can handle them, it really doesn't matter as long as everyone is content to kill something.<br>
<br>
The big guilds respect others.  It is first come, first serve.  But that means if you beat them there, it's yours.  Assuming, of course, you have a decent force there.<br>
<br>
Another thing that factors in is boredom/need.  You look at the biggest guilds, they kill in ToV.  This means they are getting armor better than what drops off Trak/VS.  So once they get enough teeth, epic pieces, they'll quit bothering with those mobs.  When the challenge gets down to how few people you can do it with with 0 losses, well, then it isn't a guild activity anymore, really.  Been there, done that.  There's other fish to fry.  Bigger fish with better loot.  KEG, for instance, isn't likely to kill VS just so that they can trade/sell his drops.  It isn't their nature.  As long as guilds kill mobs for things they want/need and then move on, eventually everyone gets their shot.  When KEG and SotS are done with ToV, they'll be playing in Sleepers.  And this will open up room for others in ToV.<br>

Yes, I have friends outside of CIW, and I do care for them as much as my own clannies, but their needs are tended to by their respective leaderships.<br>

I don't think it's my responsibility to care what the smaller guilds are doing.  Heck, if they want to hit trak, and they beat us there first, &quot;good job guys, we'll be heading out now&quot;.  It's not CIW, SOTS, KEG, AOA, LD, DBN, or anyone else's responsibility to ensure that the smaller mobs are &quot;getting their share&quot;.  If they want their share, then they gonna have to adapt, and do waht is necessary to meet those objectives.<br>

Other than for epic stuff, CIW hasn't killed VS for a long while now.  We're gonna keep hitting Trakanon however, until we have enough teeth for our members.

It would be possible to make a guild called Public.<br>
The GM can invite everyone who wans to join.<br>
Maybe add some more co-GMs for the times the GM is not online.<br>
Then add Officers who can guild invite anyone who wants to join the guild called Public.<br>
With the guild motd, the GMs can type in what he/she wants to plan for the time online.<br>
The raid will have a guild channel.  Those not participating in the guild can turn off /gu.<br>
And if you grow so large, then created a guild called Public2...<br>
Well, I wish I had more play times.  I think it would be fun.<br>

Hell, if my guild is dumb enough to think that one group of 50-54 people can take VS ... respect the fact that we got there first and let us fail (or succeed) before you step in.  I'd hate to see something where we got there first, made our way down, only to have Uberguild00 say<br>
/shout You dont have enough for that mob.  We're taking over<br>

cause you can bet your ASS there'll be more than just a small problem with that.  No one should be allowed to say who is or is not capable of something.  <br>
<br>
AS for first come first serve .. if I get one group there before you get 2 groups there .. does that mean that you get it because you have the 2 groups even though we got there first?  Just cause 2 of my people went LD porting over, doesnt give the late comers rights, does it?   Are you gonna get there second, and because we need another 10 minutes to get the others there, are you gonna start?  Does that constitute first come first serve, or stepping over someone's raid because you feel we didnt have force enough to complete it?<br>

 Dont get nitpicky about situations as a whole, cause here's a scenario for you, 60 people, 1 group at 10 diferent locations, holding each and every spawn until the rest of the larger guild can get there to finish.<br>
 ^^ situations like that, your *1* group will be laughed at.<br>
 I'll restate the generalization made by countless of people, several times already that you failed to pick up on or read.<br>
 If you have people in the holding areas for each respective mob, and gathering forces for that mob already. Then no, noones gonna step over you.<br>
 Please explain to me any difference in the above statement that has changed from what has already been said before.</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

The public / smaller guilds aren’t asking to take over every uber mob in the game. We are just saying the we plan on holding some public raids every now and then. We, the public, may not be as organized as some of the guilds on Zeb. Since there seems to be a lack of communication, there isn’t anything wrong with someone asking questions or rehashing issues as you called it to find out the way is has been handled so far. Maybe there needs to be a system that works for all and not just 3 or 4 guilds. This is a game for everyone, not just a select few.  I personally don’t really care what system we use nor don’t use, but just want to make sure it is fair for everyone involved. </font><P><font color="#2F4F4F">

<br>
Public raids to what?<br>
<br>
If its just fear/hate i doubt you will get much resistance, as long as a god isnt up.<br>
  <br>
If its VS/Trak/Kunark Dragons/Dain/Velketor/Velious Dragons, i doubt any type of public reservation would be honored, if you want those mobs you will have to beat people there.  <br>
<br>
In short, be more specific as to what you are looking for.<br>
