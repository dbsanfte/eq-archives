He never made a reacist comment. He simply mentioned events and policys that happen/have happened, in such wonderful places like China. You can't deny that. The biggest issue is this: Karburan is creative when he puts someone down. Karburan is funny when he puts someone down. Karburan makes sense when he puts someone down. Karburan doesn't troll like most of us, so what he says when he says it, probably means alot to him, rather than mindlessly bantering on threads, like most of us do. And you hate him because you don't know him. You don't know him, so, you assume that he is an asshole because you never grouped with him and you don't have any stories with you and Karburan at level 18 in Lake of Ill Omen getting killed by Goblin Sarnak Chief Priests over and over, and how funny it was kekeke~~~~~ Try to open your fucking mind.
