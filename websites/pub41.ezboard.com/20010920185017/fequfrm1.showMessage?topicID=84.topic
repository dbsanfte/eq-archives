(down about 8 posts, see Ghitming's post); it follows.<br>
<br>
I don't know enough about EQu to refute (assuming they are incorrect, which I do) those charges. Thought the creator of EQu might wish to be aware, since this is at least a superficially persuasive post.<br>
<br>
Original post follows.<br>
**************************<br>
<br>
Did you load EQu? Seems that it uploads files with your stationname and maybe your password. Not sure how it works, but lots of people are getting hacked these days. Our guild leader got his account hacked only one hour after he changed the password.<br>
<br>
He petitioned and got all of his stuff back. Please try doing so before giving up.<br>
<br>
Below is some information on EQU clipped from our Guild message board.<br>
<br>
******************************************************For those who do not know XXmann's account was hacked today. The culprit was able to get into XXmann's account because he had EQu installed on his computer.<br>
<br>
EQu has a backdoor built into it. When you run EQu it connects to their server to check for any patches, seems harmless enough, but what you do not see is that it also send them your equname.txt and equchk.txt files both are about 1k so you would not notice the upload. These files are your station name and your password (encrypted).<br>
<br>
Once they have that they can get on your account in about 2 min. <br>
<br>
If you are still not sure about this try the following test.<br>
<br>
1. start equ and point it to a directory other than your everquest directory.<br>
<br>
2. reboot<br>
<br>
3. try to start equ. You will get an error in line 52.<br>
<br>
4. Put both equname.txt and equchk.txt in another directory modify then so they don't have your actual data.<br>
<br>
5. run equ..it will work <br>
<br>
**********************************************************<br>
<br>
I am not sure of the validity of the above info, but I figure better safe than sorry. Hope you get your stuff back Bro.<br>

<br>
The first thing that struck me odd about this month's conspiracy theory was the comment about how your station password is kept locally on your PC.  I haven't had a chance to check this &quot;equchk.txt&quot; file out for myself, (I'm at school atm and I've never heard of it prior to now) but I'll check it out and see I guess.  Seems like this would make it WAY too easy for people to do what has been proposed here, and what's more, if the password is kept locally why then must we enter our station password every time we play?  And if we have to enter the password every time we play, then what on earth would be Verant's point of keeping the password stored locally?  At first glance this just doesn't seem logical to me that the password is kept locally at all, but like I said I'm not even sure, so I'll check out this file I'm being accused of stealing.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what else to tell people who think I've put a &quot;backdoor&quot; into EQu.  And there's really no telling what other processes were running on this person's PC when he somehow discovered EQu was stealing his passwords.  If you download EQu from this site, and keep your PC relatively virus-free, then using EQu is no more dangerous than surfing the web.  <br>
<br>
I can assure you that no backdoor, password stealer, hack or otherwise malicious code was placed by me into EQu.  I wrote this program to help people out... not steal their passwords.  It's kinda disheartening to me when people accuse me of the contrary, but I guess that just goes with the territory. <p>Mustard</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bequ.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mustard>Mustard</A> at: 5/29/01 10:14:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uandoritchalla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andori TChalla</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EQu User</span><br> <font color=#00ff00>(4/4/01 5:06:20 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.concentric.net/~Dmarlt/Andori_small.jpg http://www.concentric.net/~Dmarlt/Andori_small.jpg ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another EQu &quot;scam&quot; rumor...</span><hr size=1>  I seriously doubt that the password is stored anywhere on your hard drive. That would be absurd! I've been using EQu for quite a long time now, no problems here. All my friends use it too, and I haven't heard tell of anyone being hacked. Mustard seems like an upright sort of fellow to me. I'm not worried. Just make sure you get the program from this site.<br>
<br>
 Also, keep in mind that there are tons of other ways your station name can be acquired by losers who want to hack you. The best defense is a hard to crack password. Use alternating caps and numbers. Do not use common words or names.<br>
<br>
<br>
**edit** I did the test suggested above with no results. I think maybe someone had a copy of EQu that had been tampered with. *shrug* i'm not worried. <p><B>Andori T'Challa</B><BR>

I'm not sure what this file is for actually... all I know is, it's a 32 byte null-terminated string of data that tends to change slightly in value (but not in length) after playing EQ, or perhaps patching (mine changed slightly in value over the past 2 days of playing EQ and a patch) but the fact that it doesn't change in value when you change your password took no more convincing for me, I don't think password info is stored in there.<br>
<br>
That said... the whole claim seems to me to be simply made up.  As for the apparent &quot;test&quot; you can perform, this also seems silly - particularly the parts about 'rebooting' (which has no effect on my program at all, other than removing it from memory as windows shuts it down) and the bit about getting an error on a specific line of code, which is also highly suspicious, since EQu will only report specific code lines in a few select routines where it's been deliberately programmed to do so and only then if you use the 'report this error' feature and have it generate an email for you - reporting line numbers upon error is not a normal part of VB's error reporting.<br>
<br>
But anyway... IF your version of EQu actually complies with the steps of that so called test, then you simply don't have the same EQu that I write and distribute.  Maybe it's hacked, maybe it's an imitation EQu, but whatever it is you should remove it immediately. <p>Mustard</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bequ.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mustard>Mustard</A> at: 5/29/01 10:14:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucatrinofluclin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Catrin of Luclin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EQu User</span><br> <font color=#00ff00>(4/17/01 8:45:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another EQu &quot;scam&quot; rumor...</span><hr size=1> I /agree with the above. I've used EQu for some time, think it's a great tool, and Mustard a fine fellow for releasing it to us. <br>
<br>
It's conceivable but moderately unlikely that ones encrypted password could be stored locally, because you'd want to do server side verification of the password anyway. Since Mustard has noted that the contents of the .txt file CHANGE without the password changing, that alone makes the claim even more dubious. <br>
<br>
The point about being sure of the site you get EQu from is well taken... since I've always downloaded it from Mustard's old page I'm content. Here's hoping you get telocity up soon.<br>

<br>
I work for a MAJOR telecom company as a NOS III technician. I have been doing the I`Net thing for about 8 years now, and have a pretty good idea of how people can hack your password.<br>
<br>
1.)  Your password is not stored ANYWHERE on your PC for Everquest. If it is, it is in a 3rd party program that you downloaded and installed and therefore YOU are responsible for it.<br>
<br>
2.)  Mustard is right. If a VB scripted piece of code runs into an error, it doesn't spit out a line error, it just craps out and either drops completely or locks up.  It only spits out a line error message during debugging.<br>
<br>
If you want to be safe, check out a piece of software at www.zonealarm.com called Zone Alarm.  It is freeware to personal users and does a good job of keeping track of what goes in and out of your comp.  Install it, tell it to ask you about EVERYTHING that tries to access the net and you will see what tries to process info across your connection and which side it tries to process from (from your comp or from the web) because it will pop up a window (even during an EQ session) that asks you if you want to give whatever it is access.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So make sure your comp is virus free. I doubt that Mustard has writen anything like this that it sits in the backround and watches your data packets or keystrokes for your eq password, The only other way is for them to guess and check your password if it is easy enough. I guess someone could crack eq chat server and obtain a complete listing of passwords but that is unlikely cause then everyones account would be gone.<br>

The most commonly accepted form of password creation is using the Strong Password style. This style consists of your choice of any 3 of the following:<br>
1) 8 character minimum<br>
2) At least 1 capital letter<br>
3) At least one number<br>
4) At least one non-alpha numeric character<br>
<br>
Here is an example of a Strong Password using all 4 criteria:<br>
<br>
EQAholic10$<br>
<br>
This password has 1) 11 characters 2) 3 capital letters 3) 2 numbers and 4) a non-alpha numeric character, the $.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, this little post will keep just one more person from losing items by a hacked account. Strong Password or not, I strongly reccomend that you change your password at least once a month if not weekly. If you aren't concerned about people in and around your house stealing items from your account, keep a sheet of paper at your desk and change it nightly if you are extremely concerned (to the rest of us, that's translated Paranoid!). <p>"Life would be much easier if I had the source code." - Drizzinn, Mage-istrate of Fennin Ro</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1.showMessage?topicID=157.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1.showMessage?topicID=156.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1.threadControl?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://boardimages.homestead.com/files/equezboard/topiccommands.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="equfrm1">General Discussion<option value="equfrm2">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00ff00>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bequ>EQu Message Board</a><font color=#00ff00> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fequfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#00ff00> - </font><a href="http://members.telocity.com/~ericruess306/equ">EQu Homepage</a><font color=#00ff00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
