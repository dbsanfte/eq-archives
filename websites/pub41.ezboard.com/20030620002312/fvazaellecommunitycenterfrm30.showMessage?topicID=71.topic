There is nothing wrong with using subtleties of international law to reduce the tax burden on a company.  My parents have done this as my father has spent a lot of time working overseas (Europe mostly).  There are quite a few subtleties of tax law that reduce your taxes substantially when you live overseas.<br>
<br>
I don't support any form of legislation at all whatsoever that increases taxation on anyone or anything.  Period.  Taxes are already way too high and need to be dramatically slashed to be brought into line with a more libertarian approach to government.<br>

Finally, it's not too much to expect that US tax dollars go to US companies. You have to ask at some point who exactly is serving whom?  You need to match your battlefield patriotism with your pocketbook patriotism, imho. All this means practically speaking is that if you move your HQ overseas don't expect your gov't contract to move w/ you. NO biggie right?<br>

You, Herder, Ayiar, and I might all have different ideas of what the proper role of the government is in society, but certainly if there is to be any government them surely it's objective must be something other than to remove itself from existence, per your quote, no? <br>
<br>
In many ways, from an economists point of view, this dances around the issue of what is the proper rate of taxation?  What level is most optimal? Beyond the fact that this is an inherently political question, some have tried to portray it differently. <br>
<br>
In fact, one person, on a napkin without any empirical evidence, constructed a curve in such a way as to posit that we are overtaxed and that furthermore, and due to the slope of the curve, should we reduce taxation, we'd experience revenue windfalls. That economic philosophy continues to haunt us. Federal deficits ballooned because of that philosophy. We should ask when will economists will stop engaging in politics and stop putting forth guesswork in the place of well established research. <br>
<br>
How much is the right amount of government? It's a political question and should be answered as such.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuvanvaz>TuvanVaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 586<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/27/03 4:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://nightblade.netfirms.com/linkbanners/OABanner.gif height=33 width=88></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Now this is wrong </span><hr size=1> It happens all the time.<br>

<br>
The Republicans get into office by stating the goal of reducing government spending, yet the only administration in my lifetime to actually reduce goverment spending in relation to GDP was run by the Democrats.<br>
<br>
Bush the Second is now in office.  Taxation for the rich is going to be less (to my benefit) while the poor will shoulder the same burden as before.  My guess is they will actually pay more, because local governments will be forced to raise the tax rates -- especially sales taxes -- which hit the lower income people harder than the moderate-to-high income brackets.<br>
<br>
Warren Buffet chastised the Bush administration for the outrageously massive tax break that will be given to the rich.  Under the original Bush tax reductions Warren Buffet's effective tax rate would have gone from about 30 percent to a mere 3 percent, while the middle class workers he employs would have maintained the same effective tax rate.<br>
<br>
Taxing dividends of the idle rich is no more a &quot;double taxation&quot; than a paycheck is to a normal wage earner.<br>
<br>
I can only hope that Warren Buffet does the same thing with his new windfall that I am doing with mine -- donating it to political candidates that will oppose the selfish, horrendous fiscal policy that the Republicans are enacting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=truthreason>TruthReason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm actually Goanad.</span><br>  Posts: 1259<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/27/03 5:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Now this is wrong </span><hr size=1> I dont see the irony Anywon.

George Herbert Walker Bush indeed said supply side economics were &quot;voodoo&quot; economics in a fleeting moment of contrituion whilst in the middle of a run for his parties presidential nomination. Of course he later fell into lockstep with the party on the issue and thus prostituted the well considered thinking results of his economics training. <br>
<br>
Of course Warren Buffet is right. He was basically catching the GOP redhanded in the act of making a political payoff to the minority of Americans who elected dubya.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 944<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/27/03 6:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Now this is wrong </span><hr size=1> I don't see how anyone can even begin to make an argument that the poor shoulder the majority of the burden.  Just look at the numbers, the rich carry the country.  You can argue that it should be this way (I disagree), but anyone sane will realize that the rich already pay for everyone else as it is.  The poor just mooch.  (Translation: The rich pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits, the poor pay less in taxes than they receive in benefits.)<br>
<br>
As for the role of government Goanad, you sort of took me out of context.  I'm not stating that the only purpose of govt should be to eliminate itself.  I was stating, more specifically, that when choosing contracts, the government should choose the ones with the lowest pricetags.  i.e. Given some fixed benefit to be received, the government's goal should be reduction of cost.  It was not meant to be as broad a statement as you read it to be.<br>
<br>
I believe that government should seek to shrink itself to a minimal size, but not eliminate itself.  I'd like to see our national budget about 10 percent of what it is and most programs eliminated outside of national defense.<br>

Don't always agree with him, but that is the nature of the game.  Yeah, he chastised me for posting an opinion instead of a fact...so what.  The majority of the shit posted in these threads is not fact.  Most of it is akin to political spin from one side or the other.<br>

Apparently, Senator Wellstone was behind legislation that would have stopped this kind of activity.<br>
<br>
Too bad he died, like many others opposed to the direction this country is going, corporatism/facism.<br>

  I was part of the joint McDonalds-Dupont-American Airlines Strike team that took him out, this is no coincidence.  Using two of our stealthy sikorsky black helicopters, we surreptiously flew up beside his plane and sprayed ice on his wings.  The FAA ruled it an accident.  Hahahaha Fools!<br>

Then yeah, dollars to donuts it probably was an accident.<br>
<br>
Of course, then you could go with the James Fetzer theory where the government use a futuristic electromagnetic pulse weapon that he said could have disabled the plane's computerized components.<br>
<br>
I just thought it was incredibly classy that they used this guys funeral as a &quot;get out the vote&quot;/DNC fund raiser, and featured people 'Booing' the Independent Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura and various Republican leadership.  Incredibly classy!<br>
<br>
The only gullible person is you really and those that think like you that float around conspiracy theories before the NTSB has even finalized it's report on the crash.  No offense but I really doubt you have the psychic hotline.<br>
