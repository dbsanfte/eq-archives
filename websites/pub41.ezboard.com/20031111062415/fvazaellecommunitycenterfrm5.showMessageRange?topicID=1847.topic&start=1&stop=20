Much to my dismay, I am quickly reminded why I quit this game in the first place.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here I am, xp grinding in ME.  My guildmate calls me up and asks me to camp lodizal with him.  I reluctantly agree after he says I could have first loots on the shell, my group (me 56 cleric, 57 mage and 60 chanter) abandon our camp and make our way over to ice clad.  Well we port to Iceclad and find the lodizal spawning place.  Nobody is there except my guild mate.<br>
<br>
We wait for over an hour.  This Lumaddaron shows up.  He mumbles something about making a deal with my guildmate but wouldnt say what it was.  Anyway he just sits there with a rogue friend of his.  I had a bad feeling about him from the start, but I still didnt believe someone this high level would blatantly try to ks another group.  I mean are people really that stupid?<br>
<br>
Anyway, this druid shows up that my friend talked to.  Merlinwolf is his name.  After my friend told him that he could not have first loots for the shield, after all he was just going to sell it, he had ALREADY been given one, he disbands and joins Lumaddaron, saying right to our faces they are going to ks us.<br>
<br>
Well as you probably have guessed already they did manage to ks us.  I simply cannot believe this person is in a guild, Divinus Virtus.  Is everyone a complete jackass in that guild like this guy?  It's increadible that people do this sort of thing and still get groups and guilds, what the hell is wrong with this server anyway?  <br>
<br>
Lumaddaron and Merlinwolf and Pikn (thats the rogue that was with them), I hope you have a miserable new year.  And to the people who are actually friends with these scumbags, I pity you.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noobtar>Noobtar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/1/03 12:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1847.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lumaddaron and Merlinwolf, blatant ksers</span><hr size=1> to clear things up, what was your group that you had in the zone? ive been at lodi and stolen it from someone who was kiting it, meaning they had insuffecient force to kill it, and was given to the other person.<br>

As Guild Leader of Divinus Virtus, I believe I speak for all my guildmates when i say, yes, we sure as hell are!<br>
<br>
I try to make it a daily activity to tell a KEI Beggar to STFU and Die.  We all play by the rules, but leave no room for casual players.  I take pride in my reputation as a jackass.  I commend Lumaddaron on upholding this fine tradition by pissing off a casual player who expected the zone to halt and wait for them to make sure their fly was zipped before they engaged Lodizal.<br>
<br>
I'm an asshole, but a fair asshole.  I will not breach any of VI's policies nor do I support it.<br>
<br>
I hereby make my New Years Resolution to continue my reign as &quot;The Asshole&quot; and stiffle as much KEI Beggars as possible. *clinks glasses* Have a good year everyone!<br>

Any gm will tell u the person who gets first aggro has the mob. Not attack first first aggro i got hit by lodizal first therfore it was my mob. Umm i know i got hit first cuz yer warrior was all the way away from him when he popped. I got first aggro ssed and /reported it. Then i let your warrior get aggro who promplty died. Furthermore i had made a deal with said warrior that if he killed lodi 2x he would never come back or bring a grp back for 2 weeks. He broke that deal so i felt a need to break my usual policy on respecting camps, which goes above and beyond the play nice policy if i am correct. Yes my guild are a bunch of jerks and assholes (especially venthos), or we may seem like that. I am a scumbag /nod im the cause of all of the worlds problems. Im Ugly and i smell bad, and im osama bin ladens brother. Think what u want about me i wont change a bit. Ill still respect camps of decent people, even thought it goes above and beyond what i am required to do. Ill still borrow venthos llama weekly if not nightly, and ill still tell mother fuckers like you to STFU AND DIE. KK thx ~La lum <br>

One of VIs policies is kill stealing is not tolerated is it not?  <br>
<br>
<br>
I believe in something called karma, fuck with someone and it will come back to haunt you.  You obviously believe in &quot;its ok to fuck with someone, as long as I can get away with it&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Should I bring my 10 level 65 friends and ks your little guilds raid which you were hours setting up, now that would be an outrage *snicker*.  Or if you are camping something in PoN or PoV and my group barges in on you and starts killing stuff you had been pulling... you probably consider that an outrage as well.  <br>
<br>
But your little butt buddy killing lodizal for the 10th fucking time to sell his little prized possession on ebay or whatever he does with those items he does not need, &quot;stealing&quot; it from people who had been waiting there for ages because they actually NEED those drops?  Oh who cares about that ...<br>
<br>
But whatever, thanks for admitting being an asshole *snicker*, I can be that myself to people who deserve it.  What comes around goes around.<br>

He was level 50 and you 62, and he wasnt taunting, so he did NOT take the agro away from you.<br>
<br>
Secondly who the fuck are you to tell me what the rules are.  I know this:<br>
<br>
1)  You have been farming lodizal for a long time, you dont need anything from him. <br>
<br>
2)  We had been waiting there for hours for him to spawn.  You dont just barge in on us because you have him timed and kill him and say thats &quot;ok with the rules&quot;.  I dont follow YOUR rules dickhead.<br>
<br>
3)  I dont care what agreement you had with someone in my group.  Thats like me coming to your pickup group and ksing you guys, just because I dont like you.  That holds no logic.<br>
<br>
4)  You even said the agreement was only a &quot;gentlemans&quot; agreement to Morgai, so it is even further no excuse for ksing us.<br>
<br>
5)   The warrior only died because we knew you were going to attempt to ks us (after all it had been said straight to our faces just before he spawned), or we would have slowed it and he would not have died.<br>
<br>
6)  I dont give a rats ass what you claim your usual policy is.<br>

I could go on and on but I just dont feel like it's neccassary.  You have proven my point already.  Have a nice day.<br>

<br>
1)  More than an hour.<br>
<br>
2)  He has been farming lodizal, probably to sell on ebay or sell them at the bazaar although I dont know what he does with those drops.  <br>
<br>
3)  I am sure you would be more than slightly pissed if you had traveled over long distances and camped for a while somewhere only to have someone else barge in and take it.  If you say no to that then you can forget about camping anything ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karothas>Karothas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/1/03 1:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1847.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ,</span><hr size=1> Venthos that was just retarded.

2nd, I believe our warrior engaged it first no matter what that guy says, but that's beside the point.  Next time your guild is camping something, Ill make sure to barge in there and sit on the spawn.  If it hits me first it's mine right.  There is NOTHING called camping from that logic.  Might as well tell everyone that who claims he is camping something, well youd be telling 99% of the server that then I guess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slassh>Slassh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 481<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/1/03 1:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1847.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ,</span><hr size=1> Isnt he a 3hr spawn now? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noobtar>Noobtar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/1/03 1:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1847.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ,</span><hr size=1> welcome to the life of Lodizal... and guess what<br>

You know you'd think having the part about it being overly exaggerated would have prevented this ignorance.  But no, Alyssia-esque thought process took place.  READ: I was merely drawing out the fact that you took so long to mobilize and buff that there was time for another group to port in and mobizlize and buff AND kill lodizal before you even thought about engaging.<br>
<br>
As for camps not existing... well.  I am at a loss of words.  Go check EQ's website and policies.  It's plastered all over the fucking place that there is NO such thing as a camp.  They do not exist.  They are more along the lines of a player-created thing that is based on mutual respect when you are XP'ing.  You can't &quot;claim&quot; Lodizal.<br>
<br>
SORRY GUYS! I KNOW LODIZAL IS SPAWNING AT LEAST ONCE WITHIN A WEEK! HE'S MINE! DONT KS!<br>

Anyways...<br>

Venthos makes a valid comment and u respond duh. I Had mad an agreement and had that agreement not been broke none of you Ne`Vahlar would be there in the first place. So you can take a nice long lingering suck on my cock. I killed Lodi unslowed and with a 47 rogue. A paladin healing himself and stunning half the time to be to busy with doin damage. A 47 roguem, and a 61 druid also chain healing outdamaged like 6 people. so you know what i have no pity for you. ill bet your ench wouldnt have slowed it before it ate your tank. (which it did) lodi would have then ate your cleric and moved on down the hump list thus eating all of you. I however got first aggro i was sitting on his fucking spawn pt the mother fucker hit me and i turned around and engaged. 1 hit then i turned atk off so i cud watch your tank tank my mob for me. As it turns out you were unable to slow it and yer tank died boo hoo. You need to be shot to keep from further spredding your seed. I mean do the world a favor and play russian roulette with a semiautomatic. Yah i kill lodi alot, but everyone who helps me gets a fair chance at rolling, not this &quot;i claim this loot and this loot and this and this and i claim your cock cuz im a faggot and i want to ride it&quot; bullshit. If i win a shield i sell it so i can buy upgrades that is the whole idea of killing a mob to advance yourself either by loot, experience, or faction. By the way either your warrior was sent to die, or your ench was unable to slow it .. which one was it. Either option makes you look like a dumbass. Congratulations on bieng an idiot theres more of you every day. BTW venthos you are the fucking funniest person i have ever met i was almost in tears. <p>Lumaddaron <br>

You obviously dont get it.  Venthos is saying by SOEs rules there is no such thing as a camp.  I said DUH because I obviously knew that.  The hail of idiocy comes from you my friend.  I shouldn't have to explain myself perfectly every time I say something, unless you happen to be retarded.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is you have lod timed and dont respect the fact someone was there before you.  If I hit lower guk to farm I dont barge in on peoples camps because I feel like it, it's rude.  May not be against Sonys rules, but so the fuck what.<br>
<br>
BTW you sound like trailor trash Lum, I pity you.<br>
