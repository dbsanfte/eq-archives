He never had any intentions of handing the guild over to anyone.<br>
<br>
Aweian's problem with the guild was that he wanted things his way just as if it was his guild.  Hate to tell you this it was never his guild it was ours.  We took you into our guild Aweian it wasn't the other way around.  Hate to say this too but you were a little pushy even when you first came in guild but I always tried to give you the benefit of the doubt.  Sorry that I didn't stick to my instincts and talk to the leader and officers then and have you ousted.<br>
<br>
BTW you brought this up at an officers meeting a couple of months ago.  I found out that not one of those officers wanted anything to do with disbanding the guild.  I haven't talked to one person left in the guild or that left the guild recently that does agree that it should have been disbanded.  So now just who are those that agree with you? <p>Sendaenea Elentaari<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Paladin of Fantasy<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=304142">magelo</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Could you please stop talking about me (or any other guildleaders for that matter) like I too was victim of (what you consider) the evil that is Fantasy ? I still respect Fantasy and the members in it and I didn't leave out of bitterness or anything. Stop using me for justifying your view that Fantasy is rotten. I don't agree. (and I still play, as are all the others - only Mijac and you are the ones that have stopped playing)<br>
<br>
Even though at this moment the Fantasy is not the Fantasy I knew, the people in the guild DO believe in it and really WANT to be in it. Fantasy was always a guild that was defined by its people. Not the guildleader or the guildleader's policies. When I left, I left at peace with the guild. I was treated with respect by the majority of the people and it certainly wasn't the people in any way that made me leave.<br>
<br>
Have you ever stopped and think about who you are and what right you have to decide for ALL THOSE PEOPLE that Fantasy isn't working anymore. Really Aweian, when you feel everybody is wrong and you are the only one who is right, doesn't that tell you that your view is just a little bit deluded ?<br>
<br>
I think you're probably pretty hurt by the reactions you got from people. But truly, although I know how much you've given for the guild, you cannot expect people to treat you any other way. <br>
<br>
You once said to a fellow officer on the officer's board something along the lines &quot;If you do not treat the people with respect, you will get no respect back&quot;. To say that YOU know what is best for all those Fantasy members, even though they say otherwise is treating them with disrespect is an understatement. It's arrogant, and displays a huge superiority complex towards all those people in Fantasy who wanted to make it work (and to be honest, I didn't hear of any Fantasy member not wanting to come back after you disbanded it). Those people aren't children Aweian, they are mature people, who CAN think for themselves.<br>
<br>
You say the guild isn't working, but what really was happening is that the guild wasn't working for YOU anymore. That's fine, that can happen (and has happened for many Fantasy people lately, including me). Looking back, when you deguilded for a few days you came back for the wrong reasons - you couldn't accept Fantasy the way it was.<br>
<br>
Anyways, if you really want some respect you may have deserved at one time back from the people of Fantasy, you should step back and take a good look at what you did - the arrogance and misplaced superiority is probably transparant to all, except you. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26345">Merrahar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Well, there's a backhanded compliment for you.<br>
<br>
Bud... I never said I thought you did the right thing. I just said that there had been talk about doing it for a long time. Stupid me, I assumed you would have waited for an actual concensus before doing it. Remember me leaving the game 3 months ago, and not surfing the guild MB for the last 2 months? I'm just a little out of the loop there, and frankly, I'm not sure I want to be in it. My account is cancelled, and Aurianne will never log in again. She is camped on the bridge in Felwithe, right where she first appeared on June 21, 2001. She's dead, and won't be resurrected.<br>
<br>
All I said was that I trusted you to accept the consequences for what you've done. Remember me saying &quot;I want there to be something to come back to&quot; ? It was the last message I wrote on Fantasy's message board, in October. I liked the guild. I liked it a lot. It was a great bunch of people. And in the time I've known you, Awe, I've hated you, I've liked you, and I've been indifferent to you. The *one* thing I've always trusted you on was that you were willing to accept the consequences when you fucked up. Betray that trust, sir, and you will never get it again. I might sound like a complete tard when I say it, but you have nothing if you have no honour.<br>
<br>
You fucked up. Now it's time to face the music, and retain what little face you have left. Or are you going to be the first person in 22 years that I've been wrong about? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mojokynn>Mojokynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1281<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/1/03 9:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1839.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hor.troligt.com/davve/snoopy.gif width=32 height=32></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What do you say when your GL disbands the Guild?</span><hr size=1> devoit is an old lil gnome <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.vazaelle.dk"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hor.troligt.com/davve/pix/sig5.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nkosi@vazaellecommunitycenter>Nkosi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/4/03 9:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1839.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well</span><hr size=1> I haven't played EQ in a few months, been busy with real life stuff.
