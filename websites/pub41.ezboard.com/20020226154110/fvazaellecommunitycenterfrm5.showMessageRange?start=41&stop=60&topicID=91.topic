Toons--I'm a guy.  About half my toons over the years have been females.  Clearly I chose to be a male iksar shadowknight because goddamnit a shadowknight can NOT look intimidating in PINK ARMOR!!!  ARGH!!!  That aside, honestly I couldn't care less who was behind the toon as long as they're a cool person.  Wow, my use of tenses sucks, don't it?  I guess there are some 'female equipment beggars' out there, but in my experience there are just as many male-tooned ones.  When I can I lavish equipment on my friends regardless of what gender their toon is.<br>
<br>
Maijin--(the original subject of this thread) Well, that's lame.  No other way to put it.  The only real reason it sucks, though, is because IV made such an effort with her (and as they do with all their members, I might add) to get her in the best gear to better the guild as a whole.  The way I understand it, though, the ultimate insult was the chronology of the whole thing.  People sell characters all the time for many reasons.  A lot of them can even be justified to some level.  However, from what I've read and heard, Maijin's PlayerAuction was up before she told anyone about it.  That's simply insulting.  A simple &quot;I have to stop playing, I could use some cash, I'll be selling my character sorry guys and thanks for the great times&quot; BEFORE the auction was up would have been the respectful thing to do.  That way friends and relations know what's going on and can deal with it.  What was done was underhanded and rude.  I even know people who defended Maijin when the PlayerAuction was first pointed out saying it was obviously some BSer because (s)he would never do that.  As far as I'm concerned, my reputation is only as good as that of my friends and I will put mine on the line EVERY TIME to defend them.  That is something you don't betray.<br>

I myself Kinda wept for IV but at the same time Laugh my ass off. I mean I guess you can call her a gimp but you were the one who invited her/ him into your guild. Why don't you start trying to get to know your members better or here's a thought maybe your all Gimps...and bring out all the gimpness in everyone? Ah well was worth a shot and may the flames begin.<br>

<br>
Btw Toguruk how come your in In virtue now?.....I thought You sooooo hated them did Krimzin know about this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Seems you were in Occams Razor always talking about IV and how much they sucked and you hated them, I guess these days people will do anything to be &quot;uber&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good Luck In virtue,<br>

I forgot there are only 6 that I clarify as gimps in In virtue. Raif, Maijin(we already know that was true), Krimzin, Befb, Tassador, and Plumpkin. No I do not have a problem with anyone else in In virtue but just the things that you guys do Is one of the main reasons some hate the ideas of In virtue.<br>

Is it pent up agression.  MAybe lack of something in your life.  But i don't see how just about everything you post has a some kind of flame of me in it, makes you a better man.  Well if you feel it does something for you I guess go for it and make a big man out of yourself.  All i have seen is negativity from you bro.  I think its sad that she decided to ebay i liked hre  alot one of the some in IV i got along with.  I am also sorry she took your guilds stuff.  But imo I dont care on the majority.  I just feel sorry for those that i liked in IV.  Try posting something positive bro.  If youlook  on the bright side like welp at least she cant take anymore etc retc you might come out a little happier of this whole ordeal.  Guess you flaming on your board for posting that link to her ebay was completely pointless wassnt it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usllackblader.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sllack Blader</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://24.221.41.117:8080/images/adder65.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/29/01 10:37:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://24.221.41.117:8080/images/vaz/adder65.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> Sorry IV about getting boned like that - that sucks.<br>

Whatever chump BUYS the acct... with this high exposure the buyer will have only a res mule at best.<br>

Buying an acct boggles me - it's like going out with your brother's ex wife or something... just thinking about it I get a dirty feeling. <p>Bllack Ader - It's Dr00ds like me that have ruined this land!</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=91.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=91.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=91.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=91.topic&start=81&stop=92>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=91.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=91.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=91.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=91.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
