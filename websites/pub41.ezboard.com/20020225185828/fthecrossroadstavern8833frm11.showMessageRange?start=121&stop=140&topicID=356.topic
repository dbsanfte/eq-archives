<br>
I agree, I can certainly respect that limit -- except, then you get people making multiple posts in this Dethenesque fashion like he's started doing. *Chuckles*<br>
<br>
On to D-Boy's posts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> (looks at these pics of bryre some of them have something about nekkid pictures others some real nasty stuff with some girls they both know. Looks up at the flamers looks down at his flame o meter it increased a notch. Looks up and smiles saying) Is that the best you can do? Try harder grasshoppers. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't know WHAT kind of pics you've are dreaming you have of her. I live with her and *I* don't have any nekkid pics of her, much less nasty pics of her and others. I understand you're obsessed with her and her being nekkid and all, but it doesn't change the facts. You've got nadda. There isn't even a camera in this household to take pics with.<br>
<br>
This was never a flame Dethen -- this was a bottomfeeders post, it was moved to the Flames by the Moderators since so many others wanted to say a piece to you. I agree with the move, but think you definitely qualify more as a bottomfeeder.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How cute, Dickboy. ha ha ha thats it? I got more creative names for amatures like you. But you know what? Im not even going to say them. Only a immature little kid would make such a huge fuss over a little game. So flame on little children Ill just watch as the proud adult.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Uh, huh. I bet you do *Chuckles* I've got some creative ones for you, it's too bad they'd go to waste since you don't have the intellectual capacity to understand them. <br>
<br>
Again, how is it you seem to completely miss, YOU started all this? and when you got the bad press for it, suddenly wanted it all dropped? Oh, wait! silly me. Lack of intellectual prowess. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Lets go to the dictionary:<br>
<br>
a·dult<br>
n. <br>
One who has attained maturity or legal age. <br>
<br>
You seem to lack both qualifications according to any official definition.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to see you go from whining and crying about how right you are to 'I'm a proud adult'. <br>
<br>
I believe the other poster had it right when they said that only children make the cry of 'I'm an adult.' in an attempt to ratify yourself.<br>
<br>
By the way, what does your True Love think about these nekkid pics you have of Bryre? *Chuckles* Maybe someone needs to alert her to this thread...Hmmm.<br>

You would like me to leave.  I have alot of friends in BDL and you bug the hell out of them.  You know I pegged you just for what you are.  A silly little gimp that felt slighted for not receiving the 'love' from your former guild(s) and then turned into a pathetic, blabbering, little bitch.  And now you have to try to make things hard for them on their boards.  Now they brought you here and put you on a server board.  Your true genius (lack there of, really) shows through so well, that you are now seen as the general laughing stock of the server.  I bet people that read these boards and hang in any zone you shout LFG in, shudder and whisper to each other in group not to allow you in.  You know it's true.  And none of it was thier(my friends) fault, as much as you'd like to beleive.  This whole thing is YOUR doing.<br>
<br>
What's wrong?  Doesn't daddy touch your 'no no' spot enough at home?  Didn't you know not everyone has to love you and that's ok?  You fucked up hard by opening your trap.  It's funny how kids often refer to the people that criticize them as kids.  I bet you're now gonna come back and say something witty like &quot;EAT ASS!&quot; or take some sort of gay kung fu pose before you start typing your reply.  Having to put down your little plastic ninja sword and screaming at your mom for opening the door and interupting your train of thought, as she tells you dinner is ready.  Kolath has been giving you the soundest advice.  For the sake of laughs, PLEASE don't listen to it.

Not according to the logs I've read. Of course, I am sure your 'little bro' is a reliable source of information too *Cough*. <br>
<br>
Funny..how many times and posts I've seen you ask for Cyber, oh wait, that was your little brother, right? I guess that was your little brother, less then a month ago, who was /shouting in GFay about your (his) cyber-woman having cybersex with someone else other then you?<br>
<br>
You use the 'little bro' excuse very well. Makes it easy to avoid your mistakes. *Chuckles*<br>
<br>
I don't know WHERE you are having the delusion this is a flame. This isn't a flame -- this is you perverting facts and sowing dissinformation about someone and something you know nothing about personally, but only have for 'second' hand information.<br>
<br>
They call that Hearsay in a court of law. Ever heard the saying 'believe nothing you hear and only half of what you see.'? *chuckles*<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to say, it's really you that comes across pitiful and immature, after all, look at who all the hostility is aimed at. (That would be you, hoss -- just so you don't miss it) I guess it's another case of 'Dethen the Innocent, evilly maligned by all those on the Satanic worshiping, Baby eating, seal clubbing, virgin sacrificing Zebuxoruk people.'<br>
<br>
I'm sure we all know that out of every single person that posted on this thread you are the only single, sane, mature adult amongst us.<br>

<br>
However, I felt the need since you do not seem to be understanding English....You better learn it quickly if you plan on going to Maine...I come from there....they will eat you alive...<br>
<br>
My main point in my tantrum is that 1) if you are such a minor that cyber or naked anything bothers you so much then you need to stop telling us that you are an adult. Contradicting yourself isn't helping your situation.<br>
<br>
2) Lying to people, especially when I have proof that you did, also does not help people to believe you.  Oh and I have heard the little brother excuse before....some guy named Bud used it a while back when I was playing on a MUD named Aabsolom.  He was caught and banned...You do know that sharing your account is bannable in VI's eyes. Oh and if you had proof, pic, or screenshots of all this supposed nasty stuff Bryre has done you would have posted it by now.  Of course since you admitted that your &quot;brother&quot; is a hacker, we wouldn't believe them if they were posted now or not. <br>
<br>
So, that was the one and only time you will see me lose my temper with Dethen.  He has proven himself to stupid to recognize both intelligent speech, small words, and loud harsh reality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukatiera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katiera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 4:51:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enough of this</span><hr size=1> oh BTW the screenshots of you calling me a crackwhore as well as the screenshots of you denying it later have been forwarded to GMs.  Which is why I will NOT bother posting them here.

And now he gives his little fixation's true name away in there, too.  Sad, sad little man.<br>
<br>
I read his bullshit on www.badgamers.com.  OMG.  He never stops showing us that he is both dumb and dumber.<br>

Hackers who get busted cant rely on lawyers to help them because they dont know jack about computers and you are gonna call a lawyer over a silly little game?  Also I never called you a crackwhore only to a certain girl in your guild plus I only called that girl a crackwhore because I was explaining her bad influence to my girl online.  <br>
<br>
She played the game alot longer then me but never gone up to lv 30 ever so she doesnt know much also she doesnt like to group with people so I have to explain to her what Everquest can do to a persons mind.  Forwarding pics you dont have sigh how Futile. <br>
<br>
Now here is what you do I wont stop this until I get a Post from Miratos that they will agree to leave me alone, leave anyone Im associated with alone and leave whatever guild I am in alone.  Or you can call it truce and end this little kid bawling over a silly little game which possibly took over your lives.  I want this post signed by Corwene or whoever the hell he is and I want to font color of it signed in Red if possible.  If you cant do this then obviously your doing this on purpose just like a little child. <br>
<br>
You say anything to get the Gms or Guides on my back I will just tell them I gave you guys plenty of chances to stop this flaming you little boys and girls started and ill tell them the whole story and they wont touch me.<br>
<br>
BTW only little kids like you would keep flaming me like this and not come to an appropriate Mature agreement.  So if your gonna keep acting like little kids Flame on then.<br>

<br>
A.  Even if it is NOT true, you admitted to sharing your account.  Tres tacky.  Remember...guides are/were players.  Guides have friends.  Friends help friends.  And you would make it that easy.  Capice, Paison?<br>
<br>
B.  It appears that people have been preparing for this, my friend.  Screenshots, logs, etc.  Well written emails with attachments appear to be flying Verant's way.<br>
<br>
C.  It is a known fact that GM's lurk these boards.  You know and I know that you do not play the wronged one well.  Between &quot;two adults&quot; here, your attitude to the Zeb community is obvious.  This is not a matter of you protecting your rep, its a matter of you winning.  This is not going to garnish support from the GM's.<br>
<br>
Remember what I said about that thin line you walk?  It's doubly true now.  To quote Frank Herbert, you are &quot;walking on Occam's Razor.&quot;  It is no longer about you being a punk, it's about slander.  You are soooooooo incredibly close to losing everything in EQ that you have worked for.  <br>
<br>
ALL it takes is for Bryre, or Katiera, to say &quot;I am being sexually harrassed.  Here is my proof.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sound serious?  Your are right.  It is serious.  This isn't a game, little man.  At the very least, you could be banned.  Could more come from it?  Oh, you bet it could.  <br>
<br>
Now would be the BEST POSSIBLE TIME for you to drop the issue.  The Sword of Damocles hovers above your head.  Now would be a very GOOD time for you to pause, think about whether or not your tirade is worth it, and maybe give it a rest.  You pretty much have ignore me here, and on the Miratos board.  I think you know why.  There is no slam to my comments, there is no rebuttal.  The best courses of action to take are often the hardest.  Swallowing your pride can be a bitter pill.  SWALLOW IT.  In the end, you might just save yourself by doing so. <p>Kolath Eversor <BR>

<br>
ahh ok now i feel a lil better man if deathen keeps this stuff up i am going to becopme a full blown addict to this page alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;So flame on little children Ill just watch as the proud adult.&quot;<br>
<br>
you going to watch as the proud adult ???????? since when did you become a proud adult and since when did the law consider vegitables adults i always thought they were considered a non entity being as they cant think feed cloth move walk talk or anything for themselfs.<br>
<br>
&quot;dont make me get smart cuz i can get smart&quot;<br>
<br>
hm i got a couple things to say to this.<br>
<br>
it must be a real challenge for you to get smart  so if you do achieve that state where others will consider you smart i will give you effort points.<br>
<br>
and at least you are admitting that you were being a retard before hand.<br>
<br>
as to you being a teacher now  first well i have pitty on the children you teach(if it isnt the 5 fingers and the long rod you teach all the time) and 2 i thought you were a missle technican in the army bud thats what you told all of the Followers of Nobility. and whats this to the DBL you were in the naval acadamy (since when did they open their doors to the worlds most pittiful people) <br>
<br>
first of all deathen you cant keep youjr story straight ever not even on the same damn forum where you have your old posts to guide you WHAT A MORON. secondly i know from personal experience that you tried to /cyber my RL wife while in the FoN and that i told you if you ever talked to her again i would personally gut you from pecker to throat. as for others hmm isnt it obivous here deathen you have what 500 people condeming you and YOU only YOU are the one defending yourself dont you find that odd........ i would i know if i was being flammed that my friends would come to my aid  but i guess you are that specail person thathas no friends to come to his aid in his time of need  (rather funny dont you think) if you were this awe inspireing great guy that you claim to be you sure would have to have more friends then rosey palm and her 5 sisters and your ever hard pecker thats trying to get a piece from a video game produce picture.<br>
<br>
get a clue deathen you are the only one here in the wrong <br>
you want us to leave you alone then leave us alone  that means ALL OF US. dont post to our respective guild webpages, dont get other people to contact your lil flings (if there are any that would consider themselfs that) to get hem to take you off ignore<br>
leave the server<br>
delete your account<br>
delete your character<br>
<br>
as for your new ingame GF (if she is willing to admit that) i feel sorry for her  your being around her is only dragging her down to the epitomy of uselessness. you dont get it yet let me give you a lil class lesson my ever so wonderful disabled children teacher.<br>
<br>
&quot;DeAtHeN llllllleeeeeeaaaavvvveeee da gggaaaammmeee YoU hAvE nO hOpE oF eeeevvveeeerrrrr getting back what you have destroyed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
and as for the rest of you although i dont know you ingame or had the chance to meet you yet my name is Blackpaw officer of the Followers of Nobility (something that deathen isnt &quot;noble&quot;) i have met bryre (hope i got that right) and i think she is a wounderfull person and a credit to the DBL guild<br>
<br>
/e walks up to deathen who is sitting in the corner<br>
Deathen says&quot; i know you can git stiff its your old buddy here&quot;<br>
/e thinks deathen is a mental case<br>
deathen spits on his hands to use for lube<br>
/e walks away in total discust<br>
From accross the zone you hear deathen shout &quot;OH BABY YEAH BABY OH BABY LET ME SPANK YOU HARDER&quot;<br>
loading please wait.......<br>
<br>
<br>
deathen get a life, get a clue, drop the damn hustler you defile thier pictures and name<br>
<br>
and one more thing GET OFF OUR SERVER<br>

Well I suppose since this seems to be directed towards me I will respond.<br>
/snicker<br>
<br>
What places and what things? Most likely what your &quot;little bro&quot; is refering to is when a friend and I were doing emotes to each other to mess with peoples heads.  I have no clue about the naked thing you keep bringing up. <br>
/ponder<br>
<br>
Cyber sex?  Oh I think not.  There is no way I am going to have cyber sex in a game where GM's can see everything you do.  Don't be stupid.  Oh wait, that trait of you personality has already shined through.<br>
<br>
And even if I did have cyber sex, what business would it be of yours?  This is an adult game.  Someone YOUR age has to have parental permission to play.  Therefore, it is going to have ADULT content.  You claim you are such an adult but seem to have a really big problem with adult subjects. hrmm..<br>
<br>
But then perhaps you are just jealous that the emotes were not directed towards you. <br>

You don't seem to understand that Miratos/BDL wants NOTHING to do with you.  We just wanted you to leave us alone.  We do not want to flame you, talk to you or see you.  You are bringing all the flames from this board on yourself.  You don't seem to understand tha with each reply you post here you are just digging yourself deeper and deeper.  You really should have taken Kol's advice and just went away.<br>
<br>
One more thing.  You are #1 and #2 on the badgamers site now.  Oh and I see you signed up 3 differnt times to rate me.  Nice. Explain that one away.  Oh wait, I know, it was &quot;little bro&quot; again.  /wink wink nudge nudge<br>
