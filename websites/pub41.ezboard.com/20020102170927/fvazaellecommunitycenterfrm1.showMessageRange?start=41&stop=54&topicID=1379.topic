Ahhhh... that lovely time around level 17 when I took my first boat ride to Kunark... and fell off the shuttle to die in the middle of the ocean... /petition<br>
<br>
Now, I am starting all over again after abandoning my main for various reasons, and am finding the whole experience not nearly as fun the second time around... where are all the newbies?  WK used to be crawling with people looking for bandit groups, but now... tumbleweeds... <br>
<br>
Leveling is much more difficult the second time around.<br>
<br>
On a side note... Serynn!  Haven't seen you around, Lizzie... how goes life?<br>

<br>
Joined PO at lvl17 after hunting with Lillya and Galadriiel in HH for too long.  I spent about 6 hours collecting gnoll teeth to get the faction in Halas for the Langseaxe quest.  So we do the quest the first time and the bastard dropped the 2hs, we were like wtf?  Proceeded to do the quest about 6 times to get magic weapons for Kead, Skarzcnik, Trugg(?) and myself.<br>
<br>
Grouping with Illana and Ryoko in SK doing gnolls for 5+ levels.<br>
<br>
Our first MM raid where we collected 5 talons for crafted BPs and began our zerg tactics.  Was in full crafted at 32 except for boots.  <br>
<br>
Going to Permafrost with Cure and Ayon to get myself the frost totem for crafted boots.  Cure heals the goblin and I die, they make it to zone.  Never got crafted boots.<br>
<br>
Doing Kedge with Cass/Cass, Ghol, Zozz and Kead at lvl30, wtf we were we thinking?<br>
<br>
Finally getting j boots at lvl54, I feel proud to have wasted days of my life on that ass camp.<br>
<br>
Winning an FBSS on my first Frenzy camp with a roll of 34.<br>
<br>
Never had a SSoY.<br>
<br>
Lewdo giving me a Mith2H as he was running by, he was about 200 lvls above me at that point.  Super nice guy.<br>
<br>
People I miss:  Skarzcnik, Zhentarim, Slitherin, Lillya, Illana, Lewdo, Zozz<br>

<br>
1. Early groups with Yurias. I was like level 20 and still in mostly patchwork and leather.<br>
2. My first PO raid. MM and Fiido the mutt was running the show. I was in one of the few groups that didn't die. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
3. Helping Khar get his jboots within 15 mins of my presence. Was also the day I joined PO.<br>
4. First Nagafen slaying of the server. I was level 41 at the time, and PO were the first to knock him out.<br>
5. Becoming melee officer for PO when Lewdo stepped down. Felt pretty damn good to be able to help more.<br>
6. Fiido drowning in Kedge. My screenshot is still the best one in existence.<br>
7. Helping Fiido and Krissy get their epics in Kith. I was helping run the show, and they were the first epics we got for the guild.<br>
8. Helping Zhentarim + HB rogues get their epics. I was running the entire show since Kead showed up late, and it was a very smooth raid.<br>
9. Kead telling me to look behind the Dain's throne. I asked him &quot;why?&quot; he told me &quot;just look&quot;. So I did. Dain proceeds to to kick my ass and banish me to the pit. Kead says &quot;heh i didn't think you'd actually do it&quot;.<br>
10. First Treah slaying. Was PO's first significant big mob slaying since Nagafen, and landed us our first necro robe (which we used many many times heh)<br>
11. PO/HB Merger. IMO was a bad decision, and was the main reason I left PO. Feelings were hurt, and friendships were ended because of it, but we all moved on.<br>
12. Early IV raids. Shortly after my departure from PO, I looked to join IV, as they were doing the things I wanted to do, and being the best at it.<br>
13. Ring 10 War for Rhyu. Was our first try at it, and we did surprisingly good up to the last wave. Best quest ever. Was also the day I joined IV.<br>
14. First Yelinak slaying of server. Took the classic 3 tries to down the fucker, but we prevailed.<br>
15. First NToV clearing. We were the youngest server to do it, and it was the most exciting thing I've ever done.<br>
16. Meeting someone new who later on became a RL friend (they know who they are)<br>
17. IV+SF=PA. Worked out for a while, but this came to be the beginning of my lessened playtime.<br>
18. Raiding Hate with Arise in their early days. A lot of old IV'ers and other friends of ours got together and cleared out all of hate just for the helluva it, and we took our first stab at Inny. Woulda be the first Inny slaying of the server, but bad pathing got the better of us. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The pinnacle of my enjoyment in this game came when I joined IV. I met some of the best damn players who ever played the game, and I got to be a part of doing some of the most exciting things in the game.<br>
<br>
My only regret in my entire EQ career was leaving PO the way that I did. Lotsa politics involved that I would rather not relive, but I definitely should've gone another route than the one I chose. Hurt too many people and ended too many friendships, something I didn't want to happen. I've apologized all too many times alredy for it, but it's the past now.<br>
<br>
All in all, I'm happy with how things turned out for me in my year here on Vaz. I don't think I would've enjoyed myself more if I was on another server. Vaz definitely has some of the nicest people I've ever met. <p>- <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25303">Samir</a><br>
