Immigration has become the determinate factor in population growth. The arrival of 1.5 million immigrants each year, coupled with 750,000 births to immigrant women annually, means that immigration policy is adding over two million people to the U.S. population each year, accounting for at least two-thirds of U.S. population growth.<br>
<br>
U.S. companies are expected to send 3.3 million jobs overseas in the next 12 years, primarily to India, according to a study by Forrester Research. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1655<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/03 9:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=168.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where the Good Jobs Are Going</span><hr size=1> Your Time link doesn't work btw.<br>
<br>
Well, there are 2 separate issues here.<br>
<br>
1) Allowing immigration to the United States.<br>
2) Outsourcing jobs to foreign markets.<br>
<br>
I support increasing immigration limits.  Immigration has no detrimental effect on the labor situation.  If you add 100 immigrants, and they all get jobs, they spend money in the economy and their spending generates 100 more jobs.  It's a wash overall, immigration does not cause job shortages, that's a myth.  If an immigrant wants to come to the US and not work, he shouldn't be eligible for welfare or other government programs.  That would be a substantial drain on the economy.  Working immigrants however are no problem.<br>
<br>
Second, outsourcing jobs to foreign countries is a matter of what is economically best for a company.  The effects are complicated.  For the most part, we transfer only the crappiest jobs overseas (factory work, other unskilled labor, etc) and we maintain the highest paying service oriented jobs in our own country.  This has a positive effect on the economy and on the wealth of America.  It involves the financial concept of leverage.  Say I have 100 dollars.  I leverage the money to 1000 dollars and invest that at a 10 percent return and pay 5 percent interest.  I end up with 150 dollars, or a 50% return.  On the other hand, Say I just invested the money without leverage.  I would make 10 dollars, a 10% return.  It's the same idea with corporations.  Americans can make more money and have higher paying jobs because we leverage with unskilled foreign workers.  It adds to our wealth, not the other way around.  Companies are by and large American owned, and this means increased profits to the stockholders as well, which is extra money that flows into our economy.  That generates more jobs and fuels the economy.<br>
<br>
If you happen to be working in a factory that gets moved overseas, you're probably going to suffer as a result.  However, many Americans will gain small benefits from the move, and overall, there is a net benefit to America.<br>
<br>
You are making common economic mistakes.  Some things seem to make sense intuitively, but are not correct.<br>

<br>
Companies should go for their labor where it is cheapest.  That is their duty in a capitalist country.  Anything else is a failure to live up to their obligations to the shareholders.  It increases the profits of the shareholders, so thus increases the amount of money flowing into the American economy.<br>
<br>
Failure to make choices leading to greatest profitability make a company non competitive and represent a failure of the management to discharge its duties in good faith.<br>

Money going to walmart and mcdonalds helps us all out.  (Not to mention that I've spent my share of time at McDonald's and wouldn't have any problem shopping at Walmart.)  Your views of the economy are too narrow and selective.  Money goes to walmart, it helps the stockholders and employees of walmart, they go out and spend the money, it then gets diffused to thousands of businesses, which in turn generates new jobs and helps you.  Also, immigrants pay taxes, and due to economies of scale, that helps you out.  If we add a million people, we don't need a bigger military, yet it's more people to spread the cost over.<br>
<br>

<br>
Again, you don't understand how this works.  Money going into the economy helps *everyone*.  The effects are very broad and cannot be isolated to one group or class of people.  Money going to the wealthy means more investment capital, more entrepreneurialism, and the creation of new businesses and thus new jobs.  It provides liquid capital in our economy and that is critical to finance businesses in the tech industry that employ people like you.<br>
<br>

I think this is better.  It encourages performance and makes people work harder.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think it's more about that extra personal jet or new hummer then about going under for many companies.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
More capital means expansion and greater spending, again feeding the economy.  Buying a new jet or a new hummer means more money to the companies that makes those, thus providing more jobs.  You underestimate how interrelated it all is.  People do things for selfish reasons in capitalism, the beauty of the system is that it takes greed and allows it to profit the society as a whole.<br>

It's peanuts really in comparison to the size of the American economy.  America gives multiples of that in foreign aid every year.  A large portion of that money ends up getting spent on American goods exported to other countries anyways.  Finally, the global economy is extremely interconnected, good economies across the globe are in all of our best interests.<br>
<br>
What's the difference in your mind between your ancestors who were immigrants and those immigrants who come to America today and work their asses off for a fresh start?  How can you deny them the opportunities your family had?  I can understand being angry at people that come over asking for handouts, but those people don't take jobs anyways, so they can't be the ones you're talking about.<br>

Sure poor people may get jobs but likely it wont be very good ones. And if you are poor from the beginning, the people that design the way society works, the people with power, sure as hell aint the poor ones. <br>
So they take whatever chance they can to ensure that the less powerful people stay in their places. Sure, who the fuck admits it, but thats the way it works. I would abuse it.<br>
<br>
(IMO, religion has been an incredibly powerful and smart tool for a loong time doing exactly this, but thats another story.)<br>
<br>
Thus, society may change 'back' into a more class-oriented society after going the other way during the last century.<br>
<br>
The way i see it... I dont think its good, but its not like I think I can change it either. I'm cynical enough to make sure that I and my family uses the system as good as you can. <br>

Now Ammelen, you may say that this was better for the economy as a whole, but what I see is an increase in crime, unemployment, people losing thier homes, and people having to move to a different community to find work. My fathers job moved south of the border and yes he found another line of work, but he was only a few years shy of retireing. And his retirement package was severely cut. NAFTA was signed quite a while back and my poor hometown has still not recovered. And with all the young people leaving to find work it is dying slowly. Thousands of people lost thier jobs, sometimes it was 4000 at a shot. And nothing was brought back into our community to aliviate the situation. So yes I do have a problem with that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~dremarian/wsb/media/68398/site1036.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

Ideally, a stratification will become increasingly evident.  However, the stratification should be based on merit (a combination of talent and work ethic, basically productivity) and not on birth right, race, religion, etc.<br>
<br>
Those jobs moving south of the border are jobs the US should be trying to outsource anyways.  It's better for the country as a whole even if it's locally bad.  We should be trying to increase high paying skilled jobs and decrease mindless factory jobs.  This is the way of the future.  Over time, more and more factory jobs will be replaced not by Mexicans but by machines.  This increases our GNP and the productivity of our country, as well as the average standard of living.<br>
<br>
Don't try to stand in the way of progress, it will just laugh at you and keep on going.<br>

Albiet, most of the immigrants fill low scale jobs from what I can see, but most of the time they can't do shit because they refuse to learn the language.

The is the problem that so many don't, illegal immigrants hanging around getting paid under the table until they can get legalized / naturalized and collect what they never paid into after the fact.  Oh then there are immigrants who come here and have kids that ARE eligible (i.e. born in the US), while there parents may not be directly so...  also getting what they haven't paid into.  There you can fault the employer though.

This is what I keep trying to say.  Adding more people does not negatively affect your chance of getting a job.  They increase demand and thus the number of jobs available as much as they take jobs.<br>
<br>

Well, to get naturalized, you do have to speak English I think.  Before that, you aren't eligible for any government benefits anyways.<br>

<br>
Well, that's because we don't let them in legally.  If we did, we could collect taxes.  You can't get naturalized unless you are working and able to support self and family.  It's rare that they go from working to welfare.<br>

Kids of Americans can get welfare too, even though they haven't paid into it.<br>

I don't support hiring illegals.  I don't support breaking the law.  I think we should have more open immigration, but until we do, we should deport anyone who is illegal.  Management has an obligation to maximize profits, but only within the constraints imposed by the law.  (i.e. They do not have an obligation to pull an Enron.  In fact, they have an obligation to the stockholders not to.)<br>

In all honesty, as much as the jobs going overseas sucks, that is a bit more of a favorable option than this illegal business, which needs heavier monitoring and regulation.  Hell, I think student visas need more regulating so far as that goes.  Just too much questionable shit flies under the radar these days from everywhere, just pooring into the US.  I think the general concern of the others that have posted, and here in my own, isn't that we have a problem with immigrants per say, but its scary when you think about 9/11, and stuff like that where whoever comes in somewhat legit and uses our resources and sticks us in the back with them.
