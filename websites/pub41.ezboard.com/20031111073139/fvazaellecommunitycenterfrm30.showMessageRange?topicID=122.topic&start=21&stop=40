Apparently it does.  Generally speaking if husband or wife is found to be in breach of the marriage contract via adultery usually, then the children go to the other, as well as a large chunk of the marital assets usually.  This highly depends on the state however.<br>

I don't see why being married should get you financial benefits over a couple that is unmarried.  I think it's a form of religious discrimination.  I don't like the government in our personal lives to that extent.  Damn government is too big and bloated as it is.<br>

WTH, 99 times out of 100 if parents are fighting for custody, they are both the biological parents.  Seriously, what are you thinking here?  I'd say it's pretty rare for a step-parent from a second marriage to go into a custody battle with a biological parent, and that's usually only if the &quot;child&quot; wants it.<br>

  Until just recently, it didn't.  In fact married couples paid more taxes than their single counterparts.  Discrimination indeed.<br>
<br>
  As far as your theories on divvying up the marital assets, they already do have a system in place for that, it's called a pre-nuptial agreement.  Unfortunately, since most people in this country aren't rich enough to afford a lawyer for the wedding (The wedding itself is pricey enough).  The basic marriage contract has to suffice.  You find me 150,000 lawyers who will work at cheap rates to do pre-nups and I'm sure this will work, but knowing lawyers.. I'd think you'd have a better chance as a snowball in hell. <br>

Marriage is entirely irrelevant to child custody issues.  The &quot;marriage contract,&quot; as it currently exists, says absolutely nothing about child custody and doesn't affect it in any way.  The only reason you have claim to a child is biology.  Marriage doesn't matter, so if you removed the legal contract aspect of marriage, nothing would change with regard to child custody.  The marriage contract has a lot to say about dividing property in a divorce, it has NOTHING to say now about dividing children, so removal of it altogether would have NO effect on the child custody battles.<br>
<br>
Hell, you could have pre-printed contracts on the internet or available as part of those 29.99 legal packages that would be more customizable and better than the current marriage contract.  You'd only need a lawyer if you wanted something complicated and unique, which would likely only be the case if you had a lot of cash anyways.<br>

<br>
There already is a pre-printed legal marriage contract.  It's called a marriage license, and you don't need internet access to get one.  (Contrary to popular belief, not everyone has internet access).<br>
<br>
Personally I'm happy the government exercises what little control it does over marriage.  Otherwise, alot more people would be married to their 1st cousin, and we'd probably have alot more Goanad's running around. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

As far as the effect of marriage contract on child custody, it varies somewhat between states.  In my opinion, it shouldn't have anything to do with child custody.  I would also like to allow people more freedom to set the terms of their own marriage contract from a legal point of view.  I truly doubt the government will ever get out of the business,  it's just something I'd like to see.<br>

There's good points in this argument....When I first read this I laughed and was for the &quot;Down with marraige&quot; crowd...but when I really think about it...<br>
<br>
If I had things my way, anyone could marry whoever they wanted to.  Personal business is personal business.  Whether its heterosexual, homosexual, multiple partners; hell if 3 people wanted to get married, and they were all happy with it, by all means go for it.  Unless an act is harmful to another being, it shouldn't be condemned.  Our planet is overridden with stereotypes, phobias, and paranoia. Life is short, I think (unless harmful to another person) people should be able to enjoy themselves in whatever way they wish...and if its anything sexual, then that's personal business and should no way be regulated by the government. <br>
<br>
hhmm, so maybe I am for abolishing marraige.  People could still perform ceremonies of a life together, just with no legalities....  As for dividing items when couples split and/or die, that's what wills/contracts are for, and everything these days comes with paperwork anyway.  Any significant purchase usually has a deed or a title right?  <br>
<br>
But on the flipside, there would be way less drama...and it would put people like Backster out of work (Teory is my hero) and that would be sad...<br>

<br>
The reason there are terms implied into the marriage contract such as an equal division of property is that this is seen as the fairest &quot;default&quot; sharing after a relationship.  People now know that's what they're getting into.  If they don't want that, then they need to know what they are giving up and get advice and do a pre-nup.  Prior to the property sharing regime being put in place, one person tended to be left with everything as they were the ones who had the most access to the property and the information about it during the relationship.  You can still arrange a relationship in any financial fashion you want, you just have to make sure the person with less power in the couple (financially, informationally) is agreeing to that with their eyes open.<br>
<br>
Courts enforce contracts at the rest of our expense all the time, though in divorce, it's generally an interpretation of the terms of the dissolution being determined.  This was always ambiguous - &quot;what would the parties have reasonably expected to have happen?&quot; - well the parties expected to live happily ever after and never thought about it, and it turns out that the two parties often had wildly different opinions on what they thought would happen.  So in most cases, the state has put up a default mechanism that in the name of &quot;freedom to do what you want with your property&quot; doctrine you are free to opt out of with the informed consent of the other party to the contract. <br>
<br>
(One side note, on custody:  most divorces, I'd say a huge majority, are no-fault divorces, and the agreement to dissolve the marriage is by living separate and apart for a time period, and custody isn't a matter of breach of contract, but the court's inherent jurisdiction to determine what is in the best interests of the child.  Different states/countries/judges will give varying weight to things such as infidelity so custody is always a bit of a crap shoot.  Even a pre-nup deciding custody ahead of time is unlikely to hold up as the courts aren't likely to see children as property to be contracted for.)<br>

If marriage is simply a legal contract, then why should it be limited to a single man and a single woman?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammerique>Ammerique</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 495<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 9:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=122.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abolish Marriage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> It has to do with DNA<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

My brother and I were both adopted as babies.  We do not share DNA nor biology with our adoptive parents.  What would have happened if they had gotten divorced, Ammelen?  Would we have been returned to the adoption agency with our parents receiving a refund (to be split 50/50 of course)?  Or would our DNA/biological parents been tracked down to have us dropped on their doorstep.  Just curious because your DNA/biology argument holds no weight whatsoever and is incredibly naive and stupid, not to mention offensive to people who don't share DNA with those who raised them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1340<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 9:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=122.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abolish Marriage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> My brother and I were both adopted as babies.

God you people can be fucking dense sometimes.  The fact that your parents were married was irrelevant, that's my whole point.  You're just supporting it.  In your case it wasn't DNA/biology that established your parents claim to custody, but it wasn't their marriage either, which is my point.  If your parents were unmarried and living together, and then separated, or if they were married, and separated, there would be no difference in how the children would be divided.  That's my point, the marriage is not relevant.  Child custody is separate from the marriage contract.<br>

It does, it establishes the claim to custody in nearly all cases.  Adoptive cases are a slight exception to the rule, where the adoption contract takes the place of biology to establish claim to children.<br>

There is a presumption of law that the biological parents have custody.  On divorce, those are the prime two that are considered for having custody (or sharing custody.)  This presumption is rebuttable by showing that neither parent having custody is in the best interests of the child - such as in the odd case where a grandparent steps in or Social Services to argue that neither should have custody.<br>
<br>
With adoption, in most cases, only one person can be the adoptive parent unless the two parents are married - there has been some move in Canada to broaden this to same sex/common law partners of the adoptive parent (called second parent adoption) though I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't the case in the states.  Biological parents can give up custody by putting a child up for adoption and a new person can gain custody by adoption.<br>
<br>
So at the end of the day, the state has decreed that the best interest of the child is supreme, but they are loathe to interfere with the biological &quot;rights&quot; unless someone pushes the issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1347<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/03 12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=122.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abolish Marriage</span><hr size=1> What Backster said...<br>

Biology/DNA is a huge factor, best interest of the child is a huge factor, marriage contract is not a factor.<br>
<br>
I think you know this though and are just being deliberately obtuse.<br>
