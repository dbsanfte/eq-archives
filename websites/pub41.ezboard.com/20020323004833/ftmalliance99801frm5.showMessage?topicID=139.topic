I've been vegan 5-1/2 years (vegetarian a total of 7 years). I do it for the animals and that's the only reason, I'm just lucky that there are health benefits to being vegan at the same time. Cali that was an awesome article.<br>The end of the article it says it's never been easier to be vegetarian, but what it should say is it's never been easier to be vegan. You can find soy milk, soy yogurts, soy ice cream, etc. at regular chain food stores now. So much easier than when I first went vegan, it's so great now. I don't want to sound preachy so I'm not going to get into why you should go vegan. I'll just put a couple links to good vegan resources. I do suggest people go vegetarian first though, vegan would be tough to just jump into without some strong moral convictions.<br>Grolmn if you eat the &quot;meat&quot; alternatives (soy protein, wheat gluten, seitan, etc.) you won't even realize you are eating vegetables. Vegan/vegetarian foods have come a long way. And you ask about the &quot;plant's rights&quot; (I know you are joking but I get that a lot and people are serious), but I did try to stop killing plants also. I went fruitarian for 2 months. All I ate was fruit, fruit bearing vegetables and nuts/seeds, because you don't have to kill the plant to get these foods. It was very unhealthy though, I lost 35lbs in those 2 months and was just generally in bad health.<br>And I have to totally agree with Gil. Before I was veggie my diet was very very limited, I would never try new things and just ate crappy food. Now I try everything (that is vegan) and I've found that I like a lot more different types of food than I realized.<br>Well enough rambling here are the links to a couple of sites if interested. www.veganoutreach.org www.milksucks.com www.vegan.com <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=263100><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufraknar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fraknar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=B9B95F>(1/8/02 10:17:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Off Topic: Food for thought</span><hr size=1> Mmmm ... me omnivore ... <br><br>Seriously, I can understand reasons for someone to decide to be vegetarian, or limit foods from thier diet.

It's not actually just one book it's a trilogy.<br><br>The name of the first book is Ishmael. It isa fiction story about a lowland gorilla that is taken into captivity and he learns to commuicate telepathically with humans. What this gorilla teaches this guy about the worlds history and man's place in it could possibly change how you look at our culture. The second book is The Story of B which elaborates more upon Quinn's ideas. And I'm about to start reading the third book now My Ishmael. The first two books have really changed my life.

That goes for the meat AND the vegetables.<br><br>Just a side note: Have you read the ingredients in some of the products companies have come up with to capture part of the vegetarian market? They have just as many chemicals as other prepackaged food - blech!  I don't have a preference for meat or vegetables. I just want the food I eat to be natural and toxin free. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uarnicadarnit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arnicadarnit</A> at: 1/9/02 11:50:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=263100><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugilnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gilnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=B9B95F>(1/9/02 12:22:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:</span><hr size=1> Aye, I buy as much as I can from the organic section of my local grocery store.

No honey, I don't kill bugs. I try to have a general repect for all life. I eat a lot of fruits still today to try and cut down on the amount of plants I kill. <br><br>The statement about veal crates being bigger than cubicles is just asinine. You can't move in the cubicles you've seen? <br><br>Also do you see coyotes raising their food in small cramped areas and mistreating them their whole lives before they kill them? To compare factory farming to nature is absurd, they are two completely different things. <br><br>Hunting is if you are living in a tribal culture because those people understand that they are part of nature and don't think they control nature like people of our culture do.<br><br>As for animals going extinct, I have no problem with that. It's unnatural for man to keep &quot;producing&quot; more. <br><br>Grolmn, I have repect for omnivores. All but one of my friends all eat dead animals and that's their choice. I haev to be honest and say that I don't like the fact that you are part owner of a beef farm (I'd be a hypocrite if I said that was ok), but that is your choice and you are the one that has to deal with the fact that you are making money off their blood being spilled.<br><br>As for eating organically, that's the way to go. I don't eat any of the meat alternatives because they are so processed/altered. Man is screwing around with things he shouldn't i.e. cloning, genetically altered fruits/vegetables, etc. We try to dominate and conquer nature and that will be our demise.<br><br>Ok, I've ranted long enough, but as you can probably tell this is a very very important subject to me.<br><br>Veghan<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=263100><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uashreq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AshrEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=B9B95F>(1/9/02 2:04:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Very cool topic and a great read.  Thanks for the insight.  I am omnivore and staying such, but I respect each individuals' choice of diet.<br><br>Part of the meal selection limits for people is work.  Work hours are taking up a larger portion of the average Americans' day.  That is promoting the use of fast food chains, predefined meals (mostly from places you know you can get in and out of quick), etc.  So, many dietary issues are forced by society as opposed to choice in diet style (carni, omni, veggie, etc).<br><br>Btw, have I mentioned I hate working 12+ hour shifts and never seeing a sunrise or sunset? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=263100><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugrolmn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grolmn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mighty Ha Ha</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=B9B95F>(1/9/02 2:57:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Sadly for you vegan I have no remorse for spilling their blood.

I would never kill for sport and would always use what I kill.  You could never convince me one way or the other is wrong, there is simply a difference of opinion.
