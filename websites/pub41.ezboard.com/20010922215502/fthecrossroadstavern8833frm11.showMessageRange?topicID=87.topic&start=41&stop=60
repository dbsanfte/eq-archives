  Although I respect KEG, and actually dont care about ToV or the incident, I honestly think you are the worst waste of space ever to sit your fat ass in front of a computer and log onto EQ.  I hate message board arguments and I hate posting on BS issues like this but it saddens me to see someone like you post over and over tons of BS.<br>

I told you that I SAVED you guys by pulling away that wurm, I NEVER said I pulled it.  One of your idiot people went and pulled the wurm while doing CR and it was beating the crap out of your corner.  I did the RIGHT thing and picked up agro as quickly as I could which wasn't hard considering you had only a couple people fighting it, and pulled it over to our camp.  Get your freakin' facts straight before you go and flame someone.  I saved your guild from an even lengthier CR by pulling that wurm away.  I had nothing to do with it getting pulled, but I did my best to save your asses.  You're<br>
freakin welcome.  For that kind of thanks, you can bet I'm not gonna bother doing any favors for AoA. <p><table width="289" border="0">

With a post like this, I just gotta ask:  Why did you feel the need to share with us?  This isn't grade school, we don't have to pretend to care.  Look jackweed, you flamed someone for being a waste of space and logging on EQ, yadda yadda.  You claimed to hate message board arguements and posting, yadda yadda.  Here's a secret:  You just did those things.  Fuqin dillweed.<br>
I'm so tired of weak ass flames like that.  &quot;You are FAT!&quot;.  Well DUH.  I've worked long and hard to get this way.  Shouldn't you be cooking me something right now, you skinny little bitch?  If you don't quit talking back, I'm going to make you my woman.   Again.<br>
The phrase &quot;waste of space&quot;.  Jesus Christ.  Talk about overused.  Its standard in every flame vs a person ever written.  Try something new perhaps?  It won't kill you.  Perhaps something like:  Fraggle's wouldn't let you suck THIER dicks...<br>
or just &quot;I don't like you very much&quot;.  At least they are both non-carbon copy flame material.<br>

<br>
Anyhow, no one ninja'd shit. Please, I'm begging you, prove me wrong. I've been polite, but that doesn't seem to help get my point across. Let's try something new.<br>
<br>
Where the fuck is the name? Where the fuck is the screenshot? Where the fuck is the item missing? Why don't you fucking talk to your guildmates before you open that shit mouth of yours? Gadfly telling you to suck his dick is somehow enough to prove AoA ninja looted? Give me a fucking break.<br>
<br>
Some facts:<br>
<br>
1. Glimmer Drake was killed by AoA, looted by AoA. An AoA officer spoke with a KEG member to get confirmation on the kill, if KEG even THOUGHT the kill was theirs the item would have been offered up for MQ (MULTIQUEST). Nope, KEG didn't think the kill was theirs, couldn't even confirm they killed it. Didn't even want the bracer because they can't confirm the kill, so guess what? Shut the fuck up already.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. NO ONE IN AOA TOUCHED TELK'S CORPSE. Until you can prove to me otherwise, shut the fuck up. How about a name? How about a screenshot? How about some items missing? You've got your panties in a knot over someone possibly bending down and looking at Telk's corpse (no one did). Fuck, get out and get some sunshine if shit like that makes you cream your pants. <br>
<br>
The only thing we did wrong was not communicate directly with those in charge of KEG to annouce our arrival. 70 people in the pit caused a lot of problems, it won't happen again, but everything else? Nah.  I hope that helped Camoman understand the situation a little better.<br>
<br>
Can we make this a 10 page thread? Everyone pitch in. <br>

<br>
Alwayzz none of my comments were inflamatory in the least...I GAVE your guild the benefit of the doubt UNTIL your guildy came to this forum asking me to &quot;suck his cack&quot;.  I've hung out with some of your guildies, I'd go so far as to call some of them friends.  I know nobody in this game that isn't a few cards short of a full deck would say intentionally ninja looting is a good thing.  Apparently you are one of those people.<br>
<br>
But hey, maybe I'm in the wrong here....maybe your dad can beat my dad up, maybe I am 350 pounds of solid beer gut and your not....WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MATTER?  Perhaps AoA has a really good core of some good gamers and good people (I fully believe this to be true of every guild), but you my friend are not one of them.  Your pal that likes to tell the world how big his dick is on a message board is not one of them.  <br>
<br>
Can you even differentiate between the game (it's called Everquest) and your real life?  How the hell can you justify anything you say to people about their real life while defending your actions in this game?  Maybe I should leave you with a real life suggestion Alwayzz, take a break from EQ, find yourself a good shrink, and talk about real life.  Oh, and a peice of advice to the one talking about his &quot;cack&quot;....do us all a favor man and get yourself a woman (or a man since it seems you swing that way), I can gaurentee it will make your gaming experience way less stressfull, and you certainly won't have to come to an everquest message board anymore asking for sexual favors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugadflyrukbum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gadfly Rukbum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(8/13/01 6:08:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> cack</span><hr size=1> What?

So, talk to Dagon in-game and I'm sure misunderstandings will be cleared up, apologies issued where appropriate, and we can all move on and get back to enjoying the game.<br>
<br>
By the way... I don't know if flames are supposed to be funny per se, rather I always thought they were supposed to be... well, flamey. Sorta mean, ya know? Gadfly's posts were all quite funny, especially if you know him, and if one can get past words like &quot;cack&quot; you'll see he's making some really good points as he goes merrily along. He has little patience for those who don't listen to reason, as you've seen.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, you guys can keep going back and forth if you like, but I'm guessing we can put a fork in this one. I still respect and like KEG, and simply refuse to judge an entire guild (or any group of people) by the actions/words of a few.<br>
<br>
Talk to us in game, we're a fun guild and good people.<br>

Wowsers, I thought the Rathe had a flame vault like Eci? Hehe, you've gotta understand, coming from Eci we don't take sheet on forums seriously. If ya want to know what we're talking about go check out the Eci Vault forums. If we see a flame against us or one of our members we're prolly gonna come over and flame it just for the fun factor (until we're told off by our guild leaders <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
Dagon and Tinkham etc... who are a bit more mature (older?? hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) than the average AoAer, are prolly the only ones to take seriously here.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to touch the issues of what happened in ToV as this was dealt with between our officers during the event and, I thought, was a closed issue. So when Bouncur posted this flame what did he expect to happen? Think we're gonna sit back and take it? No, didn't think so.<br>
<br>
This could of been dealt with fully on the day, our officers had already appologised for entering the same area as KEG and lagging everyone out, but no, a KEGer came to the Crossroads and flamed us. Fine, no problem with that, just don't expect us to not flame back.<br>
<br>
And Gadfly, being AoA's own Sergeant Major, is prolly gonna be at the forefront of the flaming. Don't take anything here seriously, we sure as hell don't - this is just a good ol Eci flame that we all know and love.<br>
<br>
As for in-game? Hell, I've never had a problem with KEG in the past, infact peps like Chandelf have always been nice to me. Hehe, we should have a guildwar sometime, would be a damn fun event (even if ya kick our arse) and should help everyone whack their frustrations and anger away.<br>
<br>
If ya don't want to have anything to do with us in the future then so be it, I doubt it'll worry many people in our guild (as we're more geared to having fun with our friends in the guild), but we'ed prefer not to be on bad terms with you either.<br>
<br>
I'll prolly get told off for this post, but hell, they were gonna turn me into leather shoes anyway, may as well go down kicking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
