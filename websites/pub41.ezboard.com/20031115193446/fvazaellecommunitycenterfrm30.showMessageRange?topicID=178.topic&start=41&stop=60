  If you have a solution or even a remotely good suggestion speak up, but spare us the moron level sarcastic commentary.  I personally stand in the middle of this subject, preferring a form of minimal socialized healthcare for the community as a whole, with more in-depth coverage for those that can afford it or wish to designate part of their income to that purpose.  Either add your input on why your side would be preferable, or go back to shutting the fuck up, because I'm starting to get Bled flashbacks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1874<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 11:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those Without Healthcare Obviously Don't Want It</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You are SO right.

If your income is really so low that you cannot afford health insurance, you'd qualify for Medicaid.  Perhaps the Medicaid income requirements are too low, if so we should raise them, not fuck over the rest of the system by lowering everyone else's quality of care.<br>

<br>
The best way to relieve human suffering is to deliver the best quality care.  If we are efficient, we can deliver care to more people for less money.  If we are inefficient, we are wasting money on bureaucracy and government mismanagement.  Efficiency leads to greater coverage and a net reduction in human suffering, not the other way around.  Inefficiency leads to waste and leaves us with less money available to provide health care to those who need it.<br>

That way people would maintain choice of carrier, and there would still be competition and thus efficiency.  People could put in extra money if they chose above the cost of the voucher to purchase premium insurance and get even better coverage.  I'm not really in favor of a national health care system on this scale, but something like this would be cheaper than socialized medicine, provide universal coverage, and provide vastly superior quality of care.  Keep the government out of it.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, such a program would cost about what we pay every year as interest on the national debt.<br>
<br>
If only the liberals in the past had not created programs that we could not afford, and had been more fiscally responsible, we would be able to afford such a program today.  Not to even mention all the pork in our budgets...<br>

You cannot spend what you do not have.  Even if it's for a noble goal, if you spend too much, and consistently run a deficit, it hurts more people in the longterm and it prevents you later on from providing needed programs.  It's an unfortunate fact of life, but we must as a society learn to be fiscally responsible.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh, and budget deficits seem to be a Republican thing, don't they?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Actually, they're pretty much a bipartisan thing.  The republicans create them with tax cuts, the democrats create them with spending, but in the end, it's the fault of both parties.  I am not very happy about Bush's handling of the budget.<br>

I'd like to see the system improved upon and more people covered.  It's not really 40 million that are the problem, many of those choose not to have health insurance (my sister for example, who would rather keep the money than buy insurance, even though she could afford it.  I respect her right to make that decision.)  I'd also like people to have the option of taking the voucher in cash and forgoing medical insurance.  This would ensure anyone *can* have medical insurance, but allow people who do not wish to have that insurance to take their part in cash for whatever purposes they choose.  This option should not be available to children or people not of sound mind.<br>
<br>
The problem right now is we cannot afford such a program.  The approximate cost is somewhere between 250 and 300 billion dollars per year.  We need to pay off our national debt first.  This is what I mean when I say above that it is bad to spend what we do not have.  It just creates problems later, now we cannot afford to provide health care because we already spent that money a long time ago.<br>

You could use a payroll tax to fund it, so companies were paying into some system instead of paying for employees health insurance.  The cost probably would not be that different than what we have now.<br>
<br>
Companies could still offer health insurance policies, and you could sign your vouchers over to the company, then they could set up the insurance, that way if they wanted to offer premium insurance to their employees, they could.<br>

There's your example.  If I get sick I pop tylenol and sinus pills and hope it goes away.  If it doesn't I drink myself into oblivion one weekend and a week later its gone usually.

Post your W4 total earnings vs. rent, and car payment/insurance if applicable.<br>
<br>
I know my first year outta school, I worked for 10.50/hr and could easily afford insurance even after car payment, rent and insurance, but I just opted not to budget it, instead spending the money on beer, video games and friday/saturday night out.<br>
<br>
  Most single people I would wager who don't have health insurance don't have it by choice, or by choice of how they budget their cash.  Now lower income families on the other hand should receive some sort of government assistance for medical care.  (Not sure if medicaid or care of whatever covers that)<br>
<br>
  My actual biggest problem with getting coverage later in life was the fact that since all of my work was contractor/consultant, it was near impossible to find reasonably priced healthcare unless I happened to be working for one of the bigger consulting firms at the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1884<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/22/03 1:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those Without Healthcare Obviously Don't Want It</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>...

<br>
Two problems with that.  First, your healthcare system sucks ass.  For the second, see Ayiar's photo essay on the Canadian military.  If we didn't have to take care of the whole fucking world cause everyone else is too fucking lazy to do so, we wouldn't need to carry a $400 billion military budget.  That's probably more than Canada's entire budget.<br>

Sorry but not buying this at all.  I'm with Ayiar on this one.  You pay for eq.  I bet you have a car.  What kind of car is it?  You could have bought a $3000 budget model through the classified and not had a car payment.  Where do you live?  How much do you pay in rent?  How about entertainment?  How many movies have you gone to this year?  How many times have you gone out to dinner?  Do you have cable television?  The computer you own could have been 1-2 years of health insurance.  None of this stuff is necessity.  (Rent is, but probably not at the level you are paying for it now.)  The point is that I have no problem with people having to give up luxuries in order to purchase health insurance, AND I have no problem with them deciding that because they are in good health, they want to roll the dice and have those luxuries instead of insurance.  I don't want to pay more taxes to subsidize someone's entertainment budget or get them a nicer car.  If you are going to tell me that a single mom can't afford to purchase basic food and shelter for her family if she buys medical insurance, now I have sympathy.  No cable TV?  Oh well, live with it.  I'm not working so you can watch Oprah.  Also, does your wife work?  In some families, both parents have to work to support the family.  That's just how it is.  A single policy is in the neigborhood of $1200 a year for a healthy person, that's not much at all.  There are tax benefits too.  Additionally, if you are low income, there are all kinds of government subsidized plans that cost a lot less.<br>
<br>
My parents were really fucking poor when I was born.  We had basically no money.  My dad was a struggling opera singer and worked as an assistant manager in Stars department stores.  My mother didn't work as my sister and I had just been born.  My parents always found a way to purchase health insurance.  It might have meant my dad mowed lawns for the neighbors.  He drove a 16 year old Datsun with metal plates riveted onto the sides to cover up the rust holes and plastic for windows.  It meant no vacations, no cable TV, no eating out, etc.  It was a matter of priorities, health insurance was the first priority.  You'd be amazed how many people could afford it if they really wanted to.  However, it involves making some sacrifices.<br>
<br>
There are a few people in our society who really can't afford health insurance.  These people are not common.  The reason is that the poorest of the poor in our society qualify for Medicaid, so the very bottom is taken care of.  The top is obviously taken care of because they can afford health care.  The problem is what some refer to as the &quot;working poor,&quot; a group of people that are just above the Medicaid cap but are still really struggling to survive.  One way to deal with this problem is to raise the income caps for Medicaid to include more people in the program.<br>
<br>
I'd prefer to destroy the entire Medicaid program and use a voucher system by which they purchase care in the private sector.  I'd do the same with Medicare.  Fortunately, Bush is actually starting to privatize Medicare.  In the latest bill, seniors will have the option of enrolling in private coverage at no extra cost to them instead of Medicare.  I think that we are going to see an increased privatization of Medicare/Medicaid in the future, which will help a lot with cost control and provide superior care.  Even if we maintain Medicare as an option, the competition will be great for the system's efficiency and quality of care.<br>

We all agree there should be minimum care for anybody.<br>
<br>
But the minimum part of it, should be regulated by the government, there should be a strict regulation by the government. If that is arranged properly, a privatized sector should be more efficient, yes.<br>
<br>
About mandatory insurance. I don't know, I would say everybody should be responsible for themselves, but on the other hand, I think a country's medical system should provide medical assistance where necessary. Therefore, a mandatory insurance is needed (of course, that is just my opinion).<br>
<br>
Inefficiency is a very real danger with socialized health care, I agree with that. But, my first priority is that nobody has to worry about not having enough money to acquire decent medical care (and I'm not talking about just critical situations either).<br>

Not that I doubt you, but what do you base that on ? Do you have any facts to support that ? And what would such an insurance cost ? <p>---------------<br>
