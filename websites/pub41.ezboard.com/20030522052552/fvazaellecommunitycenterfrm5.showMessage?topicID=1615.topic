I don't know if they're one of the sick people that make inflammatory statements just to say &quot;Look at me!  I'm screwed in the head!&quot; or not.  I don't really care -- I can't let something like this go unanswered.  Every time I hear/read this type of &quot;blame the victim&quot; crap I want to vomit.  I hear of the same thing from rapists, wife-beaters, murders who make the sick excuse &quot;they asked for it!&quot;. <br>
<br>
What has happened to personal responsibility in this country and world?  Why is EVERYTHING that is done blamed on someone ELSE?  Please tell me how G.W. Bush or Bill Clinton or anybody else in Washington drug some wild-eyed freak onto a plane, crammed them in the cockpit, and forced them to fly into a building?  The people flying the planes in the name of Aalla did this.  Not us.  The people who told them Aalla would love them for murdering innocent people half a world a way did this.  Not us.  If America were the Great Satan that they paint us to be that region of the would would be a radioactive sheet of glass right now because of what they did.  It isn't -- instead, the zealots are out of power and an *Afhani* government is in place.  Puppets of the US?  They don't really need to be, do they?  <br>
<br>
We were attacked because HATE brings POWER.  Hitler and the Nazis used hatred of the Jews, of negros (put whatever damned politically correct term you want here - I'm not a racist and I'm going to use a dictionary term here), of homosexuals, and basically of anybody that was different from his Aryan ideal to brainwash the German people into a frenzied killing machine.  A frenzied &quot;Zeig, Heil!&quot; goose-stepping mindless, unquestioning machine of death was formed out of hatred.  Al Queda is no different -- just a variation on a theme.  <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282269">Beltalek Stormborne</a><BR>Sorcerer of Unyielding Power, Vazaelle

If you honestly believe that what happened 9/11 was because they're evil and out to destroy the world I suggest you drag your inbred ass outside the US and see the world we live in. <p><center><a href="http://www.vazaelle.dk"><img src="http://hor.troligt.com/davve/signature.jpg" width="504" height="74" border="0"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubeltalek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beltalek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 11:02:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1615.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~jr.moore/Public/wizard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blame the victim?</span><hr size=1> Here's some text from a conservative "talk radio" host that I stumbled on that addresses the "blame the government" attitude.  Not necessarily my opinion, but I do find some of the points interesting so I'll copy it here.<br>
<br>
Most Americans make the mistake of assuming that freedom’s enemies will always strike from outside our borders.  Certainly in the last year we have learned that we don’t have to travel to the mountains of Afghanistan to find those who would take our freedoms.  We can find them right here at home serving as elected officials.  They’re on our streets driving minivans to soccer practice.  They’re in our newspapers, magazines and on our televisions. <br>
<br>
Some of these people fear liberty because of the perceived chaos that accompanies freedom of thought and action.  Others eagerly trade their freedoms away for the illusion of security.  And others, especially those in elective office, fight any freedoms that interfere with their eternal quest for more and more political power.<br>
<br>
Just how long did it take --- how many hours, days or weeks passed --- before some politicians started hatching schemes to take political advantage of the attacks by the Islamic Jihadists?  Did the politicians devise their plans to use these attacks as a way to increase their power before or after private citizens came up with schemes to use them to enhance their personal wealth?  Did Tom Daschle lust over the possibility of 50,000 new federal employees before or after that man from middle Georgia filed a phony life insurance claim for the loss of a wife he said was at Ground Zero when death arrived?<br>
<br>
And just how long did it take after these cowardly attacks for so many of our fellow citizens to start thinking about how much they were willing to give up to be assured that this would never happen again?<br>
<br>
Just why did these Muslims attack us, and can it be said today that their attack failed or succeeded?<br>
<br>
For starters, you can forget blaming our involvement in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The so-called Palestinians have never been much more than useful fools for the Islamic Jihad movement anyway; pathetic tokens to be used to further the dominance of Islam over first the Middle East, then the world.<br>
<br>
No --- they didn’t attack America because of our support for Israel, just as they don’t love us because we have committed U.S. troops to battle three times in the past 12 years; in Kuwait, Somalia and Kosovo, to protect Muslims.  They attacked America because America is the prime and glaring example of the very human values that spell certain doom to their dream of Islamic world domination.  America was targeted because we’re free and because we repeatedly show that we can change our own leadership without violence, without bloodshed and turmoil.  Leadership changes make the mullahs nervous.  America was targeted because we are a nation that demonstrates, day after day, how many different religions; Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism; can live and prosper together. We were targeted because we have shown the world that a rule of law, not the mindless and cruel dictates of a religious cult, can protect the peace and ensure the harmony of people of all faiths living together in liberty.  We were targeted, and we remain a target, because we’ve been on a roll for over 400 years and still haven’t reached our peak --- while Islam reached its cultural dominance 500 years ago and it’s been pretty much been rocketing down a mud slide to hell since then.<br>
<br>
Now, one year later, just what have the Islamic Jihadists we call terrorists accomplished?  Well, they destroyed two of America’s landmarks, and damaged a third.  They killed over 2,800 people.  They brought death and destruction on their own people and their violent religious cult --- for them, a small price that they pay willingly.  But, beyond that, is it possible the Muslim murderers accomplished more than they dared hope?  Is it possible that they’ve struck an even more serious blow to freedom and liberty than they had imagined?<br>
<br>
Maybe the answer could be found in a poll taken about two weeks ago.  It was this year’s installment of an annual poll on the public’s attitudes toward our Bill of Rights.  The majority of people who responded to this poll said, in essence, that we have too many freedoms in America, and they are perfectly willing to trade some of these freedoms for protection against further attacks from the Islamic Jihadists.  Over one-half of the people who participated in this poll said that the rights protected in the first ten amendments to our Constitution were too broad, and they needed to be scaled back --- all in the name of security. <br>
<br>
The least popular freedom?  Freedom of the press.  That very portion of our First Amendment that protects our right to a free flow of information about an entity that can legally use deadly force to accomplish its goals – our government – and this is the least popular portion of our Bill of Rights? <br>
<br>
Every tyrant needs complete control over the means of communication.  China controls access to the Internet, as do many other totalitarian countries.  You can be jailed in many Islamic theocracies for simply owning a satellite dish. When leftist revolutions occur, the sources of communication and information are the first things to be seized.  In America – post 9/11 – we have a majority of citizens who, on the one hand, will profess their love of freedom; but who, on the other hand, will tell you that there is just too much freedom of the press, and the government needs to do something about it.<br>
<br>
Could the Islamic Jihadists have known that Americans would react this way to their murderous attack?  You know, it doesn’t really matter.  Planned result or not, the terrorists have much to celebrate.  Their hatred of our freedoms caused them to attack, and our love of freedom has become a casualty.<br>
<br>
Now, here we are, one year later.  It’s September 11, 2002.  The offices that were destroyed in the Pentagon are being refurnished and reoccupied.  The location of the crash of United Flight 93 in Pennsylvania is hallowed ground, and the site of the World Trade Towers has been turned from a clean-up project to a construction project.  Physical damage is easily repaired.   Not so, the damage to our national mindset.<br>
<br>
The National Archives of the United States have an interesting little project going on.  You can go to the National archives website and virtually sign the Declaration of Independence.  You type your name, select a colonial era writing style, and then print out a full color copy of the Declaration with your signature right down there with those of our founding fathers.  Before you sign, though, you are asked to remember what happened to many of those who actually did sign in 1776.  These men pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to the cause of freedom.  Their signatures made them traitors in the eyes of the King.  Rewards were posted for their capture – and the British armada was waiting offshore.  Sign, and risk losing everything?  Or not sign and live securely, though not free, under British rule?<br>
<br>
Would the American people choose the path of liberty today?  Would the same people who think that our Bill of Rights goes too far be willing to pledge their lives, their fortune and their honor to fight for freedom above security?  Many of the men who signed the Declaration died because of that signature.  Others lost their property, their liberty and their families.  Do men like that walk among us today?  Are we, as Americans, worthy of their sacrifice?<br>
<br>
Today our government is seizing American citizens and locking them away without any due process.  There is precedence for this.  The British did much the same thing after our Declaration was signed.  Then we fought the injustice.  Today we make excuses for it.<br>
<br>
Maybe we can spend this first anniversary of September 11th honoring those who died and those who protected us.  Maybe, just maybe, after today we can try to rededicate ourselves to the same principals that brought us the men and women who put their lives on the line in 1776.  America is great because we are free.  America is great because those who came before us valued freedom above security.  America was attacked because our freedom is a threat to tyrants, religious and otherwise.  Are you one of those who profess your willingness, even eagerness, to trade away some of that freedom?  Is it security you now seek?  Perhaps you should consider those in our society who are truly secure.  They live in solitary confinement in some of our prisons.  We call them “maximum security prisons” for a reason.<br>
<br>
What is our choice going to be?  Will we chose a secure life overseen by your friendly local government warden, or will we chose the brilliance and uncertainty of freedom?<br>
<br>
It’s September 11th, 2002.  It’s time to decide.<br>

[quote]Bush uses the same hatred for the "faceless" terrorists to take over iraq and set up a longstanding oil agreement (motive).[/quote]<br>
<br>
Good point, and a scary one too.  It bothers me a great deal that the Bush administration is using current world opinion of the middleeast to move in on Iraq.  I'm sure oil money has a LOT to do with it.  I fear that Iraq really =IS= working on weapons of mass destruction and needs to be stopped but you can bet that ole Dubya is working on an angle to profit from the situation too.  I don't doubt it in the least.<br>
<br>
I'll be the first to admit I don't have a clue who's on first here.  Hussein was the Ultravillan under George Senior, ignored during Peckerboy's administration, and is now Ultravillan again.  Is Daddy Bush calling the shots again?  What was Clinton's angle on IGNORING Iraq?  This is one big political shitball from the Left and the Right and I couldn't agree with you more.  It has nothing to do with my previous post, and I don't give a rats ass how many threads there are -- I'll open ten more if the mood strikes me.  If they all oppose YOUR views then load your diaper all you want, but keeping making good points like the one above.  8) <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282269">Beltalek Stormborne</a><BR>Sorcerer of Unyielding Power, Vazaelle

"Im not of arabian descent but I know many and I've traveled around the middle east and when you portray them like this its not far off from what the germans thought of jews which made me latch out."<br>
<br>
Not all germans hate jews, not all germans during WWII hated jews.  I don't agree with demonizing an entire population of people (i.e. "the germans", "the arabs").    <br>
<br>
The war on "terrorism" is as ridiculous as the war on "drugs".  They are both constructs that can be twisted to include practically ANYONE as a target.  Lives and finances of several countries have been significantly depleted for what-- we still don't know that osama is dead, even after nearly a year of this 'war'.  So we're moving on! <br>
<br>
At the moment (at least in the US) we are being saturated with propaganda.  And it looks like we'll be starting a fight with Iraq again, the newly-expanded definition of "terrorist".  People will blindly wave their flags, while accepting the reasons given in the media.  As to the statement that, "saddam has and will continue to support terrorism"- where is the evidence for that?<br>
<br>
I'm not in favor of playing hide-and-go-seek with American lives over oil.  9/11 underscored the value of human life, and in fact you can't put a dollar sign on that. <p>==================

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What has happened to personal responsibility in this country and world? Why is EVERYTHING that is done blamed on someone ELSE?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not so much about direct personal responsibility for an act of terror. It's about the responsibility we have, as Americans, to choose our leaders well. It's abotu choosing leaders who will take responsibility for the actions they take on our behalf. <br>
The problem, as I see it, is that Bush likes to dodge responsibility. Many like to say that he's willing to take the tough stand on things, but I don't think so. Honestly, I don't think he really has the intelligence to think about what he's doing. The reason I say this, is because how I've watched him duck the responsibility for ever major decision he's made in the last year. Every, and I mean EVERY time public support for one of his decisions has started to wane, he shifts the focus to something else. It's Osama, then it's Enron then it's Iraq, etc. He's got our collective fingers buried in so many pies it seems the only way this can end is with raspberry jam all over our face. <br>
<br>
I say, if you want to put the blame somewhere, put it on the voting (or nonvoting) public. We can't continue to do this. We can't continue to watch the leadership of our country be handed to pampered impetuous fools. In that way, we are ALL responsible.  <p><center>

Interesting, considering that, how the government is now trying to merge the two constructs into one?<br>
<br>
[quote]much of the world is following us down the democracy capatilism road, that is whats bothering these folks, and thats why they are pised at us, people want freedom, period.[/quote]<br>
<br>
True, but a lot of the world also tried the Communism road and, believe it or not, many of them not even at Soviet gunpoint.  Sure, the vast majority of the attempts didn't work, but democracy and capitalism isn't necessarily the only way to go and isn't necessarily right for all people in all places.  There's probably going to be a better and more equitable and humanist system than the democratic/capitalist model in the future, anyhow.  And also remember how many different flavors of democratic capitalism there are out there based upon the way the Will of the People is done, how pieces of previous governments held over, the level of free market economics, socialized aspects of government.  In basic terms it is all about freedom, but what exactly "freedom" is can be defined very differently from varying cultural viewpoints.  Not everyone wants American or Western-style freedom.  Cultures have to find their own way and choose what aspects of foreign culture they want to adopt.  The American system wasn't made in a vacuum nor did its innovation come from a single source.  Some aspects of Western culture may be worth borrowing, others probably aren't.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
As for "blaming the victim."  Yeah, it's worthless and heartless to blame the victim.  However, it's also stupid and myopic to not try and understand what factors and behaviors made the victim a target and try to modify behavior and/or perception to mitigate future risk or, at the very least, have an awareness or such things.<br>
<br>
There are reasons the US was chosen for attack.  Most of these are our fault.  We choose to behave in certain ways which, if we didn't know before we should bloody well know now, piss certain groups off.  The question is why do these behaviors piss those groups off.  Do those groups, within their cultural framework, have legitimate reason to be pissed off?  If the answer is "yes," then are there way we can modify our behavior to make ourselves less of a target without fundamentally altering our way of life? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukerai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Necrobish</span><br>  Posts: 2907<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/13/02 1:04:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1615.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sowned.com/bleh/kerai2.gif height=85 width=66></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: blame the victim</span><hr size=1> As for the topic of the thread.<br>
