My rant is on people getting their epic and leaving the server.  It has happened to me personally and i'm certainly not ranting on this because someone in my guild did it, however in the past especially in slivers it happened quite a few times and i'm sure it has happened in other guilds too.  <br>
<br>
Why do people insist that they MUST have their epic and then once they get it, leave without a trace or say, &quot;i'm bored I think i'll go play on the new server.&quot;  As much as my guild has gotten me or if I ever get my epic and wanted to leave in the future, I would surely at least say good bye and explain my reason for leaving.  &quot;Hey guys getting tired of Everquest and I have some real life responsibilties I have to take care of, thanks for everything!&quot;  However, usually people leave without a response forgetting or ignoring all the hard work someone in real life has put towards their character.   <br>
<br>
Also, do people look at their epic like a last piece they need to complete their Everquest journey?  In Slivers we had a running joke that we didn't want people we like to get their epic because they will leave.  The more I play on this server the more true it seems in some cases.  Most of us who play alot know however that getting an epic is relatively small compared to what other mobs their are to conquer in Everquest.  I mean, come on, how can you compare the General in Kith to Lord Yelinak or something?  I guess what i'm saying is, if you get your epic and think man, I've reached the top game of EQ I can leave now.  Think about it again, and also make sure to thank those who have put their valuable time into making your playing experience more enjoyable. <br>

<br>
Honestly, you have a point.  I've been doing some of the little stuff for my epic, in the hopes that maybe someday enough people will owe me favors that I'll be able to complete it.  When (and if) I finally do, there's no way I'd immediatly jump ship to restart - the work that goes into these things means far too much to me to abandon it.  Not that anyone would really care if I did - the druid epic isn't the most useful, the only people who would probably notice would be druids who didn't already have it.  Taking something like a cleric epic, which arguably benifits an entire guild, as an example, makes your point crystal clear.  When you're looking at one of these weapons that takes an enormous team effort to attain, do yourself, your friends, and your guild a favor - if you're going to dissapear after getting it, dissapear now and save everyone involved some time and trouble.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I had additional thoughts, but the cursed IT department finally fixed our damned stupid database program, so I have work to catch up on.

I guess some people see this as a game to be 'beaten' and that getting 60 and an epic is how you do that.  Honestly getting 60 and decent gear is like a prerequiste to playing the game, at least as I see it^^  If you dont have fun with the raiding level of the game, that is prefectly fine, but dont pretend that you do long enough to join a guild and get your epic, and then quit, thats just lame.  Im sure weve all seen tons of people say they will do more guild stuff when they get x y z and then dissappear once they do, it really irks me, but I guess thats just part of the process finding out who you can count on and who you cant, shrug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umiriandartheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miriandar the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/01 9:47:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Time Invested</span><hr size=1> I'd say far worse than getting something you really wanted (not necessarily just epic weapons) and simply disappearing is getting the item you want and then leaving the guild for another guild when it suits you.

Don't get wrong, there are a lot of exciting moments below 50, but going on a large guild raid to take down something that 18 or less people have no chance with is a thrill.  <br>
<br>
The feeling of knowing that everyone there has to listen, play smart, and do their job or all will fail is pretty nerve wracking.  I know I get all nervous and exciting and my hands start shaking whenever I take on a big meanie for the first time.  <br>
<br>
Then there is a the rush and glow of pure happiness when you take down big ol' meanie for the first time.  Knowing that the team got together, sucked it up and KO'd BossMob_01.  It feels even better knowing that your family gathered together, sacrificed their time and energy to help ONE person get ONE thing.  It brings a smile to my face knowing I helped a friend get something that makes them happy and makes them more effective.  <br>
<br>
Anyway...  all these items--they are almost required to do high end events.  I can't even imagine going on a big raid without having a cleric epic along.  Wipe outs are pretty much expected and the CR w/out a rez stik would be brutal.  Holding aggro on Uber Mobs is rough--but having those lightsabers make things a lot easier as well...  Llike Procrax said, getting your Epic Item is not the end of the game, it is only the beginning!  <br>

Have fun &amp; G'adventuring to you all!<br>

That pisses me off how people are willing to accept so many items and so much of peoples time only to shrug it off and walk away after they get bored like it is no big deal. And in many cases w/o even giving back any of the items that the guild could use again. <br>
<br>
&lt;rant&gt;<br>
If you're going to take and accept items from your guild, and I don't just mean epics here, then make sure you plan on playing your character or at least have the dencency  to return them if you quit. Or better yet, don't accept them /gasp. How can you sit back and grab the best gear out there knowing you're quitting anyway? It blows my mind that people are so selfish.<br>

They've helped, they've put their time in, maybe it's time they got their epic as a reward.  Kind of working it off before you get it, rather than getting it and working it off.<br>
<br>
But yeah it sucks, we've actually had that same joke in IV for a while, having countless &quot;wasted&quot; epics.  There's prolly a lot more drops though that were more wasted than epics, since 90% of epics are self work.  Things that take 3+ hours for 40 people, for a drop that goes to someone who quits.  Right there is 120 man hours, longer than any epic really takes, for needing guild type help I mean.<br>
<br>
It's all about who really owes the time...  Are you always working to pay off your gear in help of those who helped you?  Or are you helping others so they'll help you later on?<br>
<br>
Epics are just used cause it's a real time sink, I guess.  I donno my I'm biased cause mine took like 3 hours.  I guess if I were a mage or warrior I'd see it differently.  I'm not saying I'm not completely greatful to those who helped me, I just see other items being worth more than it.<br>
<br>
Only a few of the epics really directly help others though.  You could argue the resists on it save cleric mana which helps everyone in the long run, but that's a bit of a stretch.  I donno I'm just tired and rambling, although this is the right forum for that.  =) <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>
