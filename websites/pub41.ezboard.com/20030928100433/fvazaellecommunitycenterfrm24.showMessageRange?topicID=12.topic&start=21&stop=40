<br>
1.  We zone into Fear with so many people we crash the zone.  Oops.  Yah, that's how many we had, call it zergling, doesn't bother me, we were having a good time.  Lot of people there on their first plane raid ever, including about a dozen non-guilded peeps.<br>
2.  We begin clearing the plane.  We're pulling large chunks of the zone at a time and aoe'ing them all.  Was a LOT of fun, everyone laughing, yada yadda...<br>
3.  The server crashes (crash 1)<br>
4.  I personaly go into IV's chat room.  I knew that with the server crash, CT would be up.  I knew that IV would want to kill CT.  I also am pretty sure that no other guild with the possible exception of CC can solo kill CT.  So, to keep from bumping heads I say &quot;Hey guys, just to let you know, we're in Fear, we have no intention of kiling CT solo or jointly, and we'll be happy to tell you when we're done if you want to come in and kill him&quot;.<br>
5.  I pop back into PO's chat channel.  Several members of IV, including befb, zaral and zhraath begin messaging me asking how long it would take us, were we clearing the whole plane, etc...<br>
6.  I tell zaral and zhraath that I wasn't sure how long, that we can't clear it as fast as them, prolly 3-4 hours, but that we would let them know when we were done, and we'd tell them first.  I had no problem with them forming up and being ready to jump when we finished.<br>
7. Zhraath approaches me with an offer: they help us clear fear so it's done faster, we get all the loot.<br>
<br>
Let me interject that this is a more than fair offer.  However, it assumes that ALL we cared about was getting the loot.  Bear in mind that there were people there for the first time who were enjoying themselves, and wanted that sense of accomplishment.  There were also PO applicants whom we wanted to see in a raid type environment.  We also had so many in zone that we already had a small lag/link death problem.  So far all of those reasons, we said thanks, but we'd like to do it ourselves.  Bottom line, doesn't matter why we said no, we said no.<br>
<br>
8.  Still in chat, rhyuu says better accept our offer 'cause if you don't we're gonna plow it anyway.<br>
9.  Server comes back up.<br>
10. 2 minutes later, server crashes again.  Back to chat.<br>
11. IV members flood our chat channel... wasn't pw protected because of the number of guests we had on the raid.  Next time it will be.  They spend the next 20 minutes justifying why they have to come into Fear while we're still there.<br>
12.  Server comes back up and we log back in, still in Fear.<br>
13.  IV enters the zone.  Jaydrox is summoned.  Jaydrox says he can't stop them from coming in and that they are clear to pull mobs.<br>
14.  PO leaves rather than try to deal w/2 guilds pulling mobs in fear.<br>
<br>
Yes, IV offered loot to any of our members that stayed.  I believe 4 or 5 took them up on it, prolly some of the guests as well.  Myztika got her epic piece from it.  All of that loot, of course, we would have gotten anyway and had the fun of doing it ourselves.<br>
15.  IV kills CT, loot is 2 cloaks.<br>
16.  Server crashes again.  As I understand it, the cloaks we either not looted or were looted and lost when server reverted to save.  That, however, is hearsay... the rest is not.<br>
<br>
That's PO's version of the events.<br>

By taging along with them I was able to strenthen PO by seeing how another (capable) guild handled fear, and more importantly for our future, CT.  If you are objecting to me staying and 'helping' them...well...If I was helping them do something they could not do on their own I would understand that logic but then this whole thread would never have started in the first place.

<br>
Here is my take on it *not that it matters*.<br>
<br>
1. Vaz is truelly a FFA server now. Hence calander is no longer needed. Its 1st come 1st serve. Posting your raid will just set you up to be jumped by someone else.<br>
<br>
2. Planes are not considered sacred any longer and all spawns inside are FFA. So If you want that boss mob across the zone, you better get to it b4 someone else does.<br>
<br>
3. Named encounters are as always FFA, no news there.<br>
<br>
4. Its survival of the fittest.<br>
<br>
Not defending any guild or slamming any guild here, but it has come down to #4 in all honesty. If you want a span you better be there to engage it 1st, and if you can not handle it... rest assured that other guild watching is going to take it for you.<br>
<br>
Some people wanted a FFA server and some wanted a schedule, well now you have a true FFA server. Hell why should IV offer a guild 1st attempt on a kill? If you want to learn, have fun, raid the big encounters.... come ready to go balls out or go grind for exp.<br>
<br>
This is what Vaz has become and it is no one guilds fault, so why blame IV? Yes the sad truth is the strongest survive, so if a guild wants something they better go for it, rather than working pact's/arrangements.<br>

<br>
I do not see how any PO people staying w/IV has anything to do with integrity.<br>
<br>
IV was going to do CT regardless of any PO ppl being there. They surely did not NEED them, and offered the tag along as compensation in some ways.<br>
<br>
I see no need to slam someone for sticking around to learn/play/gear-up/etc since it had no impact on the encounter in all honesty. Some ppl like to play the game for the sake of playing it.<br>

Hell Brogaard is one of the nicer ppl you will meet in game, and has integrity in spades. So you are way off base on this one. <p>Milken </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubrogaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brogaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/1/01 9:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear incident new topic </span><hr size=1> The only one who has the right to question my integrity Herder are my friends.

FYI as I could see how a guild in OUR (not YOUR) position would not want it's members taging w/IV after that incident, I ran it by Kead before doing so.  At first he was not fond of it but, realizing as I do that this was making the best of a bad situation he said it was fine.<br>
<br>
Nuff said.<br>

<br>
Brog asked if it was ok for him to stay and I told him to do what he wanted and that we didn't care.  It's his choice, plain and simple.  He had every right to any/all loot that dropped imo.  <br>
<br>
and yes, Brog is one of the nicest people you'll meet in game.<br>

<br>
However, I think Herder had a valid point.  I could see how some people would think it silly that PO people stayed and accepted loot from IV.  Then again I can see how some people refused to let IV take Fear away from them.  Along the lines of the &quot;can't beat em, join em&quot; way of thinking.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I think it just shows how PO allows individuals to make their own in-game choices and doesn't force members to accept orders, or be lemmings.  A rare thing in other guilds it appears from reading the boards<br>
<br>
Brogaard....why don't you share with us what PHAT LEWTS you obtained by staying in Fear with IV?  (Loaded question, I already know the answer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

<br>
I can see both guild's points, as I have been on both the giving and recieving end of this situation. Sure I may be angry about it if I were PO, but I'm sure they realise this is an FFA server and this will continue to happen; we've made our bed and it's time to sleep in it. Maybe if I were in IV I'd feel a little shitty about hurting PO's feelings, but thats the way the Vazaelle cookie crumbles. You can either live with yourselves or not.<br>
<br>
I personally don't see the problem with two guilds in a plane, especially if they are going for two seperate objectives. This happens in many other zones and I don't consider the planes any different. There were 3 guilds and 100 people in Temple of Veeshan the other night for God's sake...We were all in different wings, but is it one guild's right to say, &quot;hey, we're rading ToV, don't come in because of lag issues, and you may deprive us of some drops on the way to where you are going&quot;. And God don't compare spawn times to me, it's just an analogy, and the best one I could think of that I have experienced recently. <br>
<br>
And for all you people flaming IV for not posting a response, I'll clue you in on something. They probobly aren't replying because they don't care anymore. They have to deal with so much of this crap that it's staggering. If you had these problems week after week would you pay attention to all of them? I know I wouldn't. It's not cowardice, it's indifference. People slander IV simply because right now they are at the top...the same reason a little brother will annoy a big brother :P <br>
<br>
IV if memory serves me right, were not avid advocates of FFA on this server, but are damn well making sure they can compete since thats the way things are going, I suggest everyone else does the same.<br>
<br>
If you're busy getting even, you're not getting ahead. <br>

Why so? Becuase for the first time, that I know of, a guild has PnPed the planes on Vazaelle. It's all gong to hell from here.<br>
<br>
guildmember_01 says, &quot;Oh, server just came up and Trees are up in PoG.&quot;<br>
guildmember_02 says, &quot;But a_gimp_guild_07 is there already, oh well I guess we exp.&quot;<br>
guildleader_01 says, &quot;No, remember when a_gim_guild_07 did xxxxx to us? We'll just go in and if the bitch, we can PnP. After all, any unengaged mob is fair game. Even if they did spend 2 hours pulling every sylval protector in the zone, we can still pull Treah.&quot;<br>

Yeah, bad shit is coming soon to a plane/uber zone near you/ <p>Alyen Stormrunner<BR>
