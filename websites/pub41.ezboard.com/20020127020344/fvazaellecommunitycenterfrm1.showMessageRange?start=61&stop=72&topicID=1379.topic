Ganking mooto from Medoc and meeting him for the first time. Somehow I knew that he was a quality player.<br>
Convincing Fira to let me join SF and then convincing her to let Medoc in. She wasn't going to let me join because she didn't think I could keep up in lvls.<br>

Dying 7 times on one attempt at Vox.<br>
Keeling Vox for the first time on the server.<br>
Keeling Vox and Naggy in one night for the first time on the server.<br>
Being in Seb when people were just hitting 60.<br>
Killing Kelorek `Dar when people thought we couldn't.<br>
Going to the 2nd floor of Hate the night it opened and thinking staying up until 4AM was worth it cause I got a tunarian scimitar.<br>
Clearing fear 7 times without one verm tunic dropping.<br>
Getting the only pair of skyshrine druid legs on the server (still).<br>
Zamtin handing me a jade reaver to finish my epic for the most part. <br>
Finally getting Carr his epic after weeks of trying to kill Sev.<br>
Killing trak far too many times to count and not once getting anything for it cept a tooth i never did the quest for.<br>
My one and only ntov raid with PA which was most enjoyable.<br>
Lvling Rade's mule to 20 just to give him the surname Brawnysbish.<br>
And finally getting Brettan to change Medoc's, Dianna's, and my surnames to Moo.<br>

Actually Vode, my first appearance here ever was at the Rants and Flames board.  I came here to have a look into a link to it on our guild site, when a member here had referred to one of our members being clearly despised by the EQ community at large as evidenced by his reputation on the Rants and Flames board.<br>
<br>
The flaming seems to be generally of the nature of chest beating and egos, but I bet if it came right down to it, the Uber guilds on our server seem more capable of co-operating than they might be on a lot of other servers and the folks at the top seem to have a pretty good knowledge of who is capable at their class, whether they consider them a-holes or not.<br>

<br>
well, my situation i guess was kinda odd. i started playing eq for the first time in late december last year, and i chose vazaelle cause, well, it was at the top of the list. i didn't really plan on actually *playing* this new fangled everquest game, it was more for humoring the boyfriend =)<br>
<br>
so i started lylliae on december 29 or so. funny thing is, while i was trouncing around dying to orcs, i met a lot of people who are now among the elite (or were, before they retired) of vazaelle.<br>
<br>
i remember galliamius convincing me to leave crushbone and go to the dreaded place called &quot;northen desert of ro&quot;. i saw a desert tarantula, and seriously thought it was something only a cool, high level person could fight.<br>
<br>
i grouped with devoit for a good portion of my teens...have screenshots of him and i standing outside kaladim on top of the big dwarf statue. i was soooo jealous of his gossamer robe!<br>
<br>
devoit introduced me to torbek, who made me my first banded armor. i remember sitting there in awe of him, because he only chaged me 30pp for like almost a full set of banded.<br>
<br>
i forget who it was, but one time in oasis at about level 20  i was sitting waiting for this boat, and this high level (i think he was like level 30...) bard was handing out gear. he gave me a gnomeskin tunic!!! omg it was the coolest thing ever. i still have it.<br>
<br>
later on, after i joined raiders of twilight (heh...), mathildae and diabolous helped me (by help i mean, did all the dirty work) camp dyllin in hph for my testament of vanear. when he finally popped and died, mathildae told me to loot it, even though i knew she needed the piece too. still one of the coolest things anyone's done for me in eq.<br>
<br>
about the same time i got my testament of vanear, mathildae also let me use her screaming mace (i think she's the cause of my tendancy to melee sometimes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) well, my guildmate lendiwen saw this, and gave me a springwood club. yup, i still use it. 5wis, 5str, 5int...rocks my world.<br>
<br>
joeb and i spent levels 30 to 40 in cazic thule...we got like 3 sets of darkforge armor between us. during that time i met sammy and he wanted me to join his little guild called &quot;eternal advocates&quot;. well, i was currently guilded, so i turned him down. he kept in touch though, checking up on me...i remember feeling stupid cause i was level 39 and he was like 53 at one point. i saw him once in the bank and he showed me some gear that ea had just gotten...coldain skin gloves. never thought i'd be wearing them now =x<br>
<br>
i remember once i was grouped in sol b, maybe level 40ish? and a bunch of IV people were in the zone (think they had just taken down rage, not sure) anyway, somehow my group got trained and someone died. then all of a sudden, this vision in purple came down and clicksticked our member, then proceeded to fully buff my group, including symbol. yes, cassianna had come to the rescue! she was SO nice to us. i still had her on my friends list when she won the botb, and sent her a big grats...i think she probably thought i was stalking her =x<br>
<br>
anyway. so many cool people on vazaelle..i'm really glad i'm here. even the &quot;uber l33t&quot; people are rad, and so far as i've seen have no problem with helping out us newbies to the game. *hug* vazaelle.<br>
