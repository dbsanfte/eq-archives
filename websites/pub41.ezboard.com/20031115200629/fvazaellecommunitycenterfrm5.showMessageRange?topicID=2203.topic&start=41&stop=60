<br>
You don't have to believe shit for it to be true.  Fact #1 - Your raid supposedly started before our adventure did.  Fact #2 - Tesgimp was still standing in the Nexus more than 15 minutes after our adventure was completly  over, including the extra 30 minutes trying to salvage a little something from a loss.  Now unless you were raiding a Nexus Scion, it doesn't really take a rocket scientist to figure out he didn't go to a raid during that time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did he really leave?&quot;<br>
Because he's a fucking gimp.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have basically said that you don't believe he had a raid to go to.&quot;<br>
No, I basically proved that he did not go to a raid while our adventure was going on.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what really happened?&quot;<br>
His head became dislodged from his ass and he was temporarily dispriented?  Hell if I know.  I don't try to understand tards.  I just smile and nod at the little droolers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you piss him off?&quot;<br>
You bet your ass I did.  Right when the words came out of his mouth that he had to go 20 minutes after starting an adventure.  Gimp says &quot;Can I get an Xloc?&quot;  Fuck no you can't.  Start walking chump.  Gimp asks other wizzy in group (YOUR GUILDEE) &quot;Can I get an Xloc?&quot;  LOL no dice from there either.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did he fall into a totally inept group?&quot;<br>
Any group he is in is bound to be a totally inept group.  And as far as ineptness goes, you're more than welcome to join the cockwaving contest and put up your credentials against mine.  Don't insult the good group members just because you refuse to admit your boy is a total fucking ass clown.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something is hiding here!&quot;<br>
Yes, it's your head that is hiding up your ass.  Wake up and smell the truth and stop trying to cover up for your gimp ass monk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oerintrubble>OerinTrubble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/3/03 10:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2203.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Credibility</span><hr size=1> Inept potty mouth little boy obsessed with words like gimp and tard.<br>
Your flaming foul mouth ranting for half a page and saying nothing seriously detracts from any credibility.<br>
<br>
No doubt that you and Teslaa had a disagreement.<br>
<br>
Serious doubt as to any other aspect of this.<br>
<br>
So if you choose to rant and flame rather than explain, well you're in the right place.<br>
<br>
But you are insulting people without proof or reason.<br>
<br>
The only proof is that you are incapable of being rational.<br>
<br>
As far as defending Teslaa, /shrug - haven't decided if he needs or deserves defending yet.<br>
But the way you're acting here, i'm leaning more in his favor.<br>
You act like this in game? Are you Truthreason in disguise?<br>
As much as i hate people leaving adventures (and you had me on your side in the beginning) I am believing more and more still without knowing all the facts that there is a whole lot more to this than you will admit to.<br>
And ranting about body parts and name calling does not get your point across.<br>

Good job.<br>
I can deal with language. It does not offend me. It just gets in the way of getting to the facts.<br>
I'm sure you misunderstand my intent though.<br>
In principle i must defend a guildee until it is proven beyond doubt that he is undeserving of defense.<br>
<br>
But i have more selfish than noble interests here.<br>
<br>
You have brought up that he bailed and i and everyone else here agrees that bailing in principle is wrong.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately two things stand out here to spur me to find out more of this instance.<br>
<br>
1. although we all agree that bailing is wrong. Nobody else has come forward and said &quot;yeah, he did it to me too.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. In the many times i have grouped with Teslaa in reg groups, LDON, and raids he has NEVER bailed.<br>
<br>
I don't say that to discredit you or defend him. It's just a fact that sticks in my head and causes me conflict.<br>
<br>
Sure i can and will ask him for his side of this. But i wanted to get as much of the rest of the story first.<br>
<br>
If someone is proven repeatably unreliable, that's one thing.<br>
A single isolated instance of bad judgement is another.<br>
<br>
I regret that you had a problem with him. I just have not seen anyone else come forward and make this out to more than an isolated incident.<br>

We won by 6 points.  When the coaches met mid field to shake hands, the other team's coach said &quot;There are no losers out here today.&quot;  It was just as dumb then as it is now.  There were losers and it was those other bastids across the field.  That's why they put everything in numerical sequence and why it's sooooo good to be #1.  And before you start the video game vs. real world argument answer this question.  Is it fun for you to just keep playing the first level of a video game over and over?

It was one LDoN group. You spent 1.5 hours not being as efficient as you would have liked. You were still getting XP and still got some points out of it. I can see why you would be mad. Hell, the same thing has happened to me and it pissed me off too. You know what though? It isn't that big of a deal! Was it a big enough deal to come here and spew for a fucking week straight?<br>
<br>
If a rant was put on this board everytime someone left an LDoN group early, you would have a shitload of rants, not suitable to entertain a wheelchair herd of comatose nursing home patients.<br>
<br>
Then, people that know this guy posted here to get more information about it and all that comes out of you mouth is &quot;You're a fucking gimp assclown n00b!1!!1!one1!!!&quot; Good stuff there.<br>
<br>
Then, when they try to get the name of the other person that you said was there, for the sole purpose of hearing what happened from someone who might have actually taken their meds today, you act like it's classified info. Like you are protecting your informant. Don't you realize that if you are telling the whole truth that this will only help to prove your point? <br>
<br>
???????? They were just a groupmember! WTF difference does it make if their name is thrown out there? It isn't a rant against them. <br>

Now I know you don't understand why I expect groups to run like well oiled machines at this level, but most players do.  Should be a class competency test every ten levels or so just to make sure people can't gimp their way through Norrath.  C'mon who's with me? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=svarien4001>svarien4001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/6/03 10:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2203.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>a class competency test every ten levels<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It still amazes me at lvl 65 that there are casters who, when they pull aggro, run around like chickens with their heads cut off instead of standing still and giving melee a chance to peel it off.<br>

Thank you for the warning.  I will take it into consideration when grouping.  I have an alt I am leveling and have seen some of the stupidest things while doing so.  In LDoN, I have had:<br>
<br>
- People exit 10 minutes in for no reason<br>
- A /q the moment an adventure was received to try to screw the group<br>
- People being a big enough anal orifice so much that they drive others out of the group<br>
- People opening trapped objects when warned that this could be bad<br>
- An SK that refused to cast Clinging Darkness because he would run out of mana (of course he had Mental Corruption up so wtf?)<br>
- Ninja looting of augments that people wanted (oops....Sorry mistake...he he)<br>
- Rangers not having neither snare nor jolt loaded (hey after awhile if you really want aggro you can have it)<br>
- Mezzing the mobs my SK pulls (even though I warn folks I pull with snare).<br>
- Refusal to Slow, Mezz, or Heal because the person might draw aggro<br>
- and of course the slowest pulling ever seen on the planet<br>
<br>
And of course Sony joins in with its own issue....<br>
<br>
- Person can't zone in to an adventure that he/she is part of and a GM won't fix it because &quot;its a known issue&quot; (this has happened in 3 groups I have been in).<br>
<br>
For me, I keep my own personal &quot;moron&quot; list.  I have given up a long time ago to try to teach people things like &quot;Hit the mob from the rear so you won't be riposted&quot;.  Life is too short for me to try to help these folks.  If you think these people don't get to level 65, I will tell you my BoT (aka Plane of Paludal Caverns - On a side note the last time I was in PoV I heard of an Outer Caves camp, now that is very funny.) story someday.<br>
<br>
Oerin,<br>
<br>
If you want this to go away, the best way to do so is to stop posting.  Ploppy having felt better by venting will move along to other things.  The thread will eventually disappear and we can start yelling about other things.<br>

Marteeny summarized the points very well.<br>
And I have stated my viewpoints.<br>
This goes way past being anything about Teslaa anymore.<br>
It's split many ways now.<br>
It's a game! It's not even a game you can win. or lose.<br>
You can succeed, or fail. But it's an adventure, not a contest.<br>
Have you ever played ball, or tennis, or golf and not kept score? Just for fun?<br>
I doubt it. You seem to be one that must win. You must be on top. You have to be #1. You seem to see everybody as beneath you.<br>
Do you have any friends? Do you treat everybody this way?<br>
You don't know me or anything about me, but you keep saying how superior you are and how much more experience you have. Like it makes a difference.<br>
It's not all about &quot;EXP&quot; and AA points. That has it's place, but this &quot;game&quot; is a whole world that can be enjoyed in many different ways. I'm not &quot;Uber&quot;. So What?<br>
I play this for fun. I enjoy the quests and the challenge of tradeskills. And every once in a while i even go after the next level or AA point. If i die, i get rezzed, learn from it and go on.<br>
If i fail a combine at the forge, i do another one.<br>
So if that makes me a noob after over 3 years, ok. the word doesn't hurt my feelings. I condider the source.<br>
People that think they are better than others really bug me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ploppydafrog>Ploppy Da Frog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/6/03 12:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2203.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.e-cadfael.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/Page_8/731.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teslaa the knob gobbler</span><hr size=1> Everything is a competition in EQ.  Sometimes it's to get past a mob, event or script for the first time.  And other times it's to do it faster and better than you have done it before.  EQ is a game of progression.  And unless the laws of physics are changed, progression means moving forward, not backward.  So those of us that do not wish to regress must warn the others of us with like minds.  You are right, this is not all about Teslaa.  It's a much larger group than just him.  Tesgimp is only a small part of it.  Incompetent players are like a plague.  They must be singled out and dealt with sometimes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azurizanesidhe>Azuriza NeSidhe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/6/03 3:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2203.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teslaa the knob gobbler</span><hr size=1>  hey Ploppy..  what u did was big difference..    when i was in high school..  i played football, and track..  basketball manager..   i had a HUGE spirit for team to win.. yes we do win for something..  to make us feel good.. thats a spirit..  and if any coach insults anyone if lose..  it means we are loser?  nah its bullshit!..   its about spirit and teamwork to keep alive..   its so much spirit when we win..  like football.  to show them that we care..  <br>
    <br>
<br>
     in EQ?   is it a spirit to do something?  i doubt it.. because its a freaking game..   they do scam players...  they do their game to fuck you off..  its BS its not a spirit to play a game in EQ.. so it has nothing to do with reality..   reality is a things that we care..  in EQ?  its nothing..   do we have teamwork?  i see so rarely players to show teamwork.. <br>
