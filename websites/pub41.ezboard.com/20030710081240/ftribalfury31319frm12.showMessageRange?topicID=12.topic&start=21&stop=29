So folks if anyone comes across essence of wind or windstones please please please save em and get them to either gimvi or myself. I REALLY want to make the most out of the sponsorship the guild is making to my smithing. It will take roughly 15-20 attempts per skill point, which means the same amount of essence per point. The essence is kinda rare (thx verant) so everyone I get is thx. In the past I have gone to twighlight sea and farmed the elementals with limited success. One trick that worked really well was a druid (raning) pulling with see invis, while (in the group i had) a mage and wizzie AE'd. We cleared the whole isle in no time flat. Fyi essence of wind drops off the air elementals there, as well as craig ligi in tenn mts. <br>
<br>
 Once I get my skill up a bit, I will start attempting the high end Cultural armors so all you Inkie tanks got something to look forward to. First set I make is already reserved but all the rest go to guild and current price on Dark prince regent breastplate is somewhere around 20k. At ac 51 with good stat buffs this stuff is real nice gear.<br>

<br>
Shrieking Substances, the Slow Way <br>
Go to Tenebrous Mountains. Kill sonic wolves. They wander all over the zone and are plentiful. The annoying thing are the bats and grimlings which may add. Still, you should be able to get a decent drop rate, 15 or 20 shrieking substances an hour if you're a good soloer. <br>
<br>
Wailing Substances, the Slow Way <br>
Go to Paludial Caverns. Yelloweyes, near the Shadowhaven zone line, drops a wailing substance upon occasion, but he is usually camped. There's a camp of four grimy owlbear cubs deep, deep within Paludial Caverns, at about -2000, -500. Kill them all. You'll average about one wailing substance out of every four owlbears. Sometimes you'll get two, sometimes you'll get zero out of the four owlbears. I averaged about six wailing substances an hour here, which is a definite bottleneck. I would definitely recommend the Fast Way. <br>
<br>
Shrieking and Wailing Substances, the Fast Way: The Hollowshade Moor War. <br>
This has got to be the single most frustrating thing to manage, as the war becomes bugged quite frequently and will only become unbugged if the zone is reset. But it gives you *lots* of Shrieking and Wailing Substances if you can get it to work, so it's worth trying. <br>
<br>
Basically, you have three camps whenever the zone is reset. Grimlings to the south, Owlbears to the east, Sonic Wolves to the north. After a server reset, every so often one camp will attack another and try to take it over. These random, automated attacks will stop after one race has successfully taken over the camp of another race, at which point attacks will only be triggered when you kill a named. You want to manipulate all of this to your advantage. <br>
<br>
What you're trying to accomplish is to get the owlbears or sonic wolves to take over the four islands in the southern part of the zone. The sonic wolves and owlbears that spawn on these islands will comonly drop shrieking and wailing substances, respectively. <br>
<br>
First, learn where the named owlbears and sonic wolves pop. There are two named owlbears in the owlbear caves: Skrieta'Cha pops at 3027, 2002. Skrieta'Chu pops at 3537, 1983. Their placeholders are owlbear fleshrenders, and they are on a 12 minute cycle. The sonic wolf named is Ghowik, in the caves at 450, -2975. Its placeholder is a sonic packleader and they are also on a 12 minute spawn cycle. <br>
<br>
Pay attention to the next sentence, as it took me far too long to figure out: <br>
<br>
Killing a named will spur its race to attack another camp. <br>
<br>
In other words, if you want the owlbears to attack another camp, you have to kill one of the owlbear nameds. (It should be noted that others have found this not to be the case, and that killing a named will trigger a random attack from any camp to any other camp. That may very well be. I'm just sharing my observation, which is that once the automated attacks have stopped, I could only trigger an owlbear attack by killing an owlbear named.) <br>
<br>
What you want is for the owlbears or the sonic wolves (depending on which substance you wish to farm) to attack the grimling camp to the south. Listen for the zone-wide message that says who is attacking and who is defending. When you hear that the owlbears (for example) are attacking the grimlings, run to the grimling chieftan at -2800, -600. In front of him are a couple of grimling bodyguards. The attack of the owlbears will spawn four grimling defenders. These mobs are perma-rooted and summon, so be careful. Do what you must to kill all these guys - defenders, bodyguards, and chieftan. You have about ten minutes from the zonewide announcement to do this. Then the owlbear attackers show up. If they can get into the chieftan's hut, the owlbears will have won the battle, the grimlings in the area will despawn, and owlbears will spawn in their place. Follow this same sequence if it's the sonic wolves you want to win. <br>
<br>
If, when you kill a owlbear named, you see a message that the owlbears are killing the sonic wolves to the east (even though the sonic wolves are really more north than east, the zonewide message talks about their camp being in the east), I'd recommend going to the sonic wolf cave and helping the defenders defeat the owlbears. You don't want the owlbears and sonic wolves to kill each other in the north and east camps, and if one race is completely defeated, you won't see it again until the zone is reset. There's supposed to be a way for you to get the war to reset on your own, but it is hopelessly bugged. So it's up to you to micro-manage the war and make sure the owlbears and sonic wolves defend their own realms successfully. <br>
<br>
Also, let's say owlbears have taken over the southern grimling camp and you've got all the wailing substances you need for now. Go to the sonic wolf cave and kill Ghowik until you see a message that the sonic wolves are attacking the owlbears in the south. Then run to the same place the grimling chieftan used to be (-2800, -600) and kill all the owlbears you see there, including the perma-rooted summoning owlbear defenders. Then the sonic wolf attackers will waltz in and take over the camp. <br>
<br>
Properly managed, this war can make farming wailing and shrieking substances trivial. It frequently becomes bugged, and you'll often have to run from place to place defending one race against an unwanted attack. Still, the benefits are worth it. <br>
<br>
Okay, you've gotten the sonic wolves or owlbears to take over the southern camp. Start killing the mobs that spawn on the four islands. As a 62 cleric I was able to be a one-man AE group: I aggro'd about eight or ten sonic wolves, then cast Upheaval and wasted them all. Doing this with KEI, I averaged 30 drops an hour. What's best, though, is if you can get an honest-to-goodness AE group together, with a tank puller and a wizard to AE nuke. Then you can get 50 drops an hour. <br>
<br>
This will be your best source of wailing / shrieking substances if you can manage it properly. <br>
<br>
Swirling Shadows <br>
Once you've got a good supply of wailing and shrieking substances, it's time to begin farming swirling shadows. These items are no-rent, which means they'll poof if you log off, so do these last. (As an alternative, you can get someone to duel you and then die, then loot your corpse of everything but the swirling shadows. As long as your corpse doesn't rot, the swirling shadows will remain for you to loot at your convenience.) You can get swirling shadows from lesser shades in Shadeweaver's Thicket, but they are uncommon drops (about one in five lesser shades drops a swirling shadow) and it's a real pain chasing down the lesser shades all over the zone, so I recommend farming lesser and greater shadows in the Twilight Sea. <br>
<br>
There's an island in the Twilight Sea at about -200, -1000 where the shadows roam. It's a relatively small island that's relatively close to Katta Castellum, so it's convenient to farm. Be warned, these mobs are not necessarily pushovers. They are level 40 and they lifetap frequently. I definitely needed KEI to farm there, since I had to heal myself often. Also, because the island is small, it is not difficult to get two or three adds during a battle. If that proves to be a problem for you, I'd recommend pulling the shadows to one of the nearby islands, where you won't get adds. Soloing, I got about 20 swirling shadows an hour. I'm certain my drop rate would have gone up with some help; this would be another decent place to AE, I think. <br>
<br>
I should also mention that it was easier for me, a cleric, to farm the mobs in Twilight Sea since I could heal myself after getting lifetapped constantly. If you're a class that can't heal themselves effectively, you may want to consider getting help, or just go back to Shadeweaver's Thicket and farm the lesser shades. <br>
<br>
You need at least twice as many swirling shadows as wailing or shrieking substances for Shadowscream armor, so plan accordingly. When I did my smithing, I'd farm 40 swirling shadows, then go do 20 Shadowscream combines, then farm 40 more swirling shadows, etc. <br>
<br>
At Last: Combining Everything into Shadowscream Armor <br>
OK! You've got your swirling shadows and your shrieking substances and your wailing substances. Time to actually make some armor. Go to the Plane of Knowledge and find the vendor that sells large bricks of ore. (Plain ore, not high-quality or medium-quality.) Combine one large brick of ore (1.5pp) with a flask of water and your file in a forge. You'll get your file back and two metal rings. Then combine one metal ring with one wailing substance, one shrieking substances, your humming luclinite hammer, and your Vah Shir anvil in a forge. This will produce a humming orb. <br>
<br>
Now place two swirling shadows, one humming orb, one banded boot mold (1.7pp), a water flask, your humming luclinite hammer, and your Vah Shir anvil in a forge. Hit combine. On success you'll get Shadowscream Boots. <br>
<br>
Keeping making Shadowscream Boots. They become trivial at 248, but remember you only need to get to 240 if you've purchased a Geerlock Automated Hammer. As a guildeline, I found that I averaged one skill-up per twenty combines. That means that to get from 188 to 240, you'll need approximately 1040 Wailing Substances, 1040 Shrieking Substances, and 2080 Swirling Shadows.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bill@tribalfury31319>bill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Burninator</span><br>  Posts: 2203<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/03 3:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx?path=/Drannor/fullsize/Trogdor.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> !</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That means that to get from 188 to 240, you'll need approximately 1040 Wailing Substances, 1040 Shrieking Substances, and 2080 Swirling Shadows. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
