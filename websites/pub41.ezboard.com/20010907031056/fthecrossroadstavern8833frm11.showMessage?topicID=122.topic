Why?  Because I had come across wayyy wayyyyyyyyy too many incompetent kiting druids on Eci.  Sorry but I've seen too many lvl 40+ true newbie druids in my day to assume that they know what they're doing.  I mean other classes you can have a fair idea that they at least know a LITTLE of what their job is.  Kind of hard to level up as a wizard if your a dumbass and nuke shit down and get yourself killed all the time, same goes for enchanters and clerics and their respective jobs.  But Druids.....sow+snare=kiting.  Kiting sometimes can = newbie druid.  <br>
<br>
Here's some examples:<br>
<br>
Lvl 50 druid I shit you not in prekunark times didn't know where the king room was in Sol B.<br>
<br>
Was in a group camping the ghoul supplier and assassin.  Had weird agro through the floor and we get a train from the savant's room and every frog between there up at our camp.  Everybody is dyiing, we're going down.  People shout EVAC EVAC!!!  Druid self gates out.  When asked why he didn't evac, druid asks whats evac?<br>
<br>
In a group and we get a big pull.  Cleric heals dyiing puller and gets mass agro and needs a heal bad.  Cleric tries to back up and root back up and root, tanks are taunting trying to get the mobs off him.  Cleric being interrupted can't heal himself, hes going down and we can't save him.  Then I think WTF is the druid doing, why isn't he healing the cleric??  I look and the druid is kiting one of the damn frogloks around and attracts MORE mobs.  <br>
<br>
If there's one thing I can't stand its incompetence.  It drives me batty when I'm surrounded by stupid people.  Not making this a slam to all druid players out there at all.   <p>----------------------- <BR>

It certainly gets at me because people read posts such as this and attach it to all druids no matter your disclaimer. I'm a damn good druid, both in groups and soloing. I'm courteous to other players when I solo and don't pull over or near them. In groups, I do my job... whatever it may be for that group, and I do it well.<br>
<br>
You are picking on druids, but why not pick on the other classes. I grouped with a level 42 warrior once that didn't know what Taunt was. I grouped with a level 52 warrior that didn't know he couldn't Taunt mobs above his level until he is 60. What kind of shit is that? I've met clerics that don't believe in CHing because it isn't mana-efficient. Maybe if they'd pull their heads out of their asses they'd figure out when it is mana-efficient. I can't even remember all the incompetent players I've run into. But to single out one class is wrong and unfair to all the good players that do play that class. I'm really tired of all the druid bashing. Go pick on another class of stupid players. Target all the dumbass warriors out there that don't know how to pull for awhile and give me a fucking break. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uraene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Battle Druid, Artist</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#333333>(8/30/01 7:24:50 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://2amstudios.com/eq/raene/raene01.jpg HEIGHT=183 WIDTH=151></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok here's a rant about newbie drewds.</span><hr size=1> I think it's justified if you come across too many instances of the same class that do not know all the facets to their skills.  It's about use, and practice, and situations.<br>
<br>
I was a lower wisdom druid growing up, and couldn't get enough mana to kite efficiently. Solution?  I grouped: Oasis, Highkeep, Sol B, Sebilis, Velks and so on. I'd like to think I know how to fill different roles in a group depending on it's makeup, and yes, keep an evac memmed when called for.<br>
<br>
Even after I had 200+ wis, I seldomed solo'd. It was boring. The group interactions can be so much more enjoyable when you get great people in it. :)<br>

No need to harp on just one. As a druid, I am prone to spot all the stupid freaking things that meleers do. When I play my rogue, I notice all the stupid things that casters do that tend to piss me off, like sitting in MIDDLE of the freaking hall way where you are trying to melee mobs. Get to the damn wall to sit down and get out of my way! And stop ping ponging the mobs cause you are too scared to stand next to it while you blast/debuff/whatever. I solo most of the time (as my druid) 'cause I've come to find that most people I group with can't play their class worth a damn. But I'm not harping on one class. I've run into way too many dumbasses for that. Like the idiot enchanter that died in KC where VS remains spawn when we were pulling to there and she didn't get up when the puller called INC. She just didn't understand why the mobs aggroed on her first. Dumbass!

<br>
Trust me, as a chanter, there are tons of enchanters out there that just lack basic skill.  Outdoor zones are mostly responsible for this.  I've run across chanters that couldn't spare the mana to aug because he was blowing it all slowing low blues that didn't do jack for damage to the tanks and the cleric had full mana.  I've watched an enchanter in Chardok who was casting cripple on mobs... and not slowing them.  Many enchanters are not aware of the power of Torment of Argli or how Wandering Mind is bugged.<br>
<br>
Nobody is really immune though.  I grouped with a level 60 cleric who used to be in one of the 'uber' guilds who didn't know how root effects summoning.  And I know back in the day when haste spells were bugged I got into a few arguments with people about haste... I wanted to give them non-aug because it was faster.  Of course, that wasn't the case.<br>
<br>
Fact is, skilled players exist in all classes.  And so do bad ones.  With a good crew, you can run amock without many of the things deemed necessary... snare, gate, CC, taunting, etc.  With a bad crew, you can have a 'perfect' set up and get wiped by a minor pull.<br>

The reason why bad druid players tend to stick out more is because of two reasons.<br>
<br>
1.  They are a support class, thus in grouping situations the group depends on them for healing, evacs, buffs, some nuking and rooting.  <br>
<br>
2.  They are a very easy class to solo with.  Solo players that spend all their time soloing are generally lacking in grouping skills.  <br>
<br>
A druid can be a great player...at soloing but be incompetent for grouping because of lack of experience.  Just imagine a player that is not used to having to heal his group and you put him on the spot where he's in charge of keeping everyone alive, sometimes they just crack.  A well played druid is a great asset for his group.  Just saying that the above two points has lead me to be in situations where I'm grouped with newbie druids when it comes to grouping.  <br>
<br>
Necros could fit into the same category because they're also a highly soloable class.  The main difference is a group doesn't depend on  necro to do its job to keep the group alive.  Necros aren't an active healer, don't group gate, or do other critical functions for a group that a druid can do.  Thus when a necro sucks he/she doesn't stick out as much as a druid.  <br>
<br>
Yeah there's shitty Warriors, Enchanters, and Clerics.  However those three are group dependent classes, thus they tend to have more experience at grouping then classes with a high level of soloability.  How many Warriors, Enchanters, and Clerics do you know that soloed their way to 50 untwinked or gimped?  Probably very very few.  I knew of TONS of druids that soloed their way to 50 that didn't know a thing about grouping, that is the basis of my rant.   <p>----------------------- <BR>

Even the one last night (Valdikov?) who I guess accidently got me and he killed when trying to properly use &quot;Harmony&quot; (or whatever) &amp; &quot;Snare&quot; on Redwind &amp; his Icy Orcs.<br>
<br>
Now I openly confess to being a noob player (See the Shrine) and am still learning the best spells to mem &amp; use when grouped in a dungeon, outdoors, or soloing, etc.  But I am competent enough now to take down a Wooley Mammoth while totally naked on the corpse run which followed our debacle.  (Instead of cannibalizing I beat it to death with my fists! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Afterward, I also realized that I might have been able to pull us out of the mess we got ourselves into if I had rooted the Icy adds instead of DOT'ing them.  Hindsight is 20/20.    <br>
<br>
So before I get a Mystykal word limit flame let me just say that everyone makes mistakes in-game because no one is perfect.  Whether or not we finally learn from these mistakes determines whether we are a pathological dumbass or not.  <br>
<br>
(O.K., go ahead, now tell me I still haven't learned from mine.  I dare you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
But regardless, I still feel it is the individual and not the class who needs spanked.<br>

Its just that for some ungodly reason people who dont have a clue how to play EQ tend to make Druids. its my Personal beliefe that all classes are Pretty dam Equal its the person playing the char that makes that char. I have seen awsome and shit players in all classes. IE recently been hanging out in CC with my monk and there has been a wizzy in there that well 2 or 3 or 4 times a night whle Im there he is looking for Rezzes for the deaths he causes. the dumb SUMBITCH allmost got Cravin Killed onenight from him being  tard. the guys name is WHIZZARDO or something close to that. <p><img src= http://www.phoenixhorizon.com/images/mempics/cravinbak.jpg><BR>

<br>
Roleplaying or not, Nyr, you sound intelligent when you type normally.  Since Crossroads isn't a roleplay message board I don't think it'd be against precedence to type normally all the time. <p>Binnen Minder<br>

<br>
It increases the mana regen on the target instead of draining it's mana.  So if your goal is to keep a mob OOM (combined with Seive), well, this is the wrong spell to use.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Having not yet been in the position of WANTING to root a critter who can summons (at least, I assume that's what you mean) how does rooting affect them? <br>
<br>
Rooted mobs place the closest person on the hate list on top.  As such, they don't summon anyone but that person.  Which makes it great if your main tank is a monkey/rogue and your enchanter has just tashed and slowed.  Or, for that matter, to allow a rogue to backstab even if nobody else is generating any real hate.<br>
