Good enough that they're used as a source for more investigation towards in criminal tracking online, because as I said, an RL friend, Officer Charlie Haines, actually handles most of our local internet crime and what's the first step in tracking someone? Getting his IP and then tracking the IP to the ISP and the ISP to the RL persona =P and as for an IP being spoofed... his IP was an unknown BEFORE he made a post here(none previous) and BEFORE the post here the matching IP was used to edit the calendar, so if someone is trying to frame him with a bogus IP it was likely someone from his OWN guild since that's the only place I see posts from him on his history =P (So once again, the source of the problem remains the same)<br>
<br>
And what do fingerprints or DNA testing at the scene of a crime do except feed suspicions for more investigation niliz? Just because you bled somewhere within a reasonable amount of time of someone getting killed close by doesn't mean you did it, but you probably know something or were involved in some means. <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Two months later I update my sig, and I'm in body armor and a kilt(It's not a skirt!)...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 1:34:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> Let's not forget that Verant does not recognize calendar/resevation systems and will not support them.<br>
<br>
I see the calendar as a place where a guild can announce its intentions, not a binding reservation system that must be adhered to by all.  <br>
<br>
Following the calandar is a courtesy, not a rule.<br>
<br>
As far as Verant sees things, planes and high level encounters in EQ are essentially FFA.  They go to the first raid party that engages.  Definitions of where raids begin and end vary mob to mob and GM to GM, but it's generally consistent.  <br>
<br>
If you're outside of the fear portal gathering people, another guild has the right to march on in and start killing -- whether you have it scheduled or not.<br>

But then again, I've not worked in the computer industry for 6 months so who the hell knows, I might be rusty. Fact of the matter, unless someone is using multiple ISP's or multiple different dial-ins IP's remain more or less static in my experience(except for that last number)<br>
<br>
As for bullshitting stuff by cut and pasting in 'proof' whatever you say boss, I just pull this stuff out of the air. I'm plenty pissed about the FFA thing, it's a sign of greed and makes the server alot less comfortable for EVERYONE on the server, and frankly it is it's own topic. <br>
<br>
FACT is that I posed it as a possibility to Baldrik, then he wouldn't say he didn't or wouldn't do it, and he changed topic, which added suspicion that he might have done something or knew something. Then without me saying a THING to her, Narya checked the IP logs, not at my request, out of her own curiosity, and the IP matches up. See, two seperate people, both doing their own looking into it, where the evidence points in a similar direction? Maybe Baldrik didn't do it, but I bet you pennies to pesos that he knows something.<br>
<br>
And once again, nice attempt at soiling my reputation, assholes will continue to hate me and 90 percent of the people worth knowing will like or love me, so direct your rants at me more, I have no reputation to lose my friends support me =P (And to be fair, these are my out of guild friends, not one's inside the guild that would be biased)<br>
<br>
And ignoring what the majority of the server feels about FFA only leads to you being FFA'ed yourself, even a 5 year old knows how to share with others in a amicable fashion for everyone, those that don't general get sent to psychiatrists and counselors at a young age in this part of the world. (There's arguments about single spawn FFA vs. zone FFA that I won't get into though, since single spawn has some reasonable arguments, unlike zone)<br>
<br>
And as for not showing the IP's Amstel, thanks for badgering me to post information in a public forum that is ILLEGAL, you;re not allowed to post people's IP's publicly under some law or another... still waiitng for Charlie to answer my phone call so he can fax me over a copy of the specifics. <br>
<br>
And also note: 'I know Baldrik did not touch the raid board'... ironic that he himself said he logged onto it to check before switching to state Planes FFA <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Two months later I update my sig, and I'm in body armor and a kilt(It's not a skirt!)...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 1:50:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> Ceros- <br>
Verant has recently stated that they're lifting rules about training and bind point camping, etc. on PVP servers... and their quote being along the lines 'We don't support these things, but they're impossible for us to maintain well, so we're letting the public deal with lashing out against the offenders'... <br>
and I'm sure Verant would rather keep everyone happy in a huge clockwork of raids not running over each other, but has no means to enforce a calendar, them saying they're taking care of it would be political suicide, the first time it fucks up.<br>
<br>
Procax-<br>
Maybe I'm niave, but what problems has there been recently with the calendars? Early days I remember the Vox/Nag squabbles over single-spawn FFA vs. Planes FFA opinions... but I've never seen Planes/ToV wings/Necro/WW declared as FFA on this server, and to this day, MOST people seem to agree that Planes FFA is ass. <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Two months later I update my sig, and I'm in body armor and a kilt(It's not a skirt!)...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 2:24:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> Vaclav,<br>
<br>
I agree to some degree, but mostly disagree.  I was going to debate what you said with some examples of things I remember Verant saying, but in the end I feel that it's incidental.<br>
<br>
It's incidental because regardless of how Verant would prefer it, or how they intended it, planes and high end encounters have evolved to be first come first serve.<br>
<br>
EQ is a diverse game with an incredible range of gamers -- from people who play just a couple of hours a week to people who play 80+ hours a week.  This diverse base of players has different philosophies, needs, desires, and goals.  <br>
<br>
Not everyone agrees with the calendar concept, and the decision on whether or not to support calendars has been left up to the individual players and guilds.<br>
<br>
Nobody but Verant has the right to say that anyone must adhere to a calendar/reservation system, and until they do following the calendar is left to courtesy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukelbenarunsun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelben Arunsun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 2:30:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> Vaclav you need a life really ;p i cannot believe someone would contact his RL friend who works at the police to help him to his right to raid POG and loot a BP <br>

<br>
You accuse me of trying to soil your reputation? Not at all. I'm merely responding to your attempt to soil somebody else's. With a post like that, what on earth did you expect? How would you feel if I made a post saying you fiddled with the system and didn't have anything to back it up? I'll tell you, pretty frikkin pissed off.<br>
<br>
Am I badgering you? I didn't ask you to post the logs here. I did say that if you were going to try and blacklist a guild for whatever reason, back it up with something. If you're not allowed to post the IP numbers, try to have something else tangible. I believe I did give you my E-mail address.<br>
<br>
As for flaming me for not believing in a reservation system. I can't even begin telling you how incredibly ignorant that is. I have been playing for a long long time, and in my experience FFA *has* been prefered over reservations. Still, that's entirely besides the point. The point is, you're calling us pricks because we don't agree with you. <br>
<br>
You're absolutely right, we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get FFA'ed ourselves. As I said in my post, when that happens we'll accept that and have our fun elsewhere. I'm sorry if you don't like our way of thinking. I won't call you a prick for not liking it either.<br>
<br>
As for the IP numbers. Well, maybe I spoke too soon. I know for a fact that that's not the way they behave over here in europe, and I know how easily things can be doctored. I'll leave it at that.<br>
<br>
That's all I'm saying. These threads go nowhere, and I should've known this beforehand. I think people reading this thread have made up their mind, and won't be swayed to either side.<br>

Ok, reading for comprehension(tossing your same shit back at you)... I said I was checking into the legalities of giving out IP information, since I knew some people would ask about it and I know there's some legal issues with it. Instead you'd rather me blindly not look into my rights and post IP's publicly so I can be sued.<br>

And Kelben I'm 27, and happily retired at my young age already, not living in luxury, but I make enough money without working that I work as an option not as a requirement.

<br>
And as for people who support a calendar vs. don't support one regarding PLANES, look back through the posts sometime, I don't recall a single person except Saalron saying they supported it... although some people said something along the lines of 'It's not worth doing non-FFA because some dicks will come along and make it not work down the line' <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Junkyard Dog of SF<BR>All rants are trademarked by me and<BR>are my opinions not those of SF =P</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvaclavromanov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaclav Romanov</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/26/01 3:05:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sacret Fires, CC and the calender.</span><hr size=1> About emailing you the IP numbers, fine and dandy, but you already stated you believe I would cut and paste bullshit into them to prove my case.

About something else tangible, you want me to post my EQ logs of exactly what Baldrik said? Guess what... I don't keep logs, you know why?

<br>
As for FFA on other servers, please list your list of servers where everything INCLUDING Planes is FFA... here's my list of all my play servers that weren't the last time I played there:<br>
<br>
Lanys T'Vyl, Quellious, Prexus, Tholuxe Paells, Torvo. <br>
<br>
One's I've played on that were when I left:<br>
<br>
Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Some of these past servers might have changed since I played there, since in the case of most it's been at least 6-9 months since I played my a char for more than a single raid to help friends, but as of when I stopped playing on each as a primary, they all were Planes as reservable. But then again, starting March 15th(or was it 14th?), 1999 - one day before most people in the US could purchase their copy of EQ, I had my acct active and was playing as much as the servers would allow.(I worked in the industry at the time and got to buy my copy a night early) Not that time you've played means anything, Iviy(my girlfriend RL) is still a very niave player, especially about politics and she's been playing over two years like myself<br>

---------<br>
<br>
No problems answering questions Eb, yes there was a scheduling conflict with Nag in the early days, wasn't involving the calendar though... Keadaian mentioned wanting to do Nagafen to Sotae in chatting after we had just killed him our first time and most of us were already logged out at the entrance to Sol B for a planned raid on him the following day after the emergency patch. <br>
<br>
After that and the ensuing thread, it became clear most of the server supported FFA in regards to single-spawn ubers... (VS, Trak, Severilious, etc.) Whereas Planes and other Raid-Level zones were reservable, well, until now at least.<br>
<br>
And as for the second question, I have no idea Eb... but it was pretty convenient that the time of it getting editted the 2nd time coincides, and Baldrik made NO MENTION about them considering Planes FFA until after I mentioned that the calendar tracks all IP's, at which point every mention of the calendar was ignored. Maybe he's not guilty of editting it, but it certainly makes on suspicious, doesn't it? Someone catches you in lie, most people do one of two things, 1. Fess up and admit it or 2. Change to a different topic to elude someone prying deeper and finding out you lied for a fact.<br>

<br>
Why is PO being dragged into this?<br>
<br>
1. Yes, we had a run in w/ SF along time ago over what really is a POS dragon spawn.  I'm over it, my guild is over it, far as I know, SF is over it.<br>
2.  Vaclav, other than one incident, has never been anything but a cool person.<br>
3.  SF as individuals are nearly all cool people.<br>
4. CC Was in Hate when we were scheduled to go up.  We went up anyway.  I told their leader at the time about the calendar here and he indicated to me that he would respect it in the future.  <br>
5.  The last Fear raid we posted (well in advance) was a bust because SF cleared the zone some 4-6 hours before our posted start time.<br>
6. We've pretty much stopped posting our raids.  CC and Agony have stated that they consider the planes to be FFA.  SF has said they support reservations but have been a bit weak in actualy following through with that.  Slivers, prior to their collapse said they did not support a reservation system.  Word on the street is that the American contingent of Slivers may be reforming and I don't expect anything will be different.  All it takes is for one large guild to go FFA and the effects will inevitably snowball.<br>
7. For those that haven't been paying attention, there are at least 2 large Asian guilds on the server now, both with multiple players lvl 50+.  Neither posts here, I seriously doubt either will check the calendar before they raid.<br>
8. For all practical purposes the server has gone FFA and all the bitching to the contrary isn't going to change it.<br>

There is no evidence whatsoever he deleted any post. <br>
Several other remarks have been made that are also incorrect. <br>
<br>
We never booked Hate, and therefore never got 'screwed' by Agony. We have never use to calendar to book raids, we consider all mobs/planes/dragons FCFS. No one has ever approached us as to how we see these things, although we have been in the Planes for at least 8 weeks, without ever booking them. So Narya maybe you shoud reread others' posts as well before replying. Nowhere is the word 'reserved' used. He writes 'planned'. <br>
<br>
Baldrik was obvioulsy upset after being harrassed in tells by people he had never met, grouped with, or ever had anything to do with. It is insinuated he has deleted/hacked or tampered with the calendar in some other manner, in the middle of a raid. He logged to check the boards to make sure it wasn't booked, something we usually do, and because he was the first to notice this and take advantage of it, he is immediately made the scapegoat of someone's attempt to disturb the peace of the server.<br>
<br>
We have always gone by the motto FCFS. Vaclav seems to think Baldrik 'changed' tactic mid conversation. Of the 60 odd members of CC, approximately 15 have English as a first language. His grammar, sentence structure etc may not always be perfect, but he did not suddenly decide we were a FFA guild.<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
All guilds have silly squables over spawns, you had one of two ways to handle it: a. Be an ass and state that the rules most of the server abides by were below you OR b. Apologize, explain the misunderstanding and try to comply to the rules in the future.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
This quote by Vaclav is amusing, as its exactly how I would have felt looked upon the people sending me tells, if I were Baldrik. He was accused of deleting posts based on nothing more than Narya's accusations so far. If it had been explained that a post was deleted and this is why the plane appeared to be unbooked when Baldrik checked, we would probably have come to some sort of agreement. This was not done though. It was insinuated that Baldrik, or someone in Caer Cadarn had deleted a post, so we could enter the plane and point to the calendar as our 'alibi'. <br>
<br>
Come with a little hard proof before you start slagging people off, and threatening with making us the server pariahs.<br>
<br>
Just for the record. We do not use the calendar, we do not recognise it. We believe in FCFS. I am sorry if you feel this will mean the moral fibre of the server will now be ripped apart by us 'forcing' other guilds to adopt this stance as well. It hasn't in the last 8 weeks we have been visiting planes, but that seems to have been missed by certain posters.<br>
<br>
We generally check the boards before going to a plane, and respect the bookings of other guilds, but we have no plans to book them ourselves.<br>
<br>
On a side note, we play and raid 6 to 12 hours ahead of US guilds. If we were to book planes it would mean we either raid US times to coincide with respawns, or US guilds raid 'Euro' times to coincide with respawns after our visits to them. Neither is going to happen. To illustrate.<br>
<br>
CC books Fear for 6 am EST Saturday. To ensure a full respawn, which I presume these booking guilds do, anyone who booked Fear for Friday, must be kill their last mob around 6pm EST, otherwise we are left with a partially respawned plane. This basically means Friday is out of the question for many guilds to raid Fear.Once we had entered Fear, the plane would not begin to respawn until 6pm Saturday, with a full respawn some 4 to 8 hours later. <br>
<br>
Maybe this means sweet FA to anyone. In the end i don't really care. Baldrik was accused of tampering with a public forum. Insted of attempting to implement 'B' in Vaclav's suggestion of how to resolve matters, he resorts to petty insinuations<br>
<br>
In most western countries, including the USA, citizens are considered innocent until proven guilty. All I see here is slander and insinuation.<br>

As far as posting goes, there are some lamers who refuse to, afraid that everyone is out to get them and steal their kills.<br>
<br>
For guilds like IV who post to help AVOID conflicts - keep doing it.<br>
<br>
For everyone else - treat it for what it is - a communication aide. It is not the law and is not enforceable. But it helps, and it is smart to try and work WITH others instead of AGAINST them. <p>Bllack Ader - It's Dr00ds like me that have ruined this land!</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=152.topic&start=81&stop=94>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=634.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=152.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=152.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=152.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm21">General Chat<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <BR><table width=90 height=20 border=1 align="center" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
