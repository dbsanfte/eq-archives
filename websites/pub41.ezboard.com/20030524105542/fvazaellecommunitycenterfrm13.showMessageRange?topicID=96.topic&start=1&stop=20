Well the time has come for me to say bye to this great server...  I have met some wonderful people here,  had countless fun mob encounters ranging from trakanon to vulak, each fight more fun then the last =)  Leveling up untwinked with a guild full of my closest friends, barely winning to some mobs people said we would never have a chance against, getting my pain in the ass epic done,  meeting many out of in virtue people that are kind hearted and fun to be around,  those are the memories I will be taking with me as I leave Vaz.  I have been on EQ since around October 1999 and I plan to still play it in the future if my friends decide to go to a new server.  But till then EQ is not the place for me.  Here I will list some people that ment alot to me,  pls forgive me if I accidently leave you out, it was not purposely.  For the IV people here I will probably see the majority of you again but ill post hugs for you anyway<br>
<br>
In Virtue-  Is always a honor playing with the finest bunch of hardcores on the server, possibly the whole game, it was great leveling, owning, and chilling with you, my family. <br>
I will see most of you again &gt;=)<br>
Promethian Order-  You guys have heart and dedication...  I really enjoyed having the priveledge of being your guild mate<br>
Caer Cadarn- One of the guilds I have much respect for on EQ.  We had some fun competition back in the day, I still miss racing with you guys ^_^  I just hope that in the future with whatever server or game I will be on to have a formidable and honorable guild like yours to compete against.<br>

Xarr- TRULLISH MONSTER SUPER HERO!  I love you, you will always be my boy,  stay true sir.<br>
Zerric- Also TRULLISH MONSTER!  Ur a very good hearted guy, you bitch to much sometimes,  but you make up with it in your excellent personality.  Joo will always be my friend.<br>
Soundwave- BARD /hug You will make the best damn enchanter ever sir.<br>
Ariki- I know you dont read this shit anymore your long gone, but while i was exping with you bro I had some awsome times...  if by any chance you do get by VCC and read this shit get back in contact with me man. <br>

Anyone who wants to talk to me I have AIM (putzgoober) or my ICQ 146563506 ICQ.  Goodbye Vazaelle /hug.  I might log on every once in a while to chat a bit but i will never hardcore on this server again...  In time this post will drift to page 20 and eventually disapear, as will peoples memory of me, but the memories in my mind that I have gained from being around you all will never go away, you will always have the love of ZHRAATH.  I do hope to see you all again. =)  <br>
<br>
Love~  Zhraath the 60th Magician of In Virtue (RETIRED)<br>
