Its a copy paste from my flames forum in my guild site.<br><br>To all members who stay with us even though those flamers constantly try to get you to hate me I am proud of all of you guys. Im proud of the fact that you do what you want to do and you believe in me. I am also proud of the fact you are willing to grow to be strong and not try to find some big old guild that will most likely have a lv requirement to try and get you pled constantly and give you things. Guilds dont do that real guilds work as a team and try to help each other out. BDL is a guild of (ill leave that out) who appear nice but when you make ONE mistake with them they flame you and kick you out dead simple. <br><br>Ill tell you a little of what happened. I had a bad comp that takes awhile to load but plays everything to good satisfaction at least. But because of this I couldnt put the clip plane up so I couldnt see really far. Well I got attacked by a giant I was a newbie at the time cuz of the lil bro episode who had to play with my toon and screw em all around. I didnt know how to get things off of me I didnt know what I should do if chased I had no Jboots. I overlooked the fact that I had Root to just root a mob if im chased or dont want to fight it. So I ran to a group hoping they could help me cuz I couldnt run out of zone I didnt had lay on hands on me. But I didnt see that they were fighting a giant over there nor was I able to type in Guild I needed help or tried to /Yell i wasnt that good of a typist yet I got half of my typing experiance from playing this game. <br><br>So anyway I ran over to them to see if they could help and as I said my clip plane was all the way down. Meaning I couldnt see the giant they were fighting because it was too late I had some lag also in which it takes some time for large moving objects to appear on my screen so by the time I saw the giant I was way too close and got me and them killed. <br><br>So then they started to flame me and yell at me the ones doing so was the Seinor officers of the guild Bryre and Kahryne. I tried to apoligize to them but all they did was act cruel, yelled at me tried to push me down like they are the boss of me and so on. So before they took me out of the guild which they are planning I took myself out. <br><br>I would not and will not take that crap over a silly little game. There are clerics in the zone with 96 exp resses so I dont know why they had to get all mad. They are too addicted to the game and according to medical magazines I read this game sometimes makes people have egos where they can push others around. Apparently when you have a high seat of power &quot;Senior officer for example&quot; the person may start to think they can do whatever they please and flame whomever the please if they do something they dont like. <br><br>By what the magazine says these kinda people are called &quot;PowerHungers&quot; Power hungers are people that dont have any power over others in RL or very little. People who want power but will never get it. So when you give them a little power in a simple game they start to think its there lives or just go overboard with it and start to order or push people around forgetting the fact that they are real people behind each player. So basically if you do something they dont like they treat you like trash, filth, garbage etc.<br><br><br>So that is what happned with BDL. I read all this in medical mags its all true. Its totally Psychological.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umanaspineblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Manas Pineblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Lore</span><br>  Posts: 673<br> <font color=#333333>(2/8/02 10:38:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok heres what happened</span><hr size=1> Dude, get a grip. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=73211>Manas Pineblade</a><br>Ranger of Tunare<br>Black Death Legion</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urogoshofbdl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rogosh Of BDL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(2/8/02 10:51:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok heres what happened</span><hr size=1> Um We let that issue drop Dethen and we thought this issue was over but you started again on our boards then threatened our reputation. I for one dont know exactly what happend that night and dont care. How we act as a guild, We help our members when needed and try to keep a family like guild. We have one rule we all decided on No twinking of toons unless it is an alt that is getting items from thier main. We do this so that all members can learn the game with all of the hardships that go with learing how to play properly. We do set up raids so that those toons that can not get quest items by themselves can. We are not trying to ruin your New guild. BDL has abgstained from talking to your guild members and we will continue this approach as long as you dont start emoting and threatening our members. If you are going to post something on your board be sure to post all of the information some of your members only know your story. <br><br>BTW what happened to your younger brother i thought he did all of this not you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukolath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kolath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#333333>(2/8/02 11:20:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *shakes his head*</span><hr size=1> Dethen, you don't know how to listen, do you?  *sighs, walks away* <p>Kolath Eversor <BR>Shadow Knight <BR>Level 42 <BR>Guardian Alliance<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufantomethunderstrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fantome Thunderstrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#333333>(2/8/02 11:24:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok heres what happened</span><hr size=1> Damn, Dethen.

I did a quick search but could not locate it.<br><br>Also, could you please post which &quot;medical magazines&quot; you read this in? Just the standard magazine title, issue/date, volume and article? and don't worry if its not online as I will order copies via interlibrary loan if need be. I am interested in reading this article too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br><br>btw, BDL, as far as I know, is *NOT* contacting your members. I was and I have made no secret of it. I also don't trash you to your guildies. I just simply point them to the various boards that you've ranted, tell them to read what you and everyone else has posted, and that they should make up their own minds as to whether they should stay in or not. Not surprisingly most that read these sites have left. The few who didnt said that they were going to for now as you promised to pay them plat/items to stay in. One said he genuinely liked you, thought that I was mean, and that I should be banned for trying to get peeps to leave BAN. Hey, fine by me that he stayed with you - he exercised his free will and made an informed decision. More power to him and I wish him luck in the future!<br><br>Also, I have not contacted anyone from your guild in the last 72 hours as I wrestle with the philosophical aspects as presented by some peeps in the other thread. I've been breaking out a lot of my old philosophy and ethics material from college. I must say that a lot of tells in game, from many many peeps, support what I was doing, and even the non-supportive tells were fairly lucid and not flames (which I thank you all for). I'm still chewing this over...<br><br>However, recent information coming to me from within your guild is making me lean to starting back up again. It's my understanding that you are agitating for your newbie players to go to badgamers and flood the Bryre post you started in order to bump you out of the #1 spot. My informants tell me that this is one of your &quot;tests of loyalty&quot; or some such crap. Thankfully most appear to be questioning that order. However, to be fair to you, while this comes from one of your guildies it is only hearsay. This particular newb didnt know about the /log function so this conversation was not recorded and cant be proven.<br><br>I think one telling item is that you do not appear to be directing your newb guildies to these threads. Knowing your personality type, just from life experience btw and not by reading any &quot;medical magazines&quot;, if you even *thought* you were in the right you would be directing them here to defend you and have their say. However, my informants tell me that you *never* mention any of these sites and instead just bash peeps in general in /gu , saying they hate you because your so nice, yada, yada, yada...<br><br>As for your &quot;big old guild&quot; level requirement... ROFL... of course you dont have a level requirement! Anyone in the mid- to high-end game knows you! We all want nothing to do with you! The only way you can get a guild is to stock it full of newbs that are bought and paid for! There are many decent guilds in Zeb that will consider peeps from around level 10 or even lower! Only a handful have a true high-end minimum level and these are the power raiding guilds where non-planar peeps just wont survive the break nevermind the zone (no offense to anyone btw! but flame me if ya gotta! LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). The only thing that truly bothers me is that a lot of these newbs will be tainted by being in BAN thru no fault of their own. Reps do rub off...<br><br>Laters<br>Haelion Caduceus<br>45 Cleric of Tunare<br>Member- Warders of Tri-Lith<br><br>PS Would you also please stop sending tells to us Tri-Lithers?

My aim is to lv to 60 and aquire all the best stuff that I can as well as attain the Epic which is so hard to attain and rarely seen. The last one I saw with it said it took her a year and 8 months to obtain due to the fact that she had no guild to help her and went on Public raids. I want to get stronger to help the Guild but to get stronger to help them they must help me. I fight for what is right and will help anyone in need. Although some people think I am my little brother who went and made a total jerk of himself with my character about nearly two months ago.

So basically all it counts down to is it wasnt my fault for startin this mess it was there inconsideret rash rude behavior that they shown towards me that started it in the first place.  Eventually I was in denial. I got out of guilds cuz I just didnt feel right in em had somethin bitin at me for some reason dont know why.  Eventually I found out im not a follower but a Leader like my father.<br><br>I want it to drop but not until you guys found out what really happened and why. That is all.
