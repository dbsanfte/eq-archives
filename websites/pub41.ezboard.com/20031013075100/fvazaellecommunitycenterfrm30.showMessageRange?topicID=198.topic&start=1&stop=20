I went over to my girlfriend's place of work after I got off work, to spend time with her on her lunch break.  When I get there, she is having major problems explaining to &quot;el pedro&quot; that he needs to pick up his order at the warehouse, not in the furniture store itself.  After about 40 minutes of trying to explain to this border hopper that he cannot walk off with the floor model, he leaves angry.  <br>
<br>
Why HE is angry, I don't know.  If I was in another country, I would have been embarassed for making these people jump through hoops and causing them frustration because I cannot speak their language.<br>
<br>
You think that is all? Nope..... We finally get into my brand new car to drive down the street to get something to eat.  When making a left turn from the turn lane onto another street out of fucking no where this guy makes a right turn onto the same street and cuts right over into the lane I was in.  This lousy mexican almost hits me and I swerve to avoid him, causing people behind me to slam on their breaks and swerve out of the way also.  I had the green arrow light, so it was fucking definatly my turn to turn.  THE EXACT SAME MEXICAN WHO MY G/F HAD TO DEAL WITH EARLIER.  You think it ends there?  NO!  He then fucking pulls into the opposite lane of traffic and waits for the far lane to clear up.  I am saying, he fucking goes over the double yellows as in he is facing north in the south lane.  This moron is using the other lane of traffic as a &quot;turn lane.&quot;  Thank god no one was in that lane or it would be a head on.  He finally makes it into &quot;K-mart.<br>
<br>
(QUESTION)<br>
<br>
Why the fuck do I want these people in my country?  Try not to just call me &quot;net names&quot; or &quot;racist.&quot;  Explain to me why it is worth it.  Why is it worth all of the money I pay in taxes?  Don't try to tell me they don't get anything, DSHS has a program in our state where illegal aliens get $ 1,300 a month if they are a family of six.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2083<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/23/03 11:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You guys wonder why I am racist, here is why.</span><hr size=1> Well, it sounds like we don't want this particular guy in our country.

There are plenty of Mexicans out there that you would like if you took the time to get to know them without prejudging them based on their ethnicity.<br>

<br>
On a slightly less bitter note, yes, you're right (though misguided). Welfare laws are completely out of control, and immigration laws are completely out of control. <br>
<br>
This is why you want &quot;these people&quot; in your country. Because every shit job in the world like washing your dishes after you take your pretty white girlfriend to Chili's or whatever or scraping the grease out of the grease trap at McDonald's. You know - the jobs most of &quot;us people&quot; are too lazy or too proud to do. <br>
<br>
A family of Mexicans moved into the house next door to me recently. Its an old 3 story house that was like many houses in the area taken over by &quot;blockbusters&quot; (not the video store chain) and cut up into 3 diff apartments to make room for low income housing. This by the way, is what contributes to the urbanization and decline of neighborhoods, eventually making them &quot;ghettos&quot; which you love to hate so much. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I digress. I'll be honest. These Mexicans fulfill a LOT of racial stereotypes. They are always working on a different car in the yard every week. They drink in the middle of the day (usually only on weekends) and play loud mariachi music. There seems to be an endless stream of children living in the house. Ya know what though? The men that live in the house go to work every day, and they work hard as hell. Harder than I do, and for a lot less money. They take care of the house - they painted it, and they're putting a new porch on it. They made a deal with my landlord to get the entire lot paved together so they could save money.<br>
<br>
Based on my anecdotal evidence, clearly I can conclude that all Mexicans are hard working people who take care of their family and take pride in their homestead.<br>
<br>
Look the bottom line is this. Leech scum are everywhere in this country. And they're all different colors. Hey, I sucked up your tax dollars for a whole month this summer, sitting on my ass and collecting unemployment. But I'm white, so do I get a free pass? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=550521"><br>

Did you ask him? Do you think just because he speaks spanish and is tan he's from Mexico? He could be from Mexico or any number of countires in South America or from Spain. You assume a lot, and we all know what happens to people who assume...ass..u..me. Just because this guy was a dick dosen't mean you should hate all latino people. I don't understand you're logic. If that applied to my dating life (when I was dating) then I would be married to a really old black man, because many men from white guys younger than men to asian guys my age or latin guys older than me have screwed me over while dating. So I should automatically hate them all because one hurt me. It makes no sense. Assholes come in all shapes colors and creeds. Do you bear this much anger at the white guys that, I'm sure, have done the exact same thing to you on the road or have givin your girlfriend a hard time? My guess is yes, so do you hate white people too? Or do you only get mad at people who look different than you? Oh wait everyone else in the whole damn world looks different than you. But I guess you didn't notice that and are most comfortable lumping yourself in with people of similar skin color and making blanket generalizations about everyone else. Your view of this world is very narrow, and you seem to bear a lot of anger inside. It would do you a lot of good to do some soul searching and find out why you are so angry and resentful of people who are slightly different than you. And a small FYI humans are all genetically the same no matter what the outward appearance. So you are made up of the exact same stuff as a black person an asian person a native american. I just don't understand such hatred. Please feel free to explain it to me. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~dremarian/wsb/media/68398/site1046.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I worked a summer job at an amusement park during college.  Many people could not get onto the rides and buckle themselves in.  I have seen many angry people drive badly.<br>
<br>
Should I assume by this that all people are stupid and bad drivers?<br>
<br>
I believe that many people come here for a better life.  I lived in South Florida for many years and watched the Cuban community there change Miami.<br>
<br>
Now are there problems, particularly in California, with immigration policy?  Yes.<br>
<br>
I have met good and bad of all races, creeds and colors.  I have not understood some of the cultural things (still have a problem with the caste system).<br>
<br>
By the way, I don't buy the &quot;they do jobs white folks won't do&quot; arguement.  One of the jobs most often cited is farm worker.  I grew up in the Northeast and not too many Mexicans were doing farm work.  But agriculture was the number 2 industry in the state of New York (after Tourism).  Who was doing all that work?<br>

The bottom line that pisses me off so much, the root of my anger, is that everyone expects us whites to conform to them.  We need to pay slave reperations, shell out tons of tax dollars for illegal aliens, in state tuition at any college if you are an immigrant, maybe free community college if that law in california gets passed, affirmative action, black history month, we owe this we owe that, no job for my cousin in california because he doesn't speak spanish.  I am sick of the utter disrespect others have upon us.  Other races can be assholes all they want but I'm tired of them taking from me, constantly.  I couldn't care less if an immigrant finds a job to support his family if its on his own money, not mine.  I think it's great if rakeem finds a great job if he got the job because of his skills, not because of his race.  I feel like a lower class citizen.  Other races can have black only schools, get all kinds of money from the gov, talk shit all day long about the white race.  I guess what I am saying is if all the special social, economical and cultural treatment minorities get would be put to a stop then my racism would go away.  I honestly don't care what others do as long as it doesn't effect me.  Until then, it seems like someone who fits the negative stereotypes of minorities fucks up my day acting the way they do at least once a week. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kultarvaz>KultarVaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/03 4:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lol</span><hr size=1> The silly death dreams you guys come up with are kiddie like and very much expected.

  I remember how many magazines praised the soprano's when that show first came out.  Some of the characters would deal drugs, act rude, and even murder.  This was all great entertainment for the critics.  Everyone seemed to love it.  One episode they had a daughter bring home a black boyfriend to her house to meet the parents.  His father disaproved and all hell broke loose.  The same critics who once praised the show now condemned it.  It's perfectly ok to be a rapist, murderer, drug dealer, asshole etc. but GOD FORBID YOU ARE RACIST.  That is the only ONE thing liberals do not stand for.  Oh wait, if you are palastinian and hold racist views towards jews its ok, blacks who are racist against whites, no death threats for them either.  Only when whites are racist do others start shitting themselves about it.  <br>

I agree with you. It's fiction. Just because it displays crime, doesn't mean the makers condone it. In the same way you can display racism, without condoning it.<br>
<br>
You're right, minority groups often get away with racism and that is bullshit. That doesn't mean you have to blame all the minority groups for them.<br>
<br>
Racism (and generalising as a whole) means denying one's individuality. You can come up with countless of examples where minority groups are doing all kind of bad things, but that won't stop me from treating each <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>person</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as an individual.<br>

I've worked with alot of immigrants from Mexico and I always found them to be the hardest working people out of any of us.<br>
As a matter of fact I'm officially an immigrant from Venezuala.<br>
I'm caucasian but my father worked for Shell Oil in South America where I was born and we immigrated to the United States when I was 4 years old.  Does that make me a bad person also? Or is it ok because I'm white?<br>

I understand your frustrations with these things. I have them too. I think if you come to this country to live you should speak the language, and that the best person for the job should get it. But you know what, equal opportunity is there for a reason, the reason might not be as previlant as it used to be, but there are still people who would hire a white guy over a black guy with the same qualifacations just to ease their comfort level. It wasn't all that long ago when women were the ones demanding equal treatment. White males have been dominant over everyone else that's not a white male for so long we want to ensure some semblance of equality. So I accept that those laws need to stay one the books for now. Maybe someday we can get rid of them because they are no longer needed ,but you know what, they are still needed now. Your family were immigrants here too and unless they were English they didn't speak the language either. People want to keep thier culture and heritage alive. So they do things differently than you. You must learn patience and understanding. There are great things about every culture we could all learn from. Don't fight the differences, try to see it from their side. You are not a second class citizen, everyone in this country is a first rate citizen. This is a great country in so many ways, don't concentrate on the things that aggrivate you so much. Just understand that those things are there for a reason even if you don't see it. Racsism is wrong, coming from anyone. There are no absolutes in this world. Kultar you should just learn to hate the dickheads like the rest of us, and they come in all shapes colors and can be male or female. And please remember that there are people alive today who were forced to sit at the back of the bus and drink from the colored only fountain. Just because you are lucky enough to have something not affect you dosen't mean it isn't real.<br>
<br>
And Kultar is right about one thing, he never preached violence. So please don't wish it against him. Let's just all hope that he takes to heart the things some of us say and not pass his racist views to his children. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~dremarian/wsb/media/68398/site1046.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
