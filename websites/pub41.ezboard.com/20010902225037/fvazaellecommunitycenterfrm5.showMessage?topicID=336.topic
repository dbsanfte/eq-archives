<br>
<br>
Al'Kabor- the keeper of the artifact item that every wizard wants....<br>
<br>
Well he spawns there were about 12 wizards all of which were all trying to out roleplay one another to have hopes of haveing possession of this item that only one wizard on the server will receive and of these wizards 90 percent of them were hoping the wizard next to them would choke and mess up in some way.<br>
<br>
So EQ ont a competition ?<br>
<br>
Well if people trying to out do one another for something and that is not a competitive in your eyes go buy yourself a clue and realize it is. <br>

1) To some it is competition of them and their friends against the game. Those people would relent in that situation and try again later.<br>
<br>
2) To others, it is also a competition with other people playing the game, which the example is a good illustration of.<br>
<br>
So to some, EQ holds the competitive spirit of constantly trying to screw other people over in order to gain the next extra bit of power as soon as possible. To others it does not. Perception is reality.<br>

You have no right to be saying this shit, you are or have been as much of a loser powergamer as anyone else. Follow the link on her signature, she's showing off her lifelessness in Diablo 2. <br>

Veraphie spent many days on all the time, and likely will again on some other game. In fact, I bet your /played time is still higher than a lot of people in IV.<br>
<br>
Let's take it a step further, shall we? I bet the average well adjusted member of north american society would look down on 90% of the people who post on this board for how much time they play this game. <br>
<br>
It's not just IV that takes this game too seriously from a RL perspective, I would say that the average SF, TE, CC, PO, etc players could find RL people shaking their heads at them for playing as much as they do.<br>
<br>
So drop the whole &quot;IV are losers because they play so much and take the game so seriously&quot; thing Vera, there are people who are looking down at you for precisely the same thing.<br>

Yeah, in another fight, a boxer may have his ear bitten off.  When I played qwtf, the competition was intense.  Sometimes the matches had no trash talking and everyone said good game at the end, and other times trash talking in matches turned into 2 months of messageboard flaming and life long enemies.  The latter was actually pretty fun actually, a game of its own.  <br>
<br>
It's all part of the game, and part of the nature of competition.  You can have two people compete and have a clean match, and the next day those two people can have a dispute.<br>
<br>
Whether someone wants to compete in EQ is up to them, but the high end game involves competition by virtue of the fact that others want to/will compete.  Sometimes it will be nice and happy, others, you'll come out with your nose bloody.  <br>

I don't think they intentionally introduce elements that promote conflict between players. I think they make mistakes and neglect to correct them, or are very slow to do so.<br>
<br>
Every communication that I've seen coming from VI that addresses interplayer conflict directly or indirectly seems to indicate the opposite of what you believe.<br>
<br>
The problem is the same as it's been from day one. There's not enough varied content for the world-server player loads. It's too crowded. It has been since the beginning. Because of this, players across all servers adopted an &quot;understood&quot; set of guidelines that were based on the idea of first come, first served and don't &quot;screw&quot; with other players. Even though they are fuzzy and difficult to enforce, the PNP's are a restatement of this idea from the company itself. Every type of behavior that goes against this idea is met with resistance and resentment by the player community. It doesn't surprise me that there is a lot of anti-IV sentiment here. Or hard feelings toward any guild who doesn't hold to that guideline. People have been used to playing a game for 2 years that is, for the most part, a cooperation with other players.<br>
<br>
Also, the game is maturing. It's getting old and &quot;tired.&quot; Players like you and those who feel the same as you are trying to squeeze &quot;new&quot; gameplay out of a system that wasn't designed to support that style of competition. Competing with the environment isn't as fun as it used to be. So you are forcing the etiquitte to change to suit you. Not the other way around. Whether that is good or bad is a topic for another discussion, but I do think it is NOT what the designers intended.<br>
<br>
I also believe that people who share your idea of a directly competitive EQ are in the minority. What that style of play means is, one group of people will have fun at the expense of everyone else. The game isn't intended to be like that, unless the designers are lying. That's the same premise that exists in PvP games. For one person to &quot;win&quot; another has to &quot;lose.&quot; VI from the beginning has touted the idea that EQ wasn't designed on this premise. They even brag about it.<br>
<br>
VI is already making changes in content - expanding it in places - to counter this attitude. Hoskar dropping green scales is an example. The &quot;dummy&quot; epic quest mobs that are spawned are another.<br>
<br>
The new content in SoL will help the problem some. Just like Kunark and Velious &quot;fixed&quot; it temporarily. However, once they are done adding content, I wouldn't be surprised if they introduced a new policy or expanded PNP to counter this type of behavior in reguards to raid mobs.<br>
<br>
Btw, this isn't intended as a flame or anything. Game design is a sort of hobby of mine and these type of discussions are interesting to me. <p><B>-Jullian</B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 547<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/6/01 6:10:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everquest not competitive?</span><hr size=1> Id agree that its not intentional, I dont ascribe evil motives to them.  I still dont think it is good game design tho.<br>
<br>
It could just be that these sort of games just have a limited half life before the concentration of people at the same level gets too high for it to be fun for very many people.  Not sure how to solve this, it would seem like even slower level advancement would be the best way but you see how bad people bitch about that already.  Right now you have a ton of content basicly wasted bc it takes about no time to outlevel it, even naked (untwinked) you can outlevel like 50% of the zones in a few days played.  So basicly like 50% of thier effort put into design is only useful to the player for like 4% of thier play time.  they should either funnel the content so that the amount of zones you can use gets bigger not smaller as you level, or else make the levels take longer so you can use the lower level zones longer.  They are starting to work on this but upgrading old zones and velious was a huge help but I still dont really think its enough, as evidenced by all this head butting even on a relatively new server.  Putting abnormally good loot on some of the lower on the learning curve mobs doesnt help. <p>Procax

I do not believe Verant could have ignored lessons from Kunark and the original game and not known how people would react to a mob like Lodizal, with the items that he has and the difficultly level involved.  It's too obvious, a 'duh' issue.  Of course he would be a point of conflict.<br>
<br>
When they buffed Cazic and put such nice items on him, they had to know that bigger guilds would walk over their grandmothers to get him.  They know the realities of the game enough to know that this would happen.  How can they not?<br>
<br>
I admit, Verant is clueless in some aspects of the game, but in terms of how the playerbase reacts to mobs like Cazic and Lodizal?  I can't believe that they're that clueless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 587<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/7/01 11:22:21 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everquest not competitive?</span><hr size=1> Or maybe Verant hoped that, you know, a community would evolve with player developed philosophy's on what is right and acceptable.  A virtual conscience, as it were.<br>

EQ is a pretty big skinner box, you get to see how people really act when they dont' fear physical retribution.<br>
<br>
Sadly, what you see is 90% childish me me me bullshit but the 10% that isn't makes it worth it. <p>Herder
