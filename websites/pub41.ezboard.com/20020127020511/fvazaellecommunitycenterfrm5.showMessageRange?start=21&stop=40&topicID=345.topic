The reason im unguilded at lev 51 is that im very selective...<br>
And the fact that many guilds arent really attracted by sk, something like &quot;Oh sk? Uhm yeah let me think about that, ill let you know...&quot;<br>
I will never beg to enter a guild, the guild must be happy to have me in like i am happy to be part of it.<br>
I dont want to see me used like a secondary tank to put in a corner, conveniently forgot when it comes by loot rights, every other class epic that jumps mine cause sk epic is tough.... BUT strangely seeked out when they need a Summon corpse, a corpse run (unnerfed circlet owns) or someone to taunt off a mob better than every existing class and save casters ass... and after that, immediately forgot again, often without even a thank....<br>
Yeah, Im very selective. And i dont like half of the guilds on Vazaelle, so i refused many guildinvite. But Ashur is this way, i roleplay my char, and im not kissing anyone ass. Innoruuk wont allow me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uhasuuuu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hasuuuu</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.vazaelle.dk/menybild.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 4:30:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> I have some spare time at work but this is insane~<br>

<br>
The main reason I join a guild is because that's where my friends are, the guild does things with are challenging and fun, and so I can find people to group with.  Though I think it's fair to say I have a lot of friends who (when I'm not AWOL in foreign countries) I can group with, getting high-level pick-ups as a hybrid is not easy, even when you have a good rep.  Getting on high-levels raids as other than rot protection is damn near impossible unless you call on friends (Thanks IV, Slivers, Endless, SF) for a slot to come along, regardless of shots at loot (Thanks crappy hybrid-only drops =p).<br>
<br>
The reason I've been without a guild for so long (it took me as long to get from 50 to 56 and from 1 to 50) is because I hate it when guilds get overly political, when people go on powertrips or when a guild becomes more about uberness (at large or of certain players) than having fun as a group of friends.  I lose friends when I fall out with a guild and frankly friends are more important than guilds.  Hopefully I'll find a good home when I come back.  Time will tell I suppose. <p><p><center><img src="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rabiega/sigs/april.jpg"><br><i>Sslanis Soulforge<br>It's not whose habitat it is, it's how hard you hit it</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/useraphis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seraphis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 8:36:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sowned.com/Board/kerosig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> Hmmm..

Herder(and others I suppose), I just wanted to ask you, how do you play the high level game?.. with no guild that is. Do you join other guilds on raids? or just not raid at all? (Out of curiousity) <br>

<br>
I do /who all lfg 50 60...see if anyone needs a group and plan a group and get people together if I see some people I know or a good group waiting to happen.<br>
<br>
The high end game bores me to tears.  I am not going to be a much better enchanter because I have an extra 5ac or 20 mana.  Loot doesn't interest me for myself, I like hanging with people who interest me.<br>
<br>
Yes, I raid with other guilds if they ask me to.  Sometimes I log on and just chat or make jewelry in newbie zones for newbies.  Sometimes I log in an alt and put a group together in the low levels which is still pretty fun.<br>
<br>
As far as attacking guilds, nothing I have said hasn't been true about one guild or other at some time.  You know, I know and others have voiced pretty much the same opinion, just not so direct as I have.<br>
<br>
People join guilds because they want to do the high end raids.  People ultimately want the high end raids so they can get loot.  Sure, raids can be fun with the right group of people and I don't attribute all bad things to all guilds.<br>
<br>
The original question was why I wasn't in a guild.  I get asked that question from newbies and upper levels at least 3 or 4 times a session when I play herder.  I thought this would be an appropriate forum to answer.<br>

Exactly wtf is that supposed to mean?  Is that some veiled threat that I may be blacklisted?  Egads.<br>
<br>
Blacklist me, I don't give a shit.  EQ is a game, one that is rapidly losing my interest.  5 years from now nobody is going to care what guild or what loot you had in EQ.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty good at what I do in EQ.  I like to think that people like grouping with me not only for my knowledge of the game but the abilities that I bring to my class.  I don't gripe when I die and I don't belittle others.  I am very fair with loot and definitely prefer seeing underequipped people get better gear.<br>
<br>
I have helped guilds on raids without asking for loot or even compensation for the peridots I used on their tanks during uber mob fights.<br>
<br>
So by all means, add me to your blacklist, because that will be your loss and no sweat off my back. <p>Herder

<br>
Anyway.. If you dont enjoy raiding I guess it doesn't make much sense to be in a guild in the first place (Which is probably why your not =P ).<br>
<br>
I however, feel raiding is a major part of the game.. if not the entire game for me atm. (I haven't leveled in a while, I come on to raid =P ). I know this isn't a &quot;why are you guilded&quot; thread, but with so many people saying why they're not.. I thought it far to explain why some are. <br>
<br>
Another thing is.. that extra 5ac or whatever helps you kill a bigger mob next time.. guilds raid to get better equipment so they can kill bigger mobs.. thats the way the game was designed.  Just an observation.<br>
<br>
Your missing out on a big chunk of this game you pay 10 bucks a month for if you dont get the chance to raid. Its your choice though, and obviously your enjoying the game with out it.  <p><center><img src="http://www.sowned.com/Board/kerosig2.jpg" width="200" height="60"></center><br><center><a href="http://www.sowned.com">www.sowned.com</a></center><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/useraphis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seraphis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 9:42:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sowned.com/Board/kerosig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> I was just throwing in a warning  'cause an argument is being created here and is rapidly getting out of control.. <br>

I didn't wanna discuss which Loot Rules are good or stuff like that, I just wanted to know why there are so many Guildless ppl around (yeah I don't wear a Tag either atm and I don't like that). Just wanted to see if other Guildless ppl seek the same kind of Guild and maybe even form one or maybe get some help to find the right one for me!<br>
<br>
It REALLY SUCKS seeing that several here seem to take Herders personal opinion as offense against their own Guilds or whatever.<br>
<br>
On the other side it's pretty nice to see that ppl actually think it's worth to post a answer on my topic but I'd enjoy them more if Guildies wouldn't post so much here and just leave a note here and start another topic cause this one will get too huge to read if this continues... If you wanna discuss the loot rules than make a Topic about it. Maybe you'll realize that it depends on the goals of the guild which rules are best, for IV for example their loot rules are good since they make their prime Tank most effective. For Guilds that strive for Loot for all such Rules would suck of course. Don't wanna go further or I'll have to make a new Topic, hehe...<br>
<br>

To choose.. or not to choose. That is the question <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I am guildless atm, largely because I am enjoying my time running around completing quests (mine and for friends).<br>
Gathering pelts in lowbie zones, for tailoring. <br>
Selling of items in EC, to afford to increase tailoring to 190 atm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have rather enjoyed meeting new people in these lowbie zones, found people whom truly NEED the items that i've given away. <br>
I've played since Aug of 99, been part of small guilds and large guilds alike.. I find the &quot;hurry.....wait&quot; syndrome pretty tiring.<br>
<br>
I tend to agree with you on the &quot;my dick is harder....longer... hairier... etc...&quot; I often imagine these same boys doing this in the back room at Mickey Dee's , kinda makes you not want to sit in that drive thru line while your kids scream for Happy Meals! <p>~Sojurne~<BR>

<br>
  Its nice to go on raids at times, but sometimes you just want to work on quest, work on trades,BS with friends or help newbies and not go on raids.<br>
<br>
 I'm not saying its not impossible to do theese things in a guild, but lets suppose you had a bad day at work and want to just come home and work on some trade, you see guild chat and they just wiped out 2 times in a row and you can tell there short on (insert your class here), now do you go help them or do what you really want or quietly log off ?<br>

Table for one! Bitter?<br>
<br>
It does seem Herder was sleighted in past times, for that I heartily apologize on behalf of all those who have wronged you in the past. It seems your slavery would give you such a jaded view of the EQ world. Comrade. Are all guilds socialist? No. Are some guilds socialist...ARE YOU NEW?! Of course there are! Nobody tied you to a chair and said you had to swallow it either.  <br>
<br>
First thing I'm going to say before I go any further, this is sounding like a discussion that belongs in Rants and Flames. There is a simple question asked by the original poster on why you are not in a guild, and if you are searching for a guild, what would those reasons be. This wasn't a thesis on how guilds can become corrupted, nor how virtuous a guild should be.<br>
<br>
What pretty much everybody who replied to this thread so far has said, is true in some case. I believe Eeepers misread some of what Herder was saying, but out of that, made some great points himself. First of all, there is no one way to run a guild, nor is every guild going to be black and corrupted as Herder makes it out to be, nor are they going to be the Utopia that Eeepers makes it out to be. They usually lie somewhere in between, as most things in life. <br>
<br>
This is *my* opinion of what a guild *is*, not what a guild should be, as who am I to say what it should be? At the most rudementary fashion, a guild is simply words in a bracket over your head and another chat channel in your chat box. Both of those things give you something in common. For some guilds, it goes deeper than that, and for every individual who joins a guild and in their own way. Some join guilds for friendships, some join guilds in hopes of doing the funner (depends on what you think is fun) raids at high levels, some are in it for loot, some are in it just to leg up in levels until they can join higher level guilds. Who's to say one is better than the other? We all have our personal values, and all pay $10/month for our own reasons. In that regard, everybody is free to make their own decisions. However, I believe that free decision extends to the point of, do I want to &quot;work&quot; for guildA to obtain what I want out of the guild, or not be a part of that guild? In my opinion, I look at it as: Do I opt to work to earn money and have taxes taken out, or not work and not have to worry about taxes? If I choose to join the workforce, then I am agreeing to the laws set forth regarding working. Or, I have the free will to just not work. I don't, however, have the option to make money and skip taxes. Dunno if that's an apt analogy, but best I could think of at the moment, hehe.<br>
<br>
I can empathize with some of your views Herder. Loot issues, will always be loot issues, hehe. But if you don't care about loot, why you bringing it up? =) I think everybody understands there are some greedy bastages out there taking advantage of guilds for their own profit. From our point of view, they're taking advantage of the system, yeah, of course it sucks. How come one person gets awarded a Resplendent Robe, then sells the FBCR when you're wearing Crystalline Robes? Yeah, it sucks, but if you don't care about loot, then why does it matter to you? Because of the moral of it? Normally, and I would say normally, guilds that use an award loot system do enforce a hand me down rule as well, to effectively &quot;double&quot; loot awards, two people gain in power instead of one. Doesn't always happen that way. Bottom line, no loot system is going to be flaw free, you take good and the bad.<br>
<br>
In an up and coming guild struggling for recruitment, the valued classes for most raids are Clerics, Enchanters, Warriors, Wizards. It's normal that in order for most raids to be a success, you're gonna be called on a lot as an Enchanter to make things work. If you didn't want to attend raids, your options were simple, enforce your right to say 'No', de-guild, or quit your Enchanter for a non-essential class. Whatever you do, you have the option to do any of those three, without being bitter about it. I guarantee you, whatever stress a guild may have caused you because you were an Enchanter is not nearly the amount of stress a guild causes because you are a guild leader =P And don't get all bent out of shape about guild leaders, there are good ones and there are bad ones, you choose to follow some, you choose to not follow others. The choice is, and always was, yours.<br>
<br>
Every guild has an agenda, whatever that agenda may be, otherwise there would be no reason to have the guild. If the guild's agenda is to have fun with friends, tha's an agenda. If the guild's agenda is to be the best tradeskill masters on the server, then tha's an agenda. If the guild strives to conquer every uber mob in the game, tha's an agenda. And every single one of those guilds can be respected for their own values. And every guild leader's job is to assure that the guild is on track to meeting that agenda. You should always know the priorities of the guild, and what obligations you would have to your guild before you join it. Simple. If you don't want to help your guild, why are you in it?<br>
<br>
If you're in a guild that strives for the high end game, as a Cleric/Enchanter, you are going to be called upon constantly to come through for your guild to advance their agenda. If you don't deliver, you are letting your guild mates down. Yeah, kinda sucks, huh? Especially when the loot that is obtained can't even be used by those two classes. Do you feel used? Depends on how you look at it. Guilds like to operate under the function of, 'Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours' for a one on one level. And the all glorious, 'Making him/her stronger makes the guild stronger as a whole' on a full guild scale. What it really comes down to is, does your view of a guild mirror/match those of the guild you are currently in? If it isn't, then why are you in the guild?<br>
<br>
Nobody forces people to be part of guilds, but as long as you *are* in that guild, you follow the rules and charter of that guild. It's fairly straight forward. If you don't like the way things are going, deguild and find one that may better suit you, or if your standards are too high, then you may stay unguilded for the length of your EQ life. Some people are willing to realize that not all guilds are perfect and one is much like the other. They are usually willing to compromise(sp?) a bit to gain a better enjoyment of the game. If you are of the attitude that all wo/men stand alone, then you will prolly not fit into many if any guilds at all. <br>
<br>
In a game where everybody says they have the right to do what they want, they sure do whine about others doing what they want. Keep ya head up, do what you gotta do, and finally, if it feels good, keep doing it. <br>

<br>
Where in my original reply did you see a rant?  Any rant on my part was a reply to someone else defending their guild, not in my view of what a guild should be.<br>
<br>
Loot is only important as to how much you are appreciated and the fact that others aren't abusing your good nature/generosity, it really allows you to see who these people are when an uber item drops and the /tells start rolling in.<br>
<br>
BTW Skeenk, in case you haven't noticed, I *am* unguilded, so I think it is sort of redundant of you to enlighten me on my options.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your sophomoric observations though.<br>

<br>
I'm not attacking you. Did my posting in any way belittle you, or sleight you on your intelligence in any way? And my points on what a guild is, is for those who are still unguilded at 46 and may not be clear as to what guilds are or how they are run.<br>
<br>
Loot = importance? I should think to somebody like you, a hearty pat on the back and an 'I luff j00 man' would be just as appreciated as a Resplendent Robe...right?<br>
<br>
You rightfully defended yourself regarding Eeepers. Yes he misread your comments, but did you have to put so much acid in your comments?<br>
<br>
The only reasons I kept emphasizing that you had, at any time to deguild yourself from past guilds, is because you seemed quite unhappy with them seeing those examples you used being done. Were you trying to be a silent martyr? Save everybody a toothache and just deguild and get it over with. Then don't sit and lament on how you were wronged til the end of your days, dwelling on how things aren't right and become bitter and jaded. Life's too short man. <br>
<br>
While I don't know you, I've read many of your posts over time and it seems to just get more and more defensive and hateful in general. All I offered was my opinion and version and offered what I could to the discussion. Your retorts did not go unnoticed, but I feel they were uncalled for. While I agree with your points and examples, I don't agree with the way they were expressed is all. Flame me down for it, it will only prove my point. <p><b>Skeenk Da'Steenka<BR>
