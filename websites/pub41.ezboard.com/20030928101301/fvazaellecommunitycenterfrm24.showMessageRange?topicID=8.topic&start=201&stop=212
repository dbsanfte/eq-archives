<br>
<br>
"Im a level 60 warrior named Dunken from the Nameless, i have a 60 dwarf warrior, 60 human Shadow knight, and 44 gnome wizard. I have an emmense amount of EQ knowledge because i was in the guild Legacy of Steel and learned much there. I was removed from LoS after being there 6 months (for going afk to much if you care to know) and dont find a need for EQ anymore so i rarley play.<br>
<br>
i have a fair ammount of good friends on this server, so i just read here and about whats going on when im bored. i really dont play on any server anymore so i dont see why it would matter where i post "<br>
<br>
I personally got that he has a few characters, has been in an ub3r guild, and has, by his own definition "emmense knowledge"...he comes to read (and post) here because he has friends and has been commenting on how few it takes to do XX so is belittling what should have been a great job done by PO.<br>
<br>
Regardless of how its accomplished.<br>
<br>
Is Cazic Dead?  yep....Did it take like 60 people to do it?  yep...YOU ZERGED HIM!!! That doesn't count!!  Is he dead?  yep...Then THAT is all that counts.<br>
<br>
Grats PO.  Good job.<br>

It's you who is applying the condescending tone to it, not him.  Someone asked who he was, he responded. <br>
<br>
Like I said before, Cure's post was less about what PO did and more about the condition of EQ that allowed that to happen.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, but that's my interpretation.<br>
<br>
Whether it's bad or not is subjective, but many do not like that a mob like cazic can simply be swarmed now, with no real strategy.<br>
<br>
The above statement is not a knock at PO.  It's a knock at the game.  I personally think that PO has the ability to do cazic without a 65 player bind rush.  <br>
<br>
As for the PO bashing... The main issue that people have against PO is not that they zerged Cazic, it's that they killed him in a pretty non-talented way, and yet still feel the need to rub people's faces in it like it's a massive accomplishment. ..but even that stems from long running personal issues, shrug.<br>

<br>
and i only posted i have a 60war,60sk,44wiz because Hasuuuu asked. He even said in an earlier post for me to stop posting until i was on the Legacy of Steel roster cause until then i was a worthless gimp or something. i found it funny cause i was in LoS (on the roster too!!) for a long time.<br>

but after that in a different post Hasuuuu asked me who i was, so i posted who i was, no i wasent bragging, i even stated in the first paragraph of my post that id post who i was since Hasuuuu asked.<br>
<br>
and i actually dont re-call telling any one what to do fiddle, maybe when i was being sarcastic or when people where asking for suggestions/help. but i just state my opinions, and thats just about it.<br>

"True uber tactics for him? No, can't call them uber really.  <br>
 They weren't complicated, but there are tactics.<br>
<br>
 Think for a second.<br>
<br>
 When IV was less well equipped than your guild currently is,  <br>
 we could kill Cazic with fewer people without bind rushing.<br>
<br>
 Now, by saying that I'm not trying to rub it in and say that <br>
 we were better than you. That may be true, but it's not the <br>
 point I'm making."<br>
<br>
 - True.  The point you were making was not to come across sounding conceited or condescending, too bad neither did.<br>
And rather than NOT seem that way, it did.  Which is why people started to take offense.<br>
<br>
Dunken:<br>
<br>
Dunken:<br>
"i've killed cazic with 29 people....<br>
<br>
 now is that just luck, or did we have some neato uber <br>
 tactics that made it possible?"<br>
...<br>
"I'm sorry to inform you that I don't even play EQ anymore <br>
 Fiddle. I haven't even ranted here in months, yet alone <br>
 posted on but a very few times. if you were going to flame <br>
 me you could of at least made it interesting with some actual <br>
 insults instead of some simple-minded story about some guy <br>
 you don't have the slightest clue about"<br>
<br>
I do apoligise.  Next time my story will be about a self-obsessesed individual that still thinks they should have an opinion about people and folks that they have never met or interacted with in the EQ venue,  when, by their own admission, they have removed themselves from the equation.<br>
<br>
And of course who can forget Menexia's first contribution to the topic:<br>
<br>
"Hi, my name is baldrik and i like my head up lizard's asses."<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
"Baldrik , sir you are to elite for me. Wood elfs are thx you like lizards. Its just not right "<br>
<br>
Third:<br>
"Go buy yourself a clue. Just because someone can play EQ <br>
 for 10 hours a day doesnt mean anything.<br>
<br>
"You can still go to school for 7 hours, play eq for 10 hours <br>
 and still have 7 hours to sleep"<br>
<br>
If you live that line above and you think that you are not a maladjusted social reject, really you do need some professional help.  That goes way beyond the lines of addictive behaviour.<br>
<br>
This game does not make better people.  The fact that you may or may have not been in every zone and think its ok to obsess for 10 hours a day over it, is indicative of your real life.<br>
<br>
EQ is escapist in nature.   A friend of mine in a troubled marriage uses it to escape his homelife.  Since you are still in school and I presume not married, since you play 10 hours a day and that's ok, and since most of your comments are negative from the starting block.  I imagine you to be a socially mal adjusted person with little to no social life or school life.  Activities before and after school, which allow us to make future bonds, friendships and social skills would be almost non-existent in you, and you are aware of this fact because when reminded of it, you lash out.  Parties are non-existant for you, socials, get togethers etc. etc.  all do not happen to you, because in the teen world there is little or no patience for people that do not "hold their own", and by this I mean the requisite time and effort it takes to be a part of a 50/50 friendship/relationship.  Your schoolwork is probably less than what it was before you started dedicating 10 hours a day to EQ, though you would probably lie and lash out to say otherwise.  Everyone knows that you can not JUST go to school and succeed.  There is homework, study, research, etc. etc.  And these things do not fall within the parameters of the school day, but are a necessary part of school.  There are people that can 'coast' through school, I did that in the beginning, but in the end I actually had to put some effort in, and it was almost too late when I did.  Almost.<br>
<br>
You also can't hold down a part time job to learn the responsibilities that an adult life will need to have, not and still play 10 hours a day and feel its 'normal'.  Your needs are currently provided for you, and you have little to do other than sit in your room on your computer and feel as if you are accomplishing something that admittedly takes a great deal of time, but also admittedly takes very litle skill once the rules are learned.  It is not chess....it's tac-tac-toe.  You have mastered it...<br>
<br>
But then so has a carnival chicken in a sideshow....<br>
<br>
<br>
(Btw..you commented on my real life, I DO work in the fast food industry.  I am one of the software engineers behind the KFC and Taco Bell main accounting system that handles all of North America.  I am about as close to serving folks food behind a counter, as you are to getting laid this weekend.  *cheers*)<br>
