prybotok, or whatever your name is, you have got to be one of the bigest idiots i have ever met over the internet.  Enron didn't cause california to go into a 28 billion dollar deficit.  You just provided an example of idiot logic.  Enron wasn't just isolated to calofirna.  Yet, calforina is having the biggest problem with spending at a state level now.  If enron was part of the cause, then every state would have shown a big increase in their deficits.  Besides, enron doesn't have anything to do with spending at a state level.  He used state money to fill the pockets of the special intrest groups that supported him.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1745<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/03 5:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOL</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Doesn't sound that hypocriticial to me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Both the US and California went from substantial surpluses to substantial deficits.  Seems hypocritical to me that you exonorate Gray Davis from all blame for California while you lay the blame for the US on Bush.<br>
<br>
I guess it's just because Bush is republican and you don't like republicans.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, I do think that the primary reasons that both California and the US went from surplus to deficit are decreases in tax revenue due to an economic downturn.<br>

If they want to have a system where the whim of the people decides who is in office then either have it so if you recall the govenor then the Lt Gov. takes over immediately or just leave one person in office for as long as no one recalls thems and then have an election.<br>
<br>
And while I have no love for republicans, I have no particular love for democrats either. Davis is a buffoon but I voted for him because at least he wasn't a crook like Simon. It was a tough best of 2 evils kind of election.<br>
<br>
As for blaming Bush and not blaming Davis: concerning the Federal deficit it is easy to see why Bush is to blame, tax refunds + war spending = bigger deficit. In California there isn't an obvious and easy connection to Davis. TYhe obvious and easy connections are to astronomically lower tax revenues due to the collapse of Silicon Valley and the inability to raise property taxes due to Prop 13. I am no poli sci expert so Davis may have had a hand in it but his connection is not clear like Bush's is. It has nothing to do with who belongs to what political party.<br>

I disagree with your view on recalls though.  I think that in a democracy it is best to give the people a choice.  They understand the cost, and they will decide if it is worth spending the money to oust Davis.<br>

According to an analysis I read in the Washington Post, a full 20% of the state's tax revenue came from a handful of dot-com millionaires in Silicon Valley.<br>
<br>
Analysts had always said that the dot-com boom would not be very long lasting, yet government spending in California increased, with none of the money being put away in &quot;rainy day funds.&quot;  When Republican lawmakers suggested cutting spending, they were denied.  Democrats suggested raising taxes, and Davis raised taxes several times while in office.  Upon further study of the programs that the Republicans wanted to cut, I learned that they were such things as artificial limbs for amputees and burying deceased adopted children.  These were the (unnecessary) things that his party refused to cut and instead chose to try and raise taxes more.<br>

I say, given his short-sightedness and proposed tax-hike solutions, I don't think recalling him is a bad idea. <p>Irrylath N'Quy<br>

However, his tax increases had a dampening effect on the economy of California.  On top of that, he could have shown some fiscal restraint.  Instead, he allowed spending increases which were not sustainable.  Everyone knew the dotcom boom was a bubble.  If he didn't, he should have, it's gross incompetence not to have known.<br>
<br>
The point is he should have looked at the money that came in as part of the boom as a windfall, not a permanent increase in annual revenue that could be allocated to create more government programs.<br>
<br>
Sure revenues have gone down from the dotcom period, but California would be fine if spending hadn't gone up so much during that period.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Empirical studies of tax cuts that happened during the twenties and sixties buttressed the supply-side position. Prodded by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, three major tax cuts reduced the top marginal tax rate from 73 percent in 1921 to 25 percent in 1926. In addition, the tax cuts eliminated or virtually eliminated the personal income tax liability of low-income recipients. The results were quite impressive. The economy grew rapidly from 1921 through 1926. After the rates were lowered, the real tax revenue (in 1929 dollars) collected from taxpayers with incomes above $50,000 rose from $305.1 million in 1921 to $498.1 million in 1926, an increase of 63 percent. In contrast, the real tax liability of those with less than $50,000 of income declined by 45 percent. Thus, as the tax rates were cut, the revenues collected from high-income taxpayers rose, while those collected from lower-income taxpayers declined. The tax cuts of the twenties substantially increased the percent of taxes paid by the wealthy. <br>
<br>
The results of the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts of the midsixties were similar. Between 1963 and 1965, tax rates were reduced by approximately 25 percent. The top marginal tax rate was cut from 91 percent to 70 percent. Simultaneously, the bottom rate was reduced from 20 percent to 14 percent. For most taxpayers the lower rates reduced tax revenues. In real 1963 dollars the tax revenues collected from the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers fell from $31.0 billion in 1963 to $29.6 billion in 1965, a 4.5 percent reduction. In contrast, the real tax revenues collected from the top 5 percent of taxpayers rose from $17.2 billion in 1963 to $18.5 billion in 1965, a 7.6 percent increase. As in the case of the tax cuts of the twenties, the rate reductions of the sixties reduced the tax revenue collected from low-income taxpayers while increasing the revenues collected from high-income taxpayers. <br>
<br>
Major tax legislation passed in 1981 and 1986 reduced the top U.S. federal income tax rate from 70 percent to approximately 33 percent. The performance of the U.S. economy during the eighties was impressive. The growth rate of real GNP accelerated from the sluggish rates of the seventies. U.S. economic growth exceeded that of all other major industrial nations except Japan. <br>
<br>
The critics of the eighties tax policy argue that the top rate reductions were a bonanza for the rich. The taxable income in the upper tax brackets did increase sharply during the eighties. But the taxes collected in these brackets also rose sharply. Measured in 1982-84 dollars, the income tax revenue collected from the top 10 percent of earners rose from $150.6 billion in 1981 to $199.8 billion in 1988, an increase of 32.7 percent. The percentage increases in the real tax revenue collected from the top 1 and top 5 percent of taxpayers were even larger. In contrast, the real tax liability of other taxpayers (the bottom 90 percent) declined from $161.8 billion to $149.1 billion, a reduction of 7.8 percent. These findings confirm what the supply-siders predicted: the lower rates, by increasing the tax base substantially in the upper tax brackets, caused high-income taxpayers to pay more taxes. In effect, the lower rates soaked the rich. <br>
<br>
Probably the most detailed study of the tax changes in the eighties was conducted by Lawrence Lindsey of Harvard University. Lindsey used a computer simulation model to estimate the impact of the eighties' tax-rate changes on the various components of income. He found that after the tax rates were lowered, the wages and salaries of high-income taxpayers were approximately 30 percent larger than projected. Similarly, after the rate cuts capital gains were approximately 100 percent higher than projected, and high-income taxpayers' business income was a whopping 200 percent higher than expected. Lindsey concluded that the main supply-side effects resulted from (a) people paying themselves more in the form of money income rather than fringe benefits and amenities, (b) increases in business activity, and (c) a reduction in tax shelter activities. His findings undercut the position of those supply-side critics who had assumed that substantial supply-side effects were dependent on a large increase in labor supply. <br>

<br>
The post by Mossiah fails because it lists changes in gross tax revenues versus some more reliable relative measure. Absolute measures can never tell the story of whether expected revenues have adjusted and reached expected values that justify causal claims such as those made by supplysiders. <br>
<br>
For example, I can claim that holding the line on state Tax increases in Texas have resulted in increased tax revenues for the School district in which I am employed. I could point to &quot;empirical evidence&quot; such that the state funded portion of the school district budget went up 18 million dollars( which it in fact has). So, has holding the line on taxes increased revenues? <br>
<br>
Yes in absolute terms. Definitively NO if we take the slightest bit of energy and look further into how agencies, bureaus, programs, school districts, etc are funded. If we note that four NEW schools were opened in the district this year we note that due to the SIGNIFICANT increase in student population that per last year's expenditure\state funding level per student, revenues to keep pace would had to go up three times what they did in absolute terms in order to just STAY the SAME on a relative scale. <br>
<br>
But I understand Ammelen that your political agenda is to defund government wherever it exist and I will grant that reliance on absolute measures is a good tact to assume given that pursuit. <br>
<br>
Honestly, speaking from a purely academic vantage point, I would argue that the impact of gov't spending\taxation on overall prosperity (GNP) is overrated. These tax policy issues have little to do with overall economic welfare or GNP and much MORE to do with distribution of wealth issues. However, the foregoing political agenda likes to frame tax policy as a GNP issue or one having to do with overall prosperity. <br>
<br>
I think much more compelling is the impact of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Yet even there, along with Milton Friedman's meandering about &quot;only money matters&quot; we had to swallow a fair dose of politicalization of economic policy that had more to do with distribution issues than with prosperity. <br>
<br>
There is certainly no one &quot;right&quot; school of economics. Otherwise we could just shut down every school of economics in the country and just place all the &quot;edicts of economic righteousness&quot; in a textbook and be done with the business of teaching the next generation of economist and political leaders how to weigh the very contentious issues that come up with this type of debate. <br>
<br>
John Maynard Keyes said something that shines some wisdom on the dangers of buying into the politicized vagueries of the favored &quot;economic theory of the day&quot; :<br>

<br>
The quintessential dynamic at work is no different than it was for Henry Ford around the turn of the century where he determined that advances in productivity in producing automobiles allowed him to produce at a lower cost and pay a much higher nominal wage than his competition. In fact, many in his industry at that time thought he would be bankrupt within 5 years because they subscribed to a school of business\economic not that far outta sync with what I hear from supplysiders these days. <br>
<br>
Obviously, and what any first MBA student will tell you, is that such dour forecast did not materialize and Ford dominated the auto industry until the depression when GM took over for reasons not related to the point at hand. <br>
<br>
The point to be noted here is simply that both sides of the economic equation need to be balanced. You cannot construct prosperity by simply isolating your policy on supplyside inputs. Demand side issues are every bit as important. Henry Ford took the lead in his day and saw the value of finding a way to produce for less and pay his workers more so that they could become consumers of his product. <br>
<br>
Who will be the person in this day and age who will come forward and do the same? I don't know, but Arthur Laffer, Ronald Reagan, and the subsequent ilk of the supplyside mantra are going down an entirely wrongheaded path. <br>
<br>
These individuals of the political right are nothing more than handmaidens of the ultra rich designated to pursue a political policy carefully cloaked in sheep's costume of a &quot;new economic theory of prosperity&quot; of defunding Government at all levels irregardless of what the ballot box has said in support of some very successful governmental programs. These people do not trust the majority. For that reason their antidemocratic butts need to be thrown out.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=626910" target="top">Chopstiks Kungfoey</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1795<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/15/03 12:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: supply side economics</span><hr size=1> There is a very strong inverse correlation between growth and tax rates.  It's not arguable, it's math.  Your argument that technology increases productivity is certainly true, but that is monotonic.  Our technology continues to improve, yet we don't always experience the same growth, and we do experience recessions.  Mathematically, growth is tied to a large extent to tax rates.<br>
<br>
It's quite simple logic really.  People work harder when they keep more of their money, increasing total productivity, and increasing the tax base.  Thus it increases revenues and fuels the economy.  This is beyond obvious to me.<br>
<br>
Most liberals will even acknowledge that cutting taxes causes economic growth, they simply argue that the revenue loss incurred by cutting rates does not balance the revenue gain from the increased tax base, thus the government's total net revenues go down.  This is sometimes true.  However, that does not change the fact that lower tax rates give greater productivity.<br>

In my case it was pounded home in third and fourth semester Macro\Micro economics sequence. <br>
<br>
Productivity differences are what lies behind comparative advantage theory (this undergirds the free trade argument...hail, nafta) <br>
<br>
I'm not really bragging about this, but I know the subject, I have a degree in economics(from top 20 school of general economics), I taught economics as a paid tutor in college(5 years) and again in high school for five years. I see the nuances and I see where supplysiders have made theoretic inroads which are very welcomed, but conversely I see where alot of their positions on the relationship between taxes and revenues is purely politically motivated fiction. I'm truly a moderate in terms of which theory I subscribe to because I think that is where the truth lies. <br>
<br>
Also, I might mention that(if you are even marginally interested in reading in the subject area) public choice theory has been an emerging subfield of economics where they have done some amazing work on quantifying and theoretically representing how the public can rationally choose through market mechanisms to &quot;purchase&quot; a certain amount of government generated public goods. Cool stuff....taking externalities and putting them into a macro economic perspective! <br>

The mathematical correlation is there, and it's very strong.<br>

Productivity increases when people work harder, people work harder when it's to their advantage.<br>
