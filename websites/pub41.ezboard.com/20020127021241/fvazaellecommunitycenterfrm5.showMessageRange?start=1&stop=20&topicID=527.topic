My friends and I set about slaughtering the foes, leaving the trinkets they dropped for the younger members of the crowd in the desert. <br><br>However, the undead dropped a Virm Fungus, which we discovered we should turn in to the High Priest of Virm who would use the fungus to the the Tishe Virm.  <br><br>However, while well over 50 people were running around trying to collect enough fungus, a rude individual by the name of Bdbee Queenbee, a throughoughly disgusting female troll, killed the High Priest... which sent his followers scattering.  It seemed those 50 plus people would not get a chance to see the Tishe Virm, whatever it was.<br><br>OOC:<br>Bdbee deliberately killed the quest giver in the N Ro events of Halloween, even after many many people asked her not too.  She was quite rude about it as well... and would not listen to reason.  And it was for nothing.  THe High Priest dropped a +6 Wis belt and was too low to even give the Troll Sk any experience.<br><br>It was all done to deliberately cause grief to the players in N Ro trying to complete the quest.  I'm asking all the guilds of Vazaelle to not helpt this person, Bdbee Queenbee... ever.  Don't group with her.  Don't Rez, don't heal, don't trade, don't sell... or do anything with or for her.<br><br>We don't need people like Bdbee on the Vazaelle server, causing problems like that.

For 60 levels I have massacred everything I see for exp, to move up the orange bar.

Nothing worked, at all. Every event was about killing. 100% of them.<br><br>Verant also has a history of dropping nice items at an event, regardless of the level of the npc. There have been items that a level 20 char could never realistically get, given to them by clicking a corpse at a gm event. I'm not saying level 20s don't deserve it, I'm just saying that level 60s AND level 20s deserve it.

It's not what I want to do.<br><br>My rogue was stuck at 19, 20, 19, 20, 19, 20, etc... for quite some time, just because I was wandering around Norrath doing quests and just having fun.  And becuase I got an itch between my shoulderblades to see what other classes were like.  That's why I have a Shaman [15], Druid [15], Warrior [17], and now a cleric at level three.<br><br>Just becuase I have had a lot of characters (the above doesn't include the eight or so characters I've made and deleted), doesn't mean I'm less of an EQ player than you.  And just becuase you have an uber doesn't mean you're more of an EQ player than me.<br><br>Everyone has their own styles of play.  Mine... casual raiding and roleplaying with no bent on getting to the high levels quickly.  Take a look at when I first started... I ran around in Nektulos with a level four Enchanter when I was at level five.  That enchanter is now level 60 and part of Promethian Order.  His name is/was Khar.  (I don't see him around much anymore)  <br><br>So lay off the fact that you think those of us who have multiple characters under forty don't have any rights in the game... cause.... see number two below...<br><br><br>Number two....<br><br>I [b][u]never[/u][/b] said that the level 40+'s couldn't participate.  I just wanted them to leave the High Priest of Tishe Virm or any of the other quest givers alive.... so the lower levels could enjoy the event and possibly get some nice items.  Out of the past few days, I've gotten 1 item for my rogue, and I destroyed it becuase I didn't like the look of it on my character.  It had no graphic.  *shrugs*<br><br>I'm weird that way, more worried about the look than the value or function.  But I just wanted to see these items so I knew what people were talking about and have fun summoning the Tishe Virm and dying as it ran through the zone slaughtering everyone.<br><br>Anyway... the high levels have a zone with events in them for the killing... of the appropriate level...  so go to Rathe Mtns and go fight the big bone dragon and such.<br><br>~Aly <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/3/01 7:35:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> uhm</span><hr size=1> Time out here, I think we're argueing but agreeing.<br><br>I'm not uber. I'm very far from that. I don't really want that. I've never set foot anywhere deep in a lot of places. I play for fun. I had a lot of random characters too before I moved to this server when it began. I had a lot of fun with a variety of classes until I settled on my main character.<br><br>You pay for an account and so do I. That's it. There's no more difference in 'rights' in eq. You want to attack a fire beetle? Feel free. Same for me. Same for any npc. Some might be a bad idea to do on your own, same for me. You have the right to enjoy any part of the game you like, regardless of your level, except for a few spots that you can't enter until level 46. And the same for me.<br><br>You said : &gt;&gt;&gt;I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>never</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> said that the level 40+'s couldn't participate. I just wanted them to leave the High Priest of Tishe Virm or any of the other quest givers alive.... so the lower levels could enjoy the event and possibly get some nice items.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>So basically you wanted to make this priest guy off limits for everyone. You wanted this part of the content of the game to not be something anyone could participate in. Well, fuck you, you can't have that. I might want a quest mob to be up and unattacked. Tough shit for me too if someone is attacking it. That's how everquest works.<br><br>I'm not dogging that you like the look of your character as a priority. Heck, you could roleplay, like looks, like stats, even imagine a smell associated with items based on where they come from, I don't care, you can play the game however you want. And so can I.<br><br>If you want to point fingers, by all means, talk to Verant. It's a game flaw that most people don't understand. There is X amount of content, first come, first serve. If someone's eating that content, you're just shit out of luck until more content happens. Don't get all upset at another player, all they ever wanted was to do what you were doing: play eq. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utuvanvaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TuvanVaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/3/01 8:19:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM Events of Halloween and Griefers...</span><hr size=1> Saalron,<br><br>Never grouped with you, never been trained by you, never even seen you in game.  <br><br>I do, however, think your style of play and general attitude on these boards would fit better on Sullon-Zek.

It makes no sense to me. I would think that most of the people who play the game agree that anyone pretty much has the right to kill anything thats not engaged by someone else. Otherwise we would be seeing Trivial Loot Code in SoL, but, as you may has noticed, it got voted down. Quest NPC or Non-Quest npc, it just doesnt matter. If its there and someones killing it, thats their right.<br><br>If you want a perfect example of this go check out posts about when class specific armor was first intruduced. The quest giver for the SK armor was in Unrest and was ALWAYS dead. VI fixed that. If they wanted to make it so higher level people couldnt kill green mobs the would. But they havent.<br><br>bleh.
