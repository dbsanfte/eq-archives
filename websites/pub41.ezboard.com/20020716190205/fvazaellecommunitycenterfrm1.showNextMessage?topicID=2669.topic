Anyway, way off my intended topic here, so back to it.<br>
<br>
How many of you handle multiple char's on different comps?  I've tried messing around running multiple accounts with eqw but it annoys me, i just want to know how many comps a single person can realistically run.  Bottom line is that I'm coming back hardcore into eq in about 2 months or so (this summer) and I don't want to play just 1 char... but when I sat down and tried to figure out what would be worth setting up another comp for, I starting to plan out setting up my own network of 8 comps and go nuts, but I toned it down some, hehe... anyway... <br>
<br>
bottom line - any input from people who have experience with running multiple comps (not eqw) would be thx appreciated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubazazu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bazazu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 5:01:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2635.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Multi-comping</span><hr size=1> For about a year I ran 2 comps, playing many different 50+ characters at the same time.<br>
<br>
Sometimes It was an enchanter and wiz, sometimes a mage and wiz, sometimes a druid and wiz, sometimes a monk and wiz, sometimes a monk and cleric, sometimes a wiz and cleric.<br>
<br>
It all depends on the characters that you are playing, and the hotkeys you setup.<br>
<br>
Some examples...<br>
<br>
2 comps:<br>
<br>
1: Tank - go hit stuff use it as main comp<br>
2: caster - make hotkeys that include assist + stand + cast + sit<br>
<br>
The above can be done with *any* caster class except enchanters, hwoever you could easily pull in multiple mobs with a tank class, then look at the ench screen and mez what you need while simply having one hand on thhe &quot;taunt&quot; button on your other comp.  Or pull with the ench and just mez on inc etc.<br>
<br>
Running 3 comps gets a little more tricky, but could still do it if the 3rd was a caster or cleric, hotkeys makes healing/nuking really automated.<br>
<br>
You could prolly stretch the caster group out to 6 computers if you had<br>
<br>
Tank<br>
Cleric<br>
caster<br>
caster<br>
caster<br>
caster<br>
<br>
And just use the Tank and Cleric as the 2 you pay most attention to, then have hotkeys no all the casters to just hit 1 button and nuke something or send a pet etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
A friend and I used to both 2 comp and power leveled our monks at efreeti lord, he would 2 comp a monk + cleric, and I 2 comped a monk + wiz.  We just had the monks grouped so they would get all the exp, the cleric healed out of group (was a 60 mule) and had a wiz out of group nuke stuff down when it was half dead to speed up the kill process (resulting in the mob dying, but all exp going to the monk duo)<br>
<br>
We could clear *all* the imps every round, and pull a bunch of death beetles, not to mention grab any named we seen while waiting for respawn.<br>
<br>
We farmed a lot of efreeti boots over the week or 2 we did this, and made awesome exp at the 50+ range.  Could do a level in about 14 hours 55+   In the week we did it, my monk went from 51 to 55, and his monk went from barely into 57 all the awy to 60.<br>
<br>
Was some good times back then...<br>
<br>
ahhh yea... the good old days <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubigfatbelly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bigfatbelly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 455<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 5:15:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2635.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> sup baz, <br>

2 comping gets much easier once you get used to it.  the only 2 comping i've done (most i've done is 3) is with a warrior/caster/cleric.  <br>
<br>
just pull with warrior and fight, if the pull had 3-4 mobs in it and the warrior is taking a beating, hit cheal on cleric (with the stand, pause, cast, sit hotkeyed), turn to enc and mez, and control warrior.<br>
<br>
It also depends how your comps are setup, when I had three, i had one on each side with one in front (lots of desk space) and could easily adjust to any situation.  if the comp is on the other side it might be slighly more difficult i can imagine.<br>
<br>
If I could choose, id prolly 2 comp along with my friend, and get 1-2 other people to join in, sometimes it gets less boring when you got others to talk to <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubakxs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakxs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 531<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 5:51:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2635.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hehehe...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Monk pulls, warrior tags, chanter mezzes adds.  Cleric keeps the warrior alive while the warrior soaks agro.  About that time the monk can join in and /assist the tank.<br>

Last comp is a wizzie who is in stand-by in those situations where serious dmg is needed, to finish something off quickly.  Other than that, on singles, I use the 3-wave AE rain for a about 1800dmg for using around 300 mana.<br>

Great setup, once you get used to it you roll over almost anything.<br>

I remember once I was 4-comping in Hate (before I had a FD puller) and took out half the mini-bosses with just that 4-man setup.

I regularly 2 comp it. <br>
<br>
If one class is a pet class, it get put on the &quot;offhand comp&quot; so to speak. Mages are good &quot;offhand comp&quot; classes as are wizards. <br>
<br>
On the main comp you have to have the class which is going to manage the pull or crowd control. It's a must. <br>
<br>
The hardest thing I find is dealing with situations where the shit hits the fan  because you have been trained or something like that. When I size up a zone I consider factors like frequency of trains, the direction they come from, pathing of mobs back from them...etc. <br>
<br>
One of my tasks this summer when I am off is going to be to reconfigure my furniture in the computer area and possibly build a decent third computer. Ergonomics and hotkeying, as others have said, is also helpful.<br>

As far as managing multiple pulls... one thing I have actually learned in the 3 years I've played eq is how to only fight what i want to fight... and chances are if it's a train heavy zone / spot, then there's someplace else you should be (fight basement karnors, not zone-in... fight in HS... deep hole, etc etc).<br>

Like the others said pick classes that support each other and allows u to switch focus shortly to the other char and then back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ergoline>Ergoline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/29/02 5:17:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2635.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: :)</span><hr size=1> Yrag: Treesinger is an old friend of mine, in fact he's the first person I ever grouped with on Vazaelle. Not as Treesinger, of course, but as his mage. He's definitely a different Treepimp, as he's from California, not NYC....and he's a half-elf, not a wood elf. He's about one-third my age (seriously) but he's a good fellow, for a bard. ;-)<br>
<br>
And how's those trade skills coming along?<br>
<br>
And I occasionally dual-box, but &quot;my side&quot; of the living room isn't set up for it. My wife (Furlibusea) dual-boxes a lot.<br>

<br>
I heard of a bit of code that allows a bard to twist 3 songs while /afk.  Not sure what it is, nor where to find it.  I just know it exists because I have seen /afk bards singing 3 songs before.<br>
