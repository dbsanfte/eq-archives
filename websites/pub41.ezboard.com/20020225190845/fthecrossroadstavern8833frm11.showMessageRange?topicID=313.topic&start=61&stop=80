Having a good time and enjoying who you are playing with is the best parts about the game and the reason i play. It always make the play funner when people know how to play there class.

<br>
I'll have to double check, but I think it was Muffinz I grouped with in Frenzy about a month ago. If I recall, he was leading the group when I joined. I had my druid in the group too, it was Pre-Luclin as I was trying to lvl up my druid a bit and collect threads for my cleric. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, Muffinz's job was simple: Stand up, group thorns, sit. Stand up, group regen, sit. Mind you, only 1 person was getting hit, don't remember his name but the tank held aggro perfectly. After a short while, the buffs from Muffinz seemed to run out. Thorns and Regen weren't being refreshed timely to the point that it seemed he'd just given up. <br>
<br>
My druid, though, was nuking, dot'ing, and spot healing as well. It was Frenzy, so I didn't have Evac up. There's not a whole lot of trouble you can get into there that you can't run out of. NOT like lower dogs. <br>
<br>
Well, Muffinz got lasier and lasier, to the point that he wasn't paying ANY attention at all. He'd RARELY toss out a simple dot on something. Well, we pulled 2 mobs. Tanks were doing great holding aggro, we had no problems. Muffinz returned from one of his many cat-like naps and dotted a spider... The WRONG spider. It hadn't been hit =) It tore after him and tore INTO him so quickly I wasn't able to save him (was healing a tank 1 as my druid was keeping tank 2 alive). <br>
<br>
He died. I was annoyed. Had her been paying attention and perhaps HELPING, he'd have lived and we'd had no problems to begin with. I took over the group. I reformed it kicking him out. Felt bad for it but the other members saying 'yeahhh, this is MUCH better' and 'Now THIS is more like it' was reassuring. <br>
<br>
Later: Muffinz harassed me about 'hey look, I'm casting spells now!!' since I accused him of doing nothing. Ignoring him, 2 'anon' people logged in and out, one after the other, saying 'hi, I'm new, can you tell me how to cast a spell?'. Go figure. <br>
<br>
The most damning part happened the next day: A little /tell argument with him and a confession in log that yes, he got to 54th lvl (or so) without having to do anything at all and how proud he was about it. I'll post the log tonight.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uleir37.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leir37</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(1/7/02 12:41:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Retarded druids PISS me off</span><hr size=1> A 54 enchanter in lower dogs is a risk.

We all try to push the limits but sometimes the limits bite back. <br>
<br>
Any way this is a red herring a good Druid makes a group hum a bad Druid hurts! I remember getting Evaced by mistake...when there was a big pull which I was quite happily mezzing... The druid lost his bottle, Boy was I annoyed. <br>
<br>
I have very fond memories of Furiae (left EQ for DAoC) who used to make it her job to keep me alive...when she was behind me I felt I could mezz anything or at least give it a go.<br>
<br>
Bottomline there are good players and bad Muffinz needs to learn how to play in groups, however the group also has some responsibility to ensure that everyone knows what they are doing before charging off into the depths. That is why pickup groups are so much &quot;fun&quot;...people take for granted that the pickup members will play the same way as their guildmates. Communication keep you alive!<br>

Soon after a Druid .. one who i have seen in there before Decides to start pulling mobs from mine and their camp .. Ok bad enuff.. next he starts to kite it around the Crater .. dipping in and out..  picking up additional mobs, which he just roots and runs around .. so these mobs pick up ore mobs.. and now they need to get around the temple which means crossing through others camps.   Well this Genius got the small Grp from WoR killed.. so i go over there and Drag them yo my camp where i have a cleric friend and rez them .. not 10 seconds after the 2nd guys is ressed, 2 snared mobs waddle into camp and start beating on us.  and a little later again he runs through with a few more mobs who detatch and attack my camp.  <br>

I think it was Ewald who was in The Grey over a week ago, trying to kite two named golems at once, without much luck. Kept getting adds as well. Ended up pulling the Shattered Golem to the wall down a ways from the Mons Latalis zone. He rooted the mob, ran and zoned out/back in to clear aggro, then came back to kill the mob. It still had dots on it, so he claimed that it was still his mob.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubrierlea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brierlea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ranger of Tunare</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#333333>(1/7/02 4:31:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ewald</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> God I hate druids that give the rest of us a bad name.

Heh, of course, that doesn't mean I didn't die on occasion, and since I died others did as well.  That's the day that I learned that although enchanters make EXCELLENT corpse recoverers in all OTHER parts of Velks, that damned dispell orb thingy down in lower dogs makes enchanters dead. &lt;g&gt; <p>Binnen Minder<br>

Hee hee, I think he meant the lazy druid that I was with that time in Velks Tril, like Raene said =) Thanks for the speedy defense though. I looked at it and thought for a sec 'yeah, but it does look like he's talking about Baoh... =) '. <br>
<br>
Still looking for those logs though.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uenchanterrodg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enchanter Rodg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/02 2:44:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LoL</span><hr size=1> Never had the honor to play with Nurrse or her druid, maybe one day.

I mean, geez, there are dumasses in every class on every server in every guild of every level, but Norrath is literally infested with druids.  There's gonna be a higher number of dufuses who are druids cause there are just a whole shitload of em.  Same percentage, higher numerical value of gooberdroods.  Sometimes, I can't take 2 steps in EC without bumpin into another godam druid.  I swear to god if  i see another druid, im gonna friggin puke.  I'm still cleanin the druid shit off my boots when i encountered that 400 head druid herd in WC, there were some warriors herding them saying : YAH YAH, git along lil dr00ds. YAH /Harbromm cracks his whip over the noob druid's head.  I joined the Druidherders, and we're gonna drive em to Queynos and sell em all at market.  Gonna have me a druid steak dinner.<br>
