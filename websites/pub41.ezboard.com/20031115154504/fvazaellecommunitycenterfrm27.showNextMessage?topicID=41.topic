I fancy myself someone who has a decent talent in the use of words to convey thoughts and ideas, as well as conjuring up stories for people to read.  I sometimes post my works on my guild boards.  Lately I have been writing a longer story on my guild boards, which I have become fairly drawn into.<br>
<br>
A while back, I was in the Plane of Hate, on a raid with RoK.  I did a /who in the zone, and I noticed a familliar name in the zone, one who's writing intrigued me; Riverdane.  I sent him a tell saying how much I admired his work, and told him that I am also a decent writer myself.  I mentioned that I may actually get up the guts to posting on these boardsone day soon.  Well, I've finally gotten up the guts to post.<br>
<br>
As of yet, this story is untitled.  I have been unable to think of a decent name for it.  Naming my stories has always been a problem for me.  Anyways.....  The story is still a work in progress.  I will post new additions periodically.  I hope you will enjoy it.  Now enough of my gnomish rambling, ON WITH THE SHOW! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick tock.<br>
<br>
I slowly opened my eyes and my ears received the comforting sounds of the clock on the wall. Whenever I feel lost or scared or lonely, the sound of the ticking in my heart can always soothe my mind. I thought about this as my mind relaxed and took in my surroundings. My house was in disorder. I had books laying across the floor, covered with a topping of papers. A chair leaned against the wall, as if pushed out of the way in a hurry. And clothes were scattered about everywhere. <br>
<br>
&quot;I really must clean this place up a little.&quot; I thought to myself as I picked up my worn travelling robe resting next to the bed. The robe was mostly red with stripes of yellow and orange pasted across the front. Magic of old held the threads together, making them near impossible to break, but years of wear had finally started to fray the hem of it. &quot;It won't be long and some threads will begin to unravel&quot; I again thought.<br>
<br>
A knock at the door brought me to attention. &quot;Be right there!&quot; I yelled to the visitor. I hurredly put on my travelling robe and stumbled over to the door. I must remember to not drink that much gnomish spirits again i realized.<br>
<br>
An impatient knock rang out. &quot;Hold on or I will feed you to Jabober!&quot; I shouted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, just hurry up and answer the door Shorty.&quot; answered a familliar voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not short! I'm vertically challenged you big oaf!&quot; I said as I reached the door. I grasped the handle and puuled the door open to cast a glimpse on the barbarian standing in the doorway with his hands over his ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;How can you stand all this infernal racket? I can't hear myself think, nevertheless hear others talk.&quot; the barbarian said as his hands waved around him. &quot;I hate Ak'anon. You gnomes are odd.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you stink. I think it's time for your yearly bath Joramen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch it or I'll eat you! You would fit nice in my belly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!&quot;<br>
<br>
I walked back in towards my house and Joramen followed, ducking low to get through the door. &quot;I hate Ak'anon! I can't even walk in a gnome house without having to duck.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quit your complaining. Halas isn't such a resort town in my opinion...&quot;<br>
<br>
Joramen glared at me, &quot;What was that??&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You heard me. Now what is it you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
Joramen gave a little grunt and said, &quot;We need your help. A bunch of us are heading to Western Wastes to fight some dragons and we need more to come along with us. You game?&quot;<br>
<br>
A flash of excitement passed through my eyes and a smile crept up my cheeks. &quot;Dragons... Sounds like tons of fun!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Meet us tomorrow in the Nexus shortly after sunrise. This shall give us plenty of time for travel and hunting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, I will be there friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. See you later Boppy.&quot; Joramen headed for the door, raising his hands to his ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate that name! My name is Jimbop of Akanon, Do not address me as Boppy.....&quot;  Joramen was out the door without hearing a word I said, so I gave up talking.  Ahh, dragon hunting. Tomorrow will be a good day.<br>

I raise an eyebrow in suspicion as I glace at the beast. &quot;This ogre is yet young, for very few battle scars are present on his skin, and his chain-linked armor looks like it was looted off a decaying corpse with how rusty it is,&quot; I thought to myself. I turn my head and stroll away, knowing this weak ogre will not bother me on this day, or he will have to deal with Jabober.<br>
<br>
People of all races crowded through the Nexus on this day, hustling between their destinations. A high elf maiden, in a long flowing green dress, was casting KEI to all those who required it's use, in exchange for 100 platinum piece. A grinning, and especially hairy, halfling hawked his wares next to a couple Nexus guardians donned in gleaming white armor. A wart-faced troll let out a roar of laughter while conversing with a straggly-looking human with a lute in hand and a dark skinned wizard. My gnomish eyes scanned the bustling and busy crowd, searching for a particular group of people I was supposed to meet up with.<br>
<br>
I headed towards the Bazaar, a place where many people go to sell rare and unusual items, to seek what I desired, only to find a sleeping dwarf, whose snoring is loud enough to make one go deaf. A nearby dark elf glared evily at the dwarf, but upon seeing the ancient breastplate across his cheast, the battle-worn sword resting next to his gnarled hand, and the hint of white in the dwarf's beard, decided against whatever his evilish mind had planned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is everyone?&quot; I thought. Late again, I assume. Impatience began to set into my brain after a couple of seconds, for gnomes generally don't like to wait around. I sat down on a stair near the Kunark portal and waited.<br>
<br>
A voice rang out through the Nexus, &quot;Everyone traveling to Kunark, please step onto the portal now.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sleeping dwarf woke up suddenly, and as if he had never ben truely asleep, stood up, and walked over to the Kunark pad. I smiled, knowing that this dwarf is a veteran of many, many battles with vicious foes and is trained to be awake when actually asleep. My thoughts drift back to the dark elf and what would have happened had the dark elf taken action. My thoughts were soon interrupted...<br>
<br>
&quot;Boppy!&quot; a female voice rang out from behind me.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name's NOT Boppy, Siara! I'm Jimbop of Akanon, elementalist of......&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, of course you are, Boppy. Anyways, glad to see you here! We were wondering where you were.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stand up and turn around to face Siara. A druid princess of 60 seasons, the beautiful wood elf walked up to me. A smile draped across her narrow face, and her slender nose twiched just slightly when a giggle emitted from her full-bodied lips. Narrow eye sockets beamed blue when her long brown hair wasn't blocking them. With a quick whisp of her hand, the hair instead tried to hide her shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you ready to come with us Boppy?&quot;<br>
<br>
I sigh, knowing I will never be able to get them to stop calling me 'Boppy.' &quot;Yes, I am ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Follow me over to everyone else, and we will port out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot;<br>
<br>
I follow her up the stairs and back into the center of the Nexus. We cross the room and head into another hallway with a new assortment of beings, except these are beings I know.<br>
<br>
With a quick bow, I said hello to Joramen, Galmor, Caenyien, Frequency, Tarimus, Tensheba, and Fisbik. Joramen and Galmor, the 2 barbarian brutes, stood next to one another in newly polished breastplates. Caenyien, a high elf, sat on the ground, reading his book on healing. Frequency, a half-elf, sat near Caenyien, composing a new song in his songbook. Tarimus, awood elf ranger, and Tensheba, a vah shir shaman faced each other, involved in an engrossing conversation. Lastly, Fisbik, a gnome, was looking at his spellbook, trying to find his teleportation spells. Such a diverse group, yet all are like family to one another through the guild name we carry in our hearts.<br>
<br>
I am greeted by every one of them in return. &quot;Well, let's get going. We don't got all day.&quot; said Joramen.<br>
<br>
Everyone stood up and gathered into a circle. Siara and Fisbik began to chant whispered words only they could understand. Each one whispered a list of names in between spidery words, names of our group. Half of our groups names were whispered by Siara and half by Fisbik, for a mortal is only able to transport 5 others at one time. The whispers grew faster and faster. Bright blue balls of energy appeared in the air surrounding the group and swirled around. The hair on the back of my neck began to rise as magical energy flowed into my skin. Bumps appeared my skin and the outside world began to fade away from view...<br>

As the light fades away, normal sight once again was possible. Trees and grass surrounded me. A snake slithered through the weeds not far from where I stood. An orc hunter hid behind a tall oak, fearing to be seen by me and....<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, where is everyone?&quot; I said to myself as I looked around to find noone near me. &quot;And where am I? I am certainly not in Cobalt Scars.&quot;<br>
<br>
I studied my surroundings intently. I sniffed the gentile breeze, noticing the moisture in the air, yet a certain dryness to it. I look around the surrounding druid ruins, which are quite familliar to me, yet can't place at the monent. I look intently at the ground, and through the blades of bright green grass, I noticed a small pile of sand.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, I am in the southern desert of Ro. Why am I here instead of in Cobalt?&quot; I again asked myself. Certainly, the teleportation spell couldn't have sent one person to the wrong place and not everyone else. How odd.<br>
<br>
I sat down into the lush grass for a minute to regather my thoughts. &quot;I doubt that they will be able to find me here, so I will gate back to the Nexus.&quot; I grasp hold of my spellbook, which is always tucked away safely inside a pocket of my robe. I open the book to the first page. Looking down through the numerous words foreign to many across Norrath, I found the particular spell line I was looking for. These words I committed to memory, making sure I knew the proper fluctuations, pitch, and frequency.<br>
<br>
I put my spellbook back inside my robe and stood up. Sounds began to flow from my mouth. My skin began to burn as the magic I was born with began to erupt and fill me with an exstacy only magic can give. Faster and faster, the sounds came. Light began to converge around me, slowly growing brighter, until it was blinding. The last word of the spell exited from my lips. The light faded away and.....<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on?&quot; I yelled as I came to realize I am still in Ro. A startled wolf pup let out a yip and ran off into some nearby bushes, waiting for his mother to return. The gate spell, able to be learned by many classes at a very early age, almost never fails, unless one's concentration is less than perfect. My concentration was just fine though!<br>
<br>
After regaining my scomposure and the strength wasted away from the casting of the spell, I attempted it again. Still nothing. I attempted again after a few minutes. Yet again, nothing. After about the 10th time, I gave up.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is going on here&quot; I thought to myself. What could possibly not allow my gate spell to work? Am I doing something wrong? Did I memorize the spell wrong? Am I losing the magic that is my life? I knew in my heart that the last three thoughts were all the same answer: No. I have cast this spell an uncountable number of times, and what I did now was no different than the first time I successfully cast it. Then what could possibly be preventing me from leaving here?<br>
<br>
*Thump*<br>
<br>
&quot;OW!&quot; I screamed, as a wooden club bounced off my head. I quickly stood up and turned around to face an orc warrior, who thought I would be easy prey.<br>
<br>
&quot;Orc stomp, orc kill. Orc weapons, your blood will spill!&quot; the brutish orc yelled in a wild battlecry. Foam frothed from his mouth and his eyes bulged out of his head.<br>
<br>
Anger rose from within me and boiled over into the fire. &quot;I'll teach you what happens when you fool around with the wrong person, foolish Orc.&quot; The orc swong a valliant blow, which sailed over my head. The magic from deep within began to fester and swell. Words of magic poured from my mouth like water coming out of a faucet. A reddish glow eminated from my skin as the air around prickled in the magic.<br>
<br>
The orc landed another blow to my right shoulder, a mere scratch it left. From my many years of training, I have learned to focus on the magic and not allow myself to be distracted. This orc will not disrupt me. I threw out my hands toward the orc. A huge ball of fire shot out from my fingertips and smote the orc square in the chest. The smell of charred orc flesh hung heavy in the air as the orc fell dead at my feet. <br>
<br>
After a quick inspection of the pockets of the orc, I left him and his smoldering club to rot away until the wolves picked the meat off his bones. My feet drove me northward through the Ro Desert, in search of the reason why I have arrived here.<br>

Towering stone walls surrounded the biggest port city on Norrath. Home to many in the human population, the city was built like a fort, never to fall. The walls are as thick as a barbarian is tall and are taller than the few trees in the small oasis just outside of the city. Two guards were placed outside for guard duty. I walked past the sand critters and made my way up to the guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, gnome.&quot; a scruffy looking, well muscled human said mildly. &quot;What brings you to these parts?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Jimbop of Akanon, and will not be addressed as 'gnome.'  I am a friend of this city and demand to be allowed to pass.&quot;<br>
<br>
A look of impatience flashed upon the veteran's face. &quot;Yes, yes. I have heard of you. You are allowed admittance to the city.&quot; The other guard glanced over in suspision.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, thank you.&quot; I said briefly as I began to walk past, slightly annoyed for being unable to finish my introduction. I got about three steps past the guards when I whirled around to ask a quick question. The other guard dropped his hand to his sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the way, has anything strange been going on lately?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean, gno....I mean Jimbop.&quot; the veteran corrected himself, knowing that gnomes are offended when referred to as 'gnome.'<br>
<br>
&quot;I tried casting my self transportation spell, but it wouldn't work. Have any travellers of late complained about this?&quot;<br>
<br>
A puzzled look came across both the guards' faces. The other guard spoke for the first time in a deep raspy voice, &quot;We have not heard anything of this. We are only guards, who have no use for magic. Maybe you should go to the magic-wielders guild.&quot; A brief, almost inaudible sentence came from his voice as I began to turn around to leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you. I will do just that.&quot; I walked swiftly away from the two guards, not trusting neither one, especially the guard who mentioned that I should go back to the magic-wielders guild in Ak'anon where I belong.<br>
<br>
My path took me past numerous stone and wooden buildings. A creaking sign swayed in the breeze in front of a rowdy bar. A street vendor swatted the hand of a snooping street urchin. An elf stood in front of a blacksmith, negotiating the price of a finely polished blade of very high quality with it's human owner. And all the while, the smell of the sea hung heavy in the overcast sky.<br>
<br>
I glanced up to find the sun's position to find the day is in the waning hours. &quot;I shall try to take the portal to the Plane of Knowledge, for it's magic should not be failing.&quot; I thought to myself while stepping aside to avoid a pleasantly drunk dwarf staggering in the street babbling something about the bar being on fire.<br>
<br>
After about twenty minutes of walking, I arrived to another gate, almost exactly identical to the gate I came in at, only here many more guards were posted. The town militia building stood just inside the gates to this entrance. Heavy armor-clad humans with gleaming longswords bustled about, protecting the populance from thieves, murderers, and the occasional invader. Like the other gate, two guards stood on duty to protect the gate, and to assure no intruders are allowed entrance.<br>
<br>
With my mind on other thoughts, I paid no heed to the guards. &quot;What could possibly cause teleportation not to work? Did the same thing happen to my group? Are they still stuck in the Nexus or.....&quot;<br>
<br>
As if rousing out of a deep slumber, I came to the realization I was being spoken to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Gnome!&quot; A rough looking human with a chest and arms bulgiong out of his armor spoke to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Jimbop of Akanon, and do not.......&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I know you are. I just wanted to let you know to be wary of travelling. Very few visitors have come by today, which is very odd for this time of year. I fear there may be danger on the paths ahead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I fear no danger, Sir. I will be fine, but thank you for your warning.&quot; With a quick bow, I followed the left wall. I continued to follow this until I came to one stretch, and I stopped. Looking at this wall, it seemed ordinary. Every stone looked the same, and looked to be masterfully built. I lifted up my hand and tried to touch the wall, only my hand became part of the wall. I drew myself into the wall, and walked through the illusion. &quot;I always hated trying to find this place&quot; I thought briefly.<br>
<br>
I emerged into a tunnel burrowing underneath the city of Freeport. Underground is how the evil travel throughout Freeport. Seeing noone around at this time, I proceeded in, my soft padded shoes kicking up dirt along the way. A faint red glow partially illuminated the hallway. The walls were roughly cut and looked to be dug out in a hurry. A trickle of water ran down and collected in a small pool. Then a faint blue glow began to emerge in the darkness. After rounding a small corner, I came to stand in front of an ancient book on a pedastal.<br>
<br>
Magic flowed forth from this ancient tome, touching every soul and filling him or her with the ability to cast a magic spell, even if he has never casted a spell before. In it's crisp pages contain one single spell, the ability to translocate yourself to the Plane of Knowledge. My steps took me up to the tome, it's power mingling with my blood. I open up the book and memorize the words needed to cast the spell. After a minute, I gently close the book and take a step back.<br>
<br>
Spell fresh in mind, I begin to recite the incantation. My arms flutter up in response to the words of the song. My magic twined with the magic of the tome and flared like wildfire in my body. Exstacy filled my mind and magical balls swirled around me. I closed my eyes and saw visions of the beauty of Knowledge, the radiant skies, the crisp clean air, the birds in the trees. I could see all races in existance living in complete harmony with one another. I could see travellers abroad in search of endless adventures. I could see many vendors selling almost anything you could possibly want. Most of all, I could see the gleaming white castle standing proudly in the center of the land. I opened my eyes to take in all these wonderful sights. The first thing I noticed was....<br>
<br>
The bluish-tinted tunnel wall.<br>

Hidden underneath my robe was a necklace that hung down to the top of my chest; a plain clear crystal attached to a golden chain. Although seemingly ordinary looking, the necklace looked vividly alive with detail. No markings existed, yet markings were felt in one's soul. Markings that shouted out words that were heard bouncing off distant mountains, yet weren't heard at all. These words shouted to the viewer, &quot;Nomadic Knights.&quot;<br>
<br>
My hand draped around the crystal. n inaudible whisper seeped from my lips. The once ordinary necklace came alive with brilliance. Shimmering blue light eminated from the cracks between my gnarled fingers, illuminating my red robe with its intensity. Darkness fled in fear from the intruding light, disappearing behind any rock or crevice it could find. A nearby rat, frightened by the change in her home, scurried away in search of the blessed cover of darkness.<br>
<br>
Images of my guild hall filled my vision. Oak tables sat in line with many chairs resting underneath them. Long benches ran along the walls covered in tapestries depicting events that transpired in the history of the Knights. On the back wall stood the grand tapestry that proudly displayed the guild name to all who entered the magnificent hall. Voices of familliar faces streamed into my ears, yet no faces graced my vision of the hall. With the magic of the crystal broadcasting strong, I gathered up my thoughts and began to speak to the members of my guild.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a question to ask of everyone. Has anyone noticed anything weird going on today like not being able to teleport or gate?&quot;<br>
<br>
A chorus of &quot;No&quot; and &quot;No Jim&quot; answers reverberated off from the walls. Despair began to fill my mind when one lone voice rose up and offered me a question in return.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, what's wrong Jim?&quot; a strong and determined feminine voice asked. Quickly, I was able to put a face to this voice that imposed an unrealized tone of authority.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure Mysty.&quot; I said to Mystykal, the leader of the Nomadic Knights. &quot;I was with a group of my friends when we ported out to Cobalt Scars. When the spell was finished, I lost all contact with my friends and ended up in the Desert of Ro. I tried to gate back to PoK, but the gate spell wouldn't work. I ran over to the PoK portal outside of Freeport, but it also won't work. Now I am stuck here, unable to contact my friends. Does anyone know what could be going on?&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence answered me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone?&quot; I again asked.<br>
<br>
A deep human voice answered me, which belonged to Gruven Tothebeat, tank extrordinaire. &quot;I don't know Jim. Maybe you just need a quick nap to clear your brain. Sometimes after being awake a while, your mind doesn't remember stuff right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not all I have to say either.&quot; I stated. &quot;When I was in Freeport, the guards seemed very worried. Travel has come to a standstill. No trade has come in or out. No travellers have come in or out. Nothing. They seem to think something in the land is strange.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice of Erki, the appointed leader of magic, was the next voice to be heard. &quot;Very odd. So far, I have had no troubles out here in Velious. Maybe you are just letting yourself get distracted while casting your spells. It happens to the best of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But that doesn't explain why the guards are suspicious and why travel has dropped off.&quot; I replied. &quot;And, more importantly, that doesn't explain why I ended up in Ro instead of with my group in Cobalt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe your group was trying to tell you something by dropping you off in Ro, Jim.&quot; said another voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe they thought you were gonna fall asleep again during the teleport or randomly during a battle, like before.&quot; Erki stated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very funny Eyan and Erki.&quot; I said with a sneer. &quot;Seriously though, does anyone know what could be going on?&quot;<br>
<br>
A few no's were heard, and that was about it. Frustrated about not knowing what is going on, I told everyone that I was going to take a small nap and go from there. After saying my goodbyes, I let go of the crystal. The crystal held it's brilliance for a few seconds, and slowly it died back down into the indistinct crystal it once was.<br>
<br>
I walked outside of the tunnel and headed over to the Freeport entrance. A few beetles skittered across the sand in front of me, and a bat flew sightlessly through the dimming sky. I reached the entrance to Freeport and walked through without acknowledging the guards, yet I noticed the main guard breathed a sigh of relief, for he would not have to possibly clean up someone's corpse the next day.<br>
<br>
I sat down not far from the entrance and leaned my back against the stone wall of the city. I reached into my backpack and pulled out a piece of bread and a water flask. I silently ate the bread and washed it down with the water and let my thoughts flow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will everything be ok when I wake up? Am I just letting myself become distracted? And will that nagging pain in my foot go away? Ugh!&quot;<br>
<br>
I pulled my knees up to my chest and folded my arms across them and leaned my head into them. Within a few minutes, the guards were able to hear how loud a gnome can snore.<br>
