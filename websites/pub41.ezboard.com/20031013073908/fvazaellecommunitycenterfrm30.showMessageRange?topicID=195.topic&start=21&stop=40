Piloting an aircraft heavily laden with fuel into a financial symbol of the world'd wealthiest nation.<br>
<br>
Attacking an aircraft loaded with passengers pursuing trans-national trade.<br>

Complete elimination of all people who share the same genetic, religious, geographical, or ideological affiliations.<br>

<br>
Acts of war will always be heinous.  War should never be candy coated.<br>
<br>
If parents are unable to ship their children to daycare or school, they are probably unable to go to work in a factory or an office building.  No work means no economic output, which further reduces the size of the war machine that can be supported.<br>
<br>
Have you ever played a real-time strategy game?  There is a reason that economy output is directly linked to war capacity.<br>
<br>
Reducing the economic output of the opposition is an excellent method for reducing their capacity for war.  It may be the best method to win a war while preserving the resources available to the victor.  If both sides only fight a purely &quot;military&quot; campaign, then it is a contest to force the opposition to exahust their resources first.<br>
<br>
Purely military campaigns are much more brutal, on a humanitarian scale, than economic ones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2057<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/03 5:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warfare vs Terrorism</span><hr size=1> That connection is very, very distant.  I'm not saying it isn't there, because I agree it has some *small* effect on the ability of a country to make war.  However, there are many, many targets that would be much more effective in reducing the ability of Israel to make war on the Palestinians.  The fact that these are not chosen shows that the intent is not to weaken Israel's ability to make war, as your connection would suggest, but rather to hurt innocent people and cause pain with very minimal military gain.<br>

You can keep imagining heinous scenarios, but given the same military options the Palestinians many people would probably support their type of warfare.<br>

The Palestinian population seems to support it.<br>

Until the scenario changes for the Palestinians there will be more heinous acts.  At the moment the risk vs reward is heavily tilted to 'reward' for these actions.

These 3 things AT LEAST are done by the CIA, our military in secret ops and by drug enforcement agencies.  Reason is tactical.  Terrorism is the act of religious zealots who neither have the resources nor the numbers to wage actual war against the enemies of their people/god.  We are the enemy because we are viewed as an evil empire.  While we flaunt our wealth, they sit in poverty.  Jealousy to the extreme clouds and influences their every thought.<br>
<br>
During the revolutionary war, it was considered dishonorable not to stand in a line and fire at each other from extremely close distances.  Now we think of it as insane to do battle like this.  Unfortunately terrorism seems to be the next step in the evolution of warfare.  Welcome to the next stage.<br>
<br>
As to the Israelites and the Palestinians, both lay sole claim to Jerusalem.  How, with that attitude, could a compromise be reached?  As you can see, I tend to blame religion for most of the problems over there.  Extreme views of religion have caused sooooo many problems in our worlds history and life would be so much more simple with a little tolerance. <p>Gen.

No group or army or general would allocate resources to destroy a target when they can allocate the same resources to destroy a different target that has a greater impact on the outcome of the war.  That's a bizarre type of altruism that only happens in thought experiements.<br>
<br>
In the case of the Palestinians, the aim is not a military victory.  They seek to instill enough fear and despair in the Israeli population that the Israeli government will give in and make concessions.  In that case, bombing a university, or a bus, is MUCH more effective than bombing a tank or military barracks.<br>

The company Dick Cheney sits as head of board, has affiliates doing all sorts of things in Iraq, from capping wells to feeding US troops. That makes me uncomfortable as he let that happen and did not feel like it would even be perceived as something nefarious.<br>
What has ale burton come away with so far from our Iraq war? See how much we have already spent, and see how much that particular company has brought home. The numbers are very close, that makes me uncomfortable. 67 billion to HB's 60 billion<br>

If the fact that influxing money into the economy works so well to raise the economy were true. Then why should'nt the minimum wage be raised to a living wage?<br>
Funny how conservatives love to talk about tax relief and trickle down, but balk when a living wage is presented. Its really the same thing, except that a higher base standard would actually put the money in the hands of people who would spend it.<br>
<br>
Take Rhode Island, put guards and checkpoints throught and around. Take away every Bess Eaton and D'n Dnts.<br>
Make it impossible for them to work. See what the next generation of them will be doing. Sitting on thier ass and dreaming up ways to cause trouble.<br>
and thus the situation continues.<br>
<br>
i think that the targetting of Hamas leaders actually spurred the last peace deal. It actually works, its funny how these guys can wire someone up and send them to death. Then FReak out when the military targets them.<br>
Until Isreal stfu and the PLO starts arresting terrorists nothing will get done. Right now the terrorists give interviews in hospitals after failed attacks, shouldn't thier government arrest them? hell yeah, unless they are suported by the government.<br>

That's the problem.  They have a lot to lose.<br>
<br>
If they weren't engaging in terrorist activities, there would be enormous pressure from the rest of the world for the Israelis to compromise and make peace.  As it is, the Palestinians have forced sympathies to the side of the Israelis.  Whether or not you think all is fair in war, the vast majority of the world condemns attacks against civilians without military objectives, and it has an enormous effect on the sympathies of the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
Even without pressure from the rest of the world, Israel has expressed a desire to negotiate with the Palestinians, but not with terrorists or any regime supporting terror.<br>
<br>
Terrorism, rather than helping their cause, is hurting it.<br>

<br>
Abbas resigned because Arafat didn't want to give up the security forces he controlled. It was all about power, they both hate eachother and therefore Abbas thought (and rightly so) that he was in an impossible position. Even though I strongly disagree with Arafat's stance here, it has nothing to do with supporting the terrorists. Hell, Hamas hates his guts because he ultimately wants to get rid of them. If you demand that he gets rids of Hamas, you make his position impossible and ultimately nullify the little power he has.<br>

<br>
That's how Hamas thinks also - Israel oppress them, almost all Israeli people support them and that's why they can justify their horrific crimes. Sure, Israel's crimes may be less horrific, but that doesn't change a thing. Innocents are victimized by both Hamas and Israel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You cannot compare the two. One targets innocent civilians, one targets criminals that have already committed crimes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And that's where you wrong. Sure, maybe the crimes of Hamas are less justifyable than the Israeli actions. That does not make the Israeli right. A terrorist attack against Israel is big news, but Israel's actions against Palestinians gets very little newscoverage, especially during the second intifada. Israel's actions are on a way larger scale than Palestina. I remember Israel casualties being something like 20 - 40 at some point, while the Palestinians were at 300 or something. <br>

I guess you don't know then. The Israeli's evacuated the building, so they could kill the Hamas leader without killing others. &quot;Hey, you're homeless now, but at least we didn't kill you !

Again, look at both sides. Israel built a fence IN ground they agreed upon would be Palestinian ground mere weeks before. Hundreds of Palestinians were cut off from family, their own farmland, their job because of it. They keep shooting missiles to assassinate Hamas leaders, killing only innocent bystanders (I believe the only Hamas leader they succesfully assasinated was the one in the building I spoke off earlier). They KNOW they can expect retalition (which they cannot even prevent).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They must cease terrorist activities and support for them or peace will never happen.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I believe if Netanyanu wasn't elected, Hamas would currently be a hunted organisation with little support from the population. I do not believe terrorism would be completely eradicated, but I do believe the casualties would be decimated. I believe they were very close to peace in the early 90's. Who knows what would've happened if Rabin wasn't shot (not claiming that it definately would be peace).<br>
<br>
Your view on the topic is exactly what is stopping the peace process. There is no way Israeli people are gonna be more sympathetic to the Palestinians without the terrorist attacks diminishing and there's no way the Palestinians are gonna be more sympathetic to the Israeli's without Israel stopping to oppress the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
They both need leaders that somehow can stay in power AND are willing to compromise, to stop laying blame and work together to pursue peace. I believe Rabin and Arafat were those leaders.<br>
<br>
To sum it up (hehe, yeah I'm longwinded) : The terrorism may be a more horrific crime than bulldozing down people's houses, but you cannot judge them that way. They are both equally detrimental to the peace process.<br>
<br>
ps. I get the feeling the European media and the US media differ greatly on covering this issue.<br>

<br>
On warfare. Anywon is making a point I very much agree with. Making rules in war is stupid. The side that is winning can always 'play nice'. The side that is losing will  ALWAYS use any means necessary to better their situation. The many European resistances in WO2 are considered heroes. They were terrorists to the opposition. We condemn terrorists for targetting civilians. We justify Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because they prevented military casualties. Americans condemn iraqi's for not abiding by the Geneva rules. Americans justify the normally considered inhumane treatement of prisoners in Guantamo Bay, because it makes their country safer.<br>
<br>
In practice, all is considered fair by a party, as long as it their own goal. I would not say &quot;All is fair in warfare&quot;. I would say that there is no 'good' or 'clean' way to fight wars. <p>---------------<br>

Hamas wants all jews gone from the country. They do not want peace (they had it with Oslo, still they deliberately kept making attacks to undermine the peacetreaty). They are the lowest scum imaginable, fighting because they think killing innocent will grant them a free ticket to heaven. If they really had heart for their people they would see that peace would be in their best interest. I'm getting sick with anger when they perform another attack just at a time peace may have a chance of flourishing, intended solely to stop the peace.<br>

  While I will agree all is fair in war, this statement here is a little bit shortsighted to say the least.  Countries of this world after having witnessed firsthand the destruction of the 2nd world war decided to put an end (or at least try) to the senseless carnage that came about from purposefully targetting civilians.  <br>
<br>
  You could speak till you're blue in the face but I'd find it hard for any person to realistically explain how the garbage man who was on the 32nd floor was a military combatant.  Now if as you state the guy picked up a rifle and a home made bomb, then yes, he's ascended from the innocent civilian stage to the partisan stage and as such is fair game.  Just killing everyone from the opposing nation no matter who they are, what they do etc... is generally referred to as Genocide.<br>
<br>
  Heck according to your concept of warfare, our best strategy to win the war in Iraq was just to Nuke every city they had.  We win!<br>

As I see it, more terrorism will lead to increasing anti-Palestinian sentiment worldwide and increased support for Israel, thus postponing the need for Israel to negotiate.<br>
<br>
Decreased terrorism will lead to increasing sympathies for the Palestinians worldwide and increased pressure on Israel to negotiate.<br>
<br>
Terrorism will not make the Israelis give in, nor will it make the Americans support the Palestinians.  It only hurts their cause, it does nothing to help it.  The problem is they are too stupid to realize it and think they can bully the Israelis into submission.  It isn't going to happen.  I think it would have happened already if it were going to.  All we have seen is Israel hardening its stance against them.<br>
<br>
I agree with Ayiar as well.  Even if you classify terrorism as a part of war, it's a part of war that I think the world should discourage by not supporting anyone that employs it.  Thus, resorting to terrorism will do more harm than good for your cause and fewer people will use it.<br>

I can't say what Arafat's motivation is.

  I'm sorry Anywon maybe I missed your point, you didn't feel that the WTC incident was an act of terrorism, just because it affected &quot;economic capacity&quot;?  How about the millions of people that were afraid to fly for a year afterwards, or the people that will no longer go into a building taller then 10 stories.  Was I the only one that saw the fear and tears on peoples faces after this?   I know that just watching it on TV, here in Texas made me very afraid for months afterwards.    You said yourself that terrorism is designed to cause fear in people, they could not have done this any better.  I for one do not think it was a blow to our economy.  It was terrorism pure and simple. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
