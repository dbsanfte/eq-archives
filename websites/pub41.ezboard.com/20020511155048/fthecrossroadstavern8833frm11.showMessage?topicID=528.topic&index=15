<br>
Dumbing it down so it's easier to comprehend is BS! I like the fact that it's taken me 7 months to be a &quot;competent&quot; player. I'm not in the highend game yet, but working towards it.<br>
<br>
Same goes for breaking weapons. I didn't have half of my gear till I was in my 30s or 40s. I'll be damed if I have to replace my KD or Wu Stick because I shattered it on a something's head. I'm a frikkin monk, I can't afford that!<br>
<br>
What This game has it's problems, but I prefer it to this POS they are offering next year. If they take my beloved EQ away, they will lose me and many others as a customer <p><BR>

<br>
In EQ there were necros, they used to be looked upon in awe because of their mighty power.  Verrant nerfed them to shit so badly that most people quit playing them.  However, those necros still found the game of EQ fun, and still wanted to play it, so they could easily level them selves up rather quickly to join their friends as a more usefull class, say, hmmm a rogue.<br>
<br>
Now, lets look at EQ2.  You find yourself as a level 200 somethingerother, the awe of your fellow players.  Verrant nerfed you to shit, and now you can't solo an orc pawn.  What are you going to do?  It is no longer reasonable for you to level that rogue up and join your friends.  You are now stuck with your useless, used to be uber class that was decided on to be too powerfull and in need of taking a back seat.<br>
<br>
Let's take the idea of item decay now, along with the above statement.  Your equipment is always going to need one of two things, upgraded all together, or repaired.  This is going to cost alot of money, thereby giving you little to spend on anything else.  One of the joys of EQ is getting yourself a solid set of gear so you can concentrate on other things.  Not possible now.<br>
<br>
Remember all that time we spent in ToV Stalk?  Anyone else that has farmed nearly a full set of armor for EVERY member of their guild?  Sure, it's a solid set of armor, you can still get upgrades in NToV or whatever but those are like bonuses, a full set of ToV gear was a major goal and when people had it and we could move on it was like a relief........not anymore.  Now the armor farm never ends.  You always need to upgrade, you always need to repair, to be elite, top of the game, you now have to Farm the ToV of EQ2 forever.  Sound fun?<br>
<br>
The idea of weapons breaking is just sad.  I mean really.  Remember how pissed people would get in VP when their fishing pole broke?  Yeah, multiply that by a zillion times cause let me tell you....a fishing pole is one thing, you can go to the vendor to buy a new one, just a minor inconvinience.  Imagine now when your SoD breaks.  That's right, sleeper was awoken for one reason or another, and VI won't be putting it back cause....well dynamic content right? (HAHAHA).  Looks like your weapon is now irreplaceable.  Hell, it don't even have to be a player caused removal of equipment like that, see Ring of Vulak for details.<br>
<br>
Now tell me why I shouldn't be skeptical?  The above observations and opinions are some stuff that could ahve been easily fixed/removed in EQ.  Make warders respawn, keep Kerafrym in Sleepers, get rid of the gay ass ring of vulak, all could be done quite easily but havn't been.  Why?  Could it be they are too busy working on a new expansion, new game, new legends server, new console version of the game, new board game version of the game, more fan faires?  I can't be sure but I bet my left testicle it has something to do with it.  So you tell me, why wouldn't they be doing the same thing with EQ2?  I learn by example folks, and until verrant shows me that they are willing to fix their errors I have no reason to believe that they will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujunchoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>junchoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/02 2:38:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=528.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So what</span><hr size=1> &quot;I dunno but if they discontinue eq1 someone is gunna get a rocket shoved up their ass.&quot;<br>

<br>
What sucks about this whole thing is that mostly everyone who still play feel they invested something on their toons, and EQ2 shows players the vision(tm) clearly, Verant is here for your money.<br>
<br>
Verant is milking EQ hard (from Legends to price increase to expansions) and they do not plan to invest any further.  They have to compete with what other companies have, real competitors.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as long as I enjoyed the ride, it's money well spent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujakula.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jakula</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/02 10:26:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=528.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;so let me get this right.. new_eqwarrior_100 gets super uber sword, new_eqwarrior_100 farms lowlevel_mob_15, shit super uber sword breaks....<br>
I can see it now, the first time a high end item breaks verant starts to recieve letter bombs. DOH. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
<br>
They will be repairable and have some form of durability visible to the player. I played UO for a long time ( open beta for a little under 4 year ) , I also player AO , Lineage , Diablo2 , and now play DAoC. I found when EA were working on UO2 they found it not finacially viable to compete in the market with themselves and I think SOE are going to find the same and EQ will eventually die. <br>
<br>
With all the new games emerging I dont see where SOE intend to get thier player base from. With Shadowbane, SWG, WOW entering the market these games will take away from EQ's player base  then EQ2 takes away from that player base again the time we put into EQ will be worthless. Servers will get fewer and fewer until there is only one left and you will find EQmore unsupported than it currently is. <br>
<br>
EQ tradeskill system sucks , UO has the best system I have seen closly followed by DAoC.<br>
<br>
UO was the game that defined the MMORPG genre ( not start, it was the one people took notice of ). <br>

Instead you buy NPC vendors that make you stuff that you define the price of...whether its magical or whatnot. I'm guessing the better stuff the more expensive the NPC and there will be some randomness in it possibly...like a newb NPC smith who has a talent for making exceptionally lightwieght plate armor?...dunno I'd rather see that then mine all day just get 1 damn blackrock ore...course when me and my friends all got togather to do a days worth of minning we'd end up with about 1000 of each ore *sept I sucked at minning so I became the &quot;smelt boy&quot; and did all the ore one at a time* lol those were cool days, &quot;SMELT BOOOOY!!&quot;....then we go make portals to the bank and watch dumb newbs walk in them while they find themeselves trapped in a parafield and we'd flamestrike them to death *MUHUHAHAHAHAHA*...<br>

hahahaha i busted out laughing in class today. Everyone thought i was a total freak for that.<br>
<br>
Anyhow that was great.<br>
<br>
BTW, what i meant about UO was it was the first BIG MMORPG.<br>
<br>
There were always games out before that, including MUDDs, but thats not the point. UO was the first to hit big in such a small amount of time.<br>
<br>
Im just happy i was at the begining of the whole &quot;MMORPG&quot; era.<br>
<br>
No i dont think eq1 will last forever, but hell if im gunna let them finish it off without me finishing half the stuff i want. <p><left><a href=http://pub49.ezboard.com/bdbn><img src=http://www.sonic.net/~goodrow/nation/sig.gif border=0></a></left> <center><font color="yellow"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7690" target="newframe"> Baron Badd Inglorin</a></font><br>
