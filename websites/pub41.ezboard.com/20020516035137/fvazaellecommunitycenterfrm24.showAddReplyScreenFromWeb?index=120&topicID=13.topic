If it was the motive then congrats he only dropped 2 items. In any case I will be sure to watch for that kind of thing in the future and payment in kind can be arranged.<br>

I don't think there is a good way for me to answer any of it. I can only say that it's sad that someone resorts to calling me a &quot;skanky she-male bitch&quot; and a &quot;spineless coward&quot;. If I somehow missed the fact that I have a pair of nuts and a penis, please let the me and the rest of my family know. Did it make you feel better to belittle me?<br>
<br>
Cure has asked the question in his other post. Why was IV there so late at night when they knew that Sacred Fires and The Endless were having a joint raid? Raif said he was bored; Rhyu says it's because they could; Malathor says that being moral is boring, and that it's just a game geez; Ghol was there to kill a god. So I'd like an answer from the 29 other present members at that raid. You must have seen that what we were attempting was something new and something that was almost unthinkable a month ago. So why were the rest of you there?<br>
<br>
Why is Endless being flamed for using CotH to get down to a raid? We're being flamed for breaking down to Trak (not the Agony thing) with 10 people, when the origins of this thread are about how IV uses a break team to get to a safe spot to CotH people down to the raid.<br>
<br>
What has happened here is basically what a couple people have been saying all along. That we should not be friends with IV, because they are friends with us to leech members, to make us their feeder guild. It's easy for someone in IV to send me a tell insulting me on how our guild can't do shit on our own, and yet is it recognized anywhere that The Endless members were there to help with Gorenaire, Dain raids, Cazic raids? No. Amadar and Devast helped with Gorenaire. I know at least Nukuki and Thynn were on Dain raids. Nukuki took 7 deaths on a IV Cazic raid. And then one day, The Endless wanted something that IV had to have. And gosh darn it that seriously pissed them off. Suddenly we were jackoffs and selfish greedy people who were SO gay as to call of the hero people down to the shrooms area. Endless members helped out IV on many an occasion, and yet when the way is reversed, you guys act in an exact opposite manner. And you wonder why some people in The Endless don't want to port, group, or rez you guys. <br>
<br>
I have stated officially that the choice to deny services to IV or Agony members is an *individual* choice. And I have said that if someone wishes to deny such members services, they are to do so in a cordial manner. If they haven't done so, it's because they as individuals are too upset to listen to what I suggest. If several members of TE have refused to offer you a service, that is their right. I agree that judging an entire guild by their tag is unfair, but when those people are standing there doing that deed that pissed you off with that guild tag on, how can you fault them for holding a grudge?<br>
<br>
Okay, my epics. I don't have to defend myself, but I will. I would have thought that of all people, Menexia would understand that the majority of the druid epic is done by the druid. I asked for guild assistance on two occasions, one for Ulummp, and another for Faydedar. I was the highest level druid in the guild and I was ready for Faydedar. My guild was happy to help me.<br>
<br>
Those in The Endless know that Gurgu is not my &quot;alt&quot;. I have two primaries, and I leveled both of them so that they could be of maximum use on guild raids. Gurgu is 58, Kaminya is 59. Up until the time Blaque joined the guild, Gurgu was the highest level warrior and up until Quarken stayed up for 50+ hours, she was the second highest level warrior. Another warrior got our first indicolite breastplate. Blaque, who had only recently joined, got the first warrior epic in The Endless. How many of you would have passed the epic you were being built up for to someone who had recently joined? And as it has been stated, the previous loot system of TE was a voting system. Where every member had a vote on who they felt was most deserving of a certain epic piece. Gurgu won the first hand of maestro by a guild vote, and no one can ever vote for themselves. Back then Maestro was a big deal to us, and people voted knowing that whoever got the hand would most likely be the first with epics should the day ever arrive. As ready as I was, with Blaque having NO golem ball, I passed on the Ancient Blade off of our first Queen raid. Three vermiculated tunics have dropped, and Kaminya does not wear a single one of them. Quarken and Slambam got our dual cobalt breastplates. It was hard, but I wanted them to be happy. Yes, I wear ES greaves, but I was the only druid present at the raid. So go ahead and talk some more shit about how selfish I am. I'm sure the bad stuff you've heard about me come from sources who couldn't milk our guild for what they wanted.<br>
<br>
I don't really understand what Kaziqueal is saying, is it that he thinks we gave Cazic the star ruby earring?<br>
<br>
Vulp, I didn't appreciate the BE bp because it was an empty offer in attempt to save face. Tell me honestly, would Krimzin have walked over and handed Nukuki a Donal's breastplate?<br>
<br>
Menexia, we ganked Sev without giving Agony a first shot? Tanth was yelling at people to stay back at camp, that we were not to interfere with Agony's attempt in any way. Quarken got an earful for trying to see what his health was at when Sev came within fearing distance of us. None of us could even SEE Sev when Agony began fighting.<br>
<br>
This comes from the other thread, but I fail to see the similarity between a game of Starcraft and a situation in EverQuest seeing as how the sole objective of a Starcraft game is to eliminate your opponent. And yes, I know how Starcraft is played, I played on Kali for well over a year. Actually, nevermind.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are likely more issues I'd like to address, but it's 5 am in paradise and I've gotta head off to bed. So good evening and good morning to you all.<br>

Yes I greatly miss your valuble contributions to my groups miri, bye.<br>
<br>
Oh and Cuminya answer my question please - since its OK in TE's book to pull a mob and kill it when another guild is pulling its guards, its OK for us to kill trak when you pull the protector right?  Its OK for us to kill cazic when you have cleared the plane and are finishing up the temple pull?  I think krim and the other people who killed CT the other night were pretty FUCKING courtous to even give you one shot after what you did to us at VS.  I really like how you respond to one little thing in my post but ignore the real issue.  But gratz on you having 10% of the epics in your guild, WTG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24>VCC Archives</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
