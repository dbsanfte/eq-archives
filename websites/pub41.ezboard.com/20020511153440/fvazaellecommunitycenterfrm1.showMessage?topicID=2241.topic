Prime Time here in the U.S. appear to be about 10pm CST.<br>
The last week at 10pm I have gone to the following zones<br>
SK<br>
DL<br>
LOIO<br>
Oasis<br>
Everfrost<br>
Now on Vazaelle at this time these zones total on average 179 people at 10pm<br>
On the new Bayle server at 10pm they average 24 people total.<br>
Now that tells me that the new Bayle server is empty. Heck last night there was not a single person at the Aviak tree or PAW and other than me, only one person in the zone.<br>
OK, so I then sort the servers by population.<br>
There is BAyle at number 4 on the list, the 2 ahead of Bayle were the PvP servers, and number one lowest populated server?<br>
You got it Legends. There are not enough people playing on that server to even make up a group. <br>
So now you know why our rates are going up.<br>

<br>
AB &amp; the new amsterdam based server are euro servers. Try checking the server around 3am 11am, I am sure you will see the over all population to be greater than you expected.<br>
<br>
also AB is a split server so the populace is more inclined to be higher level on avg. so chardock/hs/velk/ntov/funggrove/maiden eye etc... will be more populated than the zones you listed.<br>
<br>
The cost hike is simple good business daoc and others charge this rate, you paying for more development and salary increases as cost of living &amp; tenure on job merit pay increases. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ergoline>Ergoline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 11:34:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2241.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legends being paid for by new rate increase by us</span><hr size=1> It's true that Stormhammer is usually the lowest-population server, and its true that at the times you list, the Euro servers are also very low-populated. Ragin Cajun is right - check it about 3 pm Central - that's 10pm in most of Europe, 9pm in the UK - and the Euro servers are among the most populated. Vazaelle is almost always one of the least populated US &quot;blue&quot; servers, and frankly, I like it that way. My daughter plays on Bristlebane, which is at the other end of the population spectrum.<br>
<br>
I also think he's right about the rate increases. My family has three accounts, and I'm not complaining. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uthumpslots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thumpslots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 12:10:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2241.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legends being paid for by new rate increase by us</span><hr size=1> You missed the point here.<br>
Legends is a U.S. server.<br>
At 10pm it should be at its peak population as are all other U.S. servers.<br>
At 10PM it is less than AB.<br>
I know that AB is fine and has plenty of people, that is not the issue, the point is that at the prime time when the most people are on, it (Legends) is still lower in population than the emtpy AB server.<br>
I am not even knocking the rate increase, it has been 3 years and is not a shock.<br>
But I would bet that without the failure of the LEgends server we would not have seen this.<br>

<br>
It is a server full of lvl 50+ ppl, it was not intended to be a low/mid lvl server. Hence all the action such as marauders mire, new CT. Defenitely not planned for a lvl 20 bumpkin.<br>
<br>
I am confused because you orginilly stated in the title legends then went on to use bayle as a naexample of low populace.<br>
<br>
Believe me stormhammer has plenty of ppl hi end game to offset the lack of low lvl players. And at 39.95 -vs- 9.95 you would expect a smaller player base, and each acct has a higher value to cost ratio.<br>
<br>
legends acct / regular acct = 3 reg acct's based on fees so less population is ok once divided by 3 for an expected server load.<br>
<br>
So in other words if they have around 1k accts moved over they are still making more there than they are on regular servers with 3k player base. And they did reach a waiting list of ppl wanting to move, so that means they have 8000 accounts moved over total.<br>
<br>
BELIEVE me there are plenty of players on stormhammer, just none in the dink zones you mentioned. I mean if the player base is lvl 50+ more or less wtf would they be doing in sk, dl, loio, ot,... Like I said hit CT, Acrylia caverns, fungus grove, maidens eye , etc... you will find ppl. Hell there is usally 130 ppl in bazaar alone 8pm eastern time zone. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uxxragincajunxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xX Ragin Cajun Xx</A> at: 3/29/02 11:28:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukaziqueal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1317<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 12:35:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2241.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legends being paid for by new rate increase by us</span><hr size=1> A high ranking GM was saying to Krurk that 46% of the SH population is 55+ so you're numbers are wrong since the sample zones are based on areas where a large disparity exists between the two servers.<br>

<br>
A low population is hardly an indicator of success or failure, especially because we don't know what kind population levels they projected for the server and how much the average Legends subscriber plays.<br>
<br>
To say that Legends is the cause of the price hike is a wild and unsubstantiated conjecture.  <br>

<br>
Legends ALWAYS appears top of the list regardless of population, I had Iviy's machine crash out and had to log back in a few days back when they had all those locked servers(after the patch) -- while logging her on, because I was busy running my comp as well, I saw them open to Locked servers, which both according to the population order would have had more people than Legends where Vac was sitting in Bazaar and /who was reporting over 120 people...<br>
<br>
Unless more than 120 people logged on in about 30 sec and there was no one else in any other zone on Legends, I believe it always appears on top period... especially since part of the propaganda to get people join was relatively low population it would look bad if it 'appeared' like some servers were less full...<br>
<br>
Oh and as an FYI, get out of your parent's basement and step into the real world, nothing in this world has had a static price for a significant length of time since the 1950's - EQ's price would go up in time regardless.<br>
