As I said, A says it was likely someone from an IP the same or close to his, B says he responded as someone who knows more than they admit, period. Yes, maybe Baldrik didn't do it himself, maybe he was at a netcafe and a friend or some other random EQ player in the cafe that he didn't know altered it, but as you go down the list it gets less and less realistic.<br>
<br>
And what everyone doesn't understand is... UNTIL THIS THREAD... tell me of any time someone from CC has mentioned your stance on the Planes in a public forum, there has been no mention of your stance on the planes... this is compounded by the fact that for the first THIRTY minutes of the conversation - not talking 1-2 tells back and forth, we're talking 30 minutes - is when Baldrik made mention of it. <br>
<br>
If I was in his shoes and I truly didn't want to abuse the calendar to fit my day-to-day whims like it seems he does, I would've answered right off the bat from the first tell... &quot;Sorry your post got deleted, but it wouldn't have changed anything we don't respect the calendar&quot; ... instead of him neglecting to say that until he'd exhausted any trying to navigate around the point. And once he mentioned Planes are FFA to Caer, I told him I disagreed and most of the server had disagreed in past discussion(although perhaps this is a dated statement) and that I felt it was better that he re-evaluate his stance to make the server better for all guilds.<br>
<br>
And you'll note, who started this thread... who threatened anyone's reputation? Just because I was going to check into an IP for my own curiousity means what? I guess all of you wouldn't check to see how money was drawn out of your bank account if it was suddenly down $500 from what you remembered it. My intention was to deal with it on a one-on-one basis with Baldrik which I was as happy as I could be with the conclusion considering his attitude that his post above clearly shows.<br>
<br>
And as for IV using the calendar... look at the raids they do... they do single target kills without, which the server long ago deemed FFA... and they do zone/planes reservations with in the cases where another guild might end up doing it as well.(as an example Fear) <p>-Vaclav Romanov, 54 Erudite Vicar<BR>Sacred Fires<BR>Vazaelle<BR>Junkyard Dog of SF<BR>All rants are trademarked by me and<BR>are my opinions not those of SF =P</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzozz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zozz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.virtualnashua.com/zozzicon.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/27/01 4:33:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The calendar</span><hr size=1> <br>
I have stated in every post that I have ever written that it would be nice if everyone could schedule stuff or check the schedule before just doing whatever.<br>
<br>
Lord knows that would take 5 minutes to do, which is a completely unreasonable waste of time. <br>
<br>
People who have no consideration for others really make me sad.  So. thanks for everyone who admits they are simply self-important people without regard for the time and planning other people might have invested trying to plan  their guild activities and cooperate with the other children.  <br>

From what I gather, it has been stated by your leadership that while you do not post your raids on the calander, you see what is posted and if something is already reserved, you move on and do something else.  I'm sure that whoever deleted the post thought it would look better for him and his guild and would feel more comfortable of going up there, rather than seeing the post there, stating that Planes aren't reservable and going up there and &quot;stealing&quot; the Planes away from the guild that stated their intetions of going up at that time.  <br>
<br>
Nobody wants to look like the bad guy.  So if you delete the post and go up to Growth--you can just say that you didn't know someone was going to be there.  <br>
<br>
It's not law or rule breaking we are talking about--we are talking about PR and reputation.  While it may feel good for some to be all tough and do whatever they want.  Many like to do what is right and try to play nice.  I think the deleting of the post (if it is in fact true) was more of a way to &quot;save face&quot;, than to avoid breaking a &quot;rule&quot;--a rule that your side does not really observe at all.  <br>
<br>
There are no laws or rules that any of us must abide by.  But I would hope that because this is a game, we would attempt to make it as enjoyable for each other as possible.  <br>
<br>
While ideally, it would be nice to be able to do whatever you want, whenever you want.  But in EQ, like other things in life that is not so.  I learned at a very young age that sharing is good.  Being generous is good.  Just because you can beat down some Giant in 30 seconds or clear the home of the Gods in a day doesn't change that.  Sharing and compromising is good and the right thing to do...  <br>
<br>
Anyway...  I personally come from a server where the top guilds put most of the major uber spawns (Trak/VS/Sev/Etc) on a rotational basis.  Since the spawn times were fairly well known, each guild would have their set day at taking down that Uber Mob.  It was nice and simple.  Everyone got their shot at doing the big things.  No fighting.  No arguments.   <br>
<br>
I'm relatively new to this game.  I've only played on one server, so I don't have the bad taste in my mouth of FFA's and fighting for spawns on a major scale like many of you others do.  I guess I am a &quot;sheletered&quot; EQ player.  Because I've only seen people rotate on uber-spawns, I thought that's how everyone did it.  <br>
<br>
I guess I was wrong.  If people can fight over Aviaks and Gnolls and Frenzy--what's to say people won't fight over the bigger things.  I would guess that the fighting would get even worse as the stakes got higher.  <br>
<br>
I play this game to have fun.  I play this game to do things different and new.  But I respect the other people I play with--and I want them to enjoy the game as well.  <br>
<br>
Nagafen has been up for a few days now.  Celestae has it on the calandar.  I, personally would like that dragon to go down so that the Clerics who need to kill Zordak will get their shot.  I know it would be pretty easy to take 30-40 peeps up to Sol B, buff 'em up, send 'em in and gank that Dragon to allow Ragefire to spawn.  But I won't do it.  As much as I want it to happen, I know how much it would mean to Celestae to gather together and take that damn Red Dragon down.  I know how it felt the first time I killed the Dragon (it's a rush and a nice accomplishment).  I also know how it feels to have something you have been planning for, get swiped right out from under your nose.  As much as you want something or as much as you need to do something--sometimes you just have to do the right thing...  <br>
<br>
I ask of everyone here...  not just the &quot;main&quot; guilds, but for everyone to help one another and work together.  There's a lot of cool stuff to do on this server.  It'll be so much more enjoyable to do all this cool stuff if we can do it without having to race or fight over it.  <br>
<br>
I'm really in favor of posting and notifying of intent to do raids/planes/mobs.  And I'm really in favor of people respecting those postings.  I'm also strongly in favor of a possiple rotation system.  <br>
<br>
I thank everyone for their time and hopefully we can work together to make Vazaelle a really cool &amp; fun server for all.<br>

A falame and my name is nowhere to be seen.  I kinda like that.<br>
<br>
For the record.  I'm in the states, and during the time in question I logged in and asked if they needed a Bard in PoG.  But I was a tad late..things were just being cleaned up when I logged in..*shrug*.<br>
<br>
I was a tad confused.  We were supposed to have been doing Hate, but Agony had already been there and cleared the place.<br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
THe problem with having a calendar and going by it is that EVERYONE has to buy into it.  For the record, I am actually pro-calendar, which goes against the general belief among the officers of my guild.  I came from a server that adhered to a calendar among all the big guilds, until one guild felt confident to ignore it, and then all the shit started.  SO I actually like calendars.<br>
<br>
The difference here on Vazaelle as opposed to Quellious, is that as soon as this calendar was started, it was stated by several guilds that it would be ignored.  SO its not like we had something that was used and it was then ignored.<br>
<br>
All this arguing is moot.  CC has had raid conflicts before where folks say "But we had it reserved".  Which, in a perfect world, would be enough to eject people from the plane or from the Uber MoB take down.<br>
<br>
It isn't a perfect world.  Or a perfect server.  On a perfect server there would be no conflicts, there wouldn't be a rants section, and everyone would get along.  It isn;t the case.  Even if Vazaelle had a working calendar system there would be cases like this, and accustions of deleting things off the calendar or modifying dates, or single people booking places for long periods of time (like a month, don't laugh it happens), or even when timeframes aren;t allowed for a month you'll get a single person and friends booking consequtive timeslots.  DIsallow that and you'll have different people from the same guild booking consequitive timeslots.  Stop that and you get guild deguilding members to book raids as independents and utilizing all time slots, then reguilding after the raid.  Cause technically they aren't part of that guild anymore and since that guild has been in PoG for 6 weeks straight....<br>
<br>
Well you get my drift I hope.<br>
<br>
That's the thing about having a system, and one this isn't perfect, and none are.  People will exploit it for their own gain and give grief to others in doing so.<br>
<br>
So, calendars are good.  People SAYING they are using it and then not doing it is bad.  People MANIPULATING the calendar is bad.  <br>
<br>
It only works if everyone is using and adhering to it.  Since its inception not everyone has.  Broken system from the start.<br>

k first of all being a techno weenie I gotta say somethin' here... if IPs remained static across the first 3 numbers for an ISP - being xxx.xxx.xxx.0-.255 that means each ISP gets 255 ip addresses and at max, 255 customers.  That doesn't work.  Unless you mean an ISP can have xxx.yyy.yyy.yyy where xxx is a static number and yyy is random - that doesn't make too much sense either.  That would only allow 255 ISPs in the whole world.  I wouldn't trust vaclav to analyze IPs.  <br>

I was just stating experience, with every ISP I have used, the first 3 integers did remain static(in the case of dial-up different one's depending on the number I called into), most of these being small local ISPs(All of which had a cap of... gasp.... 255 or less people using an individual dial-in number at one time), Cable or DSL(which both companies right in their flyers stated that the last integer is the only dynamic, and can be made static for I think $40 a month more for my cable modem I use now for example). The one that was an exception to this was when I had AO-Hell eons ago, in their case my IP changed quite frequently, usually I believe the first two stayed static in it's case, hard to remember though(this was around 8-9 yrs ago when the internet wasn't as huge of a draw as it is now, 65335 customers using it at one time does sound feasible to me)<br>
<br>
Funny how there's some people that when you quote personal experience and not expertise try to puncture holes in your arguments, but then those same people add little meaningful content of their own. Takes work to add something to this world and improve it, takes little effort to tear it down.<br>
<br>
So to completely state what I meant....<br>
<br>
Each cluster of the first 3 IP numbers can be tracked to an individual ISP, some of which have multiple 3 integer combos available to them, sometimes split across their user base in different ways I'm sure, in my life experiences, I have had to go to a seperate dial-up number as an example, to change those first three IP numbers.<br>
<br>
I did not say 'An individual ISP can only have one 3 number combo addressed to it and that's all that is available to an ISP' as you seem to respond.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll haul out one of my computer books I never read but always buy and see if I can get the full info about exactly how they're setup, as is, doesn't 255^4 total connections to the internet including sites that are up 24/7 seem like it would run out of available IP's at a rapid pace? Shrug, I'm curious now.. I'll read up and see how my hunches line up with reality...<br>

<br>
To get back to the original context of the question...<br>
<br>
The calender site doesn't use IP logging, as stated by the operators of the site. <br>
<br>
Baldrik plays from a games centre which will have a firewall/proxy set up, whereby all PCs will show as coming from a similar or identical IP number.  So had logging been in place you could certainly point the finger at someone in that centre, but not the individual PC, or more specifically the actual person making the change.<br>
<br>
As already stated, why would we(CC) change a calendar which we don't support?<br>
<br>
We're a very laid back guild, it just isn't something we'd stoop to.  We definitely have this GAME in perspective. Sabotage of calenders means someone somewhere has the importance of EQ a little out of proportion.<br>
<br>
*** Stop here if you need to stay alert! ***<br>
<br>
Now the techie stuff:<br>
<br>
An IP address is made up from a network address and host address combined.  Which numbers(octets) change in your IP address will depend entirely on how the network you are attaching to is subnetted.  Most public networks are subnetted down to a network address which includes the first 3 octets(i.e. 10.11.12.x) and often some of the 4th octet.  This is to make the most efficient use of the limited IP addresses available on the internet.  That leaves the 4th octet for the host number, usually using from 1 to 254.<br>
<br>
To get around the IP address shortage there are 3 designated ranges of IP addresses that will not be routed on the internet.  The ranges are 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x and 192.168.x.x.  Any company in the world can safely use these addresses for it's internal addressing, as long as all PCs/servers which are directly attached to the internet use a valid public address.  That usually includes firewalls and proxy/mail servers.<br>
<br>
The next version of IP, version 6, combines the hosts hardware address with it's network address.  That gives a guarenteed unique address for any PC.  The number of network addresses has also been massively increased allow many more IP addresses to be supported.<br>

<br>
I really don't know much of what else needs to be said? Some very good points were brought up earlier by Kead that some people have seemed to ignore in favor of flaming each other. <br>
<br>
Anyway, here is my own personal opinion:<br>
<br>
We (my guild) was in S RO today buffing up and getting ready to teleport to hate when we find out that The Endless had booked this place for like 4am PST (the time was approx 6:30pm PST). Since we are not a calander posting guild the majority of us wanted to go since we spent the greater part of a couple of hours dicking off for everyone to get ready. However some of our members have friends in The Endless and opposed going. Great, whatever, so Krialis (officer) decides to try an offer a compromise - We port up, farm normal spawns and leave the minis for The Endless's raid. <br>
<br>
Now, in my book coming from a guild that doesn't book the calander that was a pretty nice offer. Basically we were saying &quot;Hey, you're not going to be up here until 9 hours from now, so we are gunna go up and farm for random drops and leave you the sure things, plus a good respawn when you finally get your butts in gear&quot;. The response we got from The Endless was less than thrilling so we just called it off. <br>
<br>
The real kick in the ass is that the servers are going down at 3am PST. We could have killed Hate, farmed our minis and The Endless would have to delay their raid for like 3 hours anyway since the server was down and have a fresh Hate to farm. Now, I realize that no one usually knows Verant is going to blow up the servers so this was sort of a random occurance, but really it kind of had me grinning from irony there for a bit.<br>
<br>
Anyway thats besides the point. My deal is this: Most mobs spawn at a rate where you can really have 2 shifts farming a plane in any 24 hour period pretty realistically. Now, I think someone who wants to go up there and farm well ahead of your scheduled raid shouldn't catch heat for it. I think the attitude really kind of pissed off several members since we felt we were offering a real generous comprimise. I think the net effect is probably going to be that we are going to be alot more secretive about where we are going and when and this is a real shame. I really prefer for people to work things out in a rational manner, but what can you do after the fact? <br>
<br>
You would think that enough people on this server come from other servers that were established enough to know how the end game evolves into a bunch of people scrambling to hit spawns after the servers come up. Instead of trying to reach some sort of utopean reservation system nirvana (which btw, will absolutely never ever ever happen, because if it was possible it would have been done already), people should just *try* (and i stress try heavily) to be cool about the inevitable toe stepping that is going to happen. I mean, doesn't it strike anyone else as slightly crazy that we have 3 pages of bickering over if someone maliciously deleted a reservation from a raid calander? It strikes me as odd anyway :0<br>
<br>
FYI my views are probably not 100% in line with Agony as a whole, I suggest if you want the real deal about what our policy is you talk to Serafina in game and find out for yourself. Sera is the leader, I am just a footsoldier.<br>

Sorry about the rant, but this was going to be my first Hate raid. During all the previous ones I had to work. Grr.<br>

Yes I know, &quot;We tried it and it didnt work&quot;.<br>
<br>
My point is this, to get your toon to a high enough level to even go on this type of raid and be invited on a regular basis should indicate that you have the ability to act like an adult and work/get along with others. Yah right! <br>
<br>
The problem is with the spoiled brats behind the screens screaming out, I'll take it when I want it regardless of what you say! and screw any one else. Same type of attitude school children have on the playground, fortunately &quot;most&quot; of them grow out of it and learn how to get along with the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
And before you start in on me, yes I know its just a game. That still doesn't mean you have to act like an ass. Those of you that don't believe in scheduling (FFA) contend that &quot;Hey if we show up somewhere and it's taken, we go elsewhere, no problem.&quot; Bullshit, its human nature to be disappointed and I'll bet you are as dissapointed if one of your unscheduled spawns is taken as I am when one of my scheduled spawns is.<br>
<br>
I don't think the reason that many of us wish to use a schedule needs to be clarified, but I'd be glad to discuss it. And yes there are flaws in any system. <br>
<br>
I'm just trying to come up with a solution. I'd prefer to avoid the crap that occurs on other servers with guilds rushing mobs and training each other.<br>

Even if you do manage to have the people it a) fucks people who want to do the plane the night before, b) fucks people who want to do the plane that night.  Last I checked the endless isn't a Euro guild, I seriously doubt they were planning on having a force available at 7am that could do all the spawns and have it respawn by that night (12 hour respawn).  Basically by scheduling it for a weekday morning you're saying &quot;we're more important than you, we deserve to have a plane 2 days in a row&quot;.  This is why I've never been a fan of a calender system.  Its f'ing lame in my opinion.  The best system is FCFS, if there's no one in a plane go do it.  If there's a mob up you want to kill and there isnt a sufficient force to kill it gathering there, just do it.<br>
<br>
I came from an original production server and was in a very powerful guild.  The server was FCFS.  Pre ROK it sucked, there was jack to do and too many people trying to do it.  People rushed on server up to kill crap, and people got upset when we supposedly &quot;monopolized&quot; stuff by the mere fact of being the best.  But you know what, there's more bitching and accusations of hax0ring and other crap here, on a 6 month old server, than there ever was on veeshan, and to be honest I'm getting pretty fucking fed up with the BS that goes on on this server.  I'm getting to the point where I regret coming back to EQ for a chance to play on a new server from day one, and I sure as hell didn't expect it to look like this in 6 months, in a lot of different ways. <p><img src='http://www.strike9.com/eq/Vehn/fullsize/vehnsig.jpg'>
