Silver Silk leggings are in fact, the gold standard for shit loots.  All other shitty loots can be defined by just how close they are to being as shitty as silversilk leggings.  Something like a yak, is really only like 3% as shitty as a silversilk leggings, while something like serpentine bracers are fully 80% as shitty.  Bracers of woven grass I would put around the 60% range, people will actually wear them until they get something better, but they are in fact pretty shitty for all that.  <br>
     Btw, ny stupid weapon that comes from sarnaks and has a ratio of like 3 damage for 57 delay is about 99.73% as shitty as silversilk leggings, auctioneers in east commons please take note of this.  Being farmable by a solo druid adds like 5%, too.<br>
<br>
At some point it rolls over and you start to look at how cool it is compared to the BFG (see REKS)<br>
<br>
I hope that clears this up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvehn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/01 4:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Im just gonna go ahead and play devil's advocate...</span><hr size=1> argh they are at least are useful to someone somewhere.. grr.

<br>
Because there are not facial expressions or inflection of voice, part of the message gets lost in text.  Not to mention mis-reading, typos or wording things wrong.  <br>
<br>
I really think this thing got blown out of proportion when Vehnn informed Maniak that the Magi was dead and what he dropped.  <br>
<br>
Usually, when someone dies they are not happy.  If I got a comment such that Vehnn made (You told maniak, 'legs btw keke')--it can be interrepeted in a few ways (even more possilby):<br>
<br>
1)  I'm informing you what just dropped--it was rubbish.  <br>
2)  hehehe.  You got owned by the Magi, but it didn't drop anything.<br>
3)  (Hmmm...SMR dropped, but fuck I don't want them to know.)  Oh yah, it was nothing.  <br>
<br>
Remember, you are upset that you died to a Mob you shoulda killed that has the potential to drop a pretty nice piece of loot.  It is very possible you will overreact.  Then the person on the other side, especially if they were being helpful will get defensive if wrongly accused and will probably get aggressive back.  One thing leads to another...  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry that this incident happened.  I'm sorry it got to be this big.  I tried to control is before things got out of hand.  <br>
<br>
As for guildmates making posts.  I am not sayin what they said was correct or not, but I know that when one of my own gets attacked, I'm going to stand up for them.  Pretty much everyone defends their guildmates when something goes public like this.  If you don't stand up for your own &quot;family&quot;--who will?  <br>
<br>
I really hate arguments.  I really hate fighting among people/guilds/etc...  I hope people can be more patient with one another and try to act calmly and discuss things before blowing things up and posting and blah-blah-blah.  <br>
<br>
BTW--I find speaking with an officer/guild leader/fellow guildmate that you know is often a very effective way of rectifying a situation.  Arguing with the person you are having a dispute with will usually get you nowhere.  Talking to a third party or an authority in the organization you are trying to deal with may help things out.  (If you have a problem with any of peeps--feel free to give me a /tell if I'm on-line).  <br>
<br>
This is a stupid incident that was blown way out of proportion.  I'm sure there are other stupid things we can talk about--like my hairy feet or something.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for your time...<br>

P.S.  On a side note--every statement, made by an individiual should be treated as such.  Although I or Tanth or Quarken do represent The Endless, it doesn't mean our statements are necessarily the stance of The Endless as a guild.  <br>
<br>
Every so often, they let me off my very potent drugs and I will claim to make some official statement for my guild, but usually Kami &quot;the boss&quot; Berrypicker will be making official statements regarding the guild.  I'll usually think that all other statements from other peeps will usually represent themselves--and that Krim, Kead &amp; the others represent the offical guild statements.

Vehnn and Kyrana said it themselves that after they talked to Bakxs Maniak backed off...  Yet Kyrana starts off a post here with: "Maniak and Myrya, fucking dumbasses".<br>
<br>
Is that a way to bury the hatchet?  No, that's pretty inflammatory.  Maniak was out of line to ask for the drop, he was imo silly to keep up the conversation, but to go and flame em on a board after he backs off seems "out of line: if you ask me.  But then again this is sposed to be a rant board where there are no lines so anything goes.  That's cool.  Yet Vehnn calling me out of line for pointing out his obvious hypocrisy...well heh that's only more hypocrisy on his part.<br>
<br>
2) Nowhere did I say anything about thinking Maniak was right or that he should have gotten the crap leggings or SMR if it had dropped.  I don't think he should have even asked.  (Course he didn't initiate the conversation, Vehnn did, but that's another story).   My point, which Vehnn has never addressed, is the fact that he is getting upset over being called a liar when it seems pretty obvious to me that he is one.  <br>
<br>
3) I'll summarize again why Vehnn has got to be the biggest moron this side of Bled.  <br>
<br>
Why did Vehnn kill the AM?<br>
To get the SMR. <br>
<br>
Is that cool?<br>
Of course, AM can drop SMR which he "needs" or "wants", there's nothing wrong with him killing the AM to get it.<br>
<br>
So why pretend that he doesn't want the SMR? <br>
No idea at all, maybe he felt guilty, maybe he's just a moron.  He claims in the log to not want the SMR, that he's there powerlevelling a twink or something.  Umm...where's the twink? <br>
<br>
So does that make him an idiot?  <br>
Nope it just makes him a liar.<br>
<br>
So why is he an idiot?<br>
Because he posts a log of him lying then gets all indignant about being called a liar.<br>
<br>
Ok Q&A done.  So what's his gameplan now?  Well when confronted with his hypocrisy he ignores it and sends in the wife to take off some heat with an argument over semantics.  Umm wait though, the wife says he doesn't NEED the SMR in one post but says he does NEED the SMR in another.  Ponder.<br>
<br>
Anyway, gameplan now must be to avoid the issue.  DILUTE! OBFUSCATE! EVADE!  These are more than valid tactics in the world of forum warfare, moreso when you have a tag team partner to help you out.

The impression I have gotten from Vehnn (through the boards) before this even started is very similar to Bodil's entire post. I don't know you, Vehnn, or Kyrana, all I know is that on one hand you &quot;respect that Maniak backed off so fast&quot; and then on the other hand you insult him with your &quot;I had to call in my lvl 53 wurmslayer&amp;shiny brass shield wearing paladin friend&quot; post. This to me is wronging Maniak in ways that he does not deserve. He was there to help a friend of his camp the SMR, and when he called you a liar, he was saying you were lying about desting the silversilk leggings. Or in lighter terms that he couldn't believe you would dest them. I'm assuming that's because he doesn't know what silversilk leggings are.<br>
<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:31:24 2001] You told Maniak, 'already destroyed them'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:31:27 2001] Maniak tells you, 'What?'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:31:29 2001] Maniak tells you, 'come on'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:31:32 2001] Maniak tells you, 'ur lying'<br>
<br>
He was wrong to assume that you had gotten an SMR, and he was wrong to ask to pick up the leggings. The argument there is settled I think, we all agree they lost the rights to it. But I fully agree with Tanth's argument, I don't see why it's so hard to see the logic he presents. I don't see why you have to threaten Bodil in game (before his post here), or why you have to insult my guildmates and pretend to respect them at the same time.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this reflects bad on my guild no matter how many disclaimers I state, but I can't stand by and let a friend come under fire like this without trying to help.<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, read up on the other &quot;flame warriors&quot;, it's an excellent site and a very entertaining read. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Guess who Vaz's &quot;Acne&quot; is?

Since you are having a very HARD time understanding, I'll go slowly and use small words.  Pay attention this time son.<br>
<br>
1)  Maniak and Myrya accusing me of lying about the loot.  Maniak and Myrya implied, over and over, I was lieing about the loot.  To a mob they died to and had no claim over.  Maniak and Myrya are asses until I hear an in game apology.  Now was that so hard to understand?<br>
<br>
2)  HOW am I a LIAR?  WHERE did I FUCKING LIE?  Read my log again carefully dipshit.  Did <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> EVER say I NEEDED an SMR?  Kyr doesn't speak for me.  She has her own words and own opinions.  Her definition of &quot;need&quot; is that I &quot;need&quot; two smrs for both my epics.  Since I have no plans on doing my epics anytime in the near future I don't need an smr.  Nice double standard there Tanth.  Regardless once a fucking gain, how does my movitations have anything to do with the fact that they were being morons?  Yer just dodging the question.<br>

3)  Since you CAN'T understand this, I'll repeat AGAIN for the THIRD fucking time.  Since its a fucking hassle to get down there, I have a level 1 halfling rogue camped out in guk.  I log her on when I can't find a group or whatever and want to PL at AM, to see if its open.  In this case I did.  I saw the AM.  I logged her off and logged on Vehnn, who happened to still be camped out there.  I killed the AM.  Questions?  Yes I'm an obvious fucking liar, thx.<br>

It'd be nice if you understand exactly what *Bodil's little situation is before flaming me.  Here's the deal.  I've grouped with *Bodil in the past.  He's a decent player.  I thought that meant we respected each other.  I gave him a deal on a pair of BE gaunts for 2.5k.  He immediately posted on the board he was selling them for more than double what he paid me.  That says to me this person doesn't respect me.  People that don't respect me don't get invited into my groups, thats not a threat, thats a fact.  He later posts that he was trying to raise money to buy a weapon, and that he was sorry.  OK, thats cool, its not an in game apology, but its something.  I thought that was done with.  But apparently he still holds a little grudge because he flames me on this thread.  Whatever, what a big man.<br>
<br>
Let me explain to you what my typical day of everquest is.  I log on.  I do / all friends.  I do / all lfg 50 60.  I put together a group and go kill shit.  Lets see who I grouped with today:<br>
<br>
Saalron, who has had the shit flamed outta him on this board and someone I've mildly flamed myself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/Vehn/fullsize/saalron.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Kyr<br>
<br>
Deck from CC<br>
<br>
Ranath, who's had the shit flamed outta him on this board.<br>
<br>
And oh, some guy named Jahniratn, maybe you've heard of him.<br>
<br>
I don't care about guildtags, or the lack of them.  I don't form opinions about guilds by what a member does.  Fuck I formed with Narya yesterday, and I have my own opinions about SF from what an officer (not member) did to me a long ass time ago, but I don't hold grudges.  Maybe you should take a closer look at your own biases.  There's three people on this thread can't seem to understand that they were being asses.  Why don't you three take your own advice and pretend for a second you're not a member of the endless, and sum it up again:<br>
<br>
Maniak and Myrya are GIMPS for accusing me of lieing about the loot on a mob they were killed by, repeatedly.<br>
<br>
Maniak and Myrya will be !gimps if they apologized to me, in game, for being asses.  Hell, I would chalk it up to having a bad day, it happens.<br>
<br>
Hell, I'll even apologize for the wurmslayer comment.  That WAS out of line.  In my book, a paladin who wields a wurmslayer is a gimp.  But saying that on this board was lame of me, and I'm sorry for it.  I'll also apologize for calling them gimps for being killed by the AM, when they're level 55 wiz and 5x paladin, dispite the fact I see ebayed wonders like Yoon solo farming the AM at level 52.  *shrug* I don't know what happened.<br>
<br>
The basis of your and Tanth's &quot;argument&quot; against me is that I am a liar.  This isn't about me, its about your guildy being an ass.  Everyone else on this thread can see that, why can't you?<br>
<br>
Regardless, this is getting fucking old.  I'm tired of trying to explain repeatedly that these two were being dipshits.  Its readily apparent to everyone whos posted other than you three.  Just accept it and move on, chalk it up to a bad day, whatever, I don't care.  I'm right and you're wrong and this whole fucking board supports me, but feel free to make more nifty personal attacks Tanth and compare to me bled or whatever if that makes yer dick hard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usojurn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sojurn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/01 11:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.morellthule.com/sojurn.gif width=142 height=163></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vehnn will be here shortly, I'm sure ... </span><hr size=1> I guess the only thing that bothers me here is......<br>

I don't recall ever defending what Maniak and Myrya did. What I did do was bring up the fact that a) you are a liar, b) you are an idiot. Maybe I should have started a separate thread on your mental deficiency, but seeing as how the relevant material was in this thread, i posted here. As far as what I'm talking about, I would say that Maniak and Myrya being dipshits has nothing to do with this discussion but it's well documented what that phrase does to your type.<br>
<br>
In any case, let me make this extremely simple, two questions. Why did you kill the AM? Why were you in the AM room?<br>
<br>
Now to help you avoid the pitfalls of inconsistency that you seem to blithely fall into, I'll repost some material from your log.<br>
<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:49:04 2001] Maniak tells you, 'why were u in the AM room then? Just wanted to pick up SMR for no reason eh?'<br>

[Tue Jun 19 20:49:55 2001] You say, '&gt; smr'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:49:57 2001] Bakxs tells you, 'Who is giving you tells?'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:49:59 2001] You say, 'i dont need an smr'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:50:03 2001] You told Bakxs, 'both myrya and maniak'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:50:03 2001] Maniak says, 'Yes, WHY were u in the AM room then?'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:50:08 2001] Maniak says, 'Just answer me that'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:50:08 2001] You say, 'cause I pl there'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:50:10 2001] You say, 'ok?'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:50:16 2001] You say, 'any more questions?'<br>
<br>
Like I said before, if the answers were that you killed the AM for the SMR and that you were in the room because you saw the AM up...well hell that's the truth and there isn't a damn thing wrong with that. So umm, why couldn't you have just said that? Or is it true that you don't need the SMR, that as you imply you didn't kill the AM for the SMR, and that at the time you were in the room to powerlevel.<br>
<br>
So...for extra clarity I'll ask the questions that are the heart of the issue that I brought up, indeed the only one that I've been talking about, while you wined and dined in the nether realms of fancy. Why did you kill the AM and why were you in the AM room?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvehn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/22/01 12:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=53>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vehnn will be here shortly, I'm sure ... </span><hr size=1> Copy/paste, because I don't know how I can state this any differently:<br>

<br>
As to why I killed the AM, I killed it because its a rare spawn that drops a nice loot item thats required for both of my epics.  Vehnn was logged out there from the night before, so it was convient for me to kill it after I logged my lvl 1 on and saw it was up.  I kill rare spawn mobs that drop decent loot.  What exactly are you accuseing me of?  The quote you have listed there is me TRYING to explain to them that there's no reason for me to lie about the SMR, because I realistically have little to gain from it, and EVEN IF one actually DID drop, there's no way in hell I'm giving it to them.  Understand?<br>
<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:51:43 2001] Myrya says, 'are curious why u killed the AM at low HP'<br>
[Tue Jun 19 20:51:51 2001] You say, 'BECAUSE IT WAS THERE'<br>

<br>
You guys started it, and we shouldn't have replied, simply because there's obviously no coming to terms. You got support from &quot;this whole fucking board&quot; on the loot that dropped and the rights to it, something that even Tanth and I agree with as well, making it something that doesn't need any arguing.<br>
<br>
You don't like us, and we don't like you. You think you're right, we think we're right. There is clearly no making up, so let's just leave it at that and avoid each other in game and on these boards.<br>

Since you are so fond of profanity and vulgarity I'll try to use an example you can relate to:<br>
<br>
There's this strip club on 5th Ave that sometimes has 50cent beer happy hours.  You walk by one day to check if they have the special but it's too late and the beers are back to the normal price of $6 a pop.  You feel horny as shit though so you go in to see some T&amp;A.  On the way out you run into your mom and dad on the street.<br>
<br>
Pops looks at you and asks what you are doing in Club PootiTang and you respond by saying that you don't need to go to a club to see naked women cause you have Kyrana at home.  The old man doesn't buy it for a second and asks, &quot;So why were you in there?&quot;  To which you respond that you go there for the cheap drinks.  Pops looks at the sign that says happy hour is over and take a guess as to what he's thinking eh?<br>
<br>
Back to the topic at hand.  You say:<br>
<br>
&quot;The quote you have listed there is me TRYING to explain to them that there's no reason for me to lie about the SMR, because I realistically have little to gain from it, and EVEN IF one actually DID drop, there's no way in hell I'm giving it to them. Understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm no I don't understand.  You say even if it dropped you would keep it, so how does whether or not you NEED the SMR affect what benefit you get about lying?  You'd keep it either way.  I am guessing that this logic is too much for you so I'll break it down even further into two situations:<br>
<br>
A) You don't need the SMR.  The SMR drops.  You keep it.  Regardless of if you say it drops or not,you keep it.<br>
<br>
B) You DO need the SMR.  The SMR drops.  You keep it.  Regardless of if you say it drops or not, you keep it.<br>
<br>
Whether you NEED the SMR or not doesn't affect at all what you get out of lying about the drop.  Yet you claim that you said you didn't need the SMR in order to show you weren't lying.  The one has nothing to do with the other.  IMHO it's just a lame attempt to cover up the truth, which is that for some unknown reason you couldn't come out and say that you wanted an SMR and that's why you killed the AM when Maniak asked.<br>
<br>
Even after all that, there is the possibility that you weren't intentionally lying but did so because of a lack of mental faculty.  But wait, there's more...  You follow it up by saying you were in the AM room to powerlevel.  He's not asking HOW you knew the AM was up.  He's asking why you were in the room.  You were in the room to kill the AM.  Easy enough to say that, but instead you say you were there to powerlevel.  WHO exactly are you powerlevelling when you kill the mob on your own and get the xp?  Referring back to the analogy, how the hell are you in there for 50cent beers when they're only serving $6 draft?  <br>
<br>
As for your final comment:<br>
<br>
&quot;Also please address the points from my previous post that you conviently skipped over, k?&quot;<br>
<br>
Give me one point you'd like me to address.  Do you want me to say Maniak was wrong?  Sure I'll say it.  Maniak was wrong.  When have I EVER said that he wasn't?  Here, I'll help you out so you don't have to &quot;bust a vein&quot; over the next post.  You can continue your current logic by cutting and pasting the following paragraph:<br>
<br>
--------CUT HERE FOR SUPERCOOL VEHN COMEBACK--------<br>
Tanth you fucking moron, the sky is obviously blue so why don't you just come out and admit it?  Everyone on this fucking board can fucking see that a duck is a fucking bird.  I'm right and you're wrong.  Prove to me I'm lieing (sic) you jackass.  <br>

I'm sorry it happened.&quot;, or, better yet, instead of coming to this thread along with your lapdog Tanth at all, asking maniak to apologize to me in game.  Then you get all defensive when I bite back.  I'm very impressed.  Baxks if you're wondering why I never wanted to join the endless when you were asking me multiple times I think you found your answer.<br>

As far as I WAS concerned I was happy with bakxs' response.  It was calm, it made sense, it left both sides happy.  And of course Tanth had to come in with his big mouth, and you yourself couldn't help but throw your &quot;lets pretend i'm not guildleader&quot; potshots at me.  Lovely.<br>
<br>
Oh and since I just saw Tanth's page long post I'll address it real fast.  Why I killed the AM is not important.  It has nothing to do with the fact that your guildmate was being an ass.  I'm glad you admitted your guildmate was being an ass.  Thats not an apology, which is what I was looking for the entire time, but thats ok <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

I logged Vehnn on to kill the AM when I saw that it was spawned.  Congratulations on that amazing leap of logic.  Thank you so much for the personal attacks.  That was very clever of you.  I will think so much more highly of you and your incredibly powerful penis waving abilities from this day forth.  *bows in awe of the enormous penis of tanth changing the jetstream and disrupting the tides and making babies cry*<br>

Heres a hint: it makes no goddamn difference why he killed it, if he needed a robe, if he wanted to see a PoD in purple, or what the fuck. You are chasing an idiot red herring and you look incredibly biased in doing so. Im sorry your guildmate died to AM, but if you think he deserves loot from a mob he didnt kill at a camp he wasnt at in a zone he wasnt in, regardless_ of the intetions of the person who killed said mob, you are pretty much not worth talking to anymore Im afraid. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
