Kaminya tells you, consent me and Laminar, we're going to CR you for another shot at VS.<br>
<br>
A few minutes go by and suddenly all the newly rez'd folks are dead from a train.<br>
<br>
Kaminya tells you, shit, IV is here in force, they're going to pull VS.  Do you mind if we take him down with the help of the poeple we've rez'd and then split the loot with you?<br>
<br>
Endless didn't have to CR us.  Props to them for doing so.  Endless didn't have to hold off killing VS as long as they did.  Props to them for doing so.  The loot he dropped blew chunks, but they didn't have to give PO dime one of it... props to them for doing so.<br>
<br>
FWIW after the repop we went back and killed VS on the first pull.  Yes, there's a learning curve and it's steep... We learned a lot on our first attempt (yes, that was PO's first attempt at VS) and put it to work the second time.  Not feeling rushed helped too, of course, but I'm confident that we'll continue to kill VS when the opportunity arises.  Oh yah, loot sucked the second time too... Who the hell needs ranger legs? :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubled1234.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bled1234</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 3:22:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> errr like guilds in the hood, you are all talkin trash and you have your boyz to back you up if shit goes down<br>

I don't ever take sides. And I'm not taking sides now. I have friends in IV. And, quite honestly, the server has shown it's way of working. If you attempt a mob and fail, be prepared for another guild to possibly kill it right then after. That is how our server is. And we should all just realize it, and work with it. And, what has happened between The Endless and some other guilds, has happend between In Virtue and The Endless, each guild(s) being on both sides of the table. We have all seen it from every angle. Lets not make this a big...fucking...deal. Thats my personal opinion. <br>
<br>
BUT as personal RELIEF, I would like to say:<br>
<br>
Vehn, suck my dick.<br>
<br>
Plumpkin, suck my fucking dick.<br>
<br>
And, Befb suck...my...dick.<br>
<br>
When either of you 3 have anything worth reading to say, lemme know. Until then, myself, and everyone with half a brain will just skip right over your pointless, mindless, spam. And, in case I wasn't clear. Vehn, suck my dick. Plumpkin, suck my dick. Befb, suck my dick and snowball the other two. THX~ <p>Quarken

Your morals mean leapfrogging over a group fighting down to trak with COH? Your morals mean pulling VS when another guild is fighting his guards? Yeah I'm so sure PO didn't want another shot at that VS, but we're the bad guys because we kill CT after you fail? Whatever, same old BS. ---  <br>
<br>
First of all no one was fighting there way down to Trak.  Both Endless and Agony were amassing members at the zoneline.  We were at Trak rdy to go with numbers before Agony even started working there way down.  Had Agony cleared the path all the way to Trak and were attempting it I can guarantee we would not be on their backs waiting to see if they failed.  <br>
<br>
With the Sev incident again we were not there waiting for them to fail because we were there way before they ever came.  <br>
<br>
As for PO and VS again we did not gank them nor were we going to take it if they wanted a second try.  However, IV does not feel the same way about spawns so PO gave us the go ahead to take VS.  It was also agreed we would split the loot before we knew what even dropped.  As for taking it from IV again I say wrong.  We were there with the numbers, buffed, and ready to go.  We just waited a moment to do the right thing in order to rezz PO so they could have another shot.  You forced the issue.<br>
<br>
My point is we don't do what we &quot;accuse&quot; you guys of doing.  In all 3 of those situations we are not breathing down anyones backs while they are attempting mobs.  In none of those did we mobilize our troops to go to the scene where someone was already at the mob in question.<br>
<br>
--- The real reason people act different towards IV than a couple months ago is because they now have the levels to want a slice of the pie that IV has been eating. Well fine, go for it, but we're going to compete for it too. Just don't get on this &quot;moral high horse&quot; crap its bullshit. ---<br>
<br>
This is not true if you ask me.  In fact it has nothing to do with it.  Many of the same guilds who may dislike your guild as a whole do so because you have changed as a guild.  Many of us once helped IV in many of their raids.  I for one did, expecting no loot at all, just to be nice.  I for one dont playa hate.  You guys without a doubt have done impressive stuff, but dont give yourself a pat on the back thinking everyone dislikes you because we cant do the things you are doing.  Its the how you do some things that irk people, or the witty retorts of some of your members.  <br>
<br>
I myself try to judge each person indivdually but its hard at times.  How many times can you say, &quot;I was just the get away driver, I didnt pull the trigger.&quot;  By this I mean when you say dont judge someone by a guildtag.  Everyone has a choice in life.  If this is your choice so be it.  Just dont expect everyone to agree with it.<br>

This is a tad off topic, but your statement is completely FALSE. Yes, you had a few members at the zoneline when we started moving in, but we were down to Myconoids when you CoH'd yourselves down to Trak. <br>
<br>
Oh and I must congratulate on the first recorded abuse of the transfer system. Bringing a naked 55+ mage over from another server just to sit and CoH folks right into the uber mobs is brilliant.<br>

However, it is interesting to see Plumpkin and Befb make comments on our deaths to CT.  Because apparently, you two have never died to him?  Or you have, and are just making moronic comments?

<br>
We STARTED our coth process before you even pulled the first set of frogs.  We didn't FINISH until just after you guys started fighting shrooms.  Just as your method of getting down to Trak took some time, so did ours.  It's not fair to compare when you started your journey to when we ended ours, instead you need to compare starts with starts and endings with endings.<br>
<br>
As far as the mage, I don't think it's relevant but you do a disservice by talking about something you don't have the facts on.  The mage in question is Altiar, neither naked nor a transfer, and the person behind Altiar is so dedicated to the guild that he has devoted Altiar to helping the guild in this way.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukaziqueal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 5:29:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> I wasn't on for either of these incidents but really if you want to spread rumors about a guild and tell everyone on the server they are the anti-crist then don't expect them to extend to you any type of courtesy. You can't have it both ways. You can't trash us and then expect us to respect you. Like Krimzin has said, &quot;we will always let you have the first shot if you were there first&quot;. And we always have. <br>
<br>
Let me, as one who was there from the IV corner shed some light on this famous incident with Trak that convinced so many of you that we are all out bigots with no respect for anyone. I haven't commented on it because I knew this nasty little flame would result. But seeing as pandoras box is open, let's go for it.<br>
<br>
TE takes 20 people from the zoneline in SEB to cockblock IV on Trak when they see us zoning in with a full force ready to kill him. With all of TWO fucking clerics for over an hour(researched extensively by my in repeated /who's), one of which was like lvl 52, they camp him and expect us to respect this. We sit there for an hour (fully ready to go)while they desperately CoH in any person they can find to help them. Well over an hour later they still aren't even fucking close to being able to kill him so the GM there says that we are allowed to take a shot at him. We offer one more time for them to have the first shot if they will let us have the teeth for our planned VP raid that weekend (many of us were against even this). Why didn't you take that shot? Because you weren't even close to being able to, and the only reason you moved down was to stop our raid. We kill Trak after Kaminya basically told Krimzin to fuck off and gave the Breast Plate he dropped to Bodil of The Endless. <br>
<br>
So for all of you that were wondering about this little blacklist shit, there you go thems the goods.<br>
<br>
And <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Tanth</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get your facts straight. Krimzin didn't Flame Kaminya in ooc. He said to you guys in shout to let the rest of you know what was happening that he had offered to let Kaminya and TE have the first shot at Trak as we were about to pull him but she told him to fuck off. He didn't flame her, he told you guys what was up. I was there from the get go and some of you guys are very misled about the whole incident.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> IV on Cazic. Yes we tried and failed. Clearly we aren't as powerful or experienced as you guys so if you want to mock us I have no problem with that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
-And this surprises you that when you walk up to someone and punch them in the face that they will hit you back? Or maybe your little blacklisting wasn't meant to be known by us? I'm sorry if that is the case. And now your trying to deny it... Fuck that, countless friends have been telling me about your members shit talking for weeks to anyone who will listen. Members refusing to even talk to us, sell to us, group with us. What else would you call this??<br>
<br>
So right there my friend is the head of that demon in our relationship gone foul. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 490<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 5:37:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> I so wish I could have everyone reading this thread read a synopsis of the 1st 12 months of lanys.com community board.  It is just verbatim the exact same stuff, no deviance whatso ever.  And like ceros said, what happened as the server progressed, was you saw more and more of the people who used to decry the uber guild tactics wind up applying to and joining that guild.  When that guild went away is where it really gets interesting, immediately_ you have the guild that was most_ vocally againt those policies make a play for &quot;uberness&quot; and preaching those policies word_ for_ word_.  About 2 weeks after that like ceros says you have another guild formed of 90% people who again were adamatly against uber policies form that behaves the exact same way.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  human nature and Verant game design dictates the way the upper level game is played.  It also dictates the &quot;roles&quot; various guilds fall into.  The winning side invaribly preaches might makes right, the have nots always attempt to make it a moral issue, and if the situation ever changes so do the roles.  Individuals_ may hold to some sort of principle (see zozz) but masses of people dont deviate from this model.  <br>
<br>
I dont expect anyone in the have not camp to openly agree with this, obviously my whole hypothisis would predict against it, as they have to play the &quot;moral high ground&quot; card, its the card they have to play.  Id just like it in the archives for people to see when this stuff happens bc it will, always does.<br>

<br>
&quot;Bad ways: insults over public channels, assumption of righteousness, inflamatory posts on public boards. &quot;<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, Rhyu and other IV members were saying a lot of insulting things in /ooc in the Emerald Jungle when they were killing Severilous when Sacred Fires tried. Krimzin didn't flame me in /ooc? Yeah, that's right. He did it in /shout. Maybe it wasn't an outright flame, but it was obviously meant to turn my own guild against me. (after Krimzin repeated my tell to him /gu was filled with stuff like &quot;exactly&quot; or &quot;hell yeah Kami!&quot;) Okay Endless, you go kill Trak like a good little guild and let us have half his loot please, thx. Yeah right.<br>
<br>
Assumption of righteousness... well jebus, wasn't this thread all about how someone in IV felt that they have the right to pull whatever the hell they want through whoever they want, whenever they want? And look what it turned into, a &quot;umm... yeah we did do that, but The Endless and Sacred Fires failed on CT keke&quot; thread. Seems to me like IV can't stay on topic when they can't really defend the point that they were being jerks assuming righteousness. Enough of this talk of us, let's flame The Endless instead of starting a rant thread all on our own about them, let's talk instead about who is gay and who stole my camp in lower guk back in April.<br>
<br>
Inflamatory posts, bad? Someone go tell that to Vehnn. Or Befb. Or Plumpkin. Why don't you go preach to them about good and bad ways to go about things?<br>
<br>
&quot;I am 100% positive that the Endless would kill something we lost to. They will pull VS past a raid. They will take a 30% Sev from Agony. They will CoH past a raid that is already clearing down.&quot;<br>
<br>
FYI, Sev was only at 50%, (not that it matters) and Agony's fight got so close to us that half of us got feared and started running right along side them. At the time I had thought things went differently, I thought that our monk had pulled and Agony was in his path back and so he feigned. But he went to pull, saw them dragging a monk corpse back, then all of a sudden all of Agony ran past him and rushed Sev. Sacred Fires had zoned in with a few folks to stand by our side, we stood still at our camp spot and went back after we got feared. When Agony was dead and the rest in zone didn't have aggro, Sev came straight for us. I wasn't going to tell everyone to run and zone out into Field of Bone, so we fought him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What does Endless do after they kill VS? They offered us some of the loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
I msged Keadaian right after their attempt, I told him that we were rezzing folks in. What did IV members do? They stood there with their rez stick cleric and started to pull VS's room. I offered the loot BEFORE anything dropped, and I think Kead knows that I would have been fair about whatever dropped.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the sarcasm and flames, but it just makes me sick. An IV member sent a flame tell after Sev asking when &quot;we're ever going to be able to kill a dragon on our own&quot;, to which I replied that we have killed Severilous twice by ourselves, and once with absolutely no wizards. I was teased about our Trakanon record, being asked if it was 2 of 8. Of all our Trakanon raids, he has died everytime. With the exception of the time that IV killed him first. Does IV forget the wipeouts they've had? I seem to recall one time when all of naked IV was at the Sebilis zone in summoning corpses because an IV member had trained Trak on them, something that happened to us as well. Do IV failures erase once they're able to do things quicker and faster? If not, then why am I taunted about our failures in game?<br>
<br>
The Endless and Sacred Fires had never really interacted or liked each other before, but we actually cleared Fear together (after server crash) and the loot seemed to work out fine. Everyone was happy for everyone that got something. I am proud of what we accomplished, even though it wasn't Cazic Thule. It won't be the last time we work together. I hope IV is happy that we cleared the plane and left their main tank Irak Atil up.<br>
<br>
I'll go wait in the corner while the stfu you sl00t response flames build up.<br>
