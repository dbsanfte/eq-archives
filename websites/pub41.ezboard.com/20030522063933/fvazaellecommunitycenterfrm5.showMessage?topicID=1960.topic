I stayed out of the RoK/Tunare thread once it became a rants type, but now you have decided to bring the topic up in this forum.  Therefore, it's time to set you straight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Guild B shows up and trys to gank Tunare from Guild A<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Raign, if Triality had decided to &quot;gank&quot; Tunare from RoK, you guys would not have walked away with her loots.  When we got to PoG, there were only 6 RoK's in the zone.  It took you guys over an hour to get rezzed and re-buffed and in the mean time we killed the last few remaining mobs for you so they would not add when you engaged Tunare a second time.  During that hour, we could have dropped Tunare at any time.  Did we even consider doing that?  Of course not.<br>
<br>
Your guild leader had already told our guild leader that you guys were going to try one more time to see if it would be close.  If you found out that Tunare was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RoK and a third attempt would be a total waste of time, then Triality could have a shot at her.  That is why we were there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Guild B trying to ass-rape Guild A without so much as a reach around<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You're being a bit dramatic there, don't you think?  Did Guild B really try to ass-rape Guild A?  If so, please explain.  We cleared some of the mobs for you guys so you could spend your time casting single-target shammy buffs on every player for an hour.  Then we sat back and waited and waited and waited and did not touch Tunare.  Stop trying to say things like &quot;ass-rape&quot; and &quot;reach around&quot; just so you can sound like a good ranter.  It is weak.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>did they have the right to saunter up to PoG<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Who the fuck are you to say where other people have a right to go in EQ?  I can see you having a valid complaint if we had come to PoG, waited until you were fighting the Guardians, and then killed Tunare while you were busy (/wave AD trying to kill Statue while Vindi is engaged by the other guild.)  However, we in no way interferred with you.  Is your complaint REALLY that we dared to even be in the zone?  Get over yourself, Raign.  We will go to any zone we please whenever we please.  Your officers didn't have a problem with us being there as long as we didn't do anything to try to hinder your Tunare attempt, so why the fuck do you care where we were?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sad thing is, earlier that day we aborting going to nToV because you were already there and we didn't want to try shit like going up the other side and screwing you over.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok...this is going to be long so pull up a chair.  Let's pretend that Triality had never shown up in PoG that night.  Would RoK have cleared the last couple mobs and gotten a second uncontested shot at Tunare?  Yes.  Would they have won?  Not by a long shot.  Let's examine the facts:<br>
<br>
1) When Triality showed up, Kalamurv, Gurgar, and some PO tank were asked to come protect you guys from the big, mean guild that was going to KS Tunare.  They were given misinformation.  They were told that we had come to KS RoK and so they rushed to your aid.  The fact was that we were not in any way there to KS RoK, but whatever it takes to get 3 extra tanks, right?<br>
<br>
2) The RoK tank starts off MAing Tunare and goes down right away.  One of the EA tanks takes agro and goes down shortly after.  Another EA tank takes agro, and goes down a bit later.  Battle-rezzes for the tanks happen and they keep replacing each other as MA.  Tell me something, Raign...if those tanks had not been asked to come help, who would RoK have used to tank when their MA went down?  My guess is that each cleric would have MA'd for about a second and then the rogues would have had a turn, etc.<br>
<br>
3) By the time Tunare was at 2%, RoK people were dropping like flies.  The healers were running out of mana, and the dmg-dealing classes were falling fast.  In short, it was a very close fight.  You guys almost didn't have enough DPS to kill her before your healers went out of mana.  I say almost because as we all know, you guys DID barely have enough DPS to kill her.  And do you know who was providing a nice boost to your DPS?  A level 65 ranger from Triality.  One of our rangers wanted to give you guys a hand because he had a lot of friends there, so he did as much damage as he could and then camped out when Tunare was at 23% hp to clear his agro.  Do you know how much dmg a well-equipped, full AA lvl 65 ranger does?  Let me give you a hint: more than any of your lvl 57-62 rogues or wizards that you had there.<br>
<br>
The only conclusion that I can reach from all of this is that even though RoK was not nearly strong enough to kill Tunare by themselves (which is what we were assuming they would find out when they tried her a second time), you guys were given enough help from some key people to get her loots.  So what's the problem with a guild being basically twinked by some higher lvl guilds for a night?  Nothing, unless it results in people making stupid-assed comments like the one you made about NToV.<br>
<br>
Raign, was RoK not in NToV &quot;practicing&quot; a few days ago after Triality had gone through and killed everything?  Yes.  What was the result of the practicing?  Oh yeah....RoK wiping to drakes.  Please get this idea out of your head that RoK &quot;let&quot; Triality have NToV this past weekend.  The truth is that we go to ToV and clear the entire North wing in about 4-5 hours.  It is not a challenge now that Luclin and PoP have made everyone so powerful.  It is boring farming plain and simple.  When you saw Tunare dead on your screen and suddenly thought your guild was ready to plow right through the expansions because of it, you got the wrong idea.<br>
<br>
One last thing.  This stupid idea that people have been spouting about RoK DESERVING the Tunare kill because they spent all day in PoG clearing is bullshit.  RoK deserved to attempt Tunare of course.  NO ONE from Triality has ever disputed that fact (which is why we did not do anything but help them while we were there).  But here is the thing about EQ: if you over-estimate your guild's abilities and try some content that is currently above your guild's level, you generally die and walk away unsatisfied.  The first time Triality ever tried the AoW, AD was hovering close by expecting us to wipe and waiting to take the kill.  If we had wiped, tough shit.  Would it matter that we killed Vindi, Statue, and Idol?  Nope.  What if we had been in Kael all day waiting for the Statue to pop?  What if we had taken 45 minutes to fully buff and get super ready?  What if we REALLY, REALLY wanted to kill the AoW?  Would any of that matter once we wiped?  Nope.  AD or any other guild on a FFA server would have stepped in and taken the kill.  We would have been forced to say &quot;We need to get stronger.  Let's try this again in 2 weeks&quot; or something like that.  When we got to PoG, RoK had just wiped to Tunare.  If we wanted to be ruthless and just plow over a younger guild, we could have rightfully taken the spawn and said &quot;fuck what other people think...they wiped so it's now our turn.&quot;  Instead, we held back and did nothing but help them.<br>
<br>
Raign, get your head out of your ass and don't try to stir up shit in R&amp;F when you only reveal what a fucking gimp you are by doing it.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) When Triality showed up, Kalamurv, Gurgar, and some PO tank were asked to come protect you guys from the big, mean guild that was going to KS Tunare.

<br>
The tanks weren't there to &quot;protect&quot; anyone.  None of them had previously attempted Tunare and wanted to tag along.  Since they were all good friend in our guild and the officers most likely thought they would be a good back up if stuff went wrong (obviously it did, will go into that later).  They weren't told anything about Triality attempting to or threatening to KS which points me to this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You're being a bit dramatic there, don't you think?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Also notice that we started w/ our 3 tanks (Drathos, Murf and Seb) before having to rely on the guest.  Though I believe one of them was inserted into the line in between because he gained aggro...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) The RoK tank starts off MAing Tunare and goes down right away. One of the EA tanks takes agro and goes down shortly after.

I'm about 99% positive that Zigon rezzed the tanks via his 2 boxed cleric, but I know for a fact that the tanks weren't re-inserted into the rotation.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Once again there you go w/ the dramaticizing instead of using facts...  /shrug<br>

Yep, Endy is a good friend to the guild (to most at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), I'm sure his help was appreciated.  Was it NEEDED?  I would venture enough to say not likely.  Was he asked to help?  I would probably say no, because none of our officers mentioned him helping...  /shrug.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The only conclusion that I can reach from all of this is that even though RoK was not nearly strong enough to kill Tunare by themselves (which is what we were assuming they would find out when they tried her a second time), you guys were given enough help from some key people to get her loots. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You know what assuming does don't you?  Ok then, we'll leave it at that.  <br>
<br>
We are strong enough to kill Tunare ourselves.  Will the guests that were at our last kill be key in our next kill?  Nope.  Even though we appreciated their help.<br>
<br>
What you don't know about RoK (warning rehash from the other post in general), is that we have wiped to EVERY major mob on our first attempt (with exception to Telk, but that f00 is gimp anyway...).  We rethink our plans/strategies, come back and totally gank mobs the next time around.<br>
<br>
A good example would be Dozekar.  We got our arses handed to us our first attempt (only had 2 clerics keke), but the next time we attempted we ganked him in seriously less than a min and half, complete yard trash at that point.  Yeah, its pretty ghey to compare Tunare to Doze...or is it...?<br>

Not if you compare AoW to Tunare~  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The reason AD would've been all over AoW is because both you and them would've blown the spawn if they didn't gank him if you wiped.<br>
<br>
If we wiped 255720485 times to Tunare it wouldn't matter because she'd still be sitting perched up in her big ass tree mocking us.  <br>

So please don't compare an encounter like Tunare to AoW.  Because if the mob was AoW instead of Tunare we would've taken 1 shot and if there was another guild waiting to gank we would've shruged it off and rethought our weaknesses, because that's the way the AoW encounter is.<br>

But I suppose if you want to get technical, on AoW spawn if you wipe on the spawn another guild has a chance according to GMs. Tunare would be no different. If you wipe another guild can make an attempt at it if you are unable to come to an agreement between guilds. Doesn't really matter if this is a triggered mob or not. GM will tell you that by triggering the mob you only get the first attempt. If you wipe tough shit. Next guild gets a try at it. So if Triality wanted to press the issue they could have taken Tunare and basically said fuck you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pigboyph>PigboyPH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Uber Gimp~</span><br>  Posts: 1595<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/5/03 6:53:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1960.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ciladan.homestead.com/files/assclown.jpg height=200 width=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~</span><hr size=1> yeah, but you might want to take that up w/ someone else because I had no issue with it, and I do think that Triality showed enough class to give RoK another try.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221">Haels~</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Gimp mofaka of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bresurgenceofkin">Resurgence of Kin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

RoK got Tunare (doesn't matter if they had help, the kill goes to them), sounds to me like Triality actually sat their keisters down and gave RoK three shots. That doesn't sound like a gank to me, that sounds like a group of folks not wanting to start trouble.  I'm unsure just WHY you are ranting. What did Triality do to &quot;gank&quot; you? I'm confused.<br>

This part made me chuckle.  Your ability to see through our master plan of Crying 'Help Me' and having everyone come to our aid truly shows you superior intellect.<br>

<br>
1) First one was to Ail the Elder. We were engaging 4 mobs: one of those flashy spirit things, a thifaye, and the two million hp focuses. We killed one focus, the flashy thing (it was yellow), and the thifaye. We had the second focus to 40% and Ail the Elder wandered into camp and started dropping silence and shiz on everyone. We switched targets and got him down to roughly 75% before people started dropping. <br>
<br>
2) Second one was to that silence kitty of Tunares. We had both in camp at once. Got them to 80% on one and I don't remember on the other before we died. Rez and repeat. AE cold wanders in, we kill it. Med up. Protector wanders in from somewhere, we kill it. Suit of armor shiz shows up, we kill it. <br>
<br>
After that it's a blur. The only cleric that said oom was Calida and that's because she's Zigon's two box alt and isn't geared as well as the others. We chewed down Tunare and she dropped, just like our first Vindi kill. That's how things looked from my end.<br>

<br>
1) This had NO BUSINESS being brought up in R&amp;F, especially by some non-officer from RoK.  To come here and flame my guild after the respect that we showed to you guys in PoG is bullshit.  The RoK leaders told us that they were not sure if they could kill Tunare and might give up after trying her again (if it looked completely hopeless).  They said that if that happened, Triality was welcome to her without having to go through the hassel of clearing PoG the next day.  We decided that that was a gamble worth taking and headed to PoG.  While in PoG, we did everything we could to help RoK (other than kill Tunare for them and one of our rangers even tried to do that).  When Tunare died, we all said grats and went on our merry way.  Now we have some little shit-bag coming to VCC trying to stir shit up and accusing Triality of trying to &quot;gank&quot; and &quot;ass-rape&quot; RoK?  Fuck that.<br>
<br>
2) As far as my comments about the guest tanks, I can only talk about things from my point of view.  Here is my point of view, and I hope Kalamurv will back me up on this:  Shortly after Triality zoned into PoG, some EA and PO tanks showed up.  Sendaught said that he got cussed out by Kalamurv for trying to gank Tunare.  Sendaught once again spoke with the RoK leaders to make sure they knew that we were not their to gank them and feel free to take their time getting ready for the bitch.  After it was all over, I sent a tell to Kalamurv asking him if the misunderstanding had been cleared up.  He said that he thought we should have never gone to PoG in the first place (his opinion and he was welcome to it).  Then he said that he had been told by RoK that Triality had come to gank Tunare from them, so he went to PoG to help them out.  As a side note, he said, &quot;No hard feelings...I'd never done Tunare anyway, so it was new for me.&quot;  Therefore, from my point of view the EA and PO tanks were brought in to help because they had been mislead by RoK into thinking that Triality was going to KS Tunare.  If they were not told this, then Kalamurv lied to me (I doubt it).<br>
