<br>
    Thanks to some friends, i have learned about this wonderful and insightful post which shamefully is constituated of 50 % lies. First of all, this is how this unfortunate situation sums up. <br>
<br>
     I was in this wonderful LS group but then unfortunatly our cleric had to leave.  No healers could be found in the zone, so we spent a good half hour trying to find a decent cleric to replace our lost comrade.  I then decided to log off for a bit since i had to prepare mentally for the total failure my final exam would be because of EQ.  I then came back about an hour later and behold i saw that a group had formed with a shaman as healer and 4 other players from the old group that was doing LS before i logged with one new member.  So i asked the Mana pimp since he was leader of the group if anyone was on the delightful list.  He then informed me that i was the first on that said list.  Soon after the enchanter had to leave and we were talking in open chat about the list and he said no one but me was on the list. <br>
<br>
     They needed someone to replace the enchanter and asked if i would wait since they were all addicted and needed some chanty drugs.  I, of course being the honorable rogue that i am, told them there was no problem since i understood the need for those delightful enchanter buffs.  Finally they found a 59 cleric that was looking to sit on his butt and make major xp healing.  While these events are unfolding i was talking with a few of my friends that were in the US group.<br>
<br>
   I then wanted to go check the siuation with LS to see if a spot was opening up in the near future.  Of course one spot did open then suddendly to my dismay i see Gronk log in and join the group.   At first i was shocked, thinking more clearly i thought that maybe 2 people were leaving instead of only one.  But thing were more grim then i thought, apperantly the new list holder forgot or didnt know that my colorful name was next on the list.  She explained to me that her guildy Gronk has been on the list for a while now.  <br>
<br>
    I had been sitting in LS with the LFG tag over my head for the 6 hours i was on the list.  I talked to Gronk about the situation and asked politely if i could get my spot back (he had just joined the group at this time).  His colorful response was &quot;i didnt steal shit, my guild member called me up cause i was playing an alt and a spot had opened&quot;.  So i then decided to talk to the new list holder.  She explained to me that she didnt know i was on that list and it isnt her fault for mis communication between the new and old list holders.  <br>
<br>
     You can imagine how angry i was after waiting for 6 hours entertaining people in Velketor with my witty remarks to my horror see my spot being taken from me by this Gronk.  Of course like all good diplomat, i wanted to resolve the situation.  I would like to know how he got this &quot;he was ranting on for about an hour about it&quot; impression of me.  I only talked for about 15 min at most and even then only half the time would you give me the courtasie of a respon.  I then talked to hamfist who was the new leader of the group. I then asked him if anyone would be leaving the group soon.  He responded that he himself would be leaving soon. <br>
<br>
    I then decided that i could wait a little longer because in my infinite wisdom i know that no good can come from a conflict.    <br>

I would compare it too coming into a strangers house and telling them that they need to bring you food, drink and to fan you.

Maybe thier tolerance for poor writing is just lower than mine.  Because theres no way I can defend a post that I cant even read_, and that mostrous block of confused adolescent text was unreadable, to me.  If you like, look on it as friendly advice:  it doesnt matter what your side of the story is if you cant effectively communicate it to others.<br>
