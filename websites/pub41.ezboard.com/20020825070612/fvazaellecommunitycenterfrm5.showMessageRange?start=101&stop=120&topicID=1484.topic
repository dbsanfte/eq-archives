Anika mentions that there are members who cannot join private channels due to firewall issues.  To me, this is really the best argument there is for keeping things in public channels (altho guildchat is also acceptable).  Lowfyr mentions the %t bug that plagued private channels for a while.  I believe that has been fixed, but some ppl still see it from time to time.  <br>
<br>
I've been using private raid channels ever since they came out.  I've been using guildchat, shout, and ooc since even before then.  Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen private channels suffer from lag while the public channels did not lag.  I've seen public channels lag far worse than I've ever seen private channels lag.  Lag on messages is a serious problem for any raid, but there's not a channel on the server you can name that does not lag from time to time.  And based on my experiences, private channels don't suffer from lag with any more frequency then public channels.<br>
<br>
As far as coloring goes, omg, use the damn help menu.  Set your &quot;shout&quot; channel to bright red.  There, it stands out now.  Coloring isn't an excuse for anything other than ignorance or laziness.<br>
<br>
Dropped messages appear much more often in public channels.  These channels are coded with anti-spam code, which prevent a person from flooding the channel too quickly with messages.  Group chat and private channels (and possibly guildchat) are the only channels that let you flood the channel as fast as you can.  Private channels also let you flood the channel as fast as you can.  Dropped messages are far less likely to occur in a private channel than in a public channel.<br>
<br>
Personally, I could care less whether a raiding guild is using a public channel anymore.  If it bothers me, I'll filter the channel.  And the one good reason I've heard so far (that some ppl can't join private channels) sounds like a pretty damn good reason to stick with guildchat, shout, and ooc channels for a raid.  Only thing I don't like hearing in the public channels is the petty bickering that goes on back and forth between guilds/raids in a zone.  If guilds/raids wanna whine like kids, there's a place for it...  Rants and Flames on VCC.<br>

There are lag issues with the private channels, above and beyond the normal zone wide channels.  Deal with it.  Has nothing to do with the Evil Empire of Verant, just has to do with methods of coding.  I am sorry VI doesnt have zone only private channels, that dont suffer as badly from lag, but blame them, not the guilds who are using the best resources available to them.  Quit being a selfish baby and use ignore already.  I just love how you seem to feel that you are more important than the 60 people on the raid.  And dont even try to say its everyone in every zone, because I am quite sure you are not a telepath, capable of reading the thoughts of others.  And no, the occasional voiced complaint does not constitute the majority vote of the server, sorry.  <br>
<br>
Dont use guides ignorance as an excuse.  It is a well documented fact that guides dont know shit about the game.  They clearly just dont have the understanding of game mechanics that the hardcore legions do.<br>

I do think that the guild should attempt to use the raid channels when possible, but if it is seriously hampering their raid safety well... then they may have to use the OOC/SHOUT.<br>
<br>
A couple questions: <br>
<br>
- After you petitioned did something happen?  Did GM's actually do something over it?<br>
- Do you see a large difference in using OOC/SHOUT vice Raid Channels?<br>

<br>
In Tov last Sun channels were lagging up to 30secs THEN they kicked out 80% of raid force. Nobody could talk or see on the channels. Tried to fix without success. <br>
<br>
SO, we did have to go back to publics. Luckily, we were only peeps in there. (Yes, shocking) So no big event, but yeah, it can happen. Guess for me that means being a little more understanding about it and willing to play with my filter button.<br>

<br>
That could be but there are a lot of factors to take in. What types of places are you usually raiding? What types of mobs? And what size (number of people) are generally at the raids? <br>
<br>
EA generally averages somewhere between 30 and 40 people, up to 50 occasionally. The raids when we have over 40 people has a very noticeable lag increase, in fact we often have our cleanest raids at around 30-35 people. Getting over that number is when the lag problems start creeping in, at least for some people who don't have the advantage of optimal systems. Also, a lot of the things we hit have an AE, which means considerably more lag in my experience, and on top of that some of them which dispell in the AE require a group of 30-40 people all to constantly be spamming their insta-click buffs.<br>
<br>
I can understand how some of these issues are hard to empathize with if you haven't experienced some of the situations I am describing. <br>
<br>
When EA was a much younger guild, our raid plans didn't take lag into consideration a whole lot. We didn't have lag problems except for some isolated cases for one, and second of all a 10-20 second lag spike really probably wouldn't have affected the raid too much. Now we have to take lag into serious account when planning out a hit. 1 second's delay in a message has the potential to end up meaning a trip to the coffin vendor for the entire guild.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udabamf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dabamf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/30/02 3:36:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1484.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Make a raid channel!&quot;</span><hr size=1> 6 pages of:<br>

<br>
Ayiar's posts are all personal opinion. You don't write about facts, and you don't accept that anyone else can have a valid opinion. Your rants are normally going against the grain and make people ponder how stupid you are. Like complaining about the background in a magelo; it's just a stupid opinion that attacks something meaningless.<br>
<br>
I rip on the pictures of you and your Raiya because to me, it is ironic to be closeminded and childish in my ripping on you, in the same manner you are closeminded and childish. After a month of you slamming me for being low-brow in taunting you, you still just don't understand that I was trying to appeal to you in the manner I thought would work best: playground insults.<br>
<br>
You're stuck in your own first-person perspective. You didn't get the larger joke. Hearing you complain about people giving low blows is pure comedic irony.<br>
<br>
So use your head for a fucking change and consider some perspective in your rants, and I might do the same for you. Until then you just don't have room to complain about my stupid comments. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubakxs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakxs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 697<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/31/02 2:45:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1484.topic&index=117>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Are you really THAT stupid?</span><hr size=1> Please think &amp; re-read before you press &quot;Add Reply&quot; Mr Tree Slover.

Incorrect...  I simply look at the simply idiotic things you and other people post.  When I see something especially retarded, I make some commentary.

I don't understand where I said that I was speaking for  anyone but myself.  My comment was that when people do/say/post dumb things, people will respond.  You often post dumb things, I, along with others will respond.  Didn't say they all will respond or anyone else will respond.  <br>
<br>
PERHAPS, I said everything that needed to be said.  The rest of the gallery didn't want to just rehash my points and extend this thread needlessly.  They didn't want ForumFreak to get all spaz-tic if they made fun of you as well.  <br>

What you don't get is that from that post--you pose a rhetorical question, YET YOU UNINTENTIONALLY ANSWER IT YOUR FUCKING SELF.

You sir, opened yourself up to a fuckin' &quot;punch in the face.&quot;<br>

If you simply posted: Why is this stupid fucking thread still alive?  Or something to that effect, this &quot;conversation&quot; would have never come to be...  but in your fuckin' ultimate wisdom felt you had to toss your two cents into the discussion.  Why the fuck do you think the thread went so damn long?  Because every numbnut felt like they had to toss in their opinion.  <br>

By the way...  who cares how long these fuckin' threads go as long as people are not just rehashing the same ol' shit (hint, hint~).  I would guess that posts, as long as they are a rant or flame (dumb, pointless posts, notwithstanding) would be welcome here.  <br>

When people post legitimate shit, I do try to stay on the subject at hand--or I just keep quiet.  But on the the other hand, when some random dumbass--or a chronic dumbass like yourself posts something stupid, I have fun writing responses.  Your posts are jus' too damn juciy.  <br>

Bakxs - If you can't break a name, dont break it.  It's not &quot;Tree Slover&quot;.  It's &quot;Trees Lover&quot;<br>

<br>
With all the commands available to the moderators and a simple guide posted on your fucking guild website, you can get everyone on the same damn foot.<br>
<br>
You need 3 channels, period.  1. RaidChat 2. RaidHeals 3. RaidLeaders.  Name them whatever the fuck you want to, but use the moderate and voice commands.  They work wonders.<br>
<br>
1. RaidChat ~ This is for everyone to chat on.<br>
2. RaidHeals ~ Great for Healers calling out heals.  Use the new UI to change the colors. VERY SIMPLE TO DO.<br>
3. RaidLeadeers ~ Great for Puller, MA, SA, TA, and Raid Leader/Guild Leader.  Again, change the colors (again, the new UI makes it very easy) to colors that are easily noticeable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Force people to leave all the chats they are in before starting a raid.  If you're on a raid, you shouldn't be reading the market channel or yacking to idiot monks on other servers on the serverwide.monklybusiness channel.  You should be first and foremest focused on the raid at hand.  If yer not, you shouldn't be there.<br>
<br>
Here are the commands to use if you're not intelligent enough to find them.<br>
<br>
/join ToVChatCC<br>
/join ToVHealsCC<br>
..... ;moderate ToVHealsCC<br>
..... ;voice ClericName ToVHealsCC (Rinse and repeat for rest of healers)<br>
/join ToVLeadersCC<br>
..... ;moderate TovLeadersCC<br>
..... ;voice Puller TovLeadersCC (Rinse and repeat for MA,SA,TA, Raid/Guild Leader)<br>
<br>
It works wonders, trust me.  And if you want to make sure everyone is in the channels, type /list.  It brings up a list of all the chat channels you are in and the number of people in them.  If they don't match, someone's not in the channel.  If you have time, compare the lists and find out who's not in which channel and chastise the hell out of that person for not following raid procedure.<br>
<br>
The new chat channels are great.  You can use the channels in peace, without having random idiots spouting crap in the shout channel you were using... or spammin the ooc channel with meaningless garbage.<br>
<br>
If you need help with the old UI, give me a tell in game and I'll sort your shit for you since you're too lazy to figure it out for yourself.... and if you can't change chat colors and what not with the NEW UI, delete EQ, you shouldn't even be playing.<br>

<br>
I agree that every raiding guild should be using a few private chat channels, but there are certain instances where the message being sent cannot be sent over a server-wide chat channel, due to the inherent lag of sending a message from the raid zone server, to the main world server, then to every zone server. Local zone channels don't lag nearly as much. Sometimes the success of a raid depends on the timely delivery of messages to others in the raid. If you've ever done a high-end raid where the clerics are on a CH rotation, you'd know how important it is for them to get the switch messages on time.<br>
<br>
Let's not assume the tactics you use for a 3-to-4 group raid apply to a high-end encounter like AoW, or even Vindi.<br>
<br>
BTW, the private chat channels went down today for a while. I hope you aren't mad that people had to use /shout, /ooc, etc.<br>
