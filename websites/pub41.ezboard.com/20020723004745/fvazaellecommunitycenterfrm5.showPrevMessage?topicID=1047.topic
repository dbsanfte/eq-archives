Imagine finding out that your life just had a 5 year time limit stamped onto it. Every day coming one day closer to the ending of your own mortality. He was rather suicidal in our conversation, which is understandable knowing that you will die anyways. I made sure he slept on it, to give him some time to reflect on whats happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
And well, this whole ordeal just got me thinking. What have I done in the past 5 years, if i were to die tomorrow. What would I be leaving the world? I think we all take the fortune of living for granted, thinking that, sure other people die. but it will never happen to me, it just can't. Dying is usually one of the last things on our mind, its just something we don't like to face. <br>
<br>
My point being, is that life is too short to be saying mean things to other people. Belittling them on a message board like this, a crime that I am guilty of. I would like to apologize to you guys, I had the ability to say what I did, but by no means did I have the right. Nothing is gained from causing other people discomfort,  or problems. We were all put on this earth for a purpose, we should live in peace with eachother. help others in any way shape or form expendable by our powers. Make a difference with your time today, because who knows, you might just wind up in a body bag tomorrow.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urascalan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rascalan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/23/02 6:27:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1020.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rant on life, and apology.</span><hr size=1> What kind of crap is this gimpy....<br>
