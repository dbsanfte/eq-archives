So we should bomb every country in South America, every country in the Middle East, and many other countries that we consider our Allies that harbor a large number of terrorists.  <br>
<br>
Hell, technically we'd even have to bomb ourselves since you could realistically say we harbor as many terrorists as any other country.  People are so twisted on the word terrorists that they think it only caters to Arabs that run around planting bombs in shopping malls or planning the killing of 100 people?  Wake up guys.  Go read newspapers from some other countries and see their &quot;facts&quot; about the U.S. and you'll see that every country has its bad apples. <br>

Colin Powell was on Fox News last week discussing protable chemical weapons plants driving around Iraq.  Yet, weapons inspects are always armed with surveillance equipment and never in 10 years of their being in Iraq has one ever been documented with film.  /nod  <br>

Some quotes - <br>
<br>
In all, rallies will held in 25 European cities on Saturday. It is being billed as the world's largest anti-war demonstration. <br>
<br>
&quot;We estimate about 150,000 people will turn up in Berlin, hundreds of buses and special trains will be bringing demonstrators from all over Germany,&quot; says Richter, a man with a full white beard, gentle eyes and a quiet, but firm voice. &quot;It will be the biggest demonstration in Germany in the past 20 years.&quot;<br>

<br>
During the anti-war rally here in Cincinnati, a local radio station thought it would be interesting to see if protestors could point out Iraq on a map.  87% couldn't.  They actually played some of their comments on the radio, and the protestors didn't seem happy about the fact they were being asked questions.  <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, think about this - is it possible that anti-war protestors have caused the forthcoming war in Iraq to happen?  Think about it for a moment.<br>
<br>
If the world had a united front when confronting Iraq, even Saddam would have realized that the other arab countries asking him to go into exile might have a good point.  Odds are he would have cooperated fully realizing that he was isolated from the rest of the world, and it's likely we wouldn't have to have a full-scale military conflict.<br>
<br>
However, with all the anti-war rallies around the globe, they have caused Saddam to see weakness.  With thousands of people around the globe protesting a possible war (and therefor basically agreeing that what Saddam is doing is okay), he has been emboldened, and with Franch holding up a new UN resolution, he believes that the worlds popular support is leaning toward him.  Of course this makes him far more uncooperative since he thinks he can get away with it, which means the US and UK have no diplomatic options left, and they have to act militarily.<br>
<br>
Of course, protesting whatever you want is your right here in the US, but you wonder about the irony of protesting a war against a country where anti-government protesters are shot or tortured. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noobtar>Noobtar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/16/03 3:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I never said bomb any country with terrorists, I said eliminate them.

You realize of course that when Chamberlain signed the Munich accords that he was applauded around the world by the Anti-War protestors.  There was even talk of a Nobel Peace Prize.  I'm not 100% certain but that doesn't bode well for the last time there was world wide protests regarding a war.<br>
<br>
I don't necessarily agree with the publicly purported reasonings behind going to war, IE: Removal of WMD.  But I do know when I see a bad apple that needs to be plucked from the tree.  Removing this fruitloop is something we should have done 12 years ago.<br>

According to which report you read, 70-80% of Britain does not support a war. <br>
<br>
Britain's leadership supports us, big difference.<br>
<br>
Ayiar, I agree 100%  The guy should have been ousted a long time ago.  We also have a policy against assassinations which would be much better served than a war.  <br>
<br>
That he should have been ousted the first time doesn't justify the means to start a war again, though.  If he was so threatening last time, they would have taken care of him.  Nothing has changed since the last time we were there.  He was trying to purchase nuclear components prior to the Gulf War as well, and everyone knew about it back then too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbanderas>Mr Banderas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/16/03 4:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Noobtar, you wanted me to address your points:<br>

If you read back to my post, prior to Anika even posting that, I mentioned the exact same thing.  10 years ago, after the Gulf War, Americans couldn't locate Iraq on a map.  You'll notice that Anika posted her survey results after I had already mentioned that.  Hell, even Jay Leno walked around NYC asking people to point out Iraq on a map, the vast majority couldn't even point to the right area.  Both sides have people that don't know where Iraq is.<br>

If you know the nature of chemical weapons, a large number of them could be produced here in the US and still be effective.  Did you see the drones and read the reports off the AP that Americans were clamoring about that Iraq was hiding that could be used for chemical warfare?  They were made out of wood, ducktape, and what looked to be lawnmower motors.   And if people invade Iraq, why the hell shouldn't he use chemical weapons?  <br>

Who'd you hear that from?  Oh yeah, Colin Powell.  <br>

He's killed some of his own people, sure.  People that violently oppose him, renegades, etc.  You're used to living here in fantasyland where you don't have to deal with that stuff.  You can't press the American lifestyle and government on another country.  The problem with Americans is they've never been to another country, they've never seen what the world is like, they think everywhere can be just like here.  That's why so many Europeans in civilized and technological areas despise us.  We're so insular and content with our lives, and so secure that we're safe from harm, that we think these other areas should be just like us.<br>
<br>
Violent civilizations outside of our country have survived for thousands of years.  All of a sudden we think we have the right and obligation to move into them and force control.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When the Shi'ites in southern Iraq rose in rebellion, Saddam determined to kill as many as he could. An Iraqi army document, obtained by the U.S. State Department, showed that Iraq's military was under orders to &quot;withhold all foodstuffs, ban the sale of fish, poison the water and burn the villages.&quot; As many as 100,000 Iraqis were murdered by the regime in the months following the Gulf war.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Poison the water?  Burn the villages?  Great way to put down a rebellion there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Saddam's treatment of the Kurds was, if possible, worse. The Kurds are a non-Arab minority living in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. Saddam accused the Kurds, who are Sunni Muslims, of collaborating with the Iranians and gave orders for their extermination. The Iraqi air force used chemical weapons to gas the towns of Halabja, Goktapa and 200 smaller villages, killing as many as 200,000. Mothers were found with their scarves wrapped around their babies' faces, hoping to protect them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Now I'm not sure where Goktapa and Halabja are but I'm guessing they're in Iraq.  Gassing his own people.<br>

First, I don't support preemptive war in many circumstances.  However, this isn't preemptive war.  This is just a continuation of Operation Desert Storm which occurred and is continuing to occur under the mandate of the United Nations.  This is a natural direction for the process to take since Saddam violated the terms ending Operation Desert Storm.  The ending of this war was contingent on his acceptance and execution of the terms of surrender.  This conflict was begun by Saddam the day he invaded Kuwait.  The terms concluding Desert Storm made it very clear that Saddam's right to stay in power was entirely contingent on his proving to the world that he destroyed his weapons of mass destruction.  He has failed to do this.  The only reason he was not taken out was that we wanted to use diplomacy further if we could.  We have given the man 12 years now to disarm and prove it to us as he agreed to do.  His signature is on pieces of paper that acknowledge the surrender of Iraq and acknowledge that his right to lead Iraq was contingent upon his compliance with the terms of surrender.<br>
<br>
Thus he has forfeited his right to lead Iraq by violation of these agreements.  We do not need further resolutions, the current resolutions make it quite clear he has no right to maintain his position of power in Iraq unless he proves that he has disarmed.  We are obligated to remove him from power based on current UN resolutions.<br>
<br>
We're just finishing a job as set out by the United Nations.  If they don't want to finish the job they started, it's not our fault.<br>
<br>
The inspections system is only being used as a delay.  It cannot possibly disarm Saddam, and we all know that.  The way it is supposed to work is that the weapons inspectors show up in Iraq and are taken from site to site where they are shown weapons of mass destruction being disassembled.  They are supposed to be able to observe the entire process from start to finish.  An Iraqi declaration of, &quot;Umm, yeah, we got rid of all the weapons.  Umm, that was when we wouldn't let the inspectors in the country.  We don't remember what we did with the pieces&quot; is not going to cut it.  Saddam has turned inspections into a game of hide and go seek.  If you find the weapons, he says, &quot;Woops, my bad, I'll destroy that.&quot;  If you don't find the weapons he gets to keep it.  Of course Bush is not willing to play at this game.  He knows you can't find the weapons hidden underground in a country the size of Texas.  Those countries that are willing to play the inspections game by Saddam's rules do not care about disarming him and are failing to enforce the previous resolutions of the United Nations.  They know it isn't going to work, they just use it as a delay tactic.<br>

Well, to bring up the reality of that situation is to be called insensitive.  The reality of it however, is that the number killed during the events of September 11th was an extremely small number in relation to the number of people killed every day in the world outside of our country.  We lived for so long in our own insular world that we thought nobody could ever do anything to us.<br>
<br>
September 11th was the first massive terror attack in our history.  When you look at it, it could have been performed by a group of 10 people sitting in Idaho in their backyard that coordinated it.  It wasn't overtly complicated, it required nothing more than some flight training and some knives.<br>
<br>
The reality of the world is that there have been violent civilizations for thousands of years.  There's been a conflict between Irsaelis and Palestinians for thousands of years.  There's been death, terrorism, and mass killings for thousands of years.  All of a sudden we think we're going to change that?

Well, I hate to sound like some retarded commercial but we'll never know unless we try.  There are lots of things that have had overwhelming odds, and people succeeded.  Hell, when the founding fathers wrote the constitution did they think America would become what it is today?  I can almost say with no doubt that they did not.<br>
<br>
Did we think that the country we fought for freedom from would become our greatest ally?  Nope, but it happened.

This is thoroughly unimpressive.  You show a couple of polls in a few countries which (not very overwhelmingly) show opposition in those countries to war and you extrapolate from these few examples that ALL countries around the world are opposed to the war.  Some of the articles don't even have polls but just describe antiwar protests.  HELLO?!? Of course all countries have people in them that oppose the war and will protest, this proves nothing about the national view.  Drawing conclusions as you have done is obviously not logically sound, any idiot knows that.<br>
<br>
I still have seen no evidence that all countries besides the US oppose the war.<br>
<br>
As far as my education, don't be so sure you're better educated that people because they disagree with you.  Not that it matters, but you're probably wrong in thinking you are better educated than I am.<br>
