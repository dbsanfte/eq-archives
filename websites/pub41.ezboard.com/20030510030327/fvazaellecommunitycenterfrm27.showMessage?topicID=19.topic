The Search For Tranquility<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
<br>
The cobblestones of the street vanished and I fell through the world.  My body started to flain and twist as I dropped into the blackness surrounding.  Looking up, I saw the world from below as a rectangular plane that shrank in size until it was a mere twinkle on the black horizon; and then it also faded.  My senses had nothing to perceive; I had been swept to a place of nonexistance.  I could not hear my voice when I screamed, nor could I register the passing of time.  In this void, light had no definition, and I had to use my fingers to check if my eyes were open or closed.  My mind became restless, and I found myself in uneasy thought; as I traveled backwards in time and then forward again.  <br>
<br>
The journey back was not long, because in the life that I had known, I had lived for only one year.  I was a grown man that awoke in a child's bed, but unlike children, whose nightmares fade when they wake, I awoke to a nightmare.  When I gained consciousness, my body felt as if it had been torn apart; I hurt everywhere.  Each breath that I took was strenuous; my hands felt like they had been severed, and when I tried to move my leg, it felt as if someone, other than me, was twisting it in the wrong direction.  I figured that I was either in hell or living, or a combination of the words.  After a few minutes, I fell back asleep.<br>
<br>
I drifted in and out of consciousness for days, but eventually, the pain lessened and I awoke.  When my eyes adjusted, I glanced around and found that I was in a miniature room.  The bed that I had been lying on was three feet too small.  The furniture, which consisted of a bedside table and desk, could have been used by children.  It was as if the world had shrunk, or I had grown.  In addition to the smallness of the room's items, it appeared that I was underground; the room's walls were made of dirt, and overhead, I saw roots that hung down like tiny fingers poking through the ceiling.  Beyond the door, I heard the playful bark of a dog and children in song.<br>
<br>
It took me a few minutes for my senses to adjust, and when I was about to sleep again, the round door banged open.  A halfling entered.  He was short, but in the small room, he appeared to fit, and I was out of place.  He smiled at me and said, &quot;The monk had been--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>resurrected</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Am I dead?&quot;  I asked.  I thought that maybe I had passed on, and that by a cruel joke, Bristlebane had bartered for my sould, thus forcing me to live in a halfling heaven that was really a human hell.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.  No.  Not dead, but almost; you are in Rivervale,&quot; the halfling said.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Lum Linder Claw.  And you can thank me later when you get your strength back.  I dragged you out of the river near Runnyeye.  The goblins in there almost killed you, but I fixed you up, and luckily, no actually, thanks to Bristlebane I was able to revive you.  I need to you bandages, so just sit tight, and try not to holler.&quot;  I looked down at my body.  Almost the entirety of my torso had been swathed in bandages, some of which were stained pink.  &quot;This might hurt a bit.  So let's just talk while I do this.&quot;  He started to unwrap the bandages.<br>
<br>
&quot;So goblins got me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I dragged you out of the river.  What do you remember?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember nothing, other than waking up here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Turan.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Turan, you got cracked on the head pretty good, and it is going to take some time remember. . . if you ever do.  At least you still know who you are.  I have saved a few of you heros from Runnyeye, and some were worse than you.  They didn't remember anything--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I don't remember anything--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You remembered your name.&quot;  Lum was right.  I remembered my name, and more.  I was Turan, a human monk of the Ashen Order.  I was 28 years old.  I had jet black hair.  My frame was small.  I remembered these facts, but recalling any event in the past was like trying to decipher a book written in a foreign language.  I knew that the book told a story, but I did not know what it said.<br>
<br>
Our talk continued as Lum re-dressed the bandages.  Occasionally I had to bit down on my lip so I would not scream out in pain.  During the process, I looked down at the wounds and I was aghast.  It was as if my body had been the canvas for a psychotic painter, but instead of using a brush, the person had used a knife.  My body had been painted red.  Each line was a slash.  Each scribble was a piercing.  And well. . . the bump on my head was teh artist's signature.  When Lum finished, he got up and said, &quot;In time--hopefully--you will remember some of you past, but I have another question for you, &quot;Who are Mongar and Taffy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind then.  Maybe you will find out later.  The reason I ask is because you kept repeating their names over and over when you were unconscious.  For three months, you did.  But anyway, I am going to leave you now, you need some rest.  Later I will bring you some fresh jum-jum.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the next months, Lum and I became friends.  I have never experienced this type of generous altruism--not that I could have remembered--but I knew that Lum was special.  Occasionally, I would ask him. &quot;Lum why are you helping me?&quot;<br>
<br>
He would smile and say, &quot;I am not helping you.  I am merely practing my spells.&quot;<br>
<br>
It took my body three months to recover, and during this time I would often question Lum about my memory.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lum, Lum,&quot; I would say.  &quot;When are you going to help me remember?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't help you with that, but in time, your memories. . . hopefully, will return.&quot;  Some of my memories did return, but they were facts about general information, not events.  This lack of information was frusterating, and on occasion my temper would ignite.  It was as if my history was wrapped up in two names that gave me purpose, but not direction.  I needed to find Mongar and Taffy, but I did not know where to begin.  I lived with this question for four months, and as I recovered, my restlessness increased.<br>
<br>
I would often have nightmares.  Sometimes I thought these images were of the past.  Others I believed portended my future.  It was impossible to tell because when you have no memory, time becomes confusing, and you beging to see things, not as how they are, but as how you want them to be.  Eventually--perhaps by chance--Lum gave me another clue.  <br>
<br>
Since I had arrived, I heard the constant warning from Lum about the dangers of Runnyeye, but it occurred to me that the dangers to a small halfling might not be equivelent to that of a human monk.  I questioned him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lum, why is Runnyeye so dangerous?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goblins, hoards of them, evil, vile, lathe, and deadly. . . very deadly--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, what do you think I was doing there?  What would a human monk be doing in Runnyeye?&quot;  He paused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, I will tell; I think you were trying to pass through the caves.  It is the fastest way to the Karanas.  You cut through Runnyeye, then go through the Gorge of King Xorbe, and then you are in the Plains of Karana. . . And I found a not in your pocket.  Let me get it for you.&quot;  He returned with a small tattered piece of parchment.  On it, I saw two names: &quot;Southern Karnana, and Brother Qwinn.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 2<br>
<br>
Blackness upon blackness as I continued through the void.  My thoughts advanced, and I saw myself standing in front of a small cave that bore into the mountain.  I was staring into the mouth of Runnyeye.  I was there against Lum's advice--he had wanted me to go to the Freeport dojo to learn of my origins--but I had chosen to cross through Misty Thicket to travel to Southern Karana.  Two goblins stood in front of Runnyeye.  Each was short about a halfling's height, but unlike the halflings whose cute rounded bellies, hairy feet, and small stature had charmed me, the goblins were repulsive.  It was as if they were created by a lazy God, and what I saw was merely the blueprint of something with greated intention.  They looked viscous but for unknown reasons--I was not afraid.  <br>
<br>
I approached the cave staring at the goblins' wide yellow eyes, thin frames, and crooked postures.  The goblins backed away.  I pointed to the cave.  &quot;I need to get through to the gorge.&quot;  I said.  They did not respond, but continued retreating.  Then one said, in broken common, <br>
<br>
&quot;Mooto, will be back soon--go around the other way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let him come,&quot;  I said.  The goblins looked to each other with fearful expressions.  It was as if they were measuring their chances of survival by judging the likelihood that the other would flee.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Ok, we let you pass, but can you spare some--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no money.&quot;  It was true.  I have never carried anything of value other than a backpack filled with rations, bandages, and pumice stones.  &quot;Stand aside, and let me pass.&quot;  They did not repsond.  My temper flared and I struck out at one of the goblins.<br>
<br>
My fist crashed down on one of the goblins' head like a hammer.  It shattered the goblin's skull and he toppled to the ground.  The other goblin did not have time to flee.  He became my next victim as I struck him in the stomach with a kick.  He fell to the ground, clutching at his gut.  I approached.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are Mongar and Taffy?  You live if you tell me who they are.&quot;  The goblin was dumbstruck.  He tried to say something but his raspy breath only came out as a pitiful. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who. . .  Who . . . Who. . .&quot;   I had kicked to hard.  And he hadn't given me the answer that I was looking for, only another question. <br>
<br>
After the bodies had been disposed, I lit a torch and then went into Runnyeye.<br>
<br>
Blackness upon blackness as I continued to travel through the void.  My mind skipped forward.  I had entered Runnyeye, and I was not assaulted by death, as I had expected, but by swarms of goblins.  They were like fleas that tried to gnaw on my legs, but with controlled rage I dispatched of the vermin, and continued through.  My search was for Mongar--who I had thought was the head goblin--but he was elusive.  I found only junk that included, soot-blackened armor, baubles made of semi-precious stones, and masks that I assumed, the goblins had used, to make them appear less grotesque.  Eventually, I found my way to the Gorge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 3<br>
<br>
As I traveled through the void, my mind had focused on the first days of my new existence.  These were the days that were important to me, and although, I had only three names, I continued on to Southern Karna in hope that my origin would unfold.  I cannot say why I searched, as I cannot say why I continued to breathe, or why someone had rescued me; but I felt that underneath the scars there was a part of me that had been injured far greater than the physical pain that was inflicted to my body.  I was left with a sense of constant uneasiness, a dry kindling of my soul that flared into rage when any beast, animal, or person provoked me.  It had taken me two weeks to cross through the Gorge of King Xorb and into the plains of Sourthern Karana, and during this time, I had learned more about my abilities.  I learned that my fighting techniques were superior to any creature that assaulted me.  I had killed beasts that were part-bull and part-human.  I had disposed of giant lumbering men that had roamed the hills.  I had killed eagles the size of ogres that swooped down at me with their sharp claws.  <br>
<br>
After I arrived in Sourthern Karana, it had taken me a month to find Brother Qwinn, and upon our introductions, I learned that he needed my help.  He, however, could not help me.  I asked him about Mongar and Taffy, but he didn't know of them.  The tast the Brother Qwinn wanted me to complete involvned retrieveing two items that were stolen from him.  The items were the Code of Zan Fi, from the caves of Lavastorm, and the Idol of Zan Fi from the Dungeon of Guk.  The corrupted monks, Targin and Raster, had stolen these items.  I agreed to the quest because Brother Qwinn had given me direction.<br>
<br>
The quest that Brother Qwinn had given to me was difficult, and the corrupted monk did not fall easily.  Targin was a monster anomg monsters.  He had befriended a clan of kobolds.  I lured him out of hiding and killed him.  The other monk, Raster, was not as elusive.  When I found him in the Dungeon of Guk, he was already fighting another monk.  I helped him and killed Raster myself.  I had then laid claim to the Idol of Zan Fi.<br>
<br>
It took me two years to complete Brother Qwinn's task; and upon my return, he gave me a maroon robe.  I was pround to wear the robe, because not only was it an upgrade from the raw sild robe that I had, but it signified my perseverance and diligence.  The next tast that brother Qwinn gave to me would take me across the world to a continent that I knew nothing about.  I was to travel to Kunark to retrieve to magical pipes.  The pipes were in Karnor Castle and Chardok.  I agreed to the quest.<br>
<br>
I tried to remember more of my history.  My mind skipped forward again, but the memory of my life, wich equated to only the past two-and-a-half years, ended, and the present began.  I was stuck between realities.  I was lost in a void where the only subject was myself, and the only objects were the memories that I had.  I needed to reach my destination.<br>
<br>
I cannot say how long I was in the void.  It might have been days or minutes when I saw, in the distance, a faint yellow dot that gradually grew into a shimmering rectangle of light.  I was approaching it fast, and if I did not pass through, I would crash.  Hopefully, I would zone out on the other side of the world.  The light came closer; it wrapped around me head, and the darkness on either side was replaced by a milky panorama.  My eyes contracted, the world came into focus, and I was in a different land.  I have been x-located across the world.  I had made it to Kunark.<br>

<br>
I was in an enchnated valley that flowed with life.  On the ground I saw flowers.  Their stems rose shoulder high and then budded outward into plumes of color that splashed upon my senses and left me with a feeling of awe.  They had colors that I had never seen before.  In the distance, trees gently swayed in the frosty autumn wind.  However, the trees' foliage was still green and fresh.  It was as if nature had become vain and ignored the other three seasons but embraced spring, a time when life began.  I was overwhelmed.  In the distance I could here the running of water.  I followed my senses and arrived at a small river that flowed west.<br>
<br>
I reached into my backpack and took out a curde map of Kunark.  I found my location and knew that to get to Karnor Castle, I would have to travel east.  I began to run in this direction, along the river and up a gentle canyon slope.  I continued to follow the river toward the canyon wall, but eventually the land became rugged and the angle of the route increased to a point where I could go no farther.  I was standing in front of a looming facade, a sheer wall whose only scars were tiny caves that emptied life into the valley.  The river that I had followed led into one of these caves, and upon examination, I noticed that the surface of the water had frozen.  I lit a torch and walked cautiously over the brittle lattice.  The path through the cave was difficult and long.  On occasion, I would slip, and my foot would fall into the biting water below; but still I continued forward, with the hope that I would eventually emerge in the frozen tundra that would lead me to Karnor Castle.  It took the entire night to travel through the cave, and I felt a sense of relief when I finally emerged.  <br>
<br>
The early morning sky was a friendly greeting, and the sun's rays thawed out my chilled body.  I was in a different land.  I had left the enchanted valley, and what lay before my eyes was startling.  In front of me, frozen mountains pierced through the hardened armor of the ground below.  Their peaks angled sharply as they rose.  Between the mountains, there were valleys cut at odd angles.  They were deep crevices that cast strange shadows upon the snowy hills.  Pictures could almost be seen in them.  I was entranced as I stood at the edge of the cave looking outward, over the many miles I would traverse.   <br>
<br>
I traveled through, between, and over mountains.  The journey was difficult.  Occasionally, I would slip and my body would free fall, but I would recover; I was safe.  I continued for days, rarely eating and sleeping.  On some nights I could here the distant barking of dogs, and on others, whispers appeared to float carelessly on the wind.  <br>
<br>
After days of travel, the temperature warmed and the frozed mountains melted away to small hills of slushy snow.  Life was no longer shy and emerged unabashed, as I crossed fields of small shrubbery and twisted trees.  Eventually, I entered a barren area, and in the distance, I saw Karnor Castle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xtcxtc2000>xtcxtc2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/16/03 8:56:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Story Continued</span><hr size=1> Chapter 5<br>
<br>
As I approached Karnor Castle, my light jog turned into a timid walk.  The castle was magnificent but threatening.  It shot upwards to the sky and seemed to extend beyond the boundaries of structural design.  Surrounding the caslte, there was a wall that blocked the entrance to the main structure.  <br>
<br>
It took me an hour to reach Karnor Castle.  I had planned to enter the castle with stealth, but as I circled it, the only entrance that could be seen was the main gate along the west wall.  I slowly crept up toward the gate, slinking between the lonely plinths and fallen columns that were on the outskirts.  I entered some ruined houses.  I believed that these had once been servant quarters, but they had been abandoned.  From these dwelling I could see the entrance, but I could also see two creatures standing guard.  They blocked my way.<br>
<br>
My eyes widened at the sight of these beasts.  They were like sketches from a pervese mind, sketches that had magically popped out of a drawing and now stood animate, alive, and in all dimensions.  The creatures were a mix of human and dog.  They had hairy bodies, long ears, dewlaps, and snouts, yet they stood on two legs.  On occoasion, the half-dogs would communicate with one another, but, unlike a dog's bark, their whines and snorts were distinct and purposeful.  In addition, the half-dogs wore clothes and carried weapons.<br>
<br>
Each half-dog wore a red leather tunic.  In the center of the tunic was a large bronze insignia that bore the image of a lizard-like creature that floated above a jeweled throne.  They had no other clothes but wielded rusty swords that scraped across the ground.<br>
<br>
Judging the strength of something I had never fought was impossible.  The half-dogs might have outmatched me, but I realized that it was better to learn their strength outside the castle rather than trying to sneak in.  If things went bad, I would have time to flee.  Looking around the ruins, I saw some small rocks.  I picked one up, jumped out from where I was hidden, and threw it with all my strength.  I heard a hollow thud and then a yelp.<br>
<br>
It was as if the half-dog had been stung by a bixie.  He roared and left his post.  I ducked down and waited.  His padded footsteps gave away his location.  He was approaching along the west wall.  I shifted positions and hid in a doorway that would intercept his path.  I was facing the wall he would be approaching, but I was out-of-sight.  I crouched to the ground as his shadow crossed the doorway, and then his  maw, and then his body.  The beast was still oblivious to my exact location; I realized that he was searching for me with his sense of smell.  I had my chance; I struck.<br>
<br>
Knuckles collided into ribs and ribs collided into internal organs as his chest gave way to my focused fist.  Before he could howl in pain; I struck again, this time with my foot that became a blunted weapon that raised deftly, but then exploded downward toward his knee.  His leg arched into a &quot;V&quot; shape and he crumpled to the ground.  A quick kick to the throat, and he was dead.  His friend had taken notice and was whimpering as he approached.  He had been instilled with doubt, but not enough to make him tuck tail and flee.  He ambled forward between the ruined buildings, preparing himself; but before he was in striking distance he stopped sharply and started to flail at his back.  The half-dog made a muffled howl and then fell face down onto the ground.  I saw a small puncture wound in his loin.  His body twitched and then went rigid.<br>
<br>
I heard a voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you were wondering, it was poison, but step into the shadows--[i]now[/i]--step over here.&quot;  The voice said.  Whomever this was had helped me, but I was reluctant as I moved toward the voice.  I stepped into a building where the voice had originated, and I saw a wood-elf.  He was wiping the blood off his dagger.<br>
<br>
The wood-elf had dark skin and pointed ears.  His face was delicate, almost childlike, but due to his race's longevity, I was unable to make a guess as to his age.  The wood-elf continued to wipe the blood from the blade.  When he was done, he sheathed the weapon, looked up at me, and grinned a smile that impressed the words mischief and mayhem into my mind.  &quot;They are called drovlongs.  Nice little critters aren't they?&quot;  He said.<br>
<br>
&quot;You kill a lot of them?&quot;  I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yup, I like to have fun.&quot;  I nodded, and extended my hand.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Turan,&quot;  I said, &quot;And thanks!&quot; as we clasped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Devalon Deback, and as you probably know, there's no use in pretending that you don't know my trade.&quot;  I nodded.  His backstab was the tell-tale sign of his class.  He was a rogue.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well. . . I am a monk.&quot;  I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can see that.  I have seen you type enter Karnor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?  What were they here for?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The same thing that you are, I assume.  You have come for the pipe.  You do know how to get to it, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, but I can manage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is what all the monks say, and some have gotten close, but they always die.  It's such a shame that they try to get the pipe alone and never ask for help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you help me?&quot;  I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't help you. . . unless there is something in it for me, and there is.  I left Karnor to find help.  I was hired by some high-elves to retrieve some trinkets from inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you friends now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are trapped inside, in a small room.  They are stupid, but rich.  I was going to leave, but they doubled, then tripled my commission, and I agreed to find help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.  For now I will go with you, but if you try anything, you will find that I'm not the easiest person to kill, rob, or betray.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Normally, I would have relied on myself and ignored Devalon.  However, I was intrigued, and for a strange reason, I felt a connection to him.  I almost knew what it was like to be a rogue.  In addition, what he said was correct.  I did not know the layout of the castle, nor did I know the location of the pipe.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xtcxtc2000>xtcxtc2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/20/03 8:59:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Continued</span><hr size=1> Chapter 6<br>
<br>
We entered Karnor through the main gate.  The thick outer wall was constructed our of a porous stone.  This stone, as I would later find out, constructed the entirty of Karnor Castle.  It had a mottled appearance and was stained white and brown.  On the walls of the structure, I saw carved images illuminated by torches.  The images were of armed birds that stood upright.  On the ground, we saw bones of various races and piles of excrement that reeked with stench.  I felt uneasy and slightly nervous.  It was almost as if Karnor had a presence, an aura that breathed our fear and digested those brave enough to enter.<br>
<br>
We rounded a bend, and standing guard were two more drovlongs.  The drovlongs were standing post and were oblivious to our presence.  Behind the dogs was a drawbridge that led to a guard tower.  I could see more drovlongs standing upon a ledge that jutted outward.  Above this ledge the buildling contained no more outcroppings but had narrow slitted windows that were commonly used for archers.  This was not a regal castle, but a fortress constructed for defense.  The two drovlongs that were in front of us were larger that the ones outside.  Ther garb was similiar.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They don't move,&quot;  Devalon said.<br>
<br>
&quot;The two ouside didn't move either, until I hit one with a rock.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are static; whoever, created them didn't bother to give them much intelligence.  Their only purpose is to guard the drawbridge.  If they atack us where we stand, someone could sneak in from behind.&quot;  I nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is there another way around?&quot;  I said.  Devalon pointed to the moat.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We could swim through the moat, but that route is not the best.  It takes us to the sewers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which way then?&quot;  Devalon pointed straight.<br>
<br>
&quot;You attack these two, but be careful.  Another one roams behind.  I will sneak behind these and. . .&quot;  He poked his thumb into his palm, his palm fell down, and I understood his plan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's do it!&quot;  I said, but Devalon had disappeared.  I was a solo monk, with a dark shadow that I was beginning to like.  More rusty weapons were being wielded by the drovlongs, this time a spear and a morning star.  I was confident as I approached.  They saw me and slowly advanced.  I charged the drovlong with the spear.<br>
<br>
I cut the distance, rolled low, and struck the drovlong with an uppercut between its legs.  He howled.  My attention shifted to the dog holding the mace, which was now coming down in a wide overhead arc aimed at my head.  As I jumped to the side, the mace thudded loudly into the ground sending chips of stone flying.  He swung again and clipped me in the arm.  I was abashed; I had underestimated his adroit reflexes.  I steadied myself and motioned him forward.  His maw lunged down at me.  I side-stepped, he missed, and his body was low.  I jumped onto his back, my legs locked around his chest, and my arms wrapped around his face.  My fingers found the dog's eyes and I pulled back with all my weight.  I felt his eyes collapse inward, creating two new grotesque handhold for my fingers that were now covered in a wet slime.  He thrashed about and I alghted.  My next attack was a flurry of punches.  he crashed to the floor, dead, or soon to be.  <br>
<br>
The other drovlong had regained his comosure.  His voice was an octave higher as he hobbled forward, driven by anger.  Then I saw it.  Devalon's dagger cut through the shadow and he pierced through the drovlong's red tunic and into red below.  He then rotated his body so that he was face-to-face with the dog, his short-sword flew up, then down, in a quick arc.  More cuts from the blade and the dog was dead.  &quot;Easy, ain't it?&quot;  Devalon said, as he looted the corpse.  I nodded.  &quot;Now we go slow.&quot;  He pushed the corpses into the moat.<br>
<br>
We walked across the drawbridge, through the guard tower, and over another small drawbridge that led into the castle.  &quot;This way,&quot; Devalon said as he pointed in a direction that led left and into a courtyard.  When we entered, his pace slowed and he faced me.  &quot;Last night--here--a group of three got slaughtered.  They were trying to break through, but they weren't strong enough.&quot;  I saw what Devalon meant.  In the southwest corner of the courtyard, I saw three corpses: two male humans and a wood-elf female.  <br>
<br>
Devalon pointed at the bodies.  &quot;Warriors, both of them, and the girl, well, she was a druid.&quot;  I approached the corpses because I wanted insight as to what we would be fighting later.  The bodies were a mess; one of the male's armor had been pierced through in spots and a thin layer of blood stained the circumference of each hole.  The other male's body had lost its head.  His hands still grasped tightly at his neck.  The wood-elf female, the worst of the three, appeared to have no protection from what assaulted her.  Her wounds were deep cuts that were split like tiny lips, wetted white, and then placed strategically over the majority of her body.  Devalon looked down at them and said, &quot;They couldn't fight worth a damn, and they picked a terrible place to camp.  We heard their screams last night, but there was nothing that we could do.&quot;  Looking away, I felt nervous, and a sense of urgency arose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we close to your friends?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, follow me.&quot;  In the courtyard that we were in, there were three routes that we could take.  We chose the one that led to the second floor of the main castle.  We acended a circular staircase and emerged in a long corridor that we followed west.  The corridor ended, and we found ourselves outside, on a walkway, that extended along the perimeter of the castle.  The perimieter was narrow and ran along the second floor of the castle.  From here we went north, past a parapet, and proceeded, past a series of rooms that were part of the main structure.  &quot;We're here,&quot; Devalon said, as he pointed to, and then opended, a small wooden door.<br>

<br>
When I saw Devalon's friends, I realized why he had recruited me.  The three high-elves sitting quietly in the corner looked feeble and weak, not tall and radiant like I had expected.  The two female high-elves were meditating and barely glanced up when we entered.  In addition, their features of the seed were alike, as both had dull blue eyes, an extended jawline, large noses, and slightly crooked teeth.  They looked identical.  &quot;Twins&quot;   Devalon told me as I glanced at them.<br>
<br>
The high-elf male was as thin as an old parchment, and as fragile also.  He looked as if his diet consisted of black bread and globular water.  &quot;Is this the help that you found?&quot;  he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is Turan, a monk who is going to help us,&quot;  Devalons said.  I extended my hand to the high-elf.  He ignored the gesture.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Pallorid, the white elf, a noble paladin that fights for justice.  I carry Soulfire a mighty blade that enervates my body with strength and power.  I am the gratuitous protector of the twins.  I am the beginning of the end for all that is evil and loathe.  I am the vanquisher that vanquishes those that should be vanquished.  I am--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; I groaned.  The twins glanced up from their spell books.  Both of them were ghostly white making it hard to tell where their white robes ended and where they began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Genna Coteria,&quot; one said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Genna is the Enchanter,&quot;  Devalon said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jeanna Coteria,&quot; said the other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jeanna is the wizard. . . I call them the silent duo.&quot;  Devalon looked down at the twins.  &quot;Genna, Jeanna, tell Turan what you are looking for.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We are here for bracelets.  Magical bracelets that are supple, beautiful, and when worn will grant us more intelligence,&quot; one of the twins said.<br>
<br>
In addition to the high-elves, there was also a dwarf in the room.  He wore cobalt blue armor which was dented in places.  He was sleeping and his snores were alarmingly loud.  &quot;Who is that?&quot;  Devalon said.<br>
<br>
&quot;We found someone also,&quot; Pallorid said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can see that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His name is Apoprage.  He is a warrior who stumbled into the room earlier.  He is willing to help if Jeanna evacuates him when we are done.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; Devalon said.  He appeared carefree and unburdened by his surroundings.  This bothered me.  It was as if nothing mattered to him, a fact that was not surprising.  I guessed by his trade, he was capable of sneaking out of Karnor on a whim.<br>
<br>
After the introductions had been made, Devalon called me over.  &quot;Let's talk strategy.  When night falls, you are going to be the bait.  I need you to lure mobs back to the room.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure,&quot; I asseneted; I didn't mind this request because if I was the bait, I could control the number and type we would be facing.  Devalon pointed beyond the door and motioned in the direction we had come from.  &quot;Continue on that way.  The path breaks right then loops around to a jail.  the jail has some dogs and a few skeletons.  Leave them be.  Past the jail, there is a staircase that leads down to a room with four dogs.  In this room there are four Drovlong Warlords.  They are large dogs that command the others; they are the targets, and the biggest one has your pipe.&quot;  I nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;What direction should I start from?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;First bring in the ones that are roaming: skeleton, dog, or ghost, it doesn't matter.  We will fight in this room, since it is secluded and large.  After these mobs are cleared, go to the Warlords and try to lure the biggest Warlord out.  He is the one that has the pipe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How will I know that he will have it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't, but if he doesn't, we will kill the other Warlords, and then, I will go down there and search the room for.  After you get the pipe, you promised to stay and help the others.  I need your help also; I need the commission.  I don't know where the bracelets are, but the elves keep insisting that the Warlords have them.  If we don't find any bracelets, i have a few of my own that I can slip on the corpses.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If you have the bracelets already, why didn't you sell them to the high-elves?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They don't know what they look like, so they wouldn't trust me.  They shouldn't trust me either, because the ones that I have are fake.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What if you have an extra pipe also?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't--the pipe is here for sure--I know it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you remember when I told you that lots of monks have entered and few have left.  They always die close to here.&quot;  That sounded reassuring.  Devalon patted me on the back and sighed.  &quot;We are both rogues, Turan, searching for things; I admit the fact, but you are in denial.  If you trust me, things will work out.&quot;  I didn't reply, nor did I trust him.  He had an answer to any question that I asked, and they all seemed to make complete sense.  However, what really bothered me was Devalon's over-friendly attitude toward me.<br>

<br>
During the remainder of the afternoon we rested and prepared.  The elves secluded themselves in the corner and chatted in their native tongue.  Occasionally I would llisten, and although I could not speak High-Elf, I enjoyed hearing their melodic language.  It was one of their few redeeming qualities.  During the day, from time-to-time, Devalon would leave to scout the area.  He would return with a smile and say &quot;one less that we have to worry about.&quot;  I couldn't tell if he was joking.  For me, the remainder of the afternoon was spent in thought.  <br>
<br>
As a monk, I always tried to find a purpose in my surroundings, but in Karnor, it was hard.  I knew that the rewards from the quest were great, but the reasons behind my efforts did not lie in the material, but the immaterial treasure that I hoped to receive.  I hoped to gain knowledge about my past.  However, during the three years that I had been doing the quest, nothing had been revealed other than the dreams that I had.  And there were not reliable, for who is to know, whether the images that I saw were: events of my past, fiction of the present, or omens of the future.  <br>
<br>
The dreams came to me each night.  I would often dream of my only friend; I missed Lum's quirky attitude and kindness.  On these nights, I was blessed, because on others, I was assaulted by nightmares.  I often saw my own death in many different ways.  The dreams never made sense, but still, I clung to them.  I cherished the idea that I had gained a part of my memory back, when in actuality, I hadn't.  These are the thoughts that occupied my mind, but as the afternoon waned, I thought about the task at hand, the quest, and my unfortunate predicament of being stuck in a castle with a rogue, and four naive heros.  I was not attuned to working with others.  And even though I like Devalon and his nonchalant attitude, I would be a fool to trust a rogue.  But I had no choice; I needed the pipe.<br>

<br>
As the hours passed, the sun bowed out, and the moon made its nightly cameo, lauded with praise from the cacophony of barks and howls heard in the distance.  It was time to start fighting.  I was ready, and I exited the room.  Torch light illuminated the walkways that I would be navigating, and the moon, now center stage, made the castle glow with an eerie light.  It was sufficient, but not ideal.  <br>
<br>
I walked north toward the jail and then cut right, down a small corridor that led into the main structure of the castle.  I continued down this corridor and rounded a bend that broke left.  Upon rounding the bend, I saw what appeared to be a floating shadow, but unlike a shadow, the features of the apparation were distinct.  It felt as if I was looking both through and at him simultaneously.  The form appeared to be Iksar.  It had a long scaled tail and a rounded oval-shaped head.  The shadow was close, a dwarf-toss away.  It turned on me.  I slowly crept backwards toward the room.  The ghost started to move in my direction; its forked tongue flicked in-and-out of its mouth.  I dashed back to the room.  I heard his padded footsteps behind me.  <br>
<br>
The door crashed open, and I ran in yelling &quot;Ghost! Ghost!&quot;  Three small Dravlongs entered the room.<br>
<br>
Those aren't ghosts,&quot; Apoprage shouted.  He was right, I had picked them up on the way back.  Apoprage was the closest to the dogs, near the door, and he began to swing his blades in wide looping arcs that lacked precision or control.  We were in trouble; he looked like a child in his first fight.  He was swinging blindly, hoping to make contact.  Devalon and I watched the spectacle, incredulous, and scared to approach, lest we be struck down by friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;Help, you cowards!&quot;  Apoprage yelled.  He was blocking the door and pushing the dogs out.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Get back--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fool</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot; Devalon said.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Cowards! Cowards!&quot; Apoprage screamed as he struck one dog with the flat of his blade.  The dog fell backwards out of the room.  Apoprage followed it.  Devalon looked at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Turan, let's go.&quot;  We exited the room; the three high-elves remained.  On the walkways, we could see the ghost; he was close to the door.  His hands were bathed in a blue light and I knew that he was casting a spell.  I saw this and struck him with a round kick that sent him crashing into the wall.  It was as if I had kicked a bubble of air, but my foot was still effective.  He was pinned and I struck out again at the dis-corporeal entity, with a mighty punch, but I felt only stone as the ghost vanished through the wall.  I felt a slight pop in my hand, my mouth lost control, and I howled at the moon.  <br>
<br>
Apoprage laughed, &quot;Ghosts, you fool.&quot;  He and Devalon were still battling the dogs.  They had killed one, and each was busy with another.  The ghost, as I had expected, had warped through the wall, and into the room.  I heard Pallorid's high-pitched battle cry.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm getting the ghost,&quot; I said.  Devalon nodded.  I entered the room.  My hand was still throbbing, sending bolts of pain up-and-down my arm.  My left arm had been disabled.  In the room, Pallorid was fighting the ghost who was trying to cast its spells.  Its hand would flash blue, then red, but Pallorid's wild swings were interrupting the process.  Its back was turned to me. <br>
<br>
I flew through the air with leg extended.  My foot clapped as thunder on the back of the ghost's head sending it forward into Pallorid's sword.  Its body went limp, and its form dissipated into a fine white powder that sprinkled to the ground.  Apoprage and Devalon entered the room.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We won, but it was an ugly fight,&quot; Devalon said.  That is how I felt also.  I looked down at my hand and frowned; two of my knuckles had disappeared.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Why so many!&quot; Pallorid yelled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up, or maybe you want to go out next time,&quot; Devalon admonished.  Pallorid capitulated.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Come over here, Turan; let me get you hand fixed up.  I can heal you.  Next time--be careful.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded and agreed.  After Pallorid had healed my minor wound, we rested briefly.  I sat alone in a corner with Devalon.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think of our four friends?&quot;  Devalon asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Novices.  They are going to get us killed.  Apoprage is frightfully aggressive, Pallorid is--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.  Yeah.  I know,  we're not going to be here long.  I have a plan.  You know the bracelets that I told you about earlier--the fake ones?  I'm going to slip them onto the Drovlong Warlord after you get your pipe.  If I do this, they'll be happy and ready to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea, let's get out of here. . . after we get the pipe.&quot;  I didn't feel guilty about what Devalon had planned to do.  The others had no business in Karnor, and Devalon's trick would probably save their lives.  &quot;It's obvious that they can't fight; why did you accompany them to being with?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a guide&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;So you escort would be heros on quests?  for a fee right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I make money, but I deserve it.  You wouldn't believe the fools that I see.  All around.  Sometimes--&quot; he said as he slapped his forward with the palm of his hand--&quot;I think that I am going to go crazy!  And these elves, and their dwarf friend are fools.  Utter fools with the milk included.&quot;  He pointed to the high-elves.  <br>
<br>
&quot;That's crazy Devalon.  Isn't it dangerous?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah it is, many have died, but they would have died anyway.  The high-elves, if I had not helped, might have got lost on the way to Karnor Castle.  If they were lucky and had made it here, they would have never made it to this room.  You see, Turan, I'm just the map that guides them, but, unlike a map, I can fight.  I'm saving lives and getting paid in the process.&quot; I laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;A noble rogue?&quot;  Devalon paused, looked at me, and for a second I thought that I could see a hint of sadness in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;My conscious is--bleh, I don't have to explain myself to you Turan.  You ask too many questions.  But, I don't care for these high-elves, and that is why I'm going to slip the fake bracelets onto the Warlord.  I would have earlier--I didn't know how pathetic they were--but I will not leave till you get you pipe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But Devalon, why does it matter if I succeed or fail?<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't really, but. . . I'm starting to like you.  A little.  And if you do get it, you'll probably go after the second one and accompany me to Chardok.  There is something that I want, and I could use your help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want in Chardok?&quot;  I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;A certain sarnak's head,&quot; he said as he drew his finger across his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whose?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You ask too many questions, Turan.  And I bet I can guess your next one also.  You are going to ask, 'but Devalon how do you know about my--secret monk quest?'&quot; he said as he imitated my low voice.  &quot;I'll explain it to you later.  But now, go do your job!&quot;<br>

<br>
I was more cautious of the beasts that would be tailing me.  It was hard, and on occasion, I had to be creative, but I brought them back solo.  Usually Devalon got the killing blow, as his abilities were greater than those of the elves and dwarf.  When Devalon attacked, each of his blows landed with precision.  The slightest cut from his blade or pierce from his dagger seemed to have deadly effects.  <br>
<br>
Apoprage and Pallorid--as I had learned earlier--were not so adept in blade nor intellct; however, they did serve a purpose.  Pallorid healed my minor wounds, and Apoprage's fierce yells and overbearing appearance attracted the monsters as they entered the room.  This would allow Devalon to sneak around and kill the mobs from behind.  The high-elf twins were still book-bound and were barely aware of what was happeneing.  The process repeated as I slowly made my way toward the jail.  <br>
<br>
After I had cleared a path to the jail, I informed the group that the next mob was going to be from the Warlord room.  I left the room and made my way down the corridor.  The castle now seemed deserted because the numberous spawns that were roaming earlier had temporarily been disposed of.  I passed the jail, ignored the skeletal fingers and furry paws which groped between the bars, and the proceeded down a circular set of stairs toward the Warlord Room.  At the bottom of the stairs was a door.  I opened it and entered.  <br>
<br>
It was mealtime for the Drovlong Warlords, and on the menu was elf and dwarf.  That is how I saw them when I entered the room, sitting at a table eating adventurors and telling them in the process.  They were the largest dogs I had seen.  They were two-trolls-tall and viscous looking.  Each Drovlong Warlord was armed with a sword sheathed at their waists .   They looked up from the meal, licked their lips, and probably saw me as dessert.  I turned and darted up the stairs.<br>
<br>
When I passed the jail, I stopped and waited with poise; my shoulders bobbed up-and-down.  The largest dog appeared first, followed by the other three.  He motioned the others back.  They barked in complaince and retreated toward the staircase.  &quot;A dog with honor,&quot; I thought as I chuckled to myself.  The largest dog attacked.  His sword was not drwan; for him, paws and maw were enough.  He raked at me; I dodged.  My mind focused, and I avoided his attacks.  His third blow was a haymaker, aimed at my head; I rolled, but the blow struck me.  I toppled to the floor.  <br>
<br>
The attacks ceased, and I heard him bark out a command.  The other dogs were leaving, walking down the staircase that led back to the Warlord Room.  They had been split, and I was alone with the biggest Drovlong Warlord.  &quot;The plain is working.  It's working,&quot; I thought.  <br>
<br>
I heard the rusty scrape of his sword leaving its sheath.  His furry paw reached down and grabbed my wrist.  He lifted me up, and I knew his intention.  Dangling from hooks on his armor were slabs of dired meat that included a collection of paws, feet, and other body parts.  They were his trophies, and my hand was going to added to the collection.  &quot;Got to be fast.  Got to be fast.  I need my hand,&quot;  I thought. <br>
<br>
The raised sword flew at my wrist, but as this occured, my dangling feet became fixed on the ground and my once limp arm shot up and met his elbow.  My blow steered the blade off-course and into the wall.  Immediately, I struck upward, into his maw.  He released me, and I crept backward.  &quot;Follow me, follow me, &quot; I thought.  The drovlong howled, but slowly advanced.  The dog was wounded; his nose was spurting blood in tune to each ragged breath, but still he advanced.  His gaze was fixed and in hazy eyes, I was the target.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Come to me.  Come on, don't get your friends,&quot; I thought.  I limped backward and pretended that my death was close.  I shook my hands.  &quot;No more--please--no more.  I will leave,&quot;  I said hopeing that he understood my ragged Common.  I rounded the corner that led back to the room and continued creeping backward.  We were now face-to-face.  The Drovlong Warlord charged, but I had reached the door.  I opened it and dashed inside.  <br>
<br>
With a growl he followed me through, but with a whine he was cut down, not at the neck, but at his ankles that tripped over the low swords held by Pallorid and Apoprage who were crouched adjacent to either side of the door.  His stature decreased and his composure followed as he toppled to the floor.  Devalon ended the dog with a slash to the throat.  <br>
<br>
My heart pounded from both adrenaline and anticipation, as Devalon searched the corpse.  He looked at me and smiled. &quot;This is yours,&quot; he said.  He threw a hollow metal pipe toward me.  <br>
<br>
It was not what I had expected.  The pipe looked plain.  It was not made of valuable metal, nor was it layered with precious stones.  However, in my hands, I felt a sense of happiness surge through my body.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Is this it?&quot; I asked.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  Not, what you expected. . . I know, but it's the one,&quot; Devalon said.  Jeanna and Genna had finally removed their noses from their spell books.  They had yet to do anything to help.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do they have the bracelets?&quot; one of the twins asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Suppple, beautiful, and made of ivory, &quot; Devalon said as he held up two plain bracelets.  The twins cheered at the fake baubles.  Inside, I was laughing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Let's get out of here.&quot; I said.  <br>
<br>
&quot;But are there more bracelets?  Surely, there are more to be found.  You gave us only two, and we need one for each wrist,&quot; the twins said in unison.  I shook my head.  Apoprage stomped his foot on the ground and grumbled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You heard the monk--no more--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>bracelets</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot;  The twins ignored Apoprage.  And with rueful countenance asked again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you check around Mr. Monk. one more time, just once more?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There are no more Drovlong Warlords; there was only the one that we killed.  He was the only one that I saw,&quot; I said.  Devalon nodded his head.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Turan says that there are no more.  Please, don't be such a greedy--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bitch,&quot; I thought to myself.  My eyes widened as I watched the door crash open.  The remaining Drovlong Warlords entered.  It was my first thought, and it was quite appopriate.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Back wall!&quot; Devalon yelled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You lie.  What are those?  What are those?&quot; one of the twins yelled as she pointed to the three large Warlords.  <br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Back wall</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->! Devalon yelled again.  <br>
<br>
We regrouped as the snarling dogs approached.  The Drovlong Warlords were not alone, and four of the smaller ones entered after them.  &quot;Now we will see what you're made of,&quot; Devalon said to me.  He had a grin on his face.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Crazy, crazy rogue,&quot; I thought.  <br>
<br>
The twins were behind us and apparently forgotten thier earlier query.  They were beginning to chant.  <br>
<br>
The drovlongs attacked in unison, boring into our huddled group with sword and claw.  I parried and blocked and struck out, but when the dogs came in numbers, it was hard to find a weakness.  Jeanna--who was the wizard--ended her spell first.  Her fingers sparked blue, and energy as controlled lightning shot outward from her fingertips and collided with the dogs.  The Drovlong Warlords were knocked back from the force of the spell.  They crashed into the wall near the door.  One of the smaller dogs, which had been hit, flew through the open door, over the small wall, and into the moat below.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get us out!&quot; Devalon yelled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Get close and hold them off for a minute!&quot;  Jeanna said.  She began to cast her next spell.  <br>
<br>
Genna--the enchanter--who had also been casting, finsihed her spell.  She pointed her hands toward me.  A sense of power shot through my nose and mouth; I felt euphoric.  The spell that she had cast, sped up my reflexes and tweaked my will.  My mouth became dry, my jaw started to clench, and i felt invincible.  It was ecstasy undermined by the annoying reality that possible death was in front of me.  My mind mind began to rave.  I needed to kill the dogs because I needed to be alone.  I needed to enjoy whatereve she did.  <br>
<br>
I charged a Warlord that was approaching, and, in my tempered haste, brought him down with a flurry of punches.  Genna cast her spell again, and this time Devalon got a hit.  He sprang into action, his sword and dagger became a dervish blur that slashed at the dogs.  I killed another with a punch to the temple.  We were winning, but more were entering the room.  They seperated our group.  Jeanna completed here second spell.  More lightning, and fragments of dogs flying across, out, and around the room like plush toys in the wake of a child's tantrum.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Get us out, you stupid prig,&quot;  Devalon hollered.  Jeanna began to cast again.  <br>
<br>
&quot;No more lightning.  No more lighting.  Just Evacuate us,&quot; I thought.  I looked about.  At least six dogs were in the room.  Twelve arms were attacking us, and one finally got lucky.  I heard a yell.  The Drovlong that Apoprage had been fighting had found flesh, split flesh, and severed flesh.  He was dead.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Get us out.  Please,&quot;  I thought again.  The room was going crazy.  And Pallorid--the high-elf paladin--began to panic.  He ran for the door.  He swung his sword like a mad-elf, as he struck anything in his path, but escaping to the door was probably equivelent to running blindfolded and naked through Kithicor at night.  I'm not sure how he died, but something got him along the way.  <br>
<br>
Finally, Genna finished her spell, and a new hope arose.  With hands aimed high, she directed a prismatic pulse of energy that flowed toward the drovlongs.  They stopped attacking and tottered about in a trance.  Some of the dogs smiled and grasped at the air with their furry paws.  Others cringed and whimpered.  They were like living statues stuck in time, stuck in a moment where emotions, good or bad, culminate and focus to a point where the only escape is to shut-down.  &quot;They are mesmerized!&quot;  Genna shouted as she ran across the room.  &quot;Now, get us out!&quot; she screamed to Jeanna, the wizard.  <br>
<br>
Jeanna, finally, completed her spell.  I sighed with relief as milky white cloud engulfed the room.  There was a flash of light; the twins had vanished.  Devalon and I looked at each other with bewildered expressions.  The dogs were still in a trance.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Where did they go?  Where did they go?&quot;  I asked.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They evacuated, but they forgot to take us with them!&quot;  One of the dogs broke free of the enchanter's spell.  He lunged at Devalon.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Devalon!&quot; I yelled. He sidestepped, and I struck the drovlong down.  I glanced about the room.  Another dog came out of its trance and then another.  The world was coming back to life.  &quot;What now?&quot;  I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Run</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!&quot; Devalon screamed as he dashed through the door.  I followed him and slammed the door on the room of drovlongs.  And for an instant, I believed the adage that said that out of sight is out of mind.  <br>
<br>
We were now on the walkway, but on either side, more dogs were blocking our escape.  One of the dogs charged at us.  Devalon swung low with his short-sword, the dog reeled and Devalon shoved him over the walkway into the moat.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Can you swim?&quot;  Devalon asked.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Too many--more are coming--I'm going to hide.  Meet me later outside the castle, but you,&quot;--he pointed to the water--&quot;Swim.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;What about you?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Go--I will be fine,&quot; Devalon said as he slashed at another drovlong who lunged at us.  <br>
<br>
I looked over the small wall and jumped.  The water below rushed up at me, and when I hit, I became disoriented.  I began to swim toward the drawbridge that would take me out of Karnor.  The swim was strenuous.  The water was like mud.  It clogged my nose and stung my eyes.  Overhead I could hear the barks of frantic drovlongs; Karnor was in a frenzy.  The journey was short, but when I crawled out of the brackish water, it felt like I had just swum across Lake Rathe.  I was exhausted.  A voice called out to me.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Turan.  Turan.  Come over here!&quot;  I shook my head and wiped the sludge out of my eyes.  &quot;Turan.  Turan--fast--come over here!&quot; the voice repeated.  I looked up.  The twins were sixty feet in front of me.  &quot;It was an accident, we didn't mean to leave.  Fast.  We will get you out.&quot;  Genna was gesticulating wildly with her arms.  I began to walk toward them.  Jeanna--the wizard--was casting again.  I assumed it was another evacuation spell.  I couldn't care less where it took them, as long as it took me also.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm coming,&quot; I said as I began to jog toward them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Train!  Train!  Behind you!&quot; Genna shouted.  I could barely understand her screams.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  Yes.  I'm coming, hold on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Train!  Train!  Behind you!&quot;  She yelled as she pointed beyond me.  <br>
<br>
I turned.  My pupils widened.  It was as if death was approaching me.  I had felt this feeling before and it had scarred me.  I had been lucky; I had cheated death, but now, it had returned and was charging at me like a battering ram.  It was overkill.  It was an army, a legion, of dogs, skeletons, and ghosts rushing toward us.  <br>
<br>
I made it to the twins, but the spell wasn't fast enough.  We were overtaken. Instinctively, my feet became one with the ground.  My muscles tensed.  They became hard like stone.  The twins were not as lucky.  They had no protection and were beaten into the ground; Karnor Castle had two new white stains.  <br>
<br>
My concentration was about to break, and when this happened I would be the third smear.  Death was my only option.  My muscles relaxed and the rain of blows turned into a storm that pounded down upon me.  Something struck me in the stomach.  Something slashed at my arm.  My body became limp and I fell to the ground.  My heart rate slowed, and my eyes stared blankly at the dogs above, but my play at death wasn't convincing.  It had failed, and now I was being killed.  It was happening again, and this time I doubted that Lum would be around to save me.  I willed myself dead again because I needed to live.  This time, the dogs believed my play at death and slowly backed away.<br>
<br>
It was as if Quellious had smiled and had parted the sea of death with his merciful hand, but I was not safe yet.  Something wrapped around my leg and started to drag me back toward the castle.  In my position, I couldn't see what it was.  <br>
<br>
Then, whatever had grabbed me, lifted me into the air by the leg--Quellious smirked-- and my body was twirled around-and-around in a wide overhead arch.  I screamed out as the world spun before my eyes.  My mind was wracked in pain, and I started to hallucinate.  The drovlongs disappeared, my body shrank in size, and all I could see was a gaint green reanimated hand twirling me around as if my body was a rock and my leg was a sling.  Eventually, it let loose, and I soared through the air and into the moat.   <br>
<br>
I tried to swim down, but waves of pain erupted through my body.  If I surfaced, the dogs would see me.  I do not know what willed me on, but something did.  I refused to be killed by drovlong, ghost, or skeleton.  My air began to wane; my chest felt like it was expanding.  I needed  air; I needed to breath.  My mind cogitated and I thought: &quot;I can not go to the afterlife like this.&quot;  I was a monk with no origin.  I needed to breathe.  And then, something inspired me; I became better than I was before.  I reached into my robe and found the solution.  I removed the pipe and placed to my lips.  It became an extension of my mouth that brought me life when I was close to death.  But this was only the beginning.  <br>
<br>
I waited patiently, and in my underwater grave the simple phrase, &quot;I will survive,&quot; replayed in my head like a scratched record on a gnomish phonograph.  At first I said the phrase with certainty because I was confident that the wavy images above, the drovlongs, who paced back-and-forth, would eventually become bored.  They would give up their search and allow me to creep up and out of Karnor Castle.  But as the minutes passed and the hours emerged, my mantra, which had once felt endearing, became vapid and stale, listless like an inspid platitude that crept out of my mouth and then slowly sank into the murky water below.  <br>
<br>
I was dying.  My lungs felt compressed; each breath taken was strained.  The pipe that had granted me air seemed to have shrunk as each inhalation was a tedious process.  One of my legs--the one which I had been swung by--was limp, and any movement that it made brought waves of pain that cascaded along my back and leg.  I began to shiver; I began to remember the dreams I had.  I wanted to remember the world for what it might have been.  And when this occurred, my mind reversed upon itself and time no longer walked in a straight line.  I started to remember the dreams that I had had in the past three years.  <br>
<br>
I started in the beginning.  I was a child again.  I was playing a game of hide-and-seek, darting through shadowed streets and small alleys.  I crept between the small houses and emerged at a bank.  I approached it, sat down, and opened my palm.  I was cadging coppers in the wealthiest city in Norrath.  An item dropped carelessly to the ground.  I picked the sparkling item up.  It slid into my pocket.  A hand grabbed my wrist.  I felt pain.  I hurt.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It's not that easy,&quot; a voice said.  I had been caught stealing and the price would be my off-hand.  <br>
<br>
&quot;No, I didn't mean to.  I'm hungry.  So hungry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you believe you are a rogue?&quot;  the voice said.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I would never stab you in the back,&quot; I replied.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We need to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You. . . You found me.  Why was I tempted to rob you a second time?  I'm so sorry.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;No we need to leave Karnor.  This is Devalon.&quot;  I felt myself being dragged along the ground.  And then the world faded.   <br>
<br>
<br>
