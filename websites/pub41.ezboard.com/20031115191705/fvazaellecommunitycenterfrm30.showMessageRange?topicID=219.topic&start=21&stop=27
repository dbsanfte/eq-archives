She's not implying they're some rigorously derived numbers.  Also, I believe she said in the next 40 years, and you talked about  in the next 10.  I didn't even put a number on it, I just said &quot;likely.&quot;  There are some things that you cannot get an accurate percentage chance for.  It's just not a number you can derive through any logical process.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that there is close to a 0% chance of a sovereign nation attacking the US in the next 10 years.  Anika and I aren't even worried about that, we are worried about terrorists.<br>
<br>
We are worried about NK because we believe (and history would support us) that NK will sell weapons to terrorists for the right price.<br>
<br>
Overall, I think the world has already forgotten 9/11.  They are back to their way of thinking that everything will just be ok and we don't have to think about the rest of the world.  I think it will maybe take a disaster like nuclear holocaust to wake people up and realize how serious the terrorist threat is.<br>
<br>
I think if you really perceive just how dangerous that threat is, you are inclined to be much more tolerant of President Bush and his efforts to fight it.  Some of us believe that this is the greatest threat our country has ever faced, and no level of effort we put forth to contain it will be sufficient.  Essentially, anything that Bush wants to do to hinder terrorism is ok with me.  People worry about a few soldiers dying.  That sounds bad, but it doesn't sound like much when you compare it to the 20 million people that would die in a day if a nuclear bomb were detonated in NYC.  I for one believe that those that oppose Bush simply do not comprehend the magnitude of the threat.<br>

<br>
As Amm said, I was looking over the next 40 years.  I don't think, unless a radical power-shift in the world occurs, that any soverign nation would be foolish enough to attack us directly.  With the massive military advantage we have now, and extrapolated out over the near future, that nation would be basically signing a death warrant for itself.  Don't see it as a factor.<br>
<br>
However, someone, somewhere will probably manage to set off a nuclear device.  I listed 4 cities as likely targets because:<br>
<br>
1)  NYC, obvious target.<br>
2)  Washington DC, again, obvious target.<br>
3)  LA, as the 'entertainment capital' of the US, many people will see that as the source of the 'filth and perversion' that the US is spreading across the world via movies and television programs.  <br>
4)  Seattle/Redmond.  Huge port area, close to an unprotected border, and home of a company that largely signifies the pinnacle of capitalism, more or less.  <br>
<br>
If I had listed a 5th, it would be Las Vegas, due to the same reasons as LA.  Another dangerous place, and perhaps one of the most damaging from a terror standpoint, would be someplace like Disneyland.  Talk about sending a message.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's not something to hide in a closet and cower in fear over.  Odds are when it happens, they will have been little if nothing we could have done to prevent it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rathic>Rathic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/6/03 1:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=219.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lol...</span><hr size=1> i find this conversation very intersting... being that i am a nuclear weapons maintainer for the USAF <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   if i were u all, id be more worried about mysteriously empty russian stockpiles, than i am about NK. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What exactly has changed after 9-11 ? It sure changed my perception of safety. But when I think objectively, the terrorists didn't need much to perform their deed. They used threats of lethal force and a rudimentary pilot training and that would be about it. The only real hard to get resource they had was the money they needed for the training and providing for 20-30(?) people during their stay in US. It would be pretty hard to do something similair nowadays, but of course they would use new means now.<br>
<br>
Until this date, I cannot think of advanced weaponry that has been used by terrorists. Did we ever doubt terrorists would hesitate to use a nuclear device if they got their hands on it ? I wouldn't, still I feel more unsafe now.<br>
<br>
Of course, the fact that terrorists didn't have access to WMD's in the past, does not mean they will never get it. The risk is there, but I don't see it as inevitable. How much the risk really is, I cannot say. Who knows ya'll are right and Saddam already supplied terrorists with chemical weapons. It would be a bad situation. What about Russia's cache of nuclear devices ? How careful is Russia with their sample of smallpox ? What if some Eurotrash pisses off Rathic and he uses a loophole in the security system to bomb Paris <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ?<br>
<br>
Maybe we're more scared because 9-11 seemed like a movie. If something like that could happen, why not some of the more horrific scenarios that Hollywood has presented.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm rambling and going nowhere with this. My point, 9-11 was a wakeup-call, but I am still fairly confident we have the ability to prevent the really big disasters from happening. On terrorism itself, I don't think we could totally stop it, except by removing their ideas. I believe extremism can die out eventually, at least to the point it will become fairly insignificant. <p>---------------<br>

It really let us know the extent to which Arabs hate us.  It's too bad they don't understand that we actually just want peace in the region, and the reason we support Israel over them is because of terrorism, the very means they are using to gain support.<br>
<br>
I disagree with you that we can prevent it.  I just don't know how we can prevent a nuclear catastrophe.<br>
<br>
As for the Russian stockpiles, I agree that that is a huge problem and I'm quite worried about it.<br>
