However people enjoy being a vital class, and enjoy giving something to a group.  I believe thats why most people chose the cleric class, even though it has major setbacks and is a very &quot;unflexible&quot; class.<br>
<br>
What I hate most of all are 2 things.  <br>
<br>
1.  People who expect the cleric in the group to lose money on symbols while they are getting cash.  If you are such a cheap bastard you arent willing to pay your share for symbols...well find another group.  Symboling the main tank can help alot, with CHeal, and save the cleric lots of mana, definately worth a few pp.<br>
<br>
Cleric should be paid for every symbol he spends in full, with pp (gems are only worth it in Seb that I have seen).  I dont mind counting the symbols I cast myself to make sure im not ripping off the group either.<br>
<br>
2.  People who &quot;expect&quot; a res.  Ask for one, dont view it as the clerics obligation however.  I dont view it as the druid/wizards obligation to port me.<br>
<br>
The ability to ressurect someone is one of the clerics main spells that gets him into groups.  If he doesnt get into groups he cant do anything worthwhile.  If everyone got a free res whenever they wanted, that would make resing a worthless skill and no need to add a cleric for that.  <br>
<br>
That is why some clerics get annoyed when being asked for a res when they are lfg.  If you want a res, get a cleric.  If you dont think you &quot;need&quot; one, then you obviously dont need a res =p.<br>

Malathor, I wish some clerics out there read your post. Looks like you know your shit (haven´t grouped with you yet though =/)<br>
<br>
There are a lot of clerics on this server, luckily I tend to not group with the gimpy ones but the more skilled ones (/wave Azzrael, Rokko, Torlan, Cure etc etc) who knows that it´s more to it than &quot;just&quot; healing and buffing the group.<br>
<br>
However, the cleric I ran into the other day in Sebilis who said &quot;I don´t wanna get hit, then I might die and I really don´t want that&quot; really angered me (not to mention Quarken, Moodi and a couple more ;P). Cleric also thought DA was a spell only to be used on Xmas or something, at least not to be used in daily play (although memmed all the time), come on it refreshes after 15 mins, roughly half the spawn-time in OS........<br>
Sly, I am not gonna give you a name, cause then this thread might die out ;P<br>
<br>
/Fubbik<br>
Rogue 54<br>
Ex-cleric<br>
P.S. If you can´t at least cover the clerics cost when you group in OS then you are seriously greedy. Just toss the gems to the cleric or at least the majority of them, I know I do..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usiggymk5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SiggyMk5</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/12/01 2:00:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Zozz</span><hr size=1> Zozz is a shitty cleric.

<br>
Enchanters need a heal right away when they are getting pounded on.  <br>
<br>
No, you don't wait until they are at 1 bbl for &quot;max efficiency&quot;.<br>
<br>
Another thing, you clueless fucking ebay throat culture dipshit: on summoning mobs, you got to stand near the goddamn mob in order to be in range.  When your enchanter gets summoned, guess what? He is no longer sitting by you because, duh, summoning moves you to the feet of the mob and therefore probably not in heal range.  You see the enchanter get summoned, hit DONE in /gems and stand your lazy ass gimped out ASS up and get in range.  <br>
<br>
On another note, Shaman and Druids, you should be standing right on top of the mob, ready with a heal for when the enchanter does get summoned on big pulls when he has 3 or 4 pounding on him and the cleric can't keep up (you know the heal spell, the one that has a hand with a red/white background, you did buy that spell and have it memmed right?)<br>
<br>
No, thorns are not as important as keeping the cleric/enchanter alive.  No, slows are not as important as keeping the cleric/enchanter alive.  No, group regen isn't as important.  When the puller says 5 inc, your focus should be on that heal key and staying in healing range.  <br>
<br>
If i see another fucking druid/shaman start casting a DoT before the crowd is under control, I am going get very postal.<br>
<br>
How the fuck can an enchanter die when he has a cleric a shaman AND a fucking druid in the group and not get one fucking heal is beyond my ability to comprehend but it DID HAPPEN, oh yes it did. <p>Herder

&gt;&gt;Why should the cleric get all the gems?<br>
&gt;&gt;XP group, 4 hours, 6 symbols, 24 peridots, thats about 250pp.<br>
&gt;&gt;Thats like 3 or 4 gems, not all of them.<br>
<br>
Agreed, although with dispells and the fact that most clerics can't buy peris for anywhere near 10.5 pp means it's more along the lines of 350-ish, but that's just fussing over semantics.<br>
<br>
Basically, the reason clerics come out of places like Seb with more gems than they used if because most people realize that clerics get zippo anywhere else.  In my personal experience, I lose money rapidly in any other high level dungeon - HS, KC, Hole, Velks, SG, wherever - because the plat and gem drops are insignifigent compared to the cost of Peris.  Seb is kind of an equalizer for the outlay and loss in the other zones.  Now given, at the end of an XP raid, I'll realistically look as the value of the gems, and if it's too much, I'll redistribute them to the group, but Ill not going to have a guilty feeling in my stomach if I walk out of there with a few hundred extra PP - especially given the relative rarity of useful cleric stuff in there.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I use Rune alot, I rune the cleric/puller on tough pulls. I rune myself. I would say I go through as many peridots as a cleric. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Enchanters need love too.<br>
<br>
Absolutely.  I think I lot of times they get overlooked because it's not as blatantly obvious when a rune is on you.  When a cleric rebuffs Symbols on everyone, it's more obvious because the Cleric goes  OOM casting them.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, clerics can just charge for rezzes to pay for peri's, np.<br>
<br>
And the 'Clerics can charge for rezzes' line isn't weak?  I've done almost 100 resses for people I don't know, and I've maybe made 1k out of it.  I refuse to hold someone's XP hostage for a few pieces of plat...  Most high level clerics res people whenever time permits as more of a professional courtesy at this point than anything else (and god how my life would be simpler if porters would feel the same way.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).   Besides, if someone drags a corpse to me and I just sit there demanding 100p for a res when all I have to do is stand up and clickystick them, that kind of makes me a gimp-ass cleric, now doesn't it?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in equitable adjustments. No more, no less. As a matter of fact, if I am in an xp group w/a cleric, I estimate we will be there 4 hours, I will give the cleric 5 peridots to cover my share.<br>

If loot was properly balanced everywhere, that would be fine.  If everyone provided their clerics with Peris, that would be fine.  Fact of the matter is it doesnt happen.  In all the non-guild XP groups Ive had, I *might* have been given 20 Peris total for symbols, and I refuse to make myself a gimp-ass cleric and refuse to symbol people until they fork over some plat because that impedes not only my efficiency, but also the efficiency of the group.  So, most clerics lose money.  Seb is generally accepted as penance for everyplace else clerics get shorted.  Still though, I think your point is more along the lines of not forgetting to compensate chanters, which should be addressed in all groups everybit as much as clerics.<br>

<br>
The leader and cleric were in the same guild.  I gave the cleric 5 peri's to cover my symbols.  The leader then stated that all sellables go to the cleric period.  <br>
<br>
Well this just pissed me off.  I paid for my symbols, personally. I am not here to subsidize every lamer that is too greedy/lazy to make sure the cleric gets compensated.  I do that for myself and possibly any friends that need it, but hell no, just because that cleric can't make money in other pickup groups doesn't mean they need to take my share of the loot now.  <br>
<br>
That method is way too communist for me and what ends up happening is the SAME people who have never bought a peridot but demand symbol, the SAME people who never have food and tell the group, &quot;anyone got some spare food?&quot; are the ones that constantly leech off the responsible people.<br>
<br>
If I supply reagents, then I want my percentage of the loot.  There is nothing wrong with that.<br>

Honestly, I'll take HS over Seb any day of the week.  Velks is a bit of a stretch I admit (I go there a lot, I know it's out of the way though), and The Hole, well I follow Brell so I don't hunt their either.  But, combine all those with KC and all the other places that higher level clerics can go, and mature the server a bit, and it balences out.  There's no way you can tell me at any given moment most of the pickup clerics are in Seb - it just doesn't support that many people, although yeah, clerics are certianly incentivized to go.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point isn't that clerics should walk out with 1300pp of sellables for a 5 hour group, but a little extra isn't gonna kill anyone.  On a purely personal note, I'd say just split the sellables and plat amongst the casters since so much tank stuff drops in there compared to caster/priest, but that's another discussion altogether.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Besides, all the plat junk isn't as important if you're making good XP.<br>

Hmm.  Honestly?  Before you give your group cleric Peris, find out how the sellables will be handled.  If they are all going to the cleric, then don't give them any Peris for goodness sake.  You COULD also ask for the cleric to count the Peris used, figure out the cost at 14pp per, and give an appropiate amount to the cleric.  Then again, while I wouldn't mind that in the slightest, some clerics and group member could see it as being nit-picky.  <br>
<br>
I dunno.  Guess the best thing to do is to discuss it with the group when you first join, and at a *minimum* get compensated for your symbols - that's just<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uslyvarius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyvarius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/13/01 11:20:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/slyvarius?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gimp ass clerics..</span><hr size=1> Rokko is good, I have to agree with you there 100%.<br>

Oh then we moved the kill group to group 2 since group 1 had been getting all the xp for the beginning...later on he starts bitching to move it back to him, so then he gates out. We were at 3rd lvl of Skyshrine, not exactly easy to get to without clearing the mobs, then he asks for a port, I was leaving so I logged my druid and went to port him, I didn't see him, I check his location &quot;commons&quot; he got a port from some1 else, this guy is total gimpness, I learned later that he doesn't even have healing talents, the raid leader told him everything he needed to know about healing during the raid so that he could do it, we were low on clerics so thats why we wasted the effort on him. But in the future, I'd rather have a druid healing me than that gimp ass cleric.<br>
