I did not mean for the previous post to sound like a flame on casters, for that I apologize.  I don't mind mana burn. Hell if you put in the work for it good for you, but you must admit that abilities such as that have increased the power of the players greatly.  While at the same time the mobs stay idle in their difficulty.  I do not agree in any way how VI went about this, but I do agree in what they were trying to do.  If drastic changes are needed to keep a constant difficulty lev then I am for it.

So by that logic the Orcs in CB should be able to cast Ice Spear by now.<br>
<br>
As the game progresses and more expansions come out, players get more powerful, thats why there it a whole slew of new content and Zones put in the expansions.<br>
<br>
Easy? Id like to see that same shaman and monk combo go soloing in the deep. MMMkkay - not gonna happen. But take that same pair and send them to SolB an &quot;old world&quot; zone. And golly, if theyre not tearing it up.... <br>
<br>
Think of this, SolB was the grouping zone pre-kunark. And boy you had better bring along some friends. Shoot pre60s back then.... But now, to think that we sould make it so the &quot;hard&quot; zones from before should still be hard? Bah.  Now that we can be lvl 60 with 1600DDs and tons of AA points?<br>
<br>
Instead of making the old content harder, they need to make the new content more of a challenge - and/or release new zones. By doing what they did to the casters this last patch - they realy hurt alot of people. The non epic weilding, non-lvl 60 uberguilded player is going to find it hard pressed to get exp in any non-melee zone. Youre going to tell me youre going to trade out all your regular gear for resist gear now.....<br>

<br>
Take your best level 60 melee equiped with Luclin loot (non Vex thal or keyed akheva level) and velious gear, and take him to solb.<br>
<br>
What happens?<br>
<br>
Now, take your best level 60 caster, with the best luclin loot and velious gear.<br>
<br>
What happens?<br>
<br>
The melee will tear through solb solo. I am sure that they could deal with the efreeti solo, or damn near close.<br>
<br>
That caster? Well, if its not a wizard, that caster will perform almost exactly the same as they did when kunark was out.<br>
<br>
Every expansion, Melee's AC, HP and Damage output jump by leaps and bounds, but the casters AC, HP and Damage output, jump, heh they don't &quot;jump&quot; they go up slightly (with wizards being the exception, but even they are not near melee jump).<br>
<br>
Absor was quoted saying &quot;We will not be increasing the damage spells of casters because we do not want them walking all over old antonican mobs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet, with every expansion, THAT IS EXACTLY what melee's are capable of doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is called &quot;Mudflation&quot; where the influx of new gear causes old content to become less difficult, or even eventually trivial.<br>
<br>
The &quot;New Content&quot; mobs did not need this &quot;boost&quot; to make them of the appropriate difficulty. The trash mobs already quad for 250-450, flurry, and cast 1k nukes.<br>
<br>
Now, they quad for 250-450, and cast 2.2k Ancient Nukes that drop only off of the Emperor himself.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile level 35's trying to do FULL GROUPS in Nurga are getting nuked for 300-500 a pop from all the casters.<br>
<br>
Are you telling me that a level 35 player can deal with 2-3 mobs chain casting for 300-500? When at level 35 they have 600-1400 hp tops.<br>
<br>
Level 30, green to 56 wurms in GD casting level 56 nukes for 1k? Killing the level 40's hunting them for quest pieces in one shot instantly?<br>
<br>
Level 60's fighting level 44-47 frogs in Seblis, getting hit by Ice comet for full damage, every time, with over 160 CR, while said mob double hits for 145?<br>
<br>
This all sound &quot;fair&quot; to you?<br>
<br>
I dare you to find an xp group doing Howling Stones now. <p><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://home.mindspring.com/~matthewshears/linked/fontbehavior.css"

A level 60 meleer could NOT (save being fear kited).  So, maybe, just maybe, melees needed some boosts in terms of AC/HP/dps. A level 60 melee, nicely equipped, could probly do imps in SolB, as could any level 60 caster with a similar quality of gear.  <br>
<br>
The fact is, if all you wanna talk about is soloing, then fine, but EQ is NOT a solo game.  The high end EQ game, the game that people with NTOV armor etc are playing, is not one of soloing.  It's all about being able to survive mobs that quad for 900-1200, on top of nasty AEs and DDs.  To go toe-to-toe with these things takes some serious gear, and Verant put it in the game.  Casters are (should be) getting a boost with the new focus items, not to mention the Flowing Thought stuff that came out (or did you forget about that?) and KEI.  Toss in some AA points and I think that EVERY class has gotten some upgrades, it's not just melees.<br>

While Tanks in this area got vast upgrades in easily obtainable weapons and armor, significant upgrades for casters are almost completely out of reach for most casters of that level range.<br>
<br>
But the longer i thought about it, the more obvious it became, that this argument is becoming more or more irrelevant. Do a /who &lt;class&gt; 50 59, then do a /who class 60. You will see that there is usually a lot more L60 players around than players of all levels 50-59 combined.<br>
<br>
If you closely watch who is opposed to the new changes, and who is either neutral or funds the new challenge great, you will find out, that most of the players at L60 are for the changes, players below are against.<br>
<br>
Most players below 60 still have a fresh outlook on the game and are much less likely to give up begause of these, changes, however frustrating. But a lot of the really bored L60 players will stay on longer now that they found new challenges.<br>
<br>
A lot of players have suggested that Verand did a major blunder and went totally overboard with the changes. The major consensus seems to be Verant never tested these changes before applying them. They expect these changes to be alleviated a lot.<br>
<br>
I think Verant knew exactly what they were doing. Most of these changes were well aimed and Verant knew exactly how they would change gameplay. There were some atrocious things, like the young shardwurms. These might be blunders, but i rather think they were put in on purpose to be reversed later for the claimed adjustments.<br>
<br>
I think most of the changes we see are here to stay, Sebilis, Chardok HS etc will stay as they are now with maybe very minor changes. The reduced melee capacities of the &quot;bionic super forgs&quot; (very well put) will almost certainly stay where they are.<br>
<br>
So, better get that resist gear, up your HP as much as you can afford somehow, and learn to survive the changes somehow, if you are not part of the endgame crowd.<br>
<br>
For the endgame crowd, enjoy.<br>

Well, I dunno where you get your information from, but I'd suggest before you go on about what Verant has said about something, maybe you go read Verant's boards.......<br>
<br>
Here's a quote from Alan VanCouvering in resonse to player concerns about the casters-<br>
<br>
&quot;............Actually, that’s a ‘sort-of-a-bug’ thing… Because NPCs were so stupid about casting spells before, some of them were given improved spell casting abilities to make them relatively better casters. Some of those casters might be too good now, and the team will be looking at those on a case-by-case basis............&quot;<br>

Last time I checked, the  release of Velious and Luclin didn't change the low end game, other than to add new content.  If anything, it made good equipment EASIER to obtain... look at items like Lammies- Once an uber sword, now a 2K item.  Knuckle duster n jade maces have tumbled in price (hell, anyone using KDs any more?).  I remember SolB FG raids, and people getting awesome gear like Mithril.... and a certain level 45+ ranger in KEG who wore Silver Plated Leggings for ages, even after hitting Fear and getting a few pieces of Thorny Vine (hi Wick).  Anyone actually using Fear/Hate gear?  Most have better by the time they're planable anyways.  Caster gear has followed a parallel course.  Flowing black robes, Oracle robes, green silken drapes, and the once Top-Of-The-Line SMR, well, virtuallyno one wears em any more.  Druids in Brown Chitin Protectors? Hell, that's a give-it-away-to-a-newb item now, it used to make you famous.  +Int/Wis jewellery is laughable to get now.. how many casters in their 30s-40's dont have their INT capped now?<br>
<br>
As for new changes, well.... the new focus items are pretty damned easy to get, (not to mention the mage summoned ones).  Pet changes weren't just for level 60 pets, they're for <br>
everyone's.  Most people 50-59 are working on AA points too (if not, why aren't you?). Oh, and KEI's popularity means that any group in Seb/Velks/wherever probly has C2 as a minimum, if not KEI, so a hugely improved mana pool.<br>
<br>
My point here is this-  The sub 50 game hasn't changed much in terms of strengths of mobs- there's a lot more zones, and fancier graphics, that's all.  HOWEVER-the average player is WAY better equipped than they were pre-Velious, let alone pre-Luclin.<br>
<br>
So I dunno if you count DBN as part of the high end game.  I mean, we do TOV, we're killing Vindi, Zland, Kland, Velk.... But a lot of our guild is sub 60, including myself. (I'm level 57, been 53+ for over a year.) Most new people coming into our guild are NOT level 60.  So yes, this DOES affect the level 50-59 world.<br>
<br>
I'm just so sick of players who bitch when a change comes in and makes the game harder without thinking about all the changes that have made the game easier.  Wanna see how much?  Go do a Naggy raid with level 45-50 toons dressed in old-world gear (pre-Kunark) with pre-kunark spells and buffs, and then do it again with the gear/buffs they have now.<br>
<br>
The low end game is laughably easy now compared to Pre expansions, and each expansion that comes out just makes it that much easier. <p><b><i><font face="arial" size="4" color="#ffcc00">Digz Graavz</font></i></b><br>

And seriously, go walk to the cheif in Droga and tell me its not over powered. You most likely will not make it solo, or without a healer who can do over 1k per heal.<br>

After, tell me you do not think its over powered for a 35-40's dungeon. <p><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://home.mindspring.com/~matthewshears/linked/fontbehavior.css"

<br>
And what part of &quot;EQ is not a solo game&quot; wasn't clear to you?  If you wanna talk about soloing ability, caster&gt;melee.  Plain n simple.  Sure, melees now can walk into some places they couldn't before, bust those are places that casters have always been able to walk into.<br>
<br>
I also don't think that ANY one character should be able to take on 2-3 blue mobs (once they leave the newb zone).  EQ is about grouping and teamwork after all.  A group of 6 should be able to handle those 2-3 chain casting mobs, or they shouldn't be taking on 2-3 at a time.....<br>
<br>
I'm glad that some dungeons are tougher than they were. Quite frankly, the low end game is too easy given the gear that players have now.  People getting to level 50 with virtually no time played, and that amount of time played goes down with each expansion and more equipment being handed down.<br>
<br>
Anyways.................<br>
<br>
Now please go read my last few posts in this thread again.  I have also said that there is an imbalance with the mobs casting now.  I agree they're over powered, and that something needs to be done (and according to the EQ board, so does Verant... why people keep saying that it's not gonna be fixed I dunno). I'm ALSO saying however, that an upgrade in the power of mobs is needed in game to balance the increased power of players of all levels.<br>

&quot;Keep in mind, though, that NPCs can be weak or strong for their ‘level’, and special NPCs can certainly be tougher or weaker than their /con might indicate. Having some of them cast higher level spells is just another tool, just like giving them procs or breath weapons or other innate abilities.&quot;<br>

<br>
If your STUPID enough to not be level 60 with 60 AA points yet you get a big /gofuk from Verant.  They screwed the balance of this game BIG time with their outrageous mudflation of items and with AA exp.  I remember pre Luclin most people in uber guilds had absolutely NO reason to go to an exp camp in Seb or anywhere else except to hang out occassionaly with friends and help them level.  Now you'll get a group of 60's with tons of AA, and they'll own the most of the upper level of Seb.  Where does this leave the poor under 60 people?  Try and talk to them (some can be reasoned with and will confine their activities to smaller camps, or go elsewhere, I've tried it, it actually works) or go someplace else.  <br>
<br>
The reason this relates?  The NPC caster balance was done (My best guess) to try and balance out the outrageous feats of these guys with tons of AA and Luclin uber gear who can solo camps that would require a full group before.  I am NOT knocking these guys, many of them are my friends, in my guild.  Its not their fault that VI has screwed the balance so far.  They're just playing the game the way they play the game, to the best of their ability.  Thothagnome can non longer solo the camps in Chardok, Cereborn can no longer solo the camps in Seb etc etc.  The side effect of this is that neither can groups of 50 - 60 that used to be able to do these things.  The NPC caster in HS that Bin started this thread with?  Yea, he killed me last night.  Went through a hundred of the golems, accidentally pulled one caster and it was CR time.  Later that night, pulled the same Helot skeleton, it took a 58 cleric and a 57 druid full time heals to get me through that fight with my 55 Ranger.  VI has been steadily degrading the quality of this game for the under 60 crowd since Velious.  I guess I shouldn't complain, I got one character to 60.  To bad for me I'm trying to level another to 60 now.<br>
<br>
This is a retarded change and if Verant doesn't fix it very soon, I think a lot of people will be taking their money elsewhere. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81033>I'm the Hound, damnit!</a>

&quot;Obviously the recent change to the way NPCs choose their spells has been receiving some attention from players. I think it’s one of the best changes we’ve seen in a while (sure, I like the pet thing too  ).&quot;<br>
<br>
That's what Tezmey was referring to.  What you referred to simply said &quot;oops, maybe a few are overpowered.&quot;  It doesn't come close to suggesting that they screwed up...if they wanted to suggest that, they wouldn't have said &quot;on a case-by-case basis.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't mind Verant &quot;oops!&quot;es...they're big dopes over there but they're OUR dopes.  This isn't an &quot;oops!&quot; when a large percentage of NPCs are now tank mages. <p>Binnen Minder<br>

From now on unless they change things it is going to be  NIGHTMARE finding groups for anyone not a cleric, warrior, druid or enchanter.  Those of us who are hybrids and straight int casters (again the majority of the server) who before found it relatively easy to find groups have just been screwed up the whazoo.  I could barely solo in places like SolB as it was. NOW I can't even get in the door without serious tank and healing assistence and I'm fairly well off considering I'm not twinkie girl OR uber guilded..now if I was either of those my chances for survival would be marginally increased.  But seeing how the large portion of us aren't twinks, have worked our rear ends off for everything we have and don't happen to have the priveledge of belonging to DH or some such, I suggest we tell Verant to stuff it where it's dark and smelly and try something else.  They obviously don't give a damn that they've made our gaming lives miserable as all fuk, why should we be paying for their sadism?  I have much better things to do with my time than die repeatedly after OOCing for 13 hours in someplace like KC because Velks was an absolute overcrowded nightmare.  It will be absolutely impossible to get a group in there for a long time to come due to the fact that its all melee.  Zones that were overcrowded and highly populated to begin with like Velks, Loio, and the other only melee will be permacamped by a few who give their spots to friends and guildies.  They have made this game that once used to be a friendly place full of very kewl folk even more of a kill your best friend for his group spot competition then what it was a few months ago.  Unless they change things and soon I am going to /chardelete and go on to something more worthwhile and less of a hassle...I have way too much life to live to waste it on a futile, stressful GAME.  Perhaps we all should wage an EC sit-in or some such to let Verant know in concrete just how much of a bitch they have made it for us.
