<br>
Hell half the time I didnt even want to raid, i was sick and tired of setting up for raids for 2 hours and then 4 hours later everyone goes to bed, shit gets old quick. Half the time we didnt even have enough people for our raids, sure lets take 70+ people to kill CT just so we can say we killed him. If they can enter fear let them in. Hell I dont even know why you are saying this shit cuz you arent even on half the time.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Raiya wasn´t at the ST key mob kill, matter of fact, she was on her twink.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
She left to go out with Ayiar that night, but of course you got your key early on even when we always were asking soph what stompfoot was doing and she would tell us laying on the couch watching TV. Thanks for helping us soo many times, I hope that you were watching PBS to help you get a fucking clue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Unbearable conditions? Maybe to you. Keep in mind Raiya was already decked out in complete ToV gear.

<br>
Its what happens when you show up to every raid and theres only TWO classes that can use leather armor. Hell a lot of the time her or Aaronite were the ONLY druids even there. Say whatever you want but we both know raiya/ayiar were very hardcored players.<br>
<br>

Did you ever stop to think that some of these IV people were once in PO??? I think they know how shit ran in the guild and I am just sad that I didnt read all the fucking warnings. <br>

Two pieces of bread with peanut butter and some jelly may be a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but it doesnt mean it tastes good. I think its the end game raiding thats bringing out a lot of this bullshit in people.<br>
<br>
Again I really dont care about the loot, before I came to Vazaelle I was fucking happy and enjoyed running around with my guild doing stuff like PoG and taking down Treah, but I did have a friend on this server whom I started to talk less to and figured since I did play on Vazaelle before I might as well come back. Then I tried to join PO, I did what I could to join the guild but I felt as if I was getting the cold shoulder and that no one was really interested in me at all except for Talandra. I should have known from that day on that it was going to be like that forever. Send a tell to a random PO person and ask them how they feel, I have heard a lot of stories about how sad people are, but of course that stuff doesnt interest you I guess.<br>

I dont remember anywhere where I even said something like that, please go find it for me. I DO however remember something where ALYEN said I was one of the best equipped rogues on the server and I happened to disagree with him along with a few others who knew I wasnt even in the top 20 of rogue gear on Vazaelle. I do however try my best when I am playing and if thats a crime, lock me up.<br>

How do you go from &quot;grouped with her&quot; to &quot;their intentions&quot;?  I obviously wasn't privy to your private conversation with her.<br>

Actually she just revived an old thread that had died down and tossed on some gasoline.  If memory serves she wasn't the only one tossing it on that week.  I didn't see anyone point guns at their heads to post..  did you?  For Bonus points go back, find the thread and see who really started it in the beginning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We asked them time and time again NOT post shit like that here, but they insisted.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Believe it or not Stompfoot, I wasn't only one who revolted at the idea of the &quot;Let's ban everyone from the VCC board&quot; strategy.  I admit I was the most vocal about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but I most certainly wasn't alone.  Plz don't imply you speak for the entire guild when I know for a fact that on this matter you do not, sir.  As I told all of PO on the board when this was being discussed.  The second PO starts paying for my off time while I'm writing on the boards, then they can dictate to me what I can and can not write.  You are so worried of what joe schmo might think that you can accept the fact that joe schmo might actually be able to think for themselves.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Raiya wasn't at the ST key mob kill, matter of fact, she was on her twink.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Boggle, she was out seeing a movie with me.  But it makes the story sound better if you throw in the &quot;She was on her twink&quot; strat right?  Didn't really matter though, short story:  5 ST mobs earlier, kead says mage, druid, cleric, wiz gets next keys, next ST key, shyde gets it (mage), next ST key (wizard gets it (Kulkin), next ST key warrior gets it (Andromyda), next ST key, cleric (Ryoko), next ST key (Bagen? - who at that point had been on perhaps 8 raids max?).. come to find out later Keadaian had already decided that Raiya would not get the key (Mind you during the previous 3 ST keys, Raiya was the _only_ druid present in 2 cases if memory serves.  The justification that &quot;Raiya had all her spells in her book&quot; and Bagen didn't was a real humdinger though.  Odd how that strat didn't go for any of the other classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Raiya deguilded because she thought she deserved the key (she thinks she deserves a LOT of loot).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Do you agree that people who raid more and/or help more should receive more loot or are you still toeing the &quot;It's for the betterment of the guild&quot; line?  Odd but wouldn't loot going to people who consistently raid more be the logical choice?  *shrug* unless they disagree with Keadaian vocally of course *gasp*<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When she asked to be back in PO those were the conditions: *Snipped various Howard Cosell commentary*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You fail to point out how those conditions were also to be imposed upon myself which as memory serves, I was calmly eatting cheese pizza at about all the time this shit was going down.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> She wasn't EVER kept out of the loot and has a lot of great things our guild worked for and awarded her.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Stompfoot.. I'm trying not to treat you like an idiot here.. ask yourself what's in Sleeper's for a Druid.  Jesus man you sleep with a female have a clue what motivates them.  Get back to me when you figure out what it was about.<br>

Since we're throwing out tidbits I'll toss out this one that I thought was kinda funny at the time:<br>

Keadaian tells you, 'If you think you know fucking everything why don't you lead some raids?'<br>
You tell Keadaian, 'Sure, make me an officer, because as we both know PO doesn't scratch it's ass w/o an officer's say so'<br>
Keadaian tells you, 'No, I can't do that, most of my officers would quit'<br>

Anger, Hatred, Fear, Loathing, Humor, Love, Platonic friendships, and what not is just the tip of the iceberg of the range of emotions I've seen people display in EQ.  Some may be a farce, some I suspect are not.  Does displaying one make you need to get professional help?  Best commit the whole damn guild pretty much.<br>

How much fun would this game really be if everyone was happy with eachother and got along?

<br>
Yea I would say something in guild chat when I knew someone else was upset or a lot of people thought there was a bad call made on something, and for voicing my opinion on matters like that is exactly what gets me on the bad side of a lot of people. Dont even tell me that there hasnt been a time that you have been grouped with someone in PO and they hadnt brought up some of the shit about how they felt being in the guild. I have heard Keadaian and other officers talk shit about other guild members all the time, hell members talk shit about each other in PO so much that the guild does not even feel like a welcoming place. I guess thats what happens when you have about 100 members though. I am at least glad that there were quite a few people who did not need loot in PO at all and were always happy. I feel bad when they are taken advantage of that too.<br>
<br>
And I think its impossible to have a multiplayer game without having emotions in it.<br>
/hug video games that dont make people upset like this.<br>
<br>
Good Idea pron<br>
