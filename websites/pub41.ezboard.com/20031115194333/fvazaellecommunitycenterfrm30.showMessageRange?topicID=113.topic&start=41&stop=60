Tell ya what.  You don't have to read up.  You can listen to Loveline.  Sure, it's mainstream media, but Dr. Dru is a specialist in addictive medicine.  He deals w/ addicts all the time and knows what he's talking about when he tells someone that they're addicted to pot.<br>
<br>
Just because YOU or some_friend_01 of yours did not encounter physical addiction to pot doesn't mean that it's not addictive.  I listen to the show every night and hear people call in asking if there is a better way to get off pot other than cold turkey because they're feeling severly depressed and feeling &quot;hung over&quot; MONTHS after quiting pot.  Also most of those people replaced their addiction to pot w/ alcohol.<br>

<br>
This is under the current manufacturing policies.  It's illegal currently, therefore it has to be produced illegally, i.e. slave labor/below minimum wage/and/or child labor.<br>

Legalize drugs and manufacturers would have to produce it legally to import it, or they end up a la Martha Stewart.  In turn driving prices up.<br>

Yeah, the genetics probably won't affect you in your lifetime, but as I said, if your parents are addicts, then your chances of being an addict increase drastically.  Not only do to genetics, but environment as well.<br>

<br>
When I say that pot is addictive, I'm not saying the addiction is up there w/ Heroin or alcohol, I'm just saying that many people do become addicted to pot and it's not as widely known because many pot users simply haven't quit in order for them to show the withdrawl symptoms. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221">Haels</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Alottapeeps<br>

It's not about choosing the value of life as opposed to money.  Drug use happens whether it be legal or illegal.

We can spend tons of money on attempting to prevent drug use or tons of money trying to prevent violent crime and addiction.  I prefer to be more pro-active on the issue and go for education and treatment to prevent drug use.<br>
<br>
The problem w/ the war on drugs is, it got a bad rap because it originally went after the dealers, instead of targeting users for treatment and education. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221">Haels</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Alottapeeps<br>

No, you didn't post any incredibly stunning information that anyone here didn't know about.  Of those links you posted, 1 claimed marijuana to be physically addictive, none of the others did.  1 even went so far as to state &quot;While we all know that marijuana isn't physically addictive, there is absolutely no denying that marijuana is psychologically addictive.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you understand that when I stated multiple times in this thread that it is not physically addictive, that I'm referring to the word physical?  I realize that's a hard concept to grasp.  Do you understand that when I stated multiple times in this thread that it's probably psychologically addictive, that I'm referring to the word psychological?  Holy shit, that must be hard to grasp too.<br>
<br>
All you've shown in your links, is that many of them agree that marijuana is psychologically addicting.  GREAT NEWS FLASH.  We already stated that.  There's never been any hard proof proving that it is PHYSICALLY, yes P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-L-L-Y, addicting.  <br>
<br>
So before you go link searching next time, make sure you have any idea what the fuck we're even talking about.  Nobody is arguing that it's not possibly psychologically addicting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammerique>Ammerique</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 484<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/03 1:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Psychologically Addicting</span><hr size=1> I think you'd have to be rather weak willed to even become psychologically addicted to weed.

Dunno, I think you proved my statement in your first sentence.  Do you really believe that drug lords are linked to over 50% of the countries violent crimes?!  They might add up to a total of 5%, maybe.  But I'm pretty sure that most of those crimes are due to someone being broke and mugging someone to get their drug money, everyday drug deals going bad, and people flipping out while doped up and attacking others.

Let's play the Herder game and pretend like we're talking to someone else when it's clear who they're talking to by bringing up a response to a statement only one person made:<br>
<br>
&quot;I read up, your turn.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's quite obvious you were speaking to me.  It's convenient for you now to turn around and pretend you were talking to Ammelen, but the way in which you constructed your post made it quite obvious who you were referring to.<br>
<br>
As far as an earlier statement to you earlier in the thread, for some reason I confused you with Herder and if I was a bit harsh in my response, I didn't realize it was you and not him.  Herder's posts don't seem to warrant any type of respect for his opinions so I treated you as if the posts were written by him.<br>

<br>
Because they enjoy it.  It's hard to stop doing something you enjoy.  It doesn't mean it's addicting.<br>
<br>
It's like everquest.  People have trouble quitting it all the time.  Nothing happens to you if you try to quit.  People just keep playing it because they enjoy it, that's all.<br>
<br>
Our society uses the term addictive in reference to a lot of things to draw parallels to true addiction and thus to emphasize a point.  It's metaphor, it's not real.  It shows the common quality of something being hard to quit, but that's it.  Nothing wrong with using metaphor in your speech, but you should recognize what true addiction is.  It's more than really liking something.<br>
<br>
Addiction is when using a substance or engaging in a behavior alters you in some very serious and tangible way such that when you cease to do it, you suffer adverse reactions to quitting that prevent you or discourage you from doing so.  You are changed by the substance so that you can no longer function normally in its absence.<br>
