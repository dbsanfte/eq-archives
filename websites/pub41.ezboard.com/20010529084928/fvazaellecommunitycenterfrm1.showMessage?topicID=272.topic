I think this issue needs to be set straight right away to avoid problems that will undoubtedly come in the future.<br>
<br>
So I guess my first question is, how long can the top guilds co-exist while disagreeing on calendar issues? IMO, not much longer. Already there are bad feelings from my guild towards Sacred Fires because despite our having Nagafen on the calendar for over a week and a half, they killed him pre and post patch thus cancelling our planned raid for this past Saturday. From looking at past posts and from hearing feedback from others, (please correct me if I'm wrong) SF says that Nagafen can be up 52 times a year and that he should go down the day he's up. Yet I don't understand why my guild cannot be given the chance to kill him just three days after he pops, especially when we have it planned and have members looking forward to it. Due to patches he can obviously be up more than 52 times a year. I did not say anything the day it happened, I thought I should either not say anything while frustrated and take the time to think things over. Having thought it over I feel this one incident of disagreeing shows the potential to create an environment very unfair to many players and needs to be resolved before the server ages to a point of no return. Should one guild go FFA on all these mobs yet the rest of the guilds do not agree, it unfairly forces the entire server into a FFA setting.<br>
<br>
In a previous post, Sotae stated that ALL dragons including Trakanon, Serv, Gorenaire, etc. and even VS should require no posting on the calendar. Atm, I think the only guild capable of doing Trak or Kunark dragons are IV anyway. But give the server a few more months and the need for sharing will obviously arrive. What happens when one guild plans Trak and another guild kills him the day before? You get a horde of angry people is what. I think these raids require so much planning that to treat them as FFA mobs is ridiculous. We all know planes can be done by players under 50 and can also be done "pickup" style, so where does this position the 50-60 mobs that require much more resources and planning than Hate or Fear? You take a random spawn like Lodizal and I won't argue against him being FFA. But I also think that until I can stick a female gnome with a "mystical eye" out in Iceclad, my guild will not be killing the turtle anytime soon. :P I know that sounds really bitter but hey, that's how I feel.<br>
<br>
Due to a mistake on my guilds' part, there was an overlapping of raids between The Endless and Slivers. Luckily things were worked out and hopefully something like this will never happen again. So a suggestion of mine is to decide on a time zone to schedule all events on. Currently The Endless will schedule on EST, but should the general consensus be otherwise, this won't be a problem for us.<br>
<br>
Guild leaders please reply to this and give your feedback on behalf of your guild. Thank you. :)<br>

Kaminya, <br>
<br>
Don't even bother to try rational scheduling discussion here. <br>
<br>
The server *has* been forced into a FFA situation regarding the old-world dragons until such point that Sacred Fires no longer feels the need to kill them.  Doubtless, the rest of the uber-mobs will fall into that category as SF is able to tackle them as well.  That is the pervading sentiment that comes from their guild officers.  <br>
<br>
As far as &quot;reserving&quot; the planes go, you can likewise expect that formality to expire when it becomes inconvenient is my prediction.  Not sure which guild it will be that starts this new tradition, but you can imagine that I have my guesses. <br>

<br>
Had a look at (the first few pages of) Bigfatbelly's post "I don't usually rant, but..." ?  Its not the first time for the, as Befb says, "gimp_guild01",  to cut in line when they want something.  <br>
<br>
I think when some people covet and desire particular things, they allow themselves to do away with certain formalities.  In this case, these formalities that other guilds have preserved out of consideration for the rest of us gave them opportunities they would not otherwise have had, yet in their greed they failed and apparently still fail to show the same consideration in return.<br>
<br>
On another note, someone in Slivers told me about what happened with their planes raid....yes I was not there to hear about it first hand.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but when a plane is scheduled for...say, a Saturday, this means the guild which occupied the plane on the previous day should be out of the zone in time for the mobs to repop for the next guild.  Finishing a planes raid at 9am on Saturday is ridiculous to consider as a continuation of your Friday raid, as its not still Friday in ANY timezone that I'm aware of.  Thats common sense, no?</font><P>Slitherin - 47th Monkey of the Scale

<br>
Every person comes from a different server, every server mature's in a different way. On Nameless the method that we have come to stand-by is that any SINGLE POP in a zone isn't schedulable, whereas anything where you need mass numbers in a zone, and preferably an empty zone except for your guild, for a longterm raid it is schedulable.<br>
<br>
Examples of each being: <br>
 No - Most dragons, Wuoshi, KD, Lodizal, VS, etc<br>
 Yes - West. Wastes, ToV, PoM, PoG, PoF, PoA, PoH, Icewell Keep, Kael(maybe, never hunted here), Skyshrine(cubes and higher), Chardok(generally Royals only) and Velketor's(not 100 percent sure about this one, but I think so)<br>
<br>
Now you ask, why did the Nameless go this way? Here's some pros and cons that I see in it(Note: I never played there so never got involved on the actually foundation of this, just speculating):<br>
1. Spawn is dead the maximum number of times in any given interval causing max loot amount to be distributed to the server.<br>
2. Causes the spawn to have more respawn chances after dropping it's loot.<br>
3. It encourage's swift action to kill the spawn if a raid on him fails, to those that can assemble and organize quickly.<br>
4. In the case of epics, you could effectively screw some classes by endless reserves on spawns that drop a piece otherwise.(Wiz, Pal sorta)<br>
5. Alot easier to manage from an impromptu raid standpoint... &quot;Hey guys, Lord Nagafen's repopped, got him on track&quot; &quot;Let's keel...&quot;... rather than logging to check the calendar...<br>
6. It encourages guild's, when a scheduling conflict, to work together to kill the spawn with alot safer numbers and to give everyone a loot op.(Note: This happens very rarely in my experience though, unfortunately)<br>
<br>
Now, the cons:<br>
1. Dealing with bitching and moaning about it, honestly one of the few things that really bothers me, but then again I came here to leave the politics on my last server, sigh. I never started this concept, don't enforce it, but it's not as harmful as everyone makes it out to be.<br>
<br>
2. Well, I've hit a brick wall besides #1, prolly is more, just too focused on my personal feelings atm..<br>
<br>
Now you say, see the Calendar system is a much better system for what ya'll have on the No list there, you should explain the pros and cons you see there, so here they are..<br>
<br>
Pros to Calendar-<br>
1. Allows your entire guild to know well in advance where to try to be, and when.<br>
2. Lets other guilds have wide berth of you, so neither infinges on the other.<br>
<br>
Cons to Calendar-<br>
1. BIG ONE - The current calendar can have stuff editted, added, removed, etc. from it without any password or indication of who made the change. If you want to point fingers at people not abiding by the calendars, I had a day of Fear on a Thursday we had put up at one time, that someone outside of Sacred Fires deleted off the calendar(no other guild moved in to take the day from us, but still could've been a ugly mess)<br>
2. Spawns sit unattended to in populated zones for up to a week waiting on their scheduled date.<br>
3. In some cases the spawns are a hazard to people in the zone.(VS can sometimes get accidentally pulled by pathing bugs in a few rooms in KC; Lodizal, and Kelorek love killing people who aren't watching, etc.)<br>
<br>
Is there a middle ground to be reached? I'm sure there is, and the general concensus from all the high level guilds seemed to be that our method was agreed to, albeit informally... because have you EVER seen, with the exception of Nagafen and Vox, the following killed on the server?:<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir, Lord Nagafen, Lodizal, Kelorek'Dar, Lady Vox, Trakanon, Severilious<br>
<br>
All have died on this server, all multiple times, yet not one reserve on the calendar for any except the level limited dragons which both have epic pieces, and full zone raids abound on the calendar. And in the case of IV, Agony, and Slivers, we have all run into encounters with a spawn on the list above where they assembled quicker than we did, and let them have it(although with a little belly-aching once or twice when we were mid-buffing and IV came in pre or unbuffed and pulled Lodizal, honestly though, they were ready quicker so fine in my book though)<br>
<br>
And Zozz, you know me well enough bro, if SF was the bunch of assholes you make them out to be, you think I'd be here? Same thing like I said to you, I wouldn't have followed your guild choice personally, but I respect it and never outright flamed them at any point to my knowledge. I just don't see eye to eye with a few old-school highbee members.<br>
Of course, watch, karma dictates that someone's gonna dredge up an obscure post where I said something negative about IV =/ ...<br>
<br>
And Keltek, The Endless is a Euro guild if I've heard correctly, the time they left was well before that, they forgot to take in the time changes for crossing the pond into account, annoying, but an understandable mistake IMO.<br>
<br>
And any other SFers who read this(preferably an officer, unlike myself), feel free to agree or disagree with my points so they can get the official opinion rather than my version.<br>
<br>
And BTW, I in the past have been exclusively a schedule-only train of thought, and only defend this because as I see it, it does have ups and downs to it, and I think the pros far outweigh the cons, until we get a SECURE calendar and some guilds willing to spend the time to sit down and make some rules we can agree to.<br>

uh-uh...<br>
<br>
I am not making SF out to be assholes.  I would have to post that on the rant/flames thread. <br>
<br>
My statement only implies that the SF is of the opinion (and you have again reiterated it) that dragons fall outside the bounds of a schedule system.  They have never offered to budge on that stance, as far as I am aware of.  The word &quot;dragons&quot; was even removed from the calendar description after the first controversy.  You might notice that there were not a lot of other guilds stepping up to take that same side of the argument, but it is really an empty point.  If one guild opts to FFA, then it forces the rest of the server into that scenario, or just get stepped on.  That is the only specific reason that I mention SF in my post.  <br>
<br>
As far as the allusion I made about the planes or high level zones being outside the bounds of a schedule in the future...  I do believe that it will happen.  I get the impression that the schedule might even be used soon to determine when to get to a place before another guild.  <br>
<br>
Yep, I am in a big guild now (In Virtue), but truthfully, I am rooting for the little guy.  I remember what it was like to do my first Naggy raid.  Hell, we planned it for weeks.  I think just because people can't be there right after the servers come up doesn't mean they shouldn't have the opportunity to kill some of these mobs.  /sigh  Always, it seems like I am the only one who thinks this way though.  <br>
I don't understand what the big deal about letting other folks have a chance to do some of this stuff is.  See that's my problem, I always try to envision what I think is &quot;fun&quot; about EQ and try to project that onto other people.  I think the idea of a Dragon attack being a planned event with much fanfare and anxiety being more fun than a &quot;oh yeah, we got 40 people together in an hour and slaughtered him, again.  Naggy's such a wuss.&quot;  Oh, I know, less loot and yadda yadda... Gosh, we definitely need as much loot as possible on the server.  My hope is that the 'younger guilds' are a little more polite and flexible, after the 'older' guilds end up with the majority of members past the level cap.  The ones who suffer are the ones that are at the level cap now and have yet to get their shot because they don't happen to be in the most efficient killing guild.  As far as the non-capped mobs go...  Who knows what is going to happen.<br>
<br>
Yeah, IV has killed all those silly beasties you mentioned, but I don't think they would argue if you said Trak or Wuoshi or Severilous should be a scheduled kill...  We sure as hell have to schedule to get enough people online for it.  Venril Salthir... I guess, maybe?  But he's kind of a chump.  If the monopoly of IV on killing these things has been brought up somewhere, I missed it.<br>
<br>
Lodi, Kalorek and Faydedar are never going to be schedulable, because they are random. <br>
<br>
Ummm...  I am rambling. <br>
<br>
Zozz<br>
<br>
And I am not not not not IV's representative on this board.  I am just some damn gnome with a big mouth and too much free time.

Yes, they will be up 52 times a year IF they are killed promptly.  However, if you allow them to be schedualed, you are decreasing the number of times they spawn.<br>
<br>
How many patches go into affect in everquest?  It's almost weekly, therefore, you can almost &quot;spawn&quot; 1.5 times the number of dragons (it's a guesstimate, ok?).  ie.  Since Naggy is a weekly spawn, and if he was killed at spawn each week, he would be killed 52 times a year.  However, since there are patches almost weekly, we can increase that number of Naggy spawns to 78 times a year IF he was killed at spawntime.<br>
<br>
Next, there are unforeseen zone downages, and emergency patches.  Let's say that these in sum happen perhaps once every two weeks.  This also increases the spawns by 26 times.  Naggy would potentially spawn (with all his phat lewts and quest items) 104 times per year.  This may seem like a lot, but really it isn't considering the thousands that play on our server.<br>
<br>
However, if the Dragons were to be schedualable on a per-day basis, it would negate a lot of these spawns.  Yes, I'm sure guilds would kill a prepatch dragon if it was schedualed post patch, however, the zone downages and short notice emergency patches would effectively &quot;lose&quot; the server a dragon.<br>
<br>
Also, Schedualing dragons also drecreases the spawns of the dragons because most people don't schedual the dragon for when it spawns, but for when they find it would be most convienient for them.  Example.  Guild A scheduals Naggy a week and a half in advance.  Letting everyone on the server know that they will be killing Naggy on a particular Saturday.  First off, the half a week is inconsequential... it's beyond the spawntime.  However, what happens is if Naggy was killed the prior week's wednesday, and spawned on wed. of the schuedualed week... there would be 3 days of Naggy sitting in his lair.  This three days may not seem like much, however, 3 days here, 3 days there all add up.  It is conceivable that you could decrease the spawns of Naggy by 50% in any given year... because you wanted to schedual the dragon on that saturday.<br>
<br>
I come from Bristlebane and Nameless.  I don't remember what server had it (I think BB), but they had a schedualing system where you could schedual the &quot;next&quot; particular dragon.  Ie.  you could schedual Naggy, but you had to kill Naggy after he spawned within 2 days.  If you did not kill Naggy, then you lost your spawn.  This system worked well when it was only Naggy and Vox.  It may have later added Venril and Trak.  However, it never added all the kunark dragons (from what I remember).  Even though this system is better than the &quot;calandar system&quot; (I'm viewing this through getting the most dragons killed per year), it still allowed for downtime; and eventually, that downtime would add up to lost spawns.  Now with the inclusion of Velious Dragons in the mix, there are simply too many dragons to schedual.<br>
<br>
Now, you may say that you simply want to schedual Naggy and Vox, the two old-world dragons.  In doing so, I would hope that you choose a schedualing system that would benefit the server, and not just your guild.  We have already seen people hoarding the calandar claiming place after place, spawn again spawn.  Why is this?  It's because there are no hard-set rules that others must follow... it's just a calander.<br>
<br>
The calander does not differentiate between dragons, planes, or Mistmoore!  All of these have been posted.  It leads to a cluttered mess that noone will eventually want to even look at.  The calander is not protected.  People can post at will, and delete at will.  Unwanted changes can be made to your post.  Deletions can be made to your schedualing, without your consent.  You WILL lose a lot of opportunity to killing said dragons if you use a calander.<br>
<br>
There needs to be a different place where people can look at planes raids, dragons/ubers, and other stuff (like MM).  I am all for the FFA system, as it promotes the fastest killing of said mob, thereby increasing it's spawnrate.  The system only allows for said items to drop at said places.  If we want said items, we need to kill said places efficiently, to give ourselves the best chance of getting the most items.  If we can't get FFA, let's seriously consider using a &quot;schedual the NEXT spawn, with a 2 day kill period&quot;.  There needs to be a system that will benefit the server, not hamper it into losing spawns.<br>
<br>
However, nothing will be done until the guildleaders (yes, one guildleader needs to step forward to get things started), get together and hash things out.  The guilds are the ones that need to agree.  Until that point, it will probably remain a FFA system.<br>

So, if naggy is popp'ing on sat, a guild can reserve him, BUT ONLY FOR THAT DAY. Past that point it is ffa. That gives people enough time to plan and get people online, but doesn't make it so the spawn sits unkilled for a long period of time.<br>
<br>
Planes, these can be scheduled due to the fact that multiple guilds in a plane just farks things up (with the possible exception of pog, but even then 100 peeps in a zone cuases issues always due to servers made by mattel)<br>
But, I am completely against someone schedule'ing planes every single week ad infinitum. I think a guild should be allowed ONE reservation a week, and for days not reserved on the calander it should be FFA.</font><P>____________________________________________________________

We need a new calendar and a set of rules for it so these silly threads can come to an end... and to kill another source of debate for Zozz and I... (BTW, this roast beef sandwich on a toasted kaiser roll I'm having right now OWNS any PBJ of yours, Zozz)<br>

Speaking as a player (*not* the Op of this board and the Calendar), I too believe what's been brought up a couple times in this thread already -- no reservations of Dragons and other long term spawns, and yes to reserving zones that do not accomodate multiple raids (planes, Western Wastes, Velk's Lab, etc.</font><P><table>

This is a basic principle of the game design. You don't formulate plans based on a possible condition of the game environment, but instead on what the actual condition is. It's why people /ooc in a zone for what is camped at this moment, and not what will be camped tomorrow.<br>

Slitherin: Like I said, it was a mishap due to a scheduling mistake. The Events Coordinator for my guild was running the event and since he lives in Hawaii and got off work at 10 pm, to him it was a Friday night. We know this was a mistake and it will most likely not happen again. <br>
<br>
Still, (not connected to this incident) take into consideration in the future that scheduling a raid after someone else does means you should respect the times they've already listed.<br>
<br>
Vaclav: It seems like you guys feel very strongly about Naggy being down ASAP and his loot being distributed to &quot;the server&quot; as much as possible. What will happen when there is a time where all guilds are either too high or too low to kill Nagafen? Do you still feel so strongly that your guild will go de-level everyone so that the loot can be distributed and Naggy can be maximally up? It seems like Nagafen is only a loot issue right now because it's a mob you want and can do. If a rotation could have been worked out I'm sure we would have come to a compromise. Saturday was probably our last best chance to kill Nagafen because many of our members are at the brink of 53. During our initial raids, MOST of the guild was on their first dragon raid. It was immensely fun, even when we failed. We're not thinking about how efficient Nagafen's loot should be to the server, we're building our guild morale by having fun together. Maybe it's unfair to the server that him and Vox are up a couple extra days but you guys killed 4 old world dragons in one week as opposed to us with 0. It hardly seems fair.<br>
<br>
I think that with each new server there needs to be a new set of rules simply because you will get a different people in each case. I came from Rallos and there was no calendar there either, but the PvP factor makes things like this work itself out. Maybe this system worked out fine on The Nameless but this isn't Nameless. This is Vazaelle, it's not right to force people into something without discussing it and coming to a conclusion. I think it's really inconsiderate.<br>
<br>
I completely agree that the calendar needs to be more secure. While this is being worked out post to the Events Scheduling Forum AND list things on the calendar. Posts can't be touched publicly and not very many people use this area. I think it's a good substitute for now. I do disagree about making VS FFA simply because he likes to kill people who aren't watching. <br>
<br>
Of the mobs you mentioned, I have said I think that Lodizal is rightfully FFA due to his being a random spawn, so I don't see him being on that list as too much of an issue. Nag and Vox are as you said, excluded. Zozz stated KD is random, but I'm just going on what he says. This leaves VS, Trak, and Severilious. No, those have not been reserved on the calendar. But iirc, only IV has done these mobs. From what I see in front of me, it looks like they do this either because of the way the calendar isn't respected or no one else has said they want to have their shot at him. I'm not going to complain about VS, Trak, and other Kunark dragons until my guild can do them. I haven't seen other guilds on these boards say anything either. Still, the general opinion of the server should be established.<br>
<br>
We are not a Euro guild. Granted we do have Euro members but the majority of our players come from Hawaii and North American time zones.<br>
<br>
Mandervane: As I suggested above, posting to the ES Forum would solve a lot of this. The calendar can be more of a visual assist. <br>
<br>
In general: I really hate to point fingers, but it has also been suggested in the past that planes not be taken too many consecutive weeks in a row. Yet I don't see how reserving Hate for all Saturday and all Sunday isn't the same thing in a different form. I give props to guilds who can raid planes on any given day, but the weekend IS when people are more able to get together due to there not being as many obstacles such as school or work, etc. Anyway, reply away pls! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Wardens will enter the planes.  We will hunt old and new world Dragons.  Our vision prohibits us from recruiting haphazardly or hastily.  We are several months from being in direct competition with the larger guilds that are curently hunting the planes and single spawns.  We will be there.  Conflict seems inevitable.<br>
<br>
A mid size guild does not have the redundancies of a larger guild.  We can not put the word out that Naggy is up and be organized in 30 minutes.  FFA will create a very chaotic atmosphere and shut 90% of our server out of planes, dragons, and what not.  Alliances will form, they have to.  I don't want to see 6 guild Y's tracking guild X's whereabouts for the sole purpose of beating them to the punch.  It happens and it's UGLY.  Everyone needs to understand that no one is immune to having a &quot;FFA&quot; mob taken from them.  The biggest baddest guild on my old server was CONSTANTLY hampered by a slew of smaller guilds.  They screwed over everyone and now they are paying for it.<br>
<br>
Policy needs to set.  Guild leaders need to form and speak with a clear mind to resolve this issue.  If it is going to be FFA, so be it.  If it is to be scheduled and organized, so be it.  FFA causes hostility, but if that is the way we want to run our server be prepared for the consequences.  I love Vaz and will work hard to make this the best server in EQ.<br>

It is really hard to come to a consensus, I guess.  <br>
<br>
This is my take on this:<br>
<br>
I play this game to have fun.  I play whenever I can (which isn't enough, in my opinion, heh!).  I have certain real life things that I have to take care of, not to mention I play at an hour where most people are sleeping.  <br>
<br>
I like to kill things.  I like to kill big things.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), I cannot kill these really big things by myself (heck, I'm a cleric--I can't even kill really small things by myself).  I need the help of my friends (a lot of them at that) to kill these things.  All my friends have real life things to take care of as well...  There are only certain times of the day and certain days of the week where we can all get together to kill these things.  So in order to kill these things, we have to make plans to all get together at a certain time and at the appropriate place to do so.  <br>
<br>
I guess this places me in the scheduling camp...  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I understand the &quot;server efficency&quot; thing.  Fifty-two or so spawns at Naggy this year, might as well get all fifty-two spawns...  The patches you mention actually work in the favor of scheduling.  Let's say that a Mob is on a 7-day spawn rate.  If there is a patch every week (not true, but it feels like it)--if you kill a mob today or tomorrow or even the day after, it won't really make a difference, because a patch will occur and it will respawn anyway.  Killing it today or two days from now won't make a difference, as long as you kill it before the patch day.  <br>
<br>
That is all irrelevant though.  You are right, the more you kill something, the more often it can spawn &amp; the more often it can drop goodies...  I guess if this was a company, we should try to maximize efficiency.  But I don't think of it as such--this is a game.  To have fun.  To enjoy.  To work together to do bigger and better things...  <br>
<br>
I don't think killing Vox 52 times insead of 49 times in 2001 is worth the racing and fighting over her.  <br>
<br>
On that point of working together, I believe we all can be civilized and talk things out.  To compromise and be reasonable.  While we all want nice things &amp; all--there is no reason to be greedy about such.  I guess I'm lucky--I come from a server where all the top guilds discussed things and shared spawns.  Where they would respect each other's scheduling and such...  <br>
<br>
But as others have said--if one organization is going to go FFA, I supposed all have to as well.  I just don't like to have to &quot;race&quot; to get to a spawn or camp.  I hate organizing for something, only to have to fight for something or leave and waste time.  I believe that FFA, tend to lead to more hard feelings and animosity.  What if both guilds get there and prep at nearly the same time.  Not a pretty sight...  <br>
<br>
I also agree, that if do wish to work together, there needs to be some sort of structure.  Having a generic calender where anyway can access and make changes to is not the answer.  If we can come to some sort of agreement, I'm sure we can find some means for a secured and stable place to announce plans and make reservations...  <br>
<br>
Anyway, you know the standard disclaimer...  I only speak for myself, not for my guild--yadda, yadda, yadda.  =)<br>
<br>
I appreciate your time and interest in this matter and I look forward to possibly working out an arrangement to make relations on this server as cordial as possible.  <br>

<br>
And as I stated above, those are the opinions I have seen stated from those that run the shop over here at SF, most are more than willing to discuss it and work out something, but to date, no one has made ANY motion from ANY leadership to accomplish this constructively, only ways it has come up is in whine-threads on the boards, which one would hope would spawn some constructive movements FINALLY..... <br>
<br>
But I'd love to see Kaminya(Endless GL, right?), Firanel, Krimzin, Chug, and whomever else wants to represent their guild's speak up and decide what rules to abide by with scheduling...<br>

And Kaminya, on the no one able to do Vox/Naggy thing.... There's ALWAYS enough people to do Vox and Naggy with little gap, may not be single guilds anymore at that point, but they will still die reasonably often.

This is our server not guild leaders.  I ve seen one guild reform 3 or 4 times, Im not letting that kinda of leadership judge the way I play. <br>
  If you can make that board read only and only allow Guild Officers to post, that would work for me but as of now any decision made in the private club will mean nothing to me. <br>
<br>
  My view on raids is they should be sceduled if the spawn rate is one week or longer IE Nag Vox. Planes can be reserved for a set amonut of time with a 8 hour window between guilds and 12 hour limit on the plane. <br>
<br>
Guild iwanabeuber schedules Fear raid for Sat 7pm est. No one can go to planes 8 hours prior there scheduled raid.  guild has the planes from 7pm est to 7am the next day.  Any guild can scheduled a raid 8 hours after the 7 am mark. This gives you time to die and do plenty of CR.  Guild leaders have the option of FFA on planes up to 8 hours before a scheduled raid. <br>
<br>
Lastly theese are my oppions and in NO WAY do I speak for In Virtue. We need to decide as a server what rules we play by, not guild officers. Guild officers just enforce what we decide.  I dont think it to much to ask a guild to check before doing a raid SOMEONE ALWAYS seems to have two computers in a guild (hint,hint). <br>
<br>
  I hope we can work this out we all have a long time to spend we each other. It isnt about what loot you can get IMHO. So what if a dragon or two despawn. I thought the whole purpose of a GAME was to have fun. If your in a uber guild let the little guys have some fun and schedule a raid.<br>
