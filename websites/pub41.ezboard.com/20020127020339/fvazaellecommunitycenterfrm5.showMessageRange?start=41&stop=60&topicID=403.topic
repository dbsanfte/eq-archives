I dont see how u can have the decency to say that America deserved this. No one fing deserves this. Foick the building who cares about that money can replace that, think about all the wives who are at home now praying to God there their husband is not still stuck under all that rubble. Dealgo i dont see how u can live with urself. Possibly 10,000 people could have died today cuz some arse thinks that God wants him to destroy the United States. So much destruction has occurred and u can honestly be happy. Granted we might overstep our boundaries once in a while, but why the hell do you take it out on a trade center building filled with 20,000 people. I understand that u have ur opinion, but come on be reasonable. An entire country is in mourning right now; a country of 270 million people is in mourning. The way you say you r happy about it makes me think of the footage from the ME of people cheerinng. What's there to cheer about. You have so much strength u can send in some crazed lunatics to kill innocent people. The really sick thing is that these people will be honored and remembered in there respective countries. Shows you what kinda country they live in. You just need to get down to earth off of ur pedestal and tell me u were joking. How would you feel if a crazed mofo like those of today blew up the building in which your wife/husband worked (that is if u could have found one with your terrible beliefs). Would you be happy then that an atrocity such as this hapened to you i think not. I for one would have been sad if this happened in the ME. I hope our government acts, but i pray that is not against a country as it was a band of crazed lunatics with &quot;divine messages&quot; that are to blame, and frankly i hope there testicles, assuming they are male, get put into a jar and are placed out on the podium everytime the president gives a speech as a reminder.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukurostheeqgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kuros The EQ God</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/01 6:27:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> I think u all insane.

With that said, I must say I am very proud to be an American.  I believe strongly that all people have a right to their own opinions.  Ryonea, you stated your opinion.  I accept that even though I could not disagree with you more.<br>

On a personal note Ryonea.  Your timing could not have been worse.  Our nation is reeling with enormous agony both as a collective and individually.  This has touched everyone.

<br>
I agree that the terror act that happened this morning was one of the most heinous acts in history. Granted, thanks to quick actions of rescuers in NY, a lot of people had made it out alive, still death toll is huge, and this truly is a sad day in our lives.<br>
<br>
What pisses me off is a self righteous attitude of certain americans about this event. Instead of perceiving this, as a sign, that perhaps your ways are wrong, and it is time to change them, all i see is mindless hatred towards Middle East (even though its not proven yet that they are responsible for this). Perhaps not as much on this forum, but its there. A lot of other racial, xenophobical bashing goes on in other forums. (check DAoC, horizons, battle net forums for one).<br>
<br>
And all i see is &quot;We're bigger, better, smarter then everyone else in the world, lets go bash their heads in, so they know better than to mess with America next time&quot; attitude. I am trying to say that this is the kinda attitude that people around the world dislike in USA people.<br>
<br>
What pisses me off, is that many of you, got the notion that somehow, USA has been wronged, that you are the saints, and everyone else is the devil, or just a mortal, who wants a bite out of your power. <br>
Newsflash: USA HAS commited many atrocities and did many things wrong, so please, dont play it like you've never did a thing wrong, and these bombings just happened out of the blue, w/o any provocation. <br>
<br>
Yes, bombing WTC was an extremly vile act, and those who were behind it, SHOULD BE brought to justice and prosecuted. They should suffer for the crimes they commited against american people, yes. All i ask is to keep in mind, that a military act against USA was not uncalled for. I wish however that instead of blowing up WTC, whoever did this, had picked another way of assaulting USA. They should have attacked military installations, not civilian buildings.<br>
Bombing of Pentagon was more justified (seeing as it is the military HQ and all).<br>
<br>
Basically, to sum up the post:<br>
<br>
Yes i think whoever did it, should die (i dont think it'll be a punishment enough for them though, seeing as they probably knew that eventually FBI, CIA, or whateverA will find them sooner or later and kill them). <br>
<br>
Yes i think that the murder of civilians was totally uncalled for<br>
<br>
Yes i do feel for those who had their friends or family injured in that event. <br>
<br>
Yes i think that USA should have a retaliatory action against whoever did this.<br>
<br>
No i dont think that action should be a war. <br>
<br>
No i dont think USA should bomb anyone or anything because of this, since it will only cause more hatred towards USA, and make more zealots want to blow up planes against your cities.<br>
<br>
No i dont think that USA is an innocent saint who just got assraped by a big bad devil, not by a long shot.<br>
<br>
again, for those who still dont get it:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> INNOCENT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN KILLED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS AS MUCH GUILTY OF CERTAIN POLITICS THAT HAVE CAUSED SUCH A RETALIATORY REACTION AS THE TERRORISTS THAT HAVE EXPLODED PLANES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
There, clear enough?<br>
<br>
And whoever was interested in my origins, i live in Canada, west coast. Used to live close to Seattle for about two years.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
I already have said that i am quite a cynical person in real life, a misanthrope if you will. I tend to see the worst in people. I was hoping that this event would cause people to look upon themselves, to see what they are capable of, cringe in fear and realize that violence only causes more violence. Apparently i was wrong, all this incident has caused, was more hate, more anger, more violence, more fear maybe. <br>
There are two ways as far as i see it.<br>
A) America kills everyone and everything until every single enemy is dead. Then america realizes that in their zealousy and arrogance, they have destroyed everything that made this world a better place.<br>
B) America calms down their trigger happy &quot;patriots&quot; and finds a peaceful way out of the situation. And then maybe eventually sometime a world will indeed become a good place to live.<br>
<br>
So far, you seem to be bending towards A)<br>
lets hope it wont be the case once the situation calms down somewhat, and the initial desire for vengeance will go away.<br>
<br>
P.P.S.<br>
If my post made no sense to you, oh well, i've never been the person who could express himself on paper well.<br>

And yes, unfortunately not many people are quite as pessimistic and/or cynical as i am, so i suppose finding a spouse will be a difficult task. But nor do i actively seek or desire human contact. Yah, i am a loner irl. Doesnt mean i dont enjoy human contact once in a while though, doesnt mean i dont like the few friends i have made on Vaz and in other places, doesnt mean i dont hold those friends dear and sure as hell doesnt mean i cant feel the sorrow of others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uxxragincajunxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xX Ragin Cajun Xx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/01 7:36:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> Ryonea.... or from this point your real name Jeff, you are a fukkin looser.

Why dont you look a little deeper into your hearts and start thinking of something else other than Ryonea's comment and about the people who are lost!<br>
About 2-3 hours ago, I heard word from my husband, he is safe. In a hospital being checking out for minor wounds and smoke inhalation. I still wont see him until they open the roads some point tomorrow.  My husband went to work today with $10 in his pocket and has no other means of getting a room somewhere.  He will probably have to sleep in a safe house for the night.  What if something happens during the night?  Does anyone know what kind of fucking hell this is?<br>
Have a heart, people, drop this fucking fighting and start thinking of others!<br>
<br>
But we still have 3 guild members not accounted for. And we have been standing by just HOPING and PRAYING we hear from them.<br>
PARAUS<br>

<br>
Why dont you start thinking of these people instead of Ryonea's fucking comment????<br>
<br>
Start realizing this is REAL!  Stop the fighting and do something to help these people!<br>

You write as though the United States is one person.   Stereo typing in my experiance only annoys/irritates people, I know it does me.<br>

I don't think I am better than anyone else.   I do think that act of terrorism are despicable, and this one was clearly directed at the U.S. as a whole.  <br>

Yes, we have been wronged.   What we, the citizens of the US, do about it is another topic.<br>

<br>
I have found most of these posts to be quite hypocritical. in america people are allowed their opinion. when someone speaks an opinion that is different than yours you turn to attack. that's not right. regardless of what one persons opinion is they are entitled to it.<br>
<br>
I honestly can say i care not at all about the events that happened. if you lost someone then i'm sorry for you, but know your grieving is spawned frome selfishness that you will miss that person. you have your right to grieve so continue to do so, what you do not have the right to do is attack someone who cares not wether you grieve or not. i made no dirrect negative comments about this act. and i don't believe this should have happened. it's wrong that so many people died trying to prove a point. the innocent shall always be sacrificed, however.<br>
<br>
i play eq to play eq, i don't play it to listen to everyones problems. i didn't want to hear a serverwide message about what happened. but they have the right to spawn whatever serverwide message they choose. so i took the opportunity, though i know it would have been in my better interests not to, to say that i didn't want to hear about it. my exact comment was i believe &quot;bah, nobody cares, go away&quot;. im well aware that people care and perhaps i should have said that i don't care not that nobody did. but what's done is done. life will go on. im sure there are many that would seek to make my life on vazaelle a living hell as they are seeking to do so to ryonea. simple solution to that is make a twink and continue to have some fun as i was until today.<br>
<br>
i take responsibility for having the opinion i have and will not back down from it. it cost me my guild and some good friends im sure, but so be it.<br>
<br>
as for those that are mad that there are some not mourning those lost to these events i give you this to think about, though i know you wont.  every day many people die. those in other countries who starve to death. those dying alone nameless in alleys of cities everywhere. those beat to death due to hate crimes. those that seem successful yet lose life due to whatever fate befalls them..  who cares for their deaths at night? none to very few of you im sure. nobody cares about death till it is brought upon the world in large magnitutdes. those of you mourning those that died today i expect you all to mourn every day for the rest of your lives those that die nameless and unknown somewhere away from the eyes of the world. cry yourselves to sleep every night. never forget that every day thousands of people are dying. every hour hundreds. if you mourn the loss of one life then you should mourn the loss of all life as is only fair. but you won't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uanywon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anywon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/01 9:44:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> When I saw the carnage as it happened I was shocked and appalled.  Angered that someone would have the audacity to intentionally kill tens of thousands of civilians.  My personal estimate on the WTC death toll is 22,000 people.  Absolutely horrendous.  There is no excuse for targeting civilians in any conflict.  Target equipment, not people.  If someone is using that military equipment then they are fair game as well.<br>
<br>
I think there are a few groups who could have done this act:<br>
<br>
1) Middle East terrorist groups.  Palestinians immediately come to mind, especially in the wake of the &quot;UN Racism Conference&quot; and the unblinking support for a free state of Israel.<br>
<br>
2) Iraq.  They are even partying in the streets right now.  They have also been ominously silent on today's events, whereas every other organization and country had steadfastly denied any involvement (including Bin Laden).<br>
<br>
3) An internal militia group who wants revenge for the death sentence imposed on Timothy McVeigh.  I seriously doubt they would target the WTC though.  Even McVeigh looked for a target that was as close to pure Federal Goverment as possible.<br>
<br>
4)  Any group who has denied responsibility by claiming &quot;American Policy caused this&quot;.  WTF?  American Policy doesnt hijack aircraft and aim them at civilians.<br>
<br>
I can understand how a government building (The Pentagon, Capitol Hill, etc) would be a valid target.  But the World Trade Center?  You have to be a seriously dumb motherfucker to even put that one on the scope.<br>
<br>
But what really angers me more than anything else is, if I can possibly believe it, is how four aircraft could be overtaken and used as weapons against us when the hijackers were only armed with KNIVES!  Fucking KNIVES!  Did only one airplane (the one that crashed south of Pittsburgh) have anyone with the balls to take these fuckers out before the plane caused massive loss of life?  I can't imagine myself being in a hijack situation where I did not act in a self-sacrificing way to try to thwart the actions of the hijackers.  I applaud the efforts and actions whomever downed that aircraft into a field in Pennsylvania.  I can only imagine Capitol Hill as the intended target.<br>
<br>
I have pictured myself in this exact situation many times in the past ten years -- and I have never survived.  My most common visualization was on a flight between Italy and Paris, France. I will be damned if I will ever let someone do that to me, my country, or any other civilized nation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uamenta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amenta</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/01 10:19:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> all I can say is I pray no one finds out who you really are Ryonea....<br>
