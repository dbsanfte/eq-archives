I'm a little fuzzy on some points but here goes anyways. What the architect is saying is that there has been previous incarnations of the matrix, the one that Neo is in is the 6th one obviously. While the Matrix is plodding along, the machines try to destroy Xion by digging down (and they are succesful all 5 previous times). In each of the incarnations, there is the anomaly that is the One. The Oracle, who is a run-away program, and the &quot;mother&quot; of the Matrix, since she discovered several key aspects of the human psyche and how to program the Matrix for it or something like that, along with several other factors, sort of help to guide the one to the mainframe. At this point the one has to choose to either go back to the matrix and destroy it (which kills off everyone still connected, since as we see if you unplug a human without &quot;properly&quot; getting them out they die) or he can choose to unplug several people to restart Zion (17 females 6 males I think was the number, although if I remember right you need more than that to have a stable gene pool). In this way its pretty much a never-ending cycle (at least up to Neo), where the Matrix is re-designed to be better and is re-started, and the One along with some other people helps to re-build Xion. <br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why the machines allow the one to restart the human resistance at Xion, I think this is because the machines can't stop the one from actually coming about, due to something like 99.9% of the people accept the Matrix, but .1% don't (this basically comes out to be one person, the One, who then helps to liberate other people from the Matrix) so they can only kind of prod him along in the direction they want him to go (that is, to get to the mainframe and choose to restart Xion, rather than what Neo does and go back to the Matrix). As the architect said, if Neo goes back and can't stop the machines in the real world from destroying Xion then the humans in the real world are wiped out, and everybody still connected in the Matrix dies, henceforth there are no humans left on Earth. As the architect says earlier, the machines are willing to accept a lower level of existance (basically, they lose like 90% of their power source when the humans die, but they can survive on the remaining 10% from cold fusion and other such things, essentially going from the Upper-class lifestyle to living like a bum). <br>
<br>
IMO, humanity has been in the matrix much longer than Morpheus thinks (he says its close to 2199). I think if Xion starts off with 17 females + 6 males + the One, its going to take thousands of years to breed the human population up to what we see in the movie, although they do liberate people from the matrix I dont think its a very large number. So, for the sake of simplicity, I'll say it takes something like 2,000 years each cycle of the matrix to get to the point we see in the Matrix Reloaded. Times this by six, and I think humanity has been in the matrix for 12,000 or so years. I think it also follows a somewhat linear timeline (inside the matrix that is) where humans lived out the BC years all the way up through now. My basis for this is because we see some obsolete run-away programs like The Twins who are Ghosts, and also the two vampire guys. I think they were used in the earlier forms of the Matrix as Agents sort of, but as time went on they couldn't be used anymore for several reasons. My main reason is this: As we know people stopped believing in ghosts and vampires and other superstitious things a while ago. Henceforth I dont think they could be used anymore since word would spread of them really quick and ways to kill them as well (via modern communications) henceforth making them obsolete. As to how Neo stopped the sentinels at the end, I do think that they are in the real world. As you may recall, Smith says to Neo that part of him got imprinted on Smith when he blew up Smith in the first movie. I believe when Smith tried to copy himself on to Neo that part of him was imprinted on Neo, giving Neo the ability to sort of hear the machines (something like giving his brain the ability to &quot;pick up&quot; the machines communication and command waves?) as well as the ability to stop them (Im guessing through giving them a self-destruct order or something like that) kind of like how Captain Picard can hear the Borg and knows their weaknesses in Star Trek due to his being assimilated and then rescued.<br>
<br>
Anyways thats my take on some of the more confusing parts of the movie. I apologize for any grammar or such things, its kind of hard to voice my exact thoughts on the movie as it is more complex than the first one. Speaking of that, from a lot of the people that are complaining about it I hear things like it was all action and no story, or other such things. I think the movie just goes over most peoples heads, and people dont like not being able to understand something which pisses them off. Also, a lot of people have no patience, and they hate the cliffhanger things, and cant wait 6 months for the conclusion, and so condemn the whole movie for that. I personally love the LotR series, as well as the Matrix series so far, and am more than willing to wait, if more people were patient I think we'd hear less overall complaints. I'm not saying this movie is perfect, it does have its short comings, but IMO it was a great movie.<br>

<br>
The architect stated after saying 99% or whatever accept the Matrix that if the remaining people that don't accept it were to be let rampant, they would exponentially increase in danger and could become a huge problem for the machines.  That's another way of stating that if they aren't placed in a stable medium that they'll be more effective.  So instead, they guide a small number of folks to recreate another Xion after one is destroyed and as the 1% that don't accept the Matrix begin to emerge, human nature drives them to creating another Xion.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.244<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
