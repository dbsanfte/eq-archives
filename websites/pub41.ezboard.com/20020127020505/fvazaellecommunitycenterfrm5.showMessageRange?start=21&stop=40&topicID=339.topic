<br>
I have been frustrated with being an enchanter at times, but not usually.  I am not advocating that the class be changed.  I am not saying that we are useless, or anything even close to that.  I said in raid tactics the class was underutilized.  For the most part in single &quot;uber mob&quot; encounters, there is no need for the typical crowd control, or even ability to affect the mob in question aside from MR debuff, dispell enchantments and occasinally mana drain.  Yes, we can also cast Rune on the participating tanks.  Truthfully, most of the enchanter job is finished come fight time, however.  It is no great wonder that in certain situations (when it is convenient) enchanters might jump at the chance to have a charmed slave to attack with.  I do not think the express purpose in all of those instances is to exploit this known &quot;bug&quot;, but simply to better aid the attack.  Even if the charmed giants generated 0.00% aggro, you would still find them being used, I suspect.  Maybe they would not be as pivotal in the end result, but they would be employed nonetheless.<br>
<br>
The first post on this topic was completely sarcastic, but I do not acknowledge that increased pet aggro is a &quot;bug&quot;.  Maybe that point alone clearly demonstrates that I am, in fact, completely ignorant.  Instead I see it as an ongoing issue that they have already struggled with to find the proper amount of aggro pets should generate.  If it was a bug, it would have been mentioned after they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> reduced</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the amount of pet aggro when they addressed it last time a few weeks ago.  I haven't pulled up the patch message on that *fix* but I don't seem to recall them saying it was still broken.<br>
<br>
I am unconcerned whether mobs tank as main tanks, supplemental damage dealers or wander in a circle if it is consistent.  All people use them as they exist in the current state of the gameworld, there is no choice.  VI only sees need to fix it immediately in Kael.  Everywhere else ench pets can still do all of these bugged things and  no one seems to care. What is the reason behind it... because it is a grievous bug, or because they didn't consider how the changes they implemented might affect all the zones?  I suspect the latter, but the former makes for an easier claim.<br>
<br>
I am also not hostile and jaded, do not dismiss me as such to discredit my argument (this is the second thread that you have opted to point out something similar).  People who may not be in accord with your own opinion are not necessarily on the verge of apoplexy.  I feel that I can make points as valid as anyone else's.  In my opinion my view on this is not unreasonable.  Disagree with me as you wish, but please do not try to divine my moods.<br>

I believe VI made the right choice of the three, but I also agree that they still have a stick up their ass if they woud even think of using option #2. Bloody morons to think when they screw somthing up in the game THEY made all they have to do is blame the players and ban people. VI is a ignorant bunch of twits who got lucky that they invented a great game.

I dont think that the code is a 'bug', I think that it was doing what they intended, in the sense that a) it stoped da tanking, and b) it had some unintended consequences, but as far as they knew those were all player-negative.  So they didnt care about that.  Only when players developed a poisitive use for the new aggro, and had the poor judgement to post screenshots of it, did it become a 'bug' in thier eyes.  I dont beleive there is anything wrong with thier code, they just didnt forsee it being used in that way.  Thats not a bug, thats poor planning.  You can hardly accuse people of abusing a bug when it is something as fundamental as the aggro system.  You might as well tell people to just work on trade skills for the next 2 weeks since any fighting at all would be using an aggro system, which is now defined as bugged.  Enspecially tell mages this, I have heard that mages can now chain nuke while soloing, this is surely abusable, but what is thier alternative, just not fight, roll a twink for 2 weeks?  You can blame the players for finding some esoteric stacking issue and call that a bug, but I hardly think you can blame them for engaging the servers AI and call that a bug. <p>Procax

Don't forget, pets are supposed to be low agro.  They're not supposed to be able to generate agro like a tank.  This was intentional, one of the measures taken to prevent pets from being main tanks.  Mages have historically wanted their pets to generate more agro.  Soloing mages anyway.<br>
<br>
My belief is that Verant simply put a low priority on this bug.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I have a pair of J-boots and sometimes I get a SoW from a friendly druid. Like the rest of you, I use this spell 'as intended'...as a faster form of port.<br>
But here is the difference, sometimes, when I am running through a zone with my SoW, I attract aggro from a mob. Well, rather then click off SoW and stand there and die, I...(Please sit down for this confession)...I run away. Thats right, I trivialize an encounter that was never meant to be trivial.<br>
<br>
Now, please understand, I have been doing this for a while, and for a long time I didn't realize that it was an exploit of a bug in the SoW spell. But not long ago I turned level 50 (I am now 54), and at that moment, it became clear to me that by 'trivializing these encounters which were never meant to be trivial', I was exploiting a bug in the SoW spell.<br>
<br>
I am certain many of you are shocked by my inexcusable behavior and I am sorry, but there is more.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I use Ogre and Troll illusions to go into Ogguk and Grobb, thereby 'changing my aggro' and allowing me to roam freely throughout the zone.<br>
<br>
Now admitadly, I haven't been able to figure out what the actual 'intended use' of these illusion spells are, but I do know (because I am a level 50+ player) that these spells allow me to trivialize encounters, and are therefore exploits of bugs.<br>
<br>
I am deeply sorry, I promise that from now on when ever I aggro a mob, I will click off SoW and die; I will only use SoW as a weak form of port.<br>
<br>
Also I will only use illusions to amuse people and never to trivialize an encounter with a hostile city.<br>
<br>
One more thing, I use Invis to trivialize many encounters too. I am sorry. Sometimes I will mez a mob and camp if I am in trouble. I am so very, very sorry.<br>
<br>
I can't go on, my tears of shame are clouding my eyes.<br>

<br>
If a game designer makes a change to one area of a game, which unintentionally effects another part of the game in a way that offsets their idea of balance, they don't have a right to fix it?  They shouldn't fix it?  By fix, I mean return it to the point it was at before its unintended change.<br>
<br>
Now talking about Verant and its issues again, bugs aside,<br>
<br>
Charming giants was an awesome tactic before the way agro works was changed, and likely will be again after the agro bug is fixed.  Does anyone here actually truly believe that charmed monsters should be able to generate agro like that?  <br>
<br>
I mean, bugs aside, do you think that dictating mobs on raids is such a mundane ability, that it should be upgraded in this way?  With the old agro system, I remember people talking about how absolutely incredible dictated mobs were on raids.  It's something a lot of people expected to be nerfed somehow, not upgraded.  Before you say Verant just nerfed it, read again.  I'm talking about charmed mobs before Verant changed agro.<br>

I think the only crime in all of this is that Verant implimented a new agro system without proper testing.  I don't think dictated mobs needed an upgrade, unintended or not.  Let's bash Verant for the right reasons, for using beta code on live servers, not for changing back something that they didn't mean to change in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 595<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 1:31:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=36>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VI's Reasoning...</span><hr size=1> I get it Zozz, therefore pet agro isn't the issue, the defeat of the AoW is the issue. <p>Herder

<br>
verant as stated that pet aggro is fixed, cause it is. it falls into the logic of &quot;who ever is highest on the hate list, gets aggro&quot; NPCs hit for more then players, they do more damage, making them higher on the hate list. no this is not a bug. this works just like it does for PC's, by taunt and disarming etc you gain so many hate points and it positions you on the hate list. there is nothing wrong with pet aggro, it works how it is suppose to.<br>
<br>
verant is saying there is a bug in poor choice of words. see this <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessage?topicID=1848.topic">link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, it might answer some of your questions.<br>
<br>
and if you beleive the fact that they did this cause it has existed for a while and its not just cause of the AoW kills you are a fool also. not very convicing that they say its not cause of AoW when it happened the day after AoW was killed as an emergency patch.<br>
<br>
also a thing to add that pet aggro is not bugged, next patch has nothing to do with pet aggo, it is not bugged, it has to do with pets in general. you will no longer be able to CH pets. thats basicly the same as taking away pet aggro. so its still pointless. but again pet aggro is not bugged.<br>

It should have been fixed a month ago when it was hurting people not helping.  And it should be fixed in a way that doesnt hurt the player base in the meantime.  Ive been saying this should be fixed since the day the da patch went in, the fact that it isnt 2 months later shows how much verant really knows/cares about thier high end game.<br>
<br>
Btw they used boltrans-able giants, dictate isnt feasible for a variety of reasons. <p>Procax

What's really funny is, if you asked the question, &quot;is pet agro bugged?&quot; before Verant patched Kael, 9/10 high level players would have said &quot;of course, gorenaire is fear kiting pets while wizards are chain nuking, wtf do you think?&quot;<br>

But now that there's a conspiracy involved, people have changed their mind, heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 562<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 9:56:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VI's Reasoning...</span><hr size=1> Well if thier patch is going to remove the ability to heal pets rather than fix the aggro, that seems like a statement that they dont think the aggro is bugged.  I guess we have to see if thats what they do.  If it is, verant has once again found the solution that screws the players in the most possible way, as pet classes still will have troubles keeping thier pets alive but pet tanking will also be nerfed.  Thier inginuity in sticking it to the player always does amaze me. <p>Procax
