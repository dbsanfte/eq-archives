While IV was a group of friends, who enjoyed sharing a chat channel/friendships, at it's core it was about doing the higher level stuff in EQ. <br>
<br>
Vaclav, your flame implied that IV's leadership was just out for themselves, and as soon as they had what they wanted, they /guilddisbanded. That's just flat out wrong. Perhaps you just assumed that because your own actions in EQ tend to be less than honorable. Krim/Rhyu/Cass and others put alot of work in IV, and earned every bit of loot/credit they got.<br>
<br>
Krim doesn't want to be guild leader of Happy Funtime Elves. He wants to run the best, most accomplished, guild in EQ. Anyone who has a decent rep, plays alot, doesn't bitch, and does their job can come along for the ride. If you don't like that attitude, fine. But don't bitch at him for having it, he's never had a hidden agenda. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umaggye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maggye</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://iquebec.ifrance.com/dbz/maggyegifsmall.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/01 3:14:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://iquebec.ifrance.com/dbz/maggye.gif Border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So, like, WTF?</span><hr size=1> Arise is going to be very tHX!!<br>

I hate scrolling back to specifically quote myself(I like to test the quality of my memory), but I believe I said something along the lines of...<br>
<br>
'...and may impart a benefit to the host'<br>
<br>
Sorry if that sounds to you like they added nothing to the guild, clearly a sign of paranoia that your Feuhr(sp?, I prolly mangled it) was being attacked...<br>
<br>
Reread it again, and read my additional posts on the subject, I have given them plenty of credit for what they did, and honestly from the guilds I've experienced personall or through friends(most of which were 'hardcore raiding guilds'), friends were not dropped like a pair of wet socks for no reason and with no warning.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, Feuhr(sp?, again) implies he's a Neo-Nazi now eh? Just like my name being Vaclav implies that I am of Russian descent which would imply the reasoning behind my implications of implying the implicative word Feuhr(sp?, 3rd times a charm...) in the aforementioned implication implied above.<br>
<br>
^---- There's a perfect example of running one fact around in circles until you have a ridiculous implication, almost 90 percent in left field... you can subtitle it: The Germans would've won WW2 if they monitored their Northern Front =P<br>
<br>
Read my original post and you'll note the words: SYMBIOTIC parasite....<br>
<br>
As for my own actions, sorry you hold any feelings for anything I did in the past, my head was up my ass and I've made up for it - and to give you a hint, the person most directly affected by me in the past has forgiven me. And note, that doesn't do anything except try to put the conversation onto a tangent, rather than to consider the issue. <p><H2><B>--Vaclav Romanov--</H2></B><BR>

Any IV member who doesn't understand why we disbanded probably wasn't playing much anyway. IV always tended to do encounters with fewer players than most other guilds, but even so, near the end our attendance was too low to do much of anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upasty1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pasty1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/01 5:27:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So, like, WTF?</span><hr size=1> Personally I find all these events very interesting to say the least.

I really have to tip my hat to Krimzin on this one.  How he was able to merge IV and SF and remain in the seat of power when SF was not a crumbling guild amazes me.  He must be a multi classed Rogue/Enchanter or something.<br>
<br>
Anyways in a way I feel bad for those who felt so betrayed and stepped on but at the same time I almost want to say you got what you had coming.  By that I refer to the policy of stepping on others to attain your goals.  Most members were fine with it when it wasnt them in the position of being stepped on.  And some of the words used to defend it were things such as, &quot;You cannot judge morality in a game&quot;.  Well by that own line of thought you shouldnt feel so bad.  Krimzins still having fun and so are those who are with him.<br>

To all the new guilds forming from this big ole mess learn a lesson in Having Fun in EQ 101.<br>

Don't talk shit about the IV members who were left out of the merger (by their own choice or not) saying that &quot;they got what they deserved for using a lack of in-game morality&quot;. Funny how I haven't seen ONE of them on the VCC boards saying ANYTHING ill towards Krimzin or the other officers. Maybe I have overlooked this, please point me to it if this is the case. IV members as a whole, that I have seen, practice what they preach. Sure, they may have gotten screwed over, I don't know the whole story so I don't know, but they are being really big about this...They sucked it up and are even starting a new guild. If they were on a lower maturity level I'd damn well expect to see a huge-ex-IV-rant-a-thon. They are moving on and adopting the &quot;thats how the game works&quot; attitude that they wished everyone else on the server had...<br>
<br>
Grats for holding to your principals, even those that didn't hold the ones that I mentioned. <br>

<br>
Let's tell a story about a weak, dying guild.  The dates below are mostly accurate, but one may be off do to the fact that this is mostly from memory and I no longer have access to IV's private board.<br>
<br>
Vulak was last killed on Sept 4th.  This was followed by killing what was up (dain, yeli, etc), including a merger test IV/SF Tormax killing on the 6th (more on that later).<br>
<br>
As NTOV was repoping, we started clearing it again, plowing everything but vyemm and the 3 dragons.  We didn't do Vulak either of course, but I didn't mention it as we had plowed so fast that he hadn't even repopped yet.<br>
<br>
The September 11th patch stopped that run, and was also the day of another significant event.  A lot of people missed stopped playing a bit around this because it was so significant to anyone who had any contant whatsoever to the real world.<br>
<br>
On the 11th or 12th, I forget which, we sat around and did nothing while Krimzin had what he later described as an officers meeting.  We had people on much earlier, but started NTOV late because of this meeting.  We plowed, as usual, and got to Aaryonar, the dragon necessary to kill in order to camp in ntov.  We lost to Aary, but had clerics and pullers camp, so it was no problem.  We lost because our bard had logged, and Zerric could land a slow on Aary without the bard's help.  It's 1am, we don't bother to do a second attempt without a bard, we port out and go to bed.<br>
<br>
On the 13th, we're in TOV again with enough people to start clearing to Aary.  PO is also there, but Krim uncharacteristically tells us to move back and wait for them... Time goes by, time goes by, PO finally gets through, and we continue to wait.  After waiting forever, I can only assume Krim was discussing the merger with SF people, Krim says that we're pulling out of TOV and going to kill Dain.<br>
<br>
This wasn't a usual Dain attempt for us, as our most experienced Dain puller, Rhyu, wasn't around.  Dain is a tough pull, and the guys pulling it had only done it once together.  It took a long time to get the pull down, and when it came, we weren't as prepared as we should be, but still got things going, and could have won.  I'm 99% certain that this was a 425 hitting Dain, which some people said that we had never beaten.  It's late at this point, most log off to go to bed.<br>
<br>
Early that morning, Krim announces in GC that he intends to disband the guild, giving those on 30 minutes to talk.  The guild is disbanded, game over.<br>
<br>
Krim posts his message, most read it the next day on the 14th.  It was a short message, asking how many people meet the requirements to join IV.  He says that IV has been disbanded, thanks us, and says that maybe he'll see some of us in the new guild.<br>
<br>
Yes, things slowed down a bit in September like they do for _every guild in EQ_, because of school, but we were still doing our shit.  Things slowed down a bit after 9/11 for OBVIOUS reasons, and we had what could be called a sub standard 3 day period before being disbanded, mostly because Krim had delayed the raids during that period.<br>
<br>
A **very** reliable SF member told me that Fir told him that the merger idea was first presented 1-2 weeks before IV's disbanding, placing it before the time of the joint Tormax raid.<br>
<br>
The merger didn't happen because IV was a weak guild.  The merger was proposed and happened because Krim coveted the notion of one guild being able to take out mobs like AoW and Tunare.  This merger was going to happen to make a super guild.  You know, there's NOTHING wrong with that, but let's stop fucking saying that IV was weak and dying.  That's bullshit.  Every guild was going through slow periods, except perhaps SF who had recently had a significant influx of transfers.<br>
<br>
The issue isn't whether Krim had a right to do this.  It was his guild to destroy.<br>
<br>
The issue is that he treated his own guild like shit in how it was disbanded.  That makes him and the officers who supported him inconsiderate assholes.  If they had any regard for us and our feelings, it wouldn't have happened like this.<br>
<br>
The issue is that he lied to us about the motives.  IV could have had a successful Sept 11-13, and the merger still would have gone through.  The attendance thing has been super exagerated to try to justify the merger which most IV members would not have agreed to if asked.  Heh, if you look at those who weren't invited, it wasn't because of attendance or level, it was because they had personal issues with either Krim or one of the officers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/01 6:12:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So, like, WTF?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If you're too lazy to read the above post, here's a summary:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

IV was still doing what it always did, read above for facts.<br>
<br>
IV had a slow period Sept 11-13 because of late starts by Krimzin and some pretty significant world events.<br>
<br>
The merger was proposed before IV was having issues.<br>
<br>
The merger was proposed to create a super guild, not because IV was weak.<br>

The issue isn't whether Krimzin had a right to disband In Virtue, the issues are that he treated his members like shit in the process, and lied about the motives.<br>

Anyways, no where do I mention the members who chose not to join PA.  In fact I applaud the fact that they stood up for what they believe in.  In fact I think you misunderstood what I was saying.

Does that mean everyone who used to belong to IV?  Not at all.  Im sure many of those who felt betrayed had nothing to do with what Im talking about above and to these people I wish nothing but the best.<br>
<br>
As for no one stepping up to say anything ill of this whole debacle.  Again I think you are quite wrong.  There are a few from the looks of it who have posted saying it friggin sucked.  Id go back and reread what some of them have said who belonged to IV in the past.  I will guarantee there are plenty more out there who are really pissed at the leadership as well.  They either choose to not speak for whatever reason or simply fear any possible consequences of doing so.<br>

<br>
My take on PA is that it will be a long time for them to ever take on Tunare or anything along those lines if it happens at all.  This wasnt you normal run of the mill merging of guilds.  It was very shady and unusual, no wonder no one had any idea what was going on around the time it was taking place.<br>
<br>
A better solution would have been like Tropics said a simple merger between the two.  Yeah you may have retained players that would have left the game anyways for say DAoC or even players who just had less time to play but at least you wouldnt have sold em out in the end.  Hell these guys served with you, spent months with you, backed up your decisions whether they believed you were right or not.  Friendships flushed for a chance to carve out a name for yourself in a game thats quickly fading away.  <br>
