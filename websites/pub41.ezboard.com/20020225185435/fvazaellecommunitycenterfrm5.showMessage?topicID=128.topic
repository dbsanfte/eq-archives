First off, this is just a game, but it's also my hobby.  I love the shit outta this game.  Play it all the time.  This is my 3rd server.  I have made plenty of friends and even some enemies while playing EQ.  I go out of my way to help others because I enjoy it.  <br>
<br>
  But as of late I see people (mostly lower levels) who complain that EQ is going down the tubes.  To me, it's only been made better.  Sure the cleric hate and armor nerfs suck, but hey they've done alot of nice changes as well.  I've discovered 2 distinct personalities while playing EQ.  The people that like to talk and the people that like to do.  Me, I always gotta be doing something.  No matter what it is, I like to be busy.  Luckily my regular group members are lazy bastards with no jobs that play EQ all day.  I get off at 5 to tells of what are we doing today?  I love it.<br>
<br>
  I like that my name comes to people's minds when they need a good meat shield with a sense of humor.  I dislike having to tell people I am already with another group or doing something with guild, but that's the way it is. sometimes.  As of late I have read alot of the threads and seen alot of different opinions.  Some people play for friendships.  Shouldn't this be a given?  Kinda like if golf was your hobby.  You'd meet people on the golf course and become friends.  Friendship will happen no matter what you do.  I used to train for UFC style fighting.  I'm still a huge fan of it and a reporter for www.Ufighting.com as well.  But what alot of people don't see is when we fight, we don;t hate each other.  Nothing like smackin someone in their bean and becomming friends.  So other than friendships, what are your EQ goals?<br>
<br>
  Mine is to complete my epic (starting on it when I get 50plus), and help kill every major mob in game and to help with every other epic quest in game.  I play a warrior because of this very thing.  I like to say, yeah, ToV, what a buncha candy ass mobs they got in that place.  Ain't true, but it's something to just say you've been there.  I kinda see it as a collection.  I get screen shots from every major place I go and all the major mobs I help kill.  I set goals for myself in game and try to achieve them.  Two people this week told me I'm a power gamer.  Not sure what that means, but yes, I do try to do everything I can while in game.<br>
<br>
  I help with any corpse run I can help with.  I will help with anyone's epic that they need help with in 2 levels when I'm 50 and can do you some good.  I do everything I can to make sure when people see Caylan they see an extension of me.  I do the same in game as I would in RL (well except for kicking giants in the nuts).  I help with anything someone needs help with.  This game to me is about character development.  And I happen to be a warrior and want to conquer.  So how am I a power gamer?  To me that sounds like a selfish thing.  I do whatever I can to help anyone that needs it.  There is one person that really pissed me off once by leaving us when we needed him for a corpse run so he could go lfg in Dreadlands.  I'd even help him get his corpse if he asked.  For no other reason than to be the best warrior I can be.  The best player I can be.  Bothers me to think people might think ill of me because I aspire to kick the shit out of anything that takes several groups to kill.<br>
<br>
  On a side note, it's 3am and I'm drugged to high hell.  Ibuprofen800, Nyquil (green death flavor) and an antibiodic.  So if this makes little sense, I;m sorry READ IT ANYWAY!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubled1234.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bled1234</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/15/01 5:14:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rant on!</span><hr size=1> I play because i dont go to school, i only ever meet 1 friend occasionaly.

<br>
I have a great number of friends, someone I have been with for 10 years (they live in Toronto, I live in Louisville), and entertain folks when they come to town to escape the Canadian winter...hehe.<br>
<br>
I work out 4-5 times a week.  Mostly during lunch at the office as we have a gym in my building, and I ride my bikes on the weekends or to/from work when the weather is good.<br>
<br>
EQ is actually what kept me sane when I as travelling so much.  I relocated 4 times in 4 years with my job, and each time it was more then 1k miles between the cities.  Having a social life with that kind of life structure isn't feasible.  So I would work all day, and go home and play.  Meet all the friend that I made and we would chat, kill things and generally have a good time.<br>
<br>
Do I think its just a game?  Yes it is just a game.  But so is Hockey, Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, Tennis, Football, etc., etc..  And to some people those sports are the center of their universe and can quote you stats and statistics from betting pools and player performance faster than you can mention the going rate on a Charred Crystal Robe.  <br>
<br>
It's apples an oranges.  Its a game.  But its an important one to those that play and have put alot of time in.  I don't view it as a waste of time, nor do I think of it as addictive or obsessive.  No more so than any other sport or activity that I enjoy.<br>

Now I rarely go fishing, I rarely snowboard, and I almost never go blading. <br>

I'm trying to cutback bigtime and getting lvl 60 will help in that I won't have to level up anymore and I will be able to schedule other things into my life again and stick to raiding.
