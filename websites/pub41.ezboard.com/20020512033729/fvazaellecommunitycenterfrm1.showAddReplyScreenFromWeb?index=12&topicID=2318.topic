<br>
I will debate that. I have played afew casters into pretty high levels and while they take more skill then a warrior I dont think they take more skill then a SK or a Bard. Actually I would say that a bard is the toughest class in the game to play well as they can fill so many roles for a group.<br>
<br>
Casters*<br>
Necromancer: solo is simple once you know what the spells do, fear kiting is easy as pie. In a group necros can be a little tricky to paly well but anyone good should figure it out.<br>
<br>
Wizard: solo is pretty easy, root/nuke takes some guts and some luck, nothing more. In a group they can be tricky to play well with agro issues, but after grouping and killing thousands of mobs it should be routine to know when you can nuke and get into a pattern.<br>
<br>
Chanter: There job is simple in theory, tricky in practice. A tough class to solo with or to group with if you are in a tough area.<br>
<br>
Mage: This class is bloody simple to play. Solo, cast earth pet and nuke as required. Group, cast pet best suited for the group and nuke as required.<br>
<br>
Shaman: This class is complex and is tough to play well. A good Shaman can take on many roles in a group.<br>
<br>
Druid: This class is easy and powerful. Not tough to play at a nearly top level. A great one can make his job somewhat difficult if he deals with adds and plays the CC job well. <br>
<br>
Melee*<br>
Warrior: I agree, not a hard class in the least. Easier then all casters and other melee.<br>
<br>
Monk: Pretty easy in fights, when pulling they can show some great skill and can be tested though as much as any caster job.<br>
<br>
Rogue: Not overly hard, but they have to watch agro almost as much as a wizzie, often when the MA falls the wizard gets to watch the rogue die before they get slapped around.<br>
<br>
Pally: Can be quite a tough class to play well. They have to know what roll to play in raids and exp groups and when. A good one will do alot more then hit his attack key and chain cast stun.<br>
<br>
SK: Can be a tough class to play as well. Agro is our strong suit and pulling issues the monks deal with are also on our plate. We are expected to take as little from a group as we can and leave the other classes to help each other as we survive on out own. A good SK will never let the agro leave him. In seb with a level 60 rogue pulling disco I was usually able to keep the rogue from getting hit once on the pull or in the duration of the fight, takes some tricks learned over time.<br>
<br>
Ranger: Not sure about this class. They melee huge damage, they buff, not sure how tough this class is. To be tough a class has to have tools to alter a fight dramatically, not sure if rangers have the tools.<br>
<br>
Beastlord: I have no idea, mine is level 1 and I cannot find my way outa the cat city =/<br>
<br>
Bard: The toughest class in EQ to play well. They can totally make or break a fight, can take on almost any roll in the game. A great bard is a rare thing and when you find one in your pressence just know that person behind the keyboard has skills. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utropicsdelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TropicsDelight</A> at: 4/9/02 1:17:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubakxs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakxs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/9/02 2:32:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I would beg to differ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Melees in general are, as they're nowhere near as hard to master as the caster classes. This isn't open to debate, it's simple fact. The well played warrior is at the top of a mob's aggro list when they're tanking, and they basically have to stop using taunt to stay off the top of the aggro list when they're not. (Or switch to slower weapons, which often means doing more damage.)<br>

<br>
Bein' a melee is not as easy as pressing autoattack &amp; taunt...  <br>
<br>
Granted, you can do that and be all fine &amp; dandy, but to be a good melee takes a bit more thinking and reacting.  <br>
<br>
Tank mezzing, Tank switching, aggro management, mob positioning...  and this is jus' warrior we're talking about here.  <br>
<br>
Then there's bard...  twisting isn't easy.  I dunno if it's really hard either--but it takes more invovlement than your average class.  <br>
<br>
How 'bout monk?  Pulling a single mob to make everyone's life easy, isn't a simple task.  Then again, I've never done it--so I can't say how tough it is.  But I imagine it isn't too easy...  <br>
<br>
I've played a wizard on a couple of occasions.  I'm no expert, but it didn't seem too tough.  The hardest part is figuring out what each spell does what.  You have so damn many!  Geez...  <br>
<br>
I must say though...  wizard is a real fun class to play.  Bringing the hammah down on mobs--putting the 3k crit kill shot feels good.  I like the fact that you can get 'round without waitin' for ports or boats or stupid shit like that.  Being able to quad for experience when you can't find a good group is convienent as well.  <br>
<br>
Each of the classes are pretty simple once you get down to it...  BUT playing any at the highest level in a raid environment takes a fair amount of skill.  The most important skills are the skills that everyone needs: good communication, listening to instruction, common sense, keeping your cool under pressure and fast reactions.  If you got that, any class should be a breeze to play after not too long.  <br>
<br>
Once again, you should play something that you think will be fun to play...  It sucks having to level again after 60.  If you have any questions about any class, I'm sure there is a plethora of peeps who will give you the heads up on what it's like to be a high level character of that class.  <br>

<br>
Depending on your cleric I gotta disagree here.  Typically enchanters are the first down.  We're like canaries in a coal mine.<br>
<br>
&quot;ENCHANTER DOWN, EVAC&quot;.<br>
<br>
I see more naked enchanters than just about any class.<br>
<br>
Enchanter is probably the toughest class in a tough dungeon with a 6 man group.<br>
<br>
Enchanter is probably the most boring class in a raid situation, after the break.  Our spells cause incredible agro and we have cloth armor.  If we get slow duty, plan on dieing a few times.<br>
<br>
However, an Enchanter is only as good as their group/guild.  You can be king mack-daddy enchanter but if you are with a bunch of idiots, prepare to die frequently. <p>Herder
