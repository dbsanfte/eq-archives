I talked to Brioma and she said nothing could be done unless we had /reports,but then when I mentioned he was openingly admitting stealing it she asked if he was still online and wanted his name. I gladly gave it to her and he was still online. I noticed she had summoned Atsoom and Zabozer to a unleavable zone and chatted with both for over 2 hrs. The out come. Next time his is reported for stealing He'll lose his account and will be banned for good.
