The entire airline industry was devastated for years (and is still reeling from the blow).  That it pursuaded people to stay away from that method of economic commerce for so long makes it an even bigger success.<br>

The economy of the entire nation was adversely affected much more so than if, say, a massive bomb had destroyed an entire army base.<br>

That people are now leery of doing business in large buildings means a further hit to the economy, since most large financial institutions are headquartered in large buildings.<br>

It was a direct attack upon the economic infrastructure of the US.  Warfare is the armed conflict between two economies.<br>

<br>
I can definitely see Anywon's point on this.  There is no question that 9/11 had massive economic effects.  The markets took a dive after 9/11 and still haven't really recovered.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure you can realistically call something a war if it's not a conflict between two (or more) sovereign nations.  I know we have the &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; the &quot;War on Terror,&quot; etc., but I think that such phrases are really propaganda.  I don't think of anything as being a war unless it's a conflict between nations, not groups of people.  Even in the Civil War, you had a secession which formed a 2nd nation and then there was a clear line separating the 2 sovereign entities.  Each party had an area of land that it controlled and a governmental structure that created and enforced laws over the entire civilian population in the region.<br>
<br>
When you have citizens of one nation attacking citizens of the same nation or another nation, without backing from a government, I don't think that's war.<br>
<br>
Maybe that should be part of how I define terrorism.  Unlike Anywon, I do believe there is a distinction between war and terrorism.  Trying to come up with a specific definition that works in every case is not easy.<br>
<br>
For example, if, during WW2, the Germans had bombed the Empire State Building and killed 3000 civilians, I wouldn't consider that an act of terrorism.  I would consider that an act of war.  What's the difference?  I think it's that Germany is a country.  Al Qaeda is not, it's just a bunch of nuts that have a mission that is not supported by any country.<br>

<br>
I find your argument completely unpersuasive.  You keep talking about the Israelis building fences and knocking down buildings.  At the same time, Hamas, supported by the Palestinians, is directly targeting innocent lives, not as collateral damage, but as the primary target.  In my mind this completely separates the two.  You can demolish 10,000 houses and it means less to me than targeting one innocent child.<br>
<br>
I can't prove Arafat's intentions.  Neither of us can.  No one but Arafat knows what is going on in his head.  All I can give is my impression.  I believe, having watched him over the years, that he does not seek compromise.  I think he is fundamentally a terrorist who will stop at nothing to achieve his end, that being the annihilation of Israel.  Like many others, I believe that there can be no peace so long as Arafat is in power.  Fortunately, he's getting old and won't be able to run things for that much longer.  Then I think we might have a real shot at peace.  I think Abbas had potential, but he needs to be more than a figurehead.<br>
<br>
As long as terrorist groups like Hamas continue to operate and enjoy widespread popular support from the Palestinian people, there will be no negotiations and no peace.  The Palestinians must shut them down to demonstrate that they want peace and that they can negotiate like reasonable people.<br>

<br>
Sometimes it seems that terrorism is almost synonymous to warfare that is not considered &quot;warfare by the rules&quot;. It's very subjective and therefore I can understand Anywon's reasoning by saying that there is no true terrorism.<br>
<br>
I think by definition, terrorism is warfare with the direct goal of frightening the enemy's population.<br>

You are comparing their actions. I am not. I think they both commit crimes that are not justifyable. I don't think it relevant to determine which side has committed the most 'evil' of crimes. If it was, yes, Hamas most definately is the worst party in the conflict.<br>
<br>
I can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>understand</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->(not justify) the Palestinians' hatred for everything that is Israel, same as I can understand the hatred for the Israeli's for the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
I think the Palestinians are an oppressed people. Many, many, many Palestinians who have nothing to do with the terrorists were affected by Israel's oppressions. The very few examples I mentioned are by no means isolated events. <br>
<br>
Let me post some links of the many acts of Israeli's vs the Palestinians. I try to find material with little bias, but understand that in this issue most articles are biased one way or another. It shouldn't be too hard to distinquish fact from propaganda.<br>

<br>
In my opinion this has little to do with self-defense. It's just oppression, plane and simple. Therefore, I don't find it hard to understand that Palestinians hate Israeli's guts and often are sympathetic with the terrorists. As long as they are not directly or indirectly participating in the terrorists attacks, they are still innocent.<br>

<br>
You're right, neither of us know his true intentions. Reading the above documents I got a bit of a different view of him during this century, I am not sure he was still actively pursueing peace anymore. <br>
<br>
I do believe he was committed to the peace during Oslo though and I still do not think that he has a part in the terrorist crimes, although he may be able to do more to stop them. I certainly do not think Arafat is a positive influence on the peace process currently (but I have not given up on him completely).<br>
<br>
Well, I have no hope whatsoever that I have persuaded you now, but let me conclude by a Dutch saying that sums up my view : Where two fight, two are to blame. <p>---------------<br>

As I see it, the Palestinians don't deserve full equality because they have shown that they cannot be reasonable people and act responsibly.<br>
<br>
If the Palestinians want to be treated equally, have full access to all the territory of Israel, have voting rights, etc., then they should show that granting such priveleges would not lead to more death and more terrorism.  I can see why the Israelis don't want to give them any more freedom; whenever they get more freedom, more Israelis end up dead.<br>
<br>
I disagree with you that the severity of the crimes is not relevant.  To me it's very relevant.  The fact that the actions of Hamas are so much more heinous means to me that they are at fault and shifts my sympathies further to the side of the Israelis.<br>
<br>
As for terrorism, I think Arafat encourages it and turns a blind eye to it with respect to law enforcement.  He knows who is responsible and he allows it to continue.  Whether he is actively directing it, I don't know.  I'm not convinced one way or the other.  That is enough for me to consider him a terrorist.<br>
<br>
I will simply never side with anyone that uses the methods Hamas employs.  America will not either.  Hamas needs to understand that they are only making the situation worse for the Palestinians by taking the course they are taking.  Neither America nor Israel will ever cave into terrorism.  We are not as easily scared off as the Europeans.<br>

<br>
I just want to reiterate what I stated before..both sides are guilty of atrocities and pointing fingers will not solve the issue.  I truly believe that if the Palestinians were given a sense of freedom and a chance to properly build their own country (not just the Gaza Strip) as per pre-1967.  Yassir Arafat, Hamas, Osama and many other factions that are most definately anti-Israel will fall by the way-side.  <br>
<br>
Israel itself would find a much greater acceptance from the entire Arab world, and in fact the entire world.<br>
<br>
Building walls, bombing one another, threatening to depose of Yassir Arafat etc, none of this will solve the situation.  It will continue its circular course of needless violence.  At some point some time in the future I am confident that people will realise this and stop.  Stop the killing, stop the pointing fingers, stop the destroying...and actually try and properly address this whole horrible mess.  <br>
<br>
The Palestinian/Israeli conflict is a horrible and often ridiculous situation that I truly believe can be remedied with a lot of work.  This is a hard topic to dicuss without passion much like abortion or gun-control (in the US), one tends to be on one end or another.  In order to make this work we (really they) have to come together and work together.<br>

If you truly believe this statement then i dont believe you have a firm grasp of whats going on over there.<br>
The arab world will never accept Israel and if they ever did succeed in destroying Israel, the terrorist acts would just move to another target.Not fall by the wayside as you believe.<br>
Radical Islam has no room for anyone else ..its Radical Islam or nothing.<br>
Having beliefs is a fine thing ...Killing people because they dont believe as you can never be acceptable.<br>

Well this idea was advanced by the Arab League of Nations more-over by Saudia Arabia.<br>
<br>
If Israel would be willing to cede land/control/autonomy to the Palastinians then they all agreed unanimously that they would give full recognition to the state of Israel, and agree basically in laymans terms to 'hold no hard feelings' towards the Israeli people.<br>
<br>
Radical Islam is not always hand in hand with the Palestinian cause.  The Taliban had little to say or do with the whole Palestinian issue (we can agree that they were radicals).  Iran from the revolution til recently has also had little contact with Palestine (I think again we can agree Iran is fairly radical Islam if slightly different shi'ia vs sunni).  Algeria has several radical groups all of which have zero ties with Palestine.  The radical groups you speak of - Hamas, Al'aksa Brigrade, RCO, PLO, etc.  They are exclusively based in and around Israel and wish to have the Israelis out of what they claim to be their land.  They use Islam as a means to an end, and for a poor nation of people religion works.  I am by no means condoning these people, just wishing to convey the facts.  <br>
<br>
If one were to ameliorate the situation that caused the angst, and therefore created peace, prosperity and happiness.  These groups within this region would have little support from within their own country and also from the rest of the Arab world and thus be ostracised as opposed to the current situation where they are viewed as heroes fighting for a cause.<br>

Yes, but it's the fault of the Palestinians that that is the case.  If the Palestinians weren't so pro terrorist, they could be trusted with greater rights and priveleges by the Israelis.

Terrorists don't wear bright orange stickers labelling themselves as terrorists.  The Israelis need to treat Palestinians as a whole with great caution and limit certain freedoms or more Israelis will end up dead.  If the Palestinians didn't allow terrorists to blend in with them so much and they didn't cover for them so much, then the Israelis could treat just the terrorists poorly.  The Palestinians themselves create the need to be treated poorly by the Israelis.  Make it clear that they don't support terrorism, and make it clear that any and all terrorists will not be harbored or supported but rather will be turned over to the authorities whenever found.  They need to give the Israelis some reason to trust them.  Trust is earned.<br>

I'm not saying the Israeli's shouldn't try to crack down Hamas. I'm saying they have an obligation to keep respecting the basic human rights while doing so.

You do not understand my position. I think both sides are wrong, I have no bias towards any side. Both sides should be willing to make concessions. I do not think a negotiation should be started with Hamas, but with the Palestian leaders. The Palestinian leadership CANNOT crack down the terrorists without at least some support from their population. The population will keep supporting the terrorists as long as they are oppressed (or however you want to name it). It's a Vicious circle. Both sides should be willing to make concessions which would gradually result to the end of violence (although terrorism is very hard to completely stop - probably would take generations). For instance : Israel agrees to respect their borders, while Palestina agrees to unify their security forces and both cooperate in guarding the borders. Over time, Palestinians will be able to do more and more against the terrorists.<br>
<br>
Of course, currently there is no hope for peaceful negotiations, with Arafat and Sharon as leaders - I had little hope in the last peaceprocess, since Sharon was forced into it. Either one side kills the other, or the international should pressure both sides into agreeing with an international arbitration. It's obvious they both are not able to solve this without genocide. Anyway, it is clear that peace will be a long, long process.<br>

Here's the problem.  There are 2 options.  1) Don't crack down on Hamas at all and preserve the rights of all Palestinians.  2) Crack down on Hamas, and hurt a lot of other Palestinians in the process, but at least reduce terrorism against Israel.  The Palestinians have left the Israelis with no choice.  By their continued support of groups like Hamas, they have backed the Israelis into a corner.  The only way for them to defend themselves is to infringe upon the rights of the Palestinians as a whole.  As soon as they grant Palestinians more rights and priveleges, they use those rights and priveleges to kill more innocent Israelis.<br>

I don't think that they do because the atrocities of Hamas and similar groups are so far beyond what the government of Israel has done.
