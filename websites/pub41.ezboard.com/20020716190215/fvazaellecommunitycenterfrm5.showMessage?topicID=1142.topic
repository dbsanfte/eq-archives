<br>
First, let me say the &quot;play nice&quot; policy of Verant generally sucks. If you are camping... um... RCY in KC(fill in any camp) lets say, and my group comes and wants to &quot;share&quot; &quot;play nice policy&quot; says you have to share and that would suck because there wouldn't be enough mobs for us to spilt. We'd both wind up sitting on our asses not doing much, and stepping on each others toes. If you answer &quot;RCY is camped&quot; we wont come. You have a camp, and we don't want to share it or take it or bother anyone.<br>
<br>
Now if you had instead answered &quot;all of Karnors&quot; then I would have to think, well, any place you aren't at currently is open, so if we go to LCY and you aren't there, I don't feel bad about taking the camp.<br>
<br>
Same applies in sebilis for me, if you answer AoE group taking all of upper... I'm glad to contact you and work out a camp. If several other camps are taken and there is no room for us, we'll move along. If only one other camp is taken, I feel we have as much a right to be there as you. I am in no way saying we have MORE right to be there, only equal, we all have an equal right to play the game. I don't think one group has a right to take over an entire zone. We've (can't speak for everyone in the game because i'm not them, but MY group and any raid i've been on) always tried to work things out amiably.<br>
<br>
As a druid, I could easily go to CS (with a nice clarity) and &quot;claim&quot; 12 wyvern spawns, and keep them clean. But I don't because other people come and play and whoever gets to the mobs when they are up is welcome to them. Same with many other camps. Just because I have the ABILITY to claim a large area for my own, does not give me the right to do so.<br>
<br>
My feeling extend to AoE groups in the same way. You have the right to fight where you will, But please be understanding that we'd like to play too. We'll be glad to work things out with you, but I don't feel anyone has the right to claim large parts of any zone as their own, and doing so IS specifically mentioned in the rules for EQ.<br>
<br>
Please, post your view on this and let me know where my thinking has gone wrong.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/25/02 9:48:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoE groups... your thoughts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=1084.topic">pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=1084.topic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:papyrus;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'10pt'">

That leaves Crypt, King and Juggs open too.  So instead of 18 people doing chef/disco 1 and zone out, that leaves 6 people doing those camps.  Hardly a monoply. <p>Herder

But as far as wizards are concerned it IS all of Sebilis, except for the shit that gets in their way when they try to get to trak ;P  I hate seb anyways and don't plan on spending much time there ever again.  I've only had 2 experiences with AE groups.  <br>
One was an attempt to be the puller for the AE group, and while we started to make the rounds another AE group zoned in and decided to take everything from us - guess camp checks only count for AE groups when they're group is the one calling it.  <br>
The other one was in FG when I was in a full group that was keeping 2-3 patches clear as well as a few bandits and some mutants.  A few hours into the camp we ran outta spawns prematurely.  I did a /w and saw the AE group.  I figured whatever and started pulling a little further out.  A little while later I pull a single bandit from very close to camp, and when we get it to half life the entire shroom patch is pulled right thru us.  This happened several times and finally sent a message to the ae group's puller, who stopped to respond mid-pull and proceeded to die rather quickly.  Felt a little badly for them but they trained us several times trying to take our camps, camps that they are extremely religious about first come first serve til someone else is in their way.<br>
I have no hate for AE groups over any other type of group, just practice what you preach guys. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uthorokinwarweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorokin Warweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/25/02 10:11:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoE groups... your thoughts</span><hr size=1> a_dead_horse stares at you glumly -- won't you please just leave me alone?<br>
<br>
Ah, hell, one more kick in the ribs won't hurt.<br>
<br>
AE groups are generally composed of good people, who know what they're doing, respect others, and are usually willing to help out regular groups with C3 or xlocs out or corpse drags.  They normally do their AEing during off hours, and they try not to interfere with other groups.  Every single time I've gone to Seb and found an AE group there, they've responded to my polite inquiry with &quot;sure, you can take NG, just give us five minutes to finish this spawn cycle, then it'll be clear.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are, of course, exceptions to this general statement.  There are AE groups who are exp-grubbing lootwhores who refuse to share anything.  There are AE groups who deliberately train other groups, and I'm sure that somewhere, there are AE groups who meet every week to wring the necks of adorable cuddly kittens while jerking off at their own l337ness.<br>
<br>
But y'know what?  Regular groups do all that too.  AE groups just get more negative attention because people are jealous of what they can do.  That's where the whining comes from, and the bitching, and the people who zone into Seb, see an AE group, then petition without bothering to talk to the group.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just dense, but where exactly is the problem with AE groups?  No AE group I've ever seen has been dumb enough to walk into a fully-camped Seb and say &quot;taking all of upper.&quot;  They normally get there first, when there's nobody in the zone.  So yeah, they kill everything in sight - who wouldn't?  When another group zones in, all they need to do is ask politely, and the AE group will usually give them a camp.  If the AE group doesn't want to share... well, boo-fucking-hoo, the regular group should port out and exp elsewhere... what's that?  You didn't invite a wizard into your regular exp group?  Your loss.  I'm sure the AE group will xloc you though, if you ask nicely.<br>
<br>
As for the whole &quot;they have no right to kill all the mobs&quot; thing, here's a little equation for you: ability + will = right.  If there's nobody else in the zone, they have undisputed right.  If another group comes in... well, does the other group have any more &quot;right&quot; just because it's made up of a cleric, warrior, chanter, gimp_00, gimp_01, gimp_02?  Fuck no.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with AE groups in general.  Personally, I love sharing Seb with them - my casters get C3, we don't need to worry about repops up the ass, and hell, it's great to watch a good AE group in action.  If there's something wrong with a specific AE group or person, take it up with them personally.  Don't blame all AE groups for the faults of one or two bad apples.<br>

We asked if there were any first floor camps we could grab and they said, &quot;Sure, take NG and congrats on your new Lammy.&quot; Yep, they just handed us the Seb Guardian who was up and holding everyone's favorite yard sale sword. <br>
<br>
That was the sum total of the conversation we had and they went about their business and we went about ours. 4 hours later, they left and we actually were left alone in Sebilis for close to an hour. <br>
<br>
On another occasion, I went to Seb and an AE group was there and I asked if they could spare a camp and they said we could have Crypt or anything 2nd floor, but we had no rogue and were a tad outgunned for King/Juggs, so we said, &quot;Have fun&quot; and promptly went and checked Chardok (which was fully camped by 2 raids) and ended up grinding at the Ledge in the Hole. We lost out on 20 minutes of travel time and still had a good day with not one single gripe, whine or fucktard petition anywhere.<br>
<br>
The gimp assbags that &quot;make people share&quot; are just dead set to get BD's, Lammy or some other Seb type loot. Anyone who says they go to Sebilis for the great exp is either lying or a dope since there at least a dozen spots with easier and faster exp. And I would hazard the guess that most of the &quot;but this AE group was mean to me&quot; stories started with someone griping or threatening to invoke the PnP before even attempting a polite discussion with said AE folks. <br>

I think it is unfair wizzies can port while i must walk. I think it is unfair rogues can bs. I think its unfair clerics can heal. I think its unfair ranja's can track.<br>
<br>
 God damn, if verant would only realize that there is only need of 1 class in this game so everyone could have it the same and fair. We could all start out at 60, and all have the same gear. Hell, while were at it i think its unfair some peeps can play alot while others cant. I would like to see a 1 hour a day limit on play times.<br>

For purposes of xp gain all classes are pretty much the same.  So when one set of them is gaining xp way faster than the other sets, thats a balance problem.  Im sorry you're too biased to see this and want to resort to a bunch of hysterical (in both senses of the word) rhetoric. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urezilaturb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rezilaturb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/26/02 10:22:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoE groups... your thoughts</span><hr size=1> /e gets out the stick<br>

It blows away regular exp'ing but I will defenitely agree with the majority that it is unfair.  40AA points in like 2 weeks is not balanced at all.  There is really no easy fix to it though.  Raise MR on frogs and it just makes it harder for those lvl 51-54 groups to come and function normally, even at camps like NG or jail, which are most popular for them. <br>
    GMs fuck it up though because they are never consistent.  One time a GM comes admiring it saying hes loggin to make a wizard so he can do it, a few hours later another is coming in telling me I am monopolizing the zone.  I think they need to come up with some sort of rule or something to make the rules clearly defined. Cause right now it depends on whatever GM you get basically. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uthumpslots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thumpslots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/26/02 11:25:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoE groups... your thoughts</span><hr size=1> My wife playing her Necro in CS and she goes to grab a Wyvern.<br>
She sees that 2 only are up, next to each other.<br>
She taps one to pull it and is instantly sent a tell by an irrate Druid stating that he owns those 2 and the 2 next to it as he is quad kiting them.<br>
Now tell me then, is it also right for someone to claim 4 spawns of a highly demanded mob like that?<br>
This is particularliy common in CS.<br>
I agree it is a golden place for quadding, but is it right to OWN them?<br>

There is no way he can kill 12 before respawns, that is if hes a lvl 54 or under who actually gets xp from them.  AE groups on the other hand can keep every spawn cleared in upper sebilis.  Respawn is 27 minutes, we've cleared it in 13. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uxarr00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xarr00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/26/02 2:22:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoE groups... your thoughts</span><hr size=1>   Clearly they should do away with Trull xp penalty pre-60 thx <p>Xarr TRULL

Come to think of it I dont really hear about seb being ae'd constantly on my other server's board, maybe its a local thing.  Our server is alot less crowded in pure numbers and in level 60s than other servers I bet, maybe the opportunity just isnt there.  Be an interesting question anyways, does anyone know how ae works on other servers? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usilvirthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvir the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 605<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/26/02 3:15:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoE groups... your thoughts</span><hr size=1> I was killing 12 raptors in TD before repops essentially.
