<br>
First of all Dethen, that was not a flame.  That was what is commonly called &quot;Sound Advice&quot; (tm).  You refusal to listen to my sound advice has completely and totally destroyed any hope of ever recovering even an iota of dignity and respect.  I not only offered you advice, but the opportunity to talk with me in game about the problems you are experiencing, and ways of resolving this so that you could enjoy the game as a member of the community.<br>
<br>
Instead you choose to insult the closest thing you have to a friend that you have on this server.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, I am not your friend.  But friends are rarely as completely and totally candid as I have been with you.<br>
<br>
And you chose to make your one and only response to me an insult.  <br>
<br>
For someone who has decided to TRY and take the moral high ground by stating that you are the only one behaving in an adult fashion, you just lost even an illusion of credibility.  You were so bent on biting at the fist you saw swinging at you, you bit the hand that was trying to offer to lead you away from your dire situation.  <br>
<br>
You don't want that hand closed into a fist.  I have alot of respect for the people on this board, but I think my credentials in the respect of argument, insult, rhetoric, etc. should give you pause.  Plus, I will not rest until every single person on Zeb has the link to this thread.  It will become my mission in life.<br>
<br>
I don't want to do that Dethen.  I am trying very hard to remain objective, to be kind, to help you, even though I have never met a person more undeserving of my help.  Plus, I just joined a new guild, and I want my guild to respect my maturity and friendly demeanor.  Unlike you, I take my reputation very seriously, and care very much about what my peers think of me.<br>
<br>
DO NOT make me angry.  It's an overused quote, but &quot;You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.&quot;  Remember the Bryre post I made?  Thats the smallest, tiniest, itty-bittiest example of what i am capable of.  I don't want to resort to a serious flame session, as amazingly tempting as it is.<br>
<br>
Last time Dethen.  You still have a chance.  You can still save your character.  Walk away from this.  Given enough time, all this will die away.  I gave you a list of great games to play in the mean time, and you should think long and hard about what you want to ultimately achieve.  Look beyond the here and now, my friend.  Do you want to play Dethen?  Do you want your Epic?  Do you want the joy of participating in the high end of the game?  The more you talk, the more you deal with the grim, grim possibility that these things are going to be closed off to you.<br>
<br>
Think, Dethen.  Just think. <p>Kolath Eversor <BR>

I distinctly remember you telling us that, since you didn't have a guild at the time, you had to bring your own group to Mistmoore to camp your Soulfire Hilt.  Maybe you quested for the hilt back at level 14, I don't know, but there seems to be a bit of inconsistency here.  By the way, how did manage any Ro armor at level 14? /boggle<br>

Did you go to sleep, or were you up late playing PS2?  In this thread, you said that you were playing PS2 when you heard an ominous bump coming from downstairs.  Which is it?<br>

 Hey mysticsoul does that Shirt your wearing really say &quot;I HAVE NO LIFE&quot; Is it really saying that? Oh and the back of it says &quot;IM A STUPID SHITHEAD!&quot; And oh the arms of it look like its saying &quot;I RAPE MY OWN SISTER&quot; and &quot;I EAT SHIT&quot; Wow that must be a very cheap shirt your mother bought you Id say its worth about two cents? You must be a regular Mommas boy. <br>
<br>
Now listen to me little mommas boy Meridean is not what you think anymore. Ever since he lost his stuff from up there he toned down, ALOT I would know because I grouped with him and any group im in with him the members seem to like him because of his funny nature. So please little mommas boy go back crying to mommy and dont flame others on purpose I dont need to stand up for myself cuz I already did so Miratos will eventually grow up and either agree to give a truce or to leave me and my friends alone. Next Bash please. <br>
<br>
this is being ADULT?????? this is that PROUD MATURE ADULT??????<br>
nope couldnt be must be that lil bro is home again<br>
<br>
btw all this si deathens reply to my post under the meridean section of the bottom feeders you are welcome to go view this upstand community minded great teacher of the disables wonderful technician of army missles and student in the naval acadamys UPSTANDING PROUD ADULT that he claims to be.<br>
<br>
funny that he is the only one that stands up for meridean whome which is exactly like this guy (only he dont try to cyber like deathen) deathen i hope your in game GF or whatever she calls you will get a chance to see you in your true inteligence right here on this site and see you for who you really are.<br>

<br>
deaths said he was a teacher of the disabled  correct???<br>
<br>
yet in an earlier post he says he goes off to his uncles house for 2 months correct?????<br>
<br>
umm deathen since when did teaches take 2 months off from teaching disabled students just to go visit a family member ( not dyeing of course) and since when did teachers live at home with mama and dada like you hmm i think its aweful wierd does anyone else think this as well???<br>
<br>
and what happned to being the missle technician in the army  did you know that impersonateing a federal employee is a federal offense.<br>
<br>
and then again what about being the naval acadamy student??? which is it deathen your storys are so inconsestant here that i cant follow your train of thoughts.<br>
<br>
i know the trueth here deathen is a lil 11 year (if i could give him that much credit) whiner baby with no idea of right and wrong. with no idea of what maturity is or will prolly ever have any idea of it. who has very little room for growth and whos parents fed him hustler and playboy for reading material.<br>
<br>
they are right deathen you are walking yourself into more fuckups then you were makeing just being on the server i like you you one funny moron.<br>
<br>
i always said i would never laugh at a retard or disabled person but i just cant help it i cant stop laughing you at deathen your worse then my 4 year old daughter in what you say and how you act. hell my 4 year old lil girl has far more maturity and much greater intelligence then you ever will. give it up bud you got too many peopl ethat know more about you then you do. your best bet is to just leave the game go to UO where your kind is welcome and leave the mature games to the mature adults  like us.<br>
<br>
anyone else remember a time when verant said you had to be at least 18 years of age to play this game damn they was stupid in reduceing that age limit  look at what it gets us people like him<br>

<br>
Every once in a while a person comes along that just deserves this kind of bashing.  Dethen is an ass, his post are infantile, and his mindset is not in par with what it takes to be a &quot;likable&quot; person (in real life, or EQ).<br>
<br>
His inability to take the responsibility for his own actions (My brother did it), the Idle threats, the immature nature of which he posts, and the way he singled out Bry, all culminated in a flurry of anger from BDL, and others in the EQ community we call Zeb.  People, that have all of their Y chromosomes, tend to see when a person deserves to be nailed for his utter stupidity.  That is what happened here.  HE started this, not you, not Bry, not BDL.  Do not apologize!<br>
<br>
This thread will show, to all who read it, exactly what kind of person Dethen is.  Hopefully the word will spread, and he will find himself alone in this game. <p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56841"><img border="0" src="http://home.houston.rr.com/mcherry/Fuman_Signature.png" width="110" height="160"></a><a href="http://www.miratos.com/forums/"><img border="0" src="http://home.houston.rr.com/mcherry/Middle_of_Signature2.png" width="110" height="160"></a><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52769"><img border="0" src="http://home.houston.rr.com/mcherry/Tegweil_Signature.png" width="110" height="160"></a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urogoshofbdl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rogosh Of BDL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 11:07:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dethen Valiant Saga - Long Version</span><hr size=1> Qoute from Dethen:<br>

Dethen also has the honor of being the first to make my ignore and &quot;do not rez&quot; for any price/reason list. Congrats!<br>
<br>
Now as for some more inconsistencies... he told me that he was a college student in Rhode Island. I was speaking to him in tells just after Tri Lith let him in I was commenting on how impressed I was with his persistence (as he was initially refused a guildship but reposted asking for a chance, etc etc). What do I get as a response? <br>
<br>
&lt;below is the paraphrase of the conversation, I have unfortunately deleted the actual log&gt;<br>
<br>
Hael: &quot;I must say that you are pretty persistent&quot;<br>
<br>
Deth: &quot;lissen hrqyc, i dont like it when people call me names!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hael: &quot;I'm sorry... what name?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deth: &quot;persistant... what does it mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hael: /boggle &quot;I thought you said you're a college student?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deth: &quot;yeah and I dont like to be insulted by flamer kids trying to use big words!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hael: &quot;Ummm... I think you need to get a dictionary and look it up... it means to not give up...&quot;<br>
<br>
Deth: &quot;Oh, it does? are you sure... I still think your insulting me...&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;end paraphrase&gt;<br>
<br>
Not long after this his obnoxious attitutude and attempts to hit on me caused me to put him on /ignore. This was the first time I had ever done that to a guildie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Some of the posts are showing just what I expected if I kept being smart and cool enough. Idioticness and Immaturity. Now hear this if you want this to stop then you do this.  You either leave me alone and quit having people send me tells so they can tell me there bull. or you can call it a truce and we will all be so much happier either which I dont care.  Pride is something I dont need nor do I want it cuz this is only a game, graphics and ones and zeroes thats all.  <br>
<br>
All im saying is its up to you guys if you want to continue this moronic nonesense because Im showing my friends, teachers and I even shown the schools Shrink all this just so they can get a laugh at it and they did. The Shrink says that all you guys need to stop taking this game so far into your life and regain some sense of maturity because its really damaging you and your social lives. <br>
<br>
Now basically my little bro would be flaming the hell out of all of you and he is really good at it. But I on the otherhand want some Peace and you guys deny me of it.  So quit this nonesense and agree to either leave me alone or to better yet call it truce because im tired of being the only adult on this board. Think about it read your own posts and just stop to think how foolish it all is. Otherwise, Next flame please.<br>
<br>
Btw Im not doing this for any attention at all. I got friends in school, girls seem to like me alot cuz of the things I do and im happy with my life so I dont need any attention at all nor want it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utannblackpoint.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tann Blackpoint</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Aahhh...not the Eyepatch!</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 2:56:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Smiles as the Flame O meter has gone up 9 out of 20</span><hr size=1> dethen, if you prove to become as annoying as the nimrod guy from a while back, i will be glad to suspend you from this board. so far all you have accomplished is trolling and provoking the rest of the server to flame you. <br>

From all of the inconsistancies, explaining the signing up for 3 accounts on badgamers, the lies you so obviously told everyone.  <br>
<br>
The first time I ever talked to you, you told me you were 21, then told another guildie you were 17 and now are 18 according to your profile here.  Well which is it?<br>
<br>
You say you are in the army, naval academy, and college.  Boy you lead a busy life, makes me wonder how you have time to post on these boards, play EQ so much, and devote time to a fiance.  <br>

If you are showing this to your the school shrink and she doesn't find something wrong with the attititude you are projecting here then she is the one that needs the shrink, or at the very least, new glasses.  <br>
<br>
As far as I can see, you are the only one taking this GAME too far into your own life.  Otherwise you would not have posted on our boards to whine at people who you don't even know because they don't like you.  Get back to me when you grow up.<br>

If you are not doing this for attention, and we have told you repeatedly to GO AWAY:  Why Why WHY (excuse the language) DO YOU KEEP FUCKING POSTING HERE?????<br>
<br>
Something I and then rest of these people are saying is obviously getting under your skin.  I post here because you are entertaining the masses with your posts and your god-almighty-bow-down-and-worship-me-I-am-Gods-gift-to-women attitude.  So please, don't listen to the people asking/telling you to go away.  <br>
<br>
In any event, this would all have never happened if you had just left well enough alone.  BDL thought the matter dropped and you brought it back up.  Not us.  You have no one to blame for this but yourself.  It is not our problem that you didn't like the answers you were given.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I forgave you for the GD thing the day it happened, what you never understood was that that was never the issuse. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
