(kinda long)</span><hr size=1> The large troll stood waiting at the gate.  He gazed off into the distance at the red fires and burnt soil of the place.  Muspelheim.  Fiery and hot, smokey and black.  His thick skin could endure it, would have to endure it because much was at stake.  He stood patiently and waited the arrival of his friends, his close companions.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hail Kreln,&quot; came the voice from behind him.  Shaken out of his daydream her turned to see a diminutive kobold leaning lightly on the massive doorjam of the large wooden gate.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah, Berlux, I had begun to wonder if you were going to show,&quot; replied Kreln.  Reaching down he patted his friend on the shoulder.  &quot;It is good to see you my friend.  What of Xammer and Frehya?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;They will be along.  I received word that they have left Jordheim and will join us shortly.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;That is good, we must not delay.&quot;  Kreln again gazed off into the fires, preparing his mind for the coming storm.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Have there been more attacks?&quot; asked Berlux.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Aye, the giants of this cursed place grow bolder every day.  Twice this week they have struck out at Veldon and Haggerfel.  Four have died, but they will be avenged.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Berlux just nodded.  He peered intently down the trail from which he had come and smiled.  &quot;There,&quot;  he pointed into the fog.<br>
<br>
  Kreln turned just as Xammer and Frehya materialized out of the fog and trotted toward them.  Kreln moved to greet them.  He nodded respectfully to Frehya then clasped the forearm of Xammer in greeting, &quot;Hello my brother.  Thor smiles on us this day.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Aye, he does.  You can hear it too, the song of battle stirring in our soul.  Let us be off.&quot;  With that from Xammmer the four turned and at a brisk pace plunged into the stifling heat of the dreaded Muspelheim.<br>
<br>
  The four trudged onward, deeper and deeper into Muspelheim.  Fighting off charred and blackened skeletons, undead spirits, demonic fiends, and fire weilding creatures of all kinds.  Nothing could stand before the mighty hammer and axe of the Thanes.  After many hours and a few minor cuts and bruises the four adventurers crested a ridge and found their destination.  The fire giant fort loomed ahead in the distance.  Even from this far away it towered over them, rising many hundreds of feet into the air.  Giant guards and scouts roamed the landscape around them, each looking to spot and destroy any enemy or invaders before they could reach the giant king.  The four descended the hill to prepare for battle.  Frehya spent many minutes praying and giving thanks to Eir while Berlux communed with the earth to speak with Ymir.  Lightening crackled through the air in responce as both Kreln and Xammer called to Thor to bless them and grant them strength.  When they were done all four felt the presence of the gods about them, they felt the god's blessings flowing through them.  It was time to go.<br>
<br>
  The four moved quietly and quickly across the hills and through the valleys.  They dealt with each and every giant they came in contact with, leaving no enemies behind.  Finally they strode up to the bridge that crossed the great river of lava.  Flame and steam spouted forth from the deadly current.  Kreln walked slowly across the bridge, stopping at the halway point and calling out and taunting the three giants milling about the other side at the entrance to the fort.  &quot;By Thor you shall die today for your actions!  Come face me in battle you coward!&quot; taunted Kreln.<br>
<br>
  The giant roared in response.  &quot;You dare come to my land and threaten me!  KILL THEM!&quot;<br>
<br>
  Kreln called to his friends as they raced to join him on the bridge.  The first giant guard charged onto the bridge, followed closely by the second, and came right for Kreln.  He ducked the giants punch and swung his mighty hammer landing a devastating blow to the giants kneecap.  Down the giant fell to the bridge where Xammer lept forward and buried his axe in its neck, severing the spinal column.  Frehya already into her prayer called to Eir and a bright white light erupted in the face of the second guard stunning him just as he stepped upon the bridge.  Berlux whispered a quiet devotion and thorns snaked up and around the guard and a large cloud of green mist erupted from the giants nostrils as poison slowly started coursing through its veins.  The second giant fell shortly after, paralyzed and bleeding from wounds inflicted by Xammer and Kreln.<br>
<br>
  They approached the king cautiously, the four of them fanning out to provide many targets.  His guards may have been weak and pitiful, but this was a giant king, a much more dangerous foe.  Kreln broke the tension and charged, his hammer swinging in a wide sideways arc.  The king brought his shield up and blocked the attack then responded with his own slash that Kreln just failed to parry.  The king's blade caught Kreln in the shoulder, cutting deep into his flesh and exposing bone.  Frehya immediately went to Eir in prayer.  Kreln dropped to one knee as the pain in his shoulder exploded throughout his senses.  The king seeing his moment brought his blade down again on Kreln thinking to finish the foe, but Xammer was there.  He parried the king's attack, knocking the king's blade wide then followed up with a wicked slash to the king's shin as blood spurted from the wound.  Just then a blast of blue light erupted over Kreln as he felt the healing power of Eir flow through him, Frehya's prayer was answered.  Berlux released a volley of blue energy balls conjured up from the depths of the earth and hurled them at the king.  Each one striking him in the chest and pushing the king back, rending and ripping at his red skin.  <br>
<br>
  Kreln stood up with renewed strength and again charged the king as Xammer parried another heavy strike from the giant lord.  Kreln rushed straight at the king, ducking below the king's swinging shield he skidded to a halt behind the king.  Kreln didn't waste any time, he dug down and mustered all his strength as his hammer struke the king in the back of the knee.  Another volley of conjured energy released from Berlux struck the king setting him wildly off balance.  He teetered for a moment then fell over backwards, shaking the ground as his mammoth weight crashed down.  Frehya released another brilliant flash of light, this time in the eyes of the king as he fell toward the earth.  Hurt and dazed he lay there waiting for death.  Xammer slahed across the neck severing the windpipe as Kreln landed a massive blow on his forhead caving the giants skull.  The king gasped for breath but no breath would come until finally the giants great chest heaved one final time then he lay still.<br>
<br>
  Kreln walked over and clasped his brother on the shoulder, both were covered in blood and tired.  The four heros stared at each other and the grisly scene about them.  No words were spoken, none were needed.  They turned and began the journey home.  <br>
