It never happened, at least it never did until I left. (thats if it happened at all, forgive me for having lost any grasp on what is going on in Britannia)<br><br>I am really not sure what to make of this but it seems like Verant is slipping farther and farther down the slippery slope they placed themselves on when they released this game.   You can see it in their original discussions of such things as houses, horses, etc.   They were firmly against it but are gradually moving in that direction in an attempt to keep us all riveted to our seats.  You can see the similar trend in weaponry and gear.  Now I am by no means at the forefront of the game, nor do I care to be there anymore. (platinum isn't worth much at my favorite Italian restaurant it seems)  but recently I have seen or heard of items with sensational stats...40/80 axe with some ungodly number of AC on it comes right to mind.  <br><br>I guess the feeling I get from the Horse implementation is basically they are saying.  &quot;Hey We are still special!

Why isn't their a run skill? So casters can make money casting spells? Why aren't their bind stones? So casters can make money binding others?<br><br>Perhaps, but why should they make more money than tanks who have no means of making extra dough other than killing? We need money just as bad.<br><br>I think the real reason horses aren't better probably has a lot more to do with the engine and the difficulty of making those kind of difficult changes. But I cringe every time I hear &quot;it would require too much work.&quot; That sounds lazy to me.

And really, why should they? You won't see any significant changes until the audience really starts to erode.<br><br>And even THAT isn't guaranteed. EQ2 could be just on the horizon, and perhaps it would be easier to just launch EQ2 in a year than waste time and money fixing a sinking ship.<br><br>I like to refer as the phenomenon as a company &quot;going Disney.&quot; They shift from response to press release and from cutting-edge to conservative and watching the &quot;bottom line.&quot;<br><br>Oh well, it ALWAYS happens. The money's rolling in, and no one in their right mind is going to jeopardize that without a damn good reason.<br><br>/sigh<br><br>That's why EQ is hiding the numbers. One of the upcoming MMORPG's is going to take a bite out of the market, and, for the first time in at least two years, they're going to have to take chances and try to get a chunk of the market.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I like EQ and gladly continue to play it, but there isn't a player out there who doesn't have a list of improvements who doesn't have a list of features that will pull him out of EQ and into another MMORPG.<br><br>To me, horses are an effort to say, &quot;Hey, we're still cool! We've got horses. You don't need houses. You need horses!&quot;<br><br>Oh well, time to start saving the dough so I can be uber one day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucervantus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cervantus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(9/8/01 3:54:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Horses in Shadows exp??</span><hr size=1> about a year or so ago Verant was upset about the value of platinum on the player economy.
