<br>
I figured it was about time I posted a message so you know I didn't die or fall off the face of the earth or something..heh<br>
<br>
Although I haven't been playing hardly at all, I still check these message boards often to see how the guild is doing. I am happy to see that we are doing so well, and finally made it past that damn Vex Thall timesink that I used to bitch about all the time in chat ;-)<br>
<br>
I like reading about the guilds raids, and hope dlaritan or whoever will keep on posting so I can stay in the loop. I miss the game a lot, but am not hooked on it like I used to be. I had some computer problems before I left the game, and by the time I got them fixed, I had broken the addiction.<br>
<br>
I do play my Necromancer from time to time and always do a &quot;who all ody&quot; to see what you all are up to. I even thought about giving my cleric to the guild on several occasions, but figured nobody likes botting characters anyways, so whats the point? heh Plus I can't say for sure that I will never play her again. At this point though, you all are so far ahead of me that it would be pointless as I would have to play catch up and get all the flags for the planes etc. that the guild has gotten over the last few months..that would suck.<br>
<br>
I am mainly writing to let you all know that I will always be an Odysseys member, and will never ebay the cleric. I am really looking forward to Everquest 2. When EQ2 comes out you better believe I will be back to my usual 8 to 12 hour a day play habit..lol<br>
<br>
Does the guild have any advance plans to move to a certain Everquest 2 sever in mass? I would really like to see Odyssey's start out EQ2 on a server together, and become the &quot;Afterlife&quot; or &quot;FOH&quot; of that server. That would be awsome!<br>
<br>
*waves* I will be watching, and miss talking to you all.<br>

As for EQ2... I think a lot are hesitant, having spent soo much time in their current characters.  The only reason I could see a lot of Ody moving to EQ2 is if a lot of the guild quits to play EQ2 instead.  I am sure either way EQ2 will hurt the guild as it will many others, but time will tell.<br>

I think at some point though, people will get to a point where you have seen and done pretty much everything Everquest has to offer. I know Sony says they will continue to expand the old game when the new one comes out. I used to work for a gaming company though, and know how it goes. The expansions to EQ 1 will probably dwindle to a minimum as most of the programmers will be working on part two patches and updates for a good 6 months to a year.<br>
<br>
In my opinion it would be a shame to see the guild simply break up piece by piece if people slowly leave for EQ2. Maybe a second branch of Odyssey's could be implemented in the new game that would have officers on both the old, and new everquest. At least until people decide one way or the other which game they want to concentrate on.<br>
<br>
It's way too early to even be talking about all this, but I don't play Everquest 1, so damnit I am thinking about it already..lol<br>
<br>
My prediction would be that EQ2 will pull the majority of Everquest players out of the original. Some will play the original game a good bit due to their long existing characters and time previously invested, but eventually will be playing the new game more than the old.<br>
<br>
I can't wait to be a level 1 cleric again, and I hope plans will be made to have a solid guild at the get go. I would hate to join some random guild in EQ2, simply because Odyssey's doesn't have a presence there ;(<br>
<br>
Heck EQ2 might totally suck. I never underistimate the stupidity of a software company when it comes to screwing up a good franchise game. It happens all the time. Everquest 1 could simply be a one hit wonder, and the sequel little more than a shadow of the original. (crosses fingers) I hope not.<br>
<br>
Nice to hear from you two. I will send ya a message slyk.<br>

Some things die fast, others have to be beat severely until they're just a bloody pile of old character models and bad CSRs...<br>
<br>
MMORPGs are here to stay, and with that base we can easily say in 10 years a good portion of us will still be playing them, yes?  To continue that thought, how many of us can honestly say we plan to be playing Everquest in 10 years (barring the fact that you give up gaming entirely, get married and your spouse is mean, etc)?  I'm not saying EQ2 will kill EQ1, honestly no single game will kill EQ1.  Just stating at some point you're going to have to let go of the old and embrace the new.  Not tomorrow, not next month, maybe not next year...everything has its time and passes though.<br>
<br>
Anyone who says they'll play Everquest forever is being silly...either that or they're 95 and plan to die tomorrow =P<br>

This isn't a flame on anyone in this thread, just making a point that in time everything has it's end....even this lame post.<br>

Stone and I most likely wont be back to EQ1.  We had to sell our accounts because the school screwed up my tuition and I ended up owing a bunch of money.  They gave me a whole 30 days to pay it back or they'd kick me out.  It was our only alternative at the time.  It was really hard giving up our characters.  I miss playing more than you know.  The good thing that came out of it all was that our characters are still in Odysseys.  However, Dream's excuse for not shaving Ael's legs is because he has a thing for hairy women....  especially hairy feet.  /cringe  All in all, I think Dream will be good to Aelanya...  he's in love with her too much not to be.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On the other hand, EQ2 is coming out and if I can get a job when we get to Texas, maybe we can afford to update the computers, get a new video card blah blah blah.  You know how it is.<br>
<br>
So did you stop playing altogether or are you just on a break?  Will you be coming back to EQ1 or are you waiting for EQ2?  I've seen the video's of EQ2 and I have to admit it looks really enticing.  What I don't understand is how the rez thing works.  Something about items in your inventory disappearing if you don't get a rez.  /boggle.<br>

Where do you plan to live in Texas? I visit a good friend of mine in Dallas every once in a while. Texas has a few nice cities, and a whole lot of crappy cities.

We'll be stationed at Sheppard AFB in Wichita Falls.  I believe it's about 1.5 or 2 hours NW from Dallas.  And what I've heard just echo's what you said about 90% of the towns.  But the base is nice.  I also have family in Dallas so maybe it will be a little more bearable.  Do you live in Texas?<br>

btw.... We will more than likely have a new email address once we move so I'll give the current one in the forums once we get it.  Hopefully I can still get earthlink dsl in that area.  If so, we should be able to keep the same one. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <br>

Qball still playing too? Damn, hearing from you guys makes me want to play again. I am too far behind though I think. You guys are a level above where I stopped. I have no emp key, no VT key, and you probably got a lot more planes access by now.<br>
<br>
I don't live in Texas. I do go there a couple times a year though. Dallas is a pretty fun city, though you gotta watch out for the occasional mugger or random gunfire..lol<br>
<br>
Hope you and qball are gonna play EQ2. I might come in to EQ1 and chat with you guys, but I think may days of playin regularly are over ;( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bodysseyxev.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjorkeq>BjorkEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Space Monkey</span><br>  Posts: 247<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/03 2:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fodysseyxevfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1066.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aelanya</span><hr size=1> Woot !!<br>

Hiya girl,  remember me?  Hugz!!!!<br>
Hey if you start playing again you can believe people are gonna help you get caught up.  EQ is still an incredible time sink but the good folks in Ody make it fun.  Hope to see you around in game.  <br>

Getting caught up on flags and such wont be bad, IF you do it now! Basically over the next week or so we are going to get alot of backflagging done right before we focus on RZ. So do not delay!

<br>
I think  several EQ guilds will move en-masse to EQ2 especially those guilds who are at the end tiers of the game by the time EQ2 rolls around ( I predict Harm and AV will dissapear or have severly reduced presence on EQ after EQ2 release).  This will free up alot of room on our server for guilds like OC and Ody and BC to rise, but at the same time will draw away some of our best players in a steady hemorrage that will probably force some consolidations/mergers/collapses of some of the raiding guilds we see on our server today.<br>
<br>
As far as EQ2 goes: first 2 weeks-month it will be a levelling race with goal to get to 50 or 100 or whatever the maximum level is.  Casters being the least loot dependent will have an advantage, but hopefully monk classes (I am given to understand that there will be several varieties of monk/paladin/warrior etc etc) will also be reasonably simple as far as gear needs go. The next uberguild on each EQ2 server will probably be decided by the end of the first month after release.  Many of the eventual winners will be old, familiar names (FoH, Harm, AL etc etc).  Its just a matter of who can get their members to level 100 (i think thats the new max) fastest and begin uber mob farming this is something that existing uberguilds have already done well with each expansion, and they continue to recruit players with uuber play times. <p>Inno Blizzardfist<br>
