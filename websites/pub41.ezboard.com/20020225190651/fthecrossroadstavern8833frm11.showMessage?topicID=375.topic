align=left class=m><span class=title> Meridean and a warning about him to all</span><hr size=1> well all this is my first time ever visiting this site or any like it but i was recomended to come here by several people i have talked to in the game from across many different guilds.<br><br>as some of you may know him or have grouped with him or had problems with him this post is about MERIDEAN<br><br>meridean whom was the leader of the guild Knights of Wildfire <br>when i came to this server about 3 months ago i joined his guild he was a friendly sort or so it seemed. i came from the terris thule server where i left behind a 56 epic druid and 52 rogue i did this beacuse on that server the general thought for the game was power not fun and thats not why i play EQ i come for fun if i get powerful then it was destined to be if i dont then the same applies.<br><br>i soon joined MERIDEANS guild but i am also a helpful individual or at least i try to be i met a very wonderful person from another guild and they needed some help straightening out their guild so i took one of my alts fromt he knights of wildfire and joined them to help them out. when meridean found out about this he called me every name int he book but a deadman. saying i was unloyal an asshole a jerk and many other names.<br><br>meridean soon left his OWN guild and joined several other guilds before joining the guild i am with now the Followers of Nobility. meridean was with us only for a week in which time he went on a raid to MM his pulling got an entire raid group of 41 people killed  when this happened he told the raid party to fuck off that they deserved this and then he was removed from our guild. since that time he has gone on to that i KNOW of at least 7 other guilds all of which have blacklisted him for his actions.<br><br>about 2 weeks ago he walked up to my wife in the EC tunnel (my RL wife) and started calling her names like a filthy whore and a nasty bitch and many other disrespectful horrible names. the GMs were made aware of this but they seem to either not care or are unable to do anything about this. since tha time he has taken every oppertunity to follow redpaw and myself blackpaw around emoteing nasty things to us (as he cant say anything since he is on ignore)<br><br>a list of the guild that i KNOW of that he  has been blacklisted from is to follow and you are welcome to talk tot hem about their thoughts on him<br><br>sicena of the scars of veeshawn<br>windroar of the Underworld Knights<br>Atsoom or myself or redpaw of the Followers of Nobility<br>Aarmy or Kudane of the Triad of Harmony<br>i am not sure but the Chaos Dragons<br>he is currently in the Fae Victus et Nobilitus (or however you spell it properly) they are aware of his history<br><br>i am certain that he has been in other guilds all of which he has left or has been kicked out of<br><br>i do this not to ensure that he never plays this game or that he never gets another guild but in the hopes that any of the guilds he joins are aware of his history and in the hopes that the history he has will hopefull be enough to change him i will never trust him but i hope that someday he will be man enough to appologize to my wife for his comments or do the graceful thing and leave the game to those that are here for enjoyment.<br><br>thank you all for your time in reading this may this information be found useful<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A

HERE is the email I got... (I took out one name to protect a guild member.)<br><br>______________________________________________<br>Date: Sun, 23 Dec 2001<br>        Dear Kudane,<br>              Greetings, This is Meridean D`Voxota, formally known as Radivel Manaburner. I have great interest in rejoining your guild, the lasting impression it made on me from the kindness of your members will never be forgotten. However I didn't think there was much much of a chance seeing as how your guild doesn't seem like it would allow rebounders, that was until XXXXXXX boasted my confidence. I left the guild because I wanted to make my own guild, Thinking everything would be a cakewalk, and things would be great. Soon I came to the realisation that my past would haunt me. My previous guild Chaos Dragons banned me because I told an officer named Raaln to f off because he had been bothering my wife for a period of two weeks and she had told him several times to stop, and to leave her alone. Soon after I joined your guild, but was recieving many msgs from my old friends to create my own guild. It se emed like a good idea at the time so I left Triad, and thus the Knights of Wildfire were born. There was heavy fire between CD and KoW because over 35 members left because of the banning and joined me. Members harassing members and such were reported to me allmost daily. That is until CD claimed I payed off a druid to port a lvl 10 CD member to IC in a shared wolf form group, and left him for dead. They messaged all my members with these accusations and soon my guild was crumbling benieth me. You may be wondering why I am telling you this story, Mainly because I'm letting you know my past history. And what I have learned from it. I should have never left Triad of Harmony to begin with. Now I am constantly monitored and any guild I join is most guarenteed to be messaged by Raaln and informed of my supposid past. I wish to let you know this now before you hear it from someone else. Thank you for your time.<br>                                       Meridean<br>___________________________________________<br><br>Now based on that letter, I gave him a chance.  explained our guild charter and rules. Well to make a long story shorter.. In one day he broke three of our five guild rules. He was rude to a cleric, argued with someone else and basically made an A$$ of himself. Sooo I put him on a two week prohbation (this was a week after joining us) a week into that he decideds to remove his tag to go raid with another guild. While on that raid I tell him its not working out. He tells me that we were &quot;to tree-huggish&quot; for his taste anyway.. That when someone was rude to him he wanted to be able to do what ever he wanted.. SOOOOO he was gone for good.<br><br>A week later I hear he is telling people that I treated him badly, that I kicked him out.. that I was being a d#ck.. etc.etc.  sooooo I highly recommend people watch for him here who I know him as<br><br>Bruized -Human Monk<br>Meridean - Barbarian Warrior<br>Radevil - Halfling Druid<br><br>So far in my year of playing this is the first person I would like to see banned from the server. that is mean to say. but the WAKE of destruction he leaves is just unbelievable..<br><br>Kudane Cheetahfeet<br>Guild Leader- Triad of Harmony<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uesmeraldatavyl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmeralda Tavyl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Prime Healer</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 1:34:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thequest.ws/images/esmerphoto.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Meridean and a warning about him to all</span><hr size=1> LOL - one of your rules is that you cant be rude to a cleric?  hahaha I love that.<br><br>EDIT - oh, this guy was in our guild for about a week, raiding with us.  He wasn't officially in the guild and we didn't invite his alts.  He went and raided with another guild in Hate with their tag and we got all kinds of tells after the raid that he was an ass and stole loot.  We got the tells because they wanted to know if he did this stuff with us.  He didn't try anything like this with us at all.  We are very strict about who gets into what groups and how we organize so he was never in an XP group and thus never had a chance to loot.<br><br>I'm pretty sure he will be guildless for the rest of his life. <p><img src="http://www.thequest.ws/images/esmersig3.jpg" border="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b><a href="mailto:esmeraldatavyl@thequest.ws">(E-Mail)</a> <a href="http://www.thequest.ws" target="_blank">(Guild Site)</a>  <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72435" target="_blank">(Magelo)</a> (ICQ=143934210)</b></font></p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uesmeraldatavyl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmeralda Tavyl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/23/02 1:38:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugryfynclawdruid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GryfynclawDruid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Swedish Maid</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 1:41:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Meridean and a warning about him to all</span><hr size=1> Actually not being rude to clerics is a pretty good...rule..if you expand to ALL classes.<br><br>Manners is Gud. <p>[A computer is] like an Old Testament god, with a lot of rules and no mercy.-- Joseph Campbell</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uviddwizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>viddwizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 1:47:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Meridean and a warning about him to all</span><hr size=1> No, the rules for our guild are simple common sense things :<br>________________________________________________<br>1. Honor and respect your fellow members. For they are your friends and deserve the best of your ethics, intentions, actions, and morality.<br><br>2. Be nice to everyone you encounter or put them on /ignore.  As a member of the guild, you represent all of us through your deeds.  Do not dishonor yourself, your guild, or your friends by being rude, crude, nasty, selfish, or any other manner of behavior that would be generally viewed as lame.<br><br>3. Avoid hostile verbal exchanges with the lamers you encounter in the game.  They exist, but let us ensure they exist outside of our guild.   Yelling at them seldom does anything more than make you look bad.  If they are irritating you, just put them on /ignore.<br><br>4. Take it outside. Any differences of opinion that become more than just friendly banter between guild members must be taken &quot;offline&quot; with one another and discussed in some forum other than guild chat or the Message Boards.  Your dirty laundry is just that--yours. The guild members who are not involved should not have to be subjected to it.  It is up to you to work things out.<br><br>5. Don't Beg.   You are expected to raise yourself up by your own bootstraps.  You can ask in guild chat if anyone has something you need, but don't beg for it or be a pest about it.   No one likes a beggar and being a member of the guild does not automatically mean that people are going to start giving you stuff.<br>___________________________________________________<br><br>to explain the cleric..<br><br>He came to a group that Meridean was in (not leading) and the slot had been filled. when he did an /ooc of &quot;I came all the way over here and the slot was filled, that sucks&quot; he started flipping the guy off and saying some rude stuff.. sooo we got a tells asking about him. and reporting his actions..<br><br>he broke 1-3 in one day... and when I asked him about it.. he said &quot;i never read that crap.. i saw no need&quot;<br><br>But again. these are common sense things<br><br>On a second note..

Me and some friends were going to SolB to try to get some GEBs.  He was out tank and well, we ended up getting trained by a Rangers bad pull, got a ton of spiders, and finally killed.  Before we could make an attempt to get our corpses out Cleric goes LD.  But luckly a Necro from my guild happened to be in Lavasrotm.  I asked him to summon out corpses, he agreed, went to Neriak to get coffins, came back and ACK!<br><br>I guess Meri and my guildie had a rough history.  Long story, but Meri was trying to SOLO the specs in Oasis and he kept training the docks, getting a ton of people killed.  Noobs were swearing at him, and well it ended with Meri and my guildie dueling.  Warrior v. Necro, I think we all have a good idea how it was going to go.  But Meri had a Cleric guildie in the zone heal him up and then he ran to NRo.  He came back and started throwing all sorts of obsenaties and insultes at my guildie and well, that's that.  So back to SolB.<br><br>We're in Lavasrotm at the SolB zone waiting for my guildie to come and summon out corpses.  Meri immeadiatly starts cussing out my guildie and finally says something along the lines of, &quot;I'll get my corpe back with the help of this faggot!&quot;  Then he stormed off into SolB alone and nude.  Come to think of it, I'm not sure if he ever got his corpse back.  And from what I gathered, he had lost a corpse not too long ago and that's why his gear sucked so bad, hehe.<br><br>But me and the Chanter got our corpses summoned and all was good after that.  And that's my story. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>--Gihmle Gearbungler51st Gnomish Channeler--<TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/10.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
