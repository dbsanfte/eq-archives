<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   1. Raid Announcements</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Often times, around 6pm est weekdays, everyone will start to log on and wonder what's going on. Unless it's a raid day (Thursdays and Saturdays) and nothing has been set, assume that it's an open night. Usually by 8pm est, a raid zone of choice would have been selected, if not carry on as you were before (xp, farming, trading etc). It all depends on what mobs are alive, what needs to be done (epic ganks, quests that requires a full raid force) and who we have online that will enable a raid force. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   2. Getting to the raid</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Often, if there's a raid, it will be in the guild's motd. (/guildmotd). Otherwise, check with the officers online, or members of the guild. In the guildmotd, there will be a time posted as to when the raid will take place. We expect everyone to be punctual. Getting late to a raid, means ending it late or not accomplishing what we have set out to do. Please read on &quot;porting to raids&quot; topic in this forum, it'll tell you how to get to raid locations through guild porters. <br>
<br>
Should you think that getting to the raid location will not be easy for you (eg: getting to ToV, crossing thru SG, WW), plan ahead, go in groups, go with someone that knows the way, someone that can cast invis on you, sow, levi, succor, whatever it takes to get to the raid location safely. Dying on the way to raid, is not going to help the raid and delay the Guild further. It should be noted that everyone must know the way to the raid location, learn it, because someday you may be the one that will have to lead a group of people to the raid location. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   3. Raid participation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Once a raid has been declared, the Guild expects full participation from everyone. Do note that if you are online during the said raid, without a valid excuse/consent of an officer, it will be taken notice. We try not to be military, but in order for any raids to be successful, we require everyone's participation. It's why raids are being announced in the first place, because the officers deemed that there are enough online to attend the raid, and expects everyone to be there.  <br>
<br>
There are times when you may not have enough time to attend the entire raid, the Guild would like to encourage you to attend, irregardless, just to get the raid kicking and going. It's for Guild morale. Do your part, but if you do need to go, nobody is going to stop you. Sure, we will miss you and what you bring to the raid, but this is EQ, real life issues and events are more important than EQ. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   4. Prepping for the raid</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Usually a raid is not a 1 hour deal. It's a raid, so be prepared to spend some time, that means getting the necessary amount of peridots, pearls, reagents, food and drink. Once you are at the raid, or at the entrance to the raid zone, it's a good habit for all casters to bind themselves there. A wipeout is possible, and if nobody bound themselves there, we're in for a long CR. This includes the guild porters as well. You'll never know you might be the only druid to port the entire raid out, and there are no wizards available to TL everyone out. <br>
<br>
Once you are at the raid zone, put LFG on. Some raids requires some group shuffling, but as we do more and more raids, we should know who will be the main tanks (MT), who are the clerics present, who are the chanters and who are the mages. Group up accordingly. Do not depend on the raid leader to make up groups for everyone! <br>
<br>
MT will have his/her own cleric, and so will the second assist. Sometimes either one of the assist will be assigned as a tank mezzer, so it's not a good idea to have them in the same group with only 1 cleric. If either one of them is assigned as the tank mezzer, its also good to have a backup healer in the group. More often than not, the MT and SA groups will be assigned by the raid leader. Also to note, there is no such thing as a KS group at a raid. Never ever forma  KS group. We are raiding and not trying to powerlvl a group of people. It's a selfish act. That means, if you're a caster, do not over nuke and aggro please, that means instant death to you, your healer and slows down the raid from killing a mob because of the potential &quot;ping pong&quot; it will cause. <br>
<br>
Start buffing once you are the raid location, there is nothing worse than to wait for everyone to be present and start buffing then. Buff as folks arrive, this will save on down time from medding. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   5. Leaving the Raid</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Once the raid is over, please make sure that you do have a way to get out of the dungeon/raiding zone. Send tells to the remaining druids or wizards, speak up or notify the guild who went LD, lost their corpse and such. The Guild will not abandon you unless its your fault that you did not speak up or secure yourself a TL/port out of there. <br>
<br>
Sometimes, there may not be enough porters (all druids and no wizards for TLs), those that has gate capability, use it. That includes gate potions. Which also means, please make sure that you do carry a gate potion around. It's handy, and not just for raiding purposes. Do not be selfish, and refuse to use your gate potion, sometimes we are deep in the dungeon, and fighitng out will just take too much time and requiring a druid to bind themself deep in the dungeon is not safe. This is where binding at the entrance to the dungeon or outside the dungeon is so helpful.  Caster classes that bound themselves at the zone entrance can gate to the zone entrance and wait for guild druids that bound themselves there.<br>
<br>

Hopefully this post will make us all be on the same page about how raiding works Odysseys style and make us more efficient about raiding. Please read all the other posts as well, as they contain good information on how this guild operates, from loots, to assisting, porting to raid locations and buffs. I will add more as I see what needs to be addressed, but currently these are some of the issues that needs to brought to attention, as we need to improve the way we are raiding. We need to be more efficient.  <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62453>Jaraan Stonebow</a><br><center><b>

One thing that always happens is there will be a certain amount of new people to the raid.  People that arent familiar with the zone, etc.  Listen close to the raid leader or the one the raid leader is depending on to get us thru a sticky situation.  Standing on the lil ol graphic couch could cause the whole zone to come down on us - and if you dont know, it's important to listen.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, when you are new to a raid area, or raid environment, understand that if you think we are being a bit harsh or loud in guildchat to get what needs to be done accomplished, we arent mad at you directly.  A lot of feelings can be hurt if you are sensitive enough, but it honestly isnt personal - it's VERY hard to get 45 people do do what you need them to do, to avoid breaking mez, to heal the right person, to listen up for loot, etc.  So if you do get your feelings hurt, as the raid leader or the person who upset you in tells after the raid, or maybe during a med break.  Chances are 200 to 1 that no one was mad at you, and we will really feel bad if we upset you.<br>
<br>
If we are in a new area and I'm on the raid, please always feel free to ask me about the area or maybe some hints.  One of the benefits of having played so long, is likely I've been there....and I'm always willing to help :)))<br>

<br>
Judging on how's it been lately with raiding, I think it's time we remind ourselves. What I'd like to stress on is, if there's a raid announced, that means officers have counted everyone present online, and has decided that the number of players available online will make the raid successful, therefore <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  GET YOUR HEAVY BUTT TO THE RAID ZONE NOW!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> because we'd like to get things done as quickly as possible and so that everyone can walk out with a kill, mission accomplished, and go back to your xp/trading/cyber/questing/tradeskills activities. <p><center><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~malousek/_uimages/JaraanSig.jpg>
