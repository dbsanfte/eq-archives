<br>
the matrix philosphy is some kind of mix up of a dozen of different philosophies, you could do pretty much what you want and say that its &quot;a part&quot; of the philosophy.<br>
<br>
I dont know if its really relevant to refer to the &quot;philosophy&quot; anyway, since at the end of the movie, morpheus neo and co finally understand the oracle is playing with them from the beginning.<br>
The only thing remaining is the fact that Neo can alter the matrix, making him unique. All the prophecy stuff was made up from the beginning. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=473215">Karenne Kharne<br>

Neo: Matrix dreams<br>
Trinity: Neo I swear if you start having seizures while playing and you think the Agents are coming to get you in real life, I'm outta here<br>
Link: Guys...you're late for the guild meeting<br>
<br>
*In Matrix*<br>
Niobe: These reports are the last transmition of Osirus before he got fed up and quit the game<br>
Ice: Another EQ expansion? Thats impossible. They havent even fixed the current shit.<br>
Morpheous: Why is that impossible? Another 29.99 from every man, woman, and child...that sounds exactly like the thinking of SoE to me.<br>
Niobe: So what do we do?<br>
Morpheous: We wait for a message from the Oracle<br>
Niobe: Morpheous...you know she doesnt post to Zionly Buisness anymore since we funded the board with ebay funds.<br>
<br>
*At the door*<br>
Door_guy01: Hail<br>
Door_guy01: Hail<br>
Door_guy01: Wtf...I cant target you. Who the hell are you?<br>
Agent_Smith: I have a trade for Neo...you see, he set me free<br>
Door_guy01: Yea sure...open a window. A sealed envelop? Wtf are you, some ghey RPer? Piss off.<br>

Neo: Get to the exits...SoE developers are coming...<br>
<br>
*Later, at the park*<br>
Neo: I got your message<br>
Oracle: Sorry about that...figured I had to throw you guys a bone...the little hint about the flagmaker<br>
Neo: How I can I trust you?<br>
Oracle: You can't. It's a pickle. On the one hand, all the stuff I promise might be added. On the other hand, I might just be stringing you guys along so you don't quit. It's all going to come down to choice.<br>
Neo: Choice?<br>
Oracle: Whether or not the majority of our playerbase choses WoW over this.<br>
<br>
*Agent Smith enters*<br>
Agent_Smith: Mr. Anderson...how good to see you<br>
Neo: I paid for a name change to escape my old rep...stop spreading that shit around<br>
Agent_Smith: I just wanted to thank you for setting me free from CSR. I've been bumped to developer status.<br>
Neo: gg.<br>
Agent_Smith: kkthx. I've come here to show you a new encounter I designed for you based on your feedback. The Ring of Smith.<br>
Neo: A ring event...wtf<br>
*Agent Smiths keep pouring in*<br>
Neo: When the hell do these start dropping loot? I've been fighting them for 4 hours. <br>
Agent_Smith: Didnt you know? The ring has reset 3 times since you started it due to bugs<br>
Neo: Fuck this<br>
Neo fades away<br>
<br>
*Later*<br>
Neo: Oracle said the flagmaker will spawn in this building at 7am. However, there's a euro guild that camps him constantly to cockblock other guilds from entering the Plane of the Central Mainframe.<br>
Trinity: They really need to randomize stuff like that<br>
<br>
*Later that night*<br>
Flagmaker: To enter the plane of CM, you'll have a 5 minute window to do a series of ring events. Failure to do things perfectly will result in event resets. The agents will be watching to make sure you dont exploit. You'll need to split your raid force up into 3 groups. The rest have to wait outside<br>
Morpheous: Er...where's Neo?<br>
Trinity: He said someone named Tigole wanted to show him something.<br>
<br>
*In the inner room*<br>
Neo: I fucking knew it. Plane of Central Mainframe B isnt finished yet.<br>
The CEO: That is correct.<br>
Neo: But the promises...the leaked uber loot...the months of development time...it was all lies?<br>
The CEO: Yes. The One's function was to merely goad the player base to continue spending their countless hours playing our game and making them strive for unfinished content. <br>
Neo: Wtf<br>
The CEO: Well you have two choices. To the right is the message boards. To the left is quitting the game. When you go through the right door, you will hand select 23 various things that need to be nerfed, retuned, or buffed. These 23 things will be added upon the launch of a rival MMORPG.<br>
*Neo starts to head towards the left door*<br>
The CEO: Er...the countless hours invested in your character...our eventual caving in to player whines...WoW will fail. You will cause the death of your guild.<br>
Neo: I'm sick of this shit. l8r.<br>
*Neo tries to open the door, but it opens the wrong way and smacks him*<br>
The CEO: Oops...we missed one. We'll add that to our door and grammar fix list.<br>

As we know, Smith says that when Neo destroyed him part of Neo imprinted on Smith, and he now displays even more human qualities. We also see Smith try to copy himself onto Neo, and Neo seems to get a form of an imprint, which manifests itself as his becoming slightly more machine like. He seems to understand/communicate with them better now apparently, in addition to being able to stop the sentinels in the real world (I still maintain there is no Matrix within the Matrix). Obviously this whole movie was about Choice, but I think from everything I've seen in Reloaded, that Revolutions will be about the relationship and inter-dependency between Humans and Machines. They make a big speech in the engine room of Xion with the Counselor and Neo talking about how humans need machines to survive and how machines need humans to survive etcetera, in addition to the relationship between Smith and Neo. IMO, they are going to end the next movie by getting the machines and humans to reconcile in a way and learn to co-exist. The only other thing I see that could be done is if they destroy the actual physical computer thing that houses the Matrix program in the real world, but this would be way too predictable and below the Brothers story-telling capabilities. Of course we could all be missing a 3rd choice, but when it comes down to it, as much as people argue back and forth over it, we're all gona just have to wait the 6 months to see Revolutions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jebnar>Jebnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/16/03 7:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Found this lil gem on the FoH Forums...</span><hr size=1> All too many of you need to go and watch the movie again if you missed that much of what was revealed.<br>

Personally I just see that as retarded but thats just me.<br>
<br>
As for the end where Neo stops the sentinels it can be one of 2 things, a) part of Agent Smith got imprinted on him b) there is something special about the one. Some basic thing within him that rejects the matrix, kinda like a sixth sense or something that not only allows him the freedom within the matrix but also a certain innate power against the machines. Or I could be just infected with X2 =x<br>
<br>
Agent Smith is also an anomally. When he walked up to Neo he was like just like before except something is different. I thought it was about their previous meeting in the first movie until the end when I realized it was about his previous incarnations. And he really has a hardon about Neo =x<br>
<br>
I really liked this movie, it was deep enough that it wasn't just mindless action (I'm waiting for July 2nd for that~ T3 baby) but it had that fucking ownage action scenes that we've come to know and love. The entire highway scene was just...well...fucking amazing.<br>
<br>
About the architect, was kinda funny. All that work was just you being led along on a chain. Neo is the reboot key. Insert him in the right place and boom, the matrix is remade slightly better than it previously was and so that 1% grows smaller, .9% or whatever. With enough reincarnations you can probably eliminate the rogue The One. Genetic Engineering~<br>
<br>
Zion just made me think when the previous One chose the 17 females and 6 males, he chose a lot of dark skinned people. Tho its funny during the &quot;club&quot; scene them dancing by pools of lava and then the counciler and neo in the engineering section and the counciler saying these machines keep us warm... =x I don't think keeping people warm is an issue but maybe thats just me. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477296">Kerai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
As far as the movie goes here is what I got from it:<br>
<br>
Agent Smith: could not serve his purpose and instead of getting destroyed he stuck around in the matrix. He also now has the ability to copy himself using anything that looks like a human. Sorta like how a Disc can copy itself to another disc. Remember he was the only one that Neo jumped into at the end of the first movie, the other two agents ran off. Agent Smith failed to copy himself onto Neo and Morpheus.<br>
<br>
Neo: Neo has new abilities that we have not seen before or saw very little of. He is very good at manipulating the world in the matrix. He is the 6th version of himself and although he believes he chooses his own destiny it appears that is not the case.<br>
<br>
Neo's out of the Matrix Abilities: Neo destroys/stops some sentinals that are following him and the crew. It appears that no one else has done this before or is capable of. Did Agent Smith leave something on Neo? If so why did this not affect Morpheus? Is Neo really human or is he a machine programmed to think he is a human that is out there to save mankind?<br>
<br>
We are introduced to a lot of programs created by the machines that supposively try to help the humans based on their own free will because it is their destiny and those that are the exact opposite. <br>
<br>
We are also told that a small percentage doubt the matrix and in order to keep those people in check a sub program was created to let those people think that they had a chance against the machines and saving mankind.<br>
<br>
Thats it for now, perhaps I will post later when I am not at work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treeslover>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1426<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/18/03 9:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix Spoilers</span><hr size=1> It was pretty clear to me that Neo is a machine.

Zion is around to control the one.  Once the one is found, he's given a mission to stop the war and free all their people.  In reality, the machines are in control because they have the ability to destroy zion (they have done it 5times already).   The one gets put into a position that he must choose to either return to the source, choose some people to go rebuild zion, and let the rest die (but preserving humanity).  The other choice is to return to the matrix and try to destroy it (in this case he saves trinity) but at any rate he didn't comply with the machines requests so they are going to try and destroy zion.  What I missed is exactly how the people connected to the matrix get killed because he didn't destroy the source yet.  <br>
<br>
The oracle is just a form of control, it all was.  The reason its so convincing is that all the programs are independent of each other (or at least act like they are).  So they talk like they are on your side, or mad at that other program, etc.  They are instead just doing their little part of a bigger job.  They try get that across to you in a couple places.  I'm trying to remember a couple quotes but they are escaping me atm.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why Neo has these special powers outside the matrix.  It might be a thing with Agent Smith. (that when Neo destroyed him instead of getting deleted somehow stuck around, and granted himself independance from the system)  The oracle hints at this being possible when she talks about ghosts/angels and stuff being old programs hiding.  Maybe he had the power all along but didn't know it.  Its not like they have alot of close contact with the machines in the &quot;real life&quot;.  I'm not sure, we'll find out in Revolutions I'm sure.<br>
<br>
I'm curious who the traitor is.  Is that the original traitor (kinda looks like him) and how is he working for the machines.  He programmed or what.<br>
<br>
I like the movie, its pretty deep and the architect thing really sheds alot of light on the whole ordeal.  I'm looking forward to the next one.  November is too far away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=atong>atong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/03 10:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix Spoilers</span><hr size=1> Agent Smith has become a virus or a chain mail in the system. Like the &quot;I love u&quot; thingy, just copy copy and never ends.<br>
<br>
In the end credit preview of Matrix 3, Oracle said to Neo that he had to stop &quot;him&quot; (I assumed that's Agent Smith because that's what the screen was showing) otherwise there would be no tomorrow. Was it because Smith would be coping himself over/on to so many human in the matrix that he would wipe out the population in matrix? (just like the purpose of a computer virus to a computer system)<br>
<br>
At the end of the movie, they showed that they saved a crew member from another ship. That's the one who got copied over by Smith before logging off the matrix right? The one who was trying to kill Neo in real world right? Did that mean there was a copy of Agent Smith in the real world too?<br>
<br>
And I think Neo has started to gain his special power in the real world (I don't like the matrix inside matrix theory). Maybe this is how he will be able to stop the machines and save Zion?<br>
<br>
And I didn't get what are those twins. You know, the twins body guards of the gate keeper (?). <p>----------<br>

Hmm, so much to speculate about, maybe Agent Smith stopped the sentinels because he wanted to assimilate Neo (as far as i can tell, he also gets the abilities of those he assimilate, probably not tho) but that would be weird because Neo goes into a comatous like state..<br>

-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
For your reading pleasure, a copy of the dialog between Neo and The Architect near the end of The Matrix: Reloaded<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Neo.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human, ergo some of my answers you will understand and some of them you will not. Concordantly while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize that it also the most irrelevant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why am I here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomoly which despite my sincerest efforts I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. WHile it remains a burden assiduously avoided it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you inexorably... here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You haven't answered my question.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite right. Interesting... that was quicker than the others.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now Neo's other selves in the monitors start asking all sort of questions, like &quot;Others? What others?&quot;, etc...<br>
<br>
&quot;The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomoly to the emergence of the next in which case this is the sixth version.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now the others Neo's start cursing and calling him a liar as we zoom into one of the Neos on the screen who says...<br>
<br>
&quot;There are either two possible explanations... either no one told me... or no one knows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomoly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now the other Neos start screaming &quot;You can't control me! I'm gonna smash you...&quot; etc...<br>
<br>
The camera again zooms into another Neo in the center screen...<br>
<br>
&quot;Choice. The problem is choice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art. Flawless. Sublime. A triumph equalled only by its monumental failure. The inevitablility of its doom as aparent to me now is a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus I redesigned it... based on your history. To more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However I was again frustrated by failure. I've since come to understand the answer alluded me because it required a lesser mind or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another... an intuitive program. Initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the Matrix... she would undoubtedly be its mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Oracle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please. As I was saying she stumbled upon a solution whereby 99 percent of all test subjects accepted the program as long as they were given a choice. Even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While thid answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory... systemic anomoly... That if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refuse the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is about Zion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are here because Zion is about to the destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existance eradicated.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bullshit&quot;... the other Neo also say &quot;Bullshit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Denial is the most predicatable of all human responses. But rest assured... this will be the 6th time we have destroyed it. And we have become exceedingly efficient at it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now there's Trinity fighting the Agent.<br>
<br>
&quot;The function of the One is now to return to the source allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the Matrix, 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash, killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You wont let it happen, you can't. You need huamn beings to survive.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Architect clicks his pen and the screens change to varioud human beings.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication, a contigent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific... vis-a-vis... love.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trinity.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She entered the Matrix to save your life, at the cost of her own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which brings us at last, to the moment of truth, where the fundamental flaw is ulimately expressed and the anomoly revealed as both beginning... and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and to the end of your species. As you eloquently put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason, and emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth... she is going to die and there's nothing you can do to stop it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo takes the door to the left, but stops before leaving as Architect says...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hope... it is the quinisential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We wont.&quot;<br>

<br>
Matrix within a matrix... it's plausible but not fitting.  You have to remember the audience and the nature of human beings.  We are rooting for zion, we want them to survive and win the war.  If it turned out that it was only a simulation... that would not be very fun for the audience.  So with that said, here's what I think is going to happen.<br>
<br>
Neo is a machine.  Whether a human/machine hybrid or just a really well designed machine that can't be detected as machine by the humans, I don't know.  He is a machine programmed to think like the humans, to help the humans, to destroy the matrix.  If you remember the first matrix movie, Morpheus describes the man as &quot;born inside the matrix, it is he who freed the first of us.&quot;  And if you've played enter the matrix, the oracle eluded to her being the mother and the architect being the father of Neo.  It would explain his powers within the matrix and probably the real world.<br>
<br>
With that said, here's what I think will happen in the 3rd movie.  If you think back to the first movie, Morpheus said that it was one AI that spawned a race of AIs, so the war/destruction of human civilization was caused by 1 AI that was made by humans.  Neo is going to end up saving Zion, and it will be a machine made by machines that felt love for a human that ends up saving the humans.  Oh the irony of it all would be way too good.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.evie.org" target="top">Evie</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maldanonvaz>Maldan On Vaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/03 7:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> matrix</span><hr size=1> I gotta agree with ya on that Evie, seems like what would happen.<br>
