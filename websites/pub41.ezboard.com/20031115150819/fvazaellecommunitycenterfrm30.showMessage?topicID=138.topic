<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. troops are facing a classic guerrilla war in Iraq (news - web sites), spearheaded by Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) loyalists, and American forces need to adapt their tactics to crush this increasingly organized resistance, the head of U.S. Central Command said on Wednesday.   <br>
<br>
This contrasted with an assessment given by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on June 30 that it was not &quot;anything like a guerrilla war or an organized resistance.&quot; <br>
<br>
But Central Command chief Gen. John Abizaid, who commands American forces in Iraq, said a guerrilla war is exactly what U.S. troops are confronting. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think describing it as guerrilla tactics being employed against us is, you know, a proper thing to describe in strictly military terms,&quot; Abizaid said in a Pentagon (news - web sites) briefing. <br>
<br>
Abizaid, who replaced the retiring Gen. Tommy Franks at the helm of Central Command earlier this month, also said U.S. troops should be prepared for yearlong deployments in Iraq, a staple of the Vietnam War but used only rarely since then. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think if you look at contemplating keeping the force structure stable for a while, until the security situation improves, that yearlong employments or deployments are possible for certain units ... So we've done it before and we can do it again,&quot; Abizaid said. <br>
<br>
He said U.S. forces are battling remnants of Saddam's Baath Party throughout Iraq, with various cells of six to eight resistance fighters &quot;receiving financial help from, probably, regional level leaders.&quot; He said there was &quot;no evidence of central command.&quot; <br>
<br>
The general also said there was &quot;a lot of information that indicated that there were significant terrorist groups and activities,&quot; including from the group Ansar al-Islam and perhaps elements of al Qaeda. He said there were foreign fighters in &quot;not significant numbers.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mid-level officials of Saddam's government, including from the old intelligence and security agencies and the Special Republican Guard, &quot;have organized at the regional level in cellular structure, he said. They &quot;are conducting what I would describe as a classical guerrilla-type campaign against us. It's low-intensity conflict in our doctrinal terms, but it's war however you describe it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Lawrence Di Rita, Rumsfeld's chief of staff and acting chief Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that whether or not the &quot;guerrilla&quot; label is apt is &quot;almost beside the point&quot; and an &quot;academic discussion.&quot; <br>
<br>
Abizaid said resistance forces are better coordinated, more sophisticated and &quot;less amateurish.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The level of resistance, I'm not so sure I would characterize it as escalating in terms of number of incidents. But it is getting more organized and it is learning. It is adapting -- it is adapting to our tactics, techniques and procedures. And we've got to adapt to their tactics, techniques and procedures,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
A senior defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said &quot;there's a zillion upsides&quot; to yearlong deployments from the perspective of commanders, but there is concern about keeping troops in the all-volunteer U.S. military away from their families for so long. <br>
<br>
Some U.S. troops in Iraq have complained publicly about the uncertainty of when they are returning home. Rumsfeld testified last week that the entire 3rd Infantry Division definitely would be back home by September. But officials backtracked this week, saying the goal was to bring them home sometime this fall, hopefully September, depending on security conditions. </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
At least Central Command chief Gen. John Abizaid, Commander of American forces in Iraq, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>seems</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to have more balls than his predecessor.  <br>
<br>
Now, how many sniper shots, rpg's, and bombings taking out American soldiers does it take before Rumsfield admits the truth?<br>

The military campaign is likened to a kind of swamp or marsh in which the warring nation is unable to remove itself. <br>
<br>
Typically, a quagmire situation occurs when a major power attempts with little success to subdue a foreign guerrilla insurgency. Often matters of national pride or belief in military invincibility are the cause of the lack of an exit strategy. The classic examples of quagmires were the American involvement in the Vietnam War and the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It is often humorously suggested that the best way to resolve the military impasse associated with a quagmire is to simply &quot;declare victory and go home.&quot; <br>

In both cases you've mentioned, the Major powers were attempting to force governments that were terribly unpopular (S. Vietnam), or outright Puppet governments (Afghanistan).  <br>
<br>
  Considering at this point most of the guerilla forces in the country are not popularly supported by the populace, I don't see them being successful in the long run.  <br>
<br>
  Now.. if the United States should attempt to prop up some puppet government rather than allowing the populace to vote for their own, I can see it going to hell in a handbasket real quick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammerique>Ammerique</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 535<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/03 3:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Quagmire</span><hr size=1> Hahaha, surely you can't be serious?

I think that the government we install will be fundamentally democratic in nature, and thus will be the type of government we want, but the people will choose who actually fills the positions.<br>

<br>
We will try to set up an environment that is conducive to democracy, but in the end, we will not choose who serves in elected office, the Iraqi people will.  We can and should try to influence it so that as enlightened a government as possible is chosen, but we shouldn't and won't actually choose the government.<br>

<br>
You can't just go into a country with no history of democracy and just expect to set one up in a couple years. Especially with the amount of resistance to it. So either Bush will end it eventually and it will probably flop or the next person elected in will end it quietly. In the lower percentile of probability, the US is successful, then you wage another war (Iran, Syria, N. Korea...take your pick.) Judging with Afghanistan, what the US puts in will flop...if they get that far. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477296">Kerai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
