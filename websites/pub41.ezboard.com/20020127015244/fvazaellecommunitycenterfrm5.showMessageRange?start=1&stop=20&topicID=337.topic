IV gets bashed on for killing mobs and not giving a guild that arrived sooner a second chance, well.... SF once threatened to do that to Agony if they failed upon trak, The Endless races to mobs they know others have scheduled... I once saw Endless try to race IV to trak, we all know about it, now Endless had 12 people down there, one cleric, and IV arrived with a full squad, prepeared to kill trak... IV got a ton of shit for walking past 12 people, basically saying you can call mobs camped... However there have been several times when TE has done it, Like for example when PO was trying VS.... PO dies twice, TE walks in and kills VS, gives up half the loot... i don't hear PO complaining about that, but it's the same issue as IV offering PO all loot except CT in fear... but you dont' hear about that... why do you not hear about this when you hear about the whole fear issue and refusing IV the right to fight a mob PO didn't even have a shot at...?<br><br>IMO IV gets trashed because they have 100x more chances to &quot;gank&quot; mobs from other guilds, if SF or PO was on top, they would get crap for it too, solely because they were the top guild.<br><br>So all you level 30's that read about an issue instead of being there, stop posting, you just look stupid la~<br>(This goes for people in other guilds that wern't there as well, you can't hear one side of the issue and talk like you know, solely based on what a 'friend' told you.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ustiletto13.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stiletto13</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 1:28:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a few fyi's</span><hr size=1> <br>The cool thing about anonymous posters is that they can say anything they want - consequence free.<br><br>The really cool thing about this particular one is that the poster diseminates absolutely inaccurate information while under the pretense of dispelling &quot;rumors&quot;.<br><br>I think that you might find that the reason IV gets bashed so much on this board is because they piss a lot of people off.  I understand that this concept might be difficult to comprehend, but it makes perfect sense if you actually sit and wonder about people's motivations to post here. <br><br>Let me try to explain it for our cerebrally underprivileged audience.  If IV wants it, they take it.  This bothers some people.  <br>I'll break it down further into little bits that can be easily interpreted:<br>The part that bothers people that aren't as &quot;uber&quot; is that they don't have a chance to kill the mobs that they have waited 50+ levels for a chance to kill just because they don't necessarily live, eat, sleep, breathe EQ.  In fact, it doesn't even matter if they are there to kill the mob first, if they can't be as efficient as IV.  No, you don't get a second try.  No, you don't even necessarily get a first try...  You should have quit your job/dumped your girlfriend to get to level 60 faster if you wanted to have those shots.  I think we all agree that is a completely valid argument.<br><br>The part that bothers people who have a natural aversion to hypocrisy is that a scant few months ago, IV member Befb decided to flame Sacred Fires for something that guild did which was mild by comparison (see thread entitled &quot;I don't usually rant&quot;). <br><br>The part that bothers people trying to have fun is that they might be forced into a situation where IV will offer the scraps from their guild table in the most demeaning, patronizing fashion because IV negotiates from a &quot;position of strength&quot;  ie. they don't give a fuck, because they don't have to.  &quot;Hey I went on my first Fear raid today and it was fun... another guild killed everything and I hung around and waited until I could loot the corpses.  What a thrill.&quot;<br><br><br>The part about your rant that bothers *me* is that your argument is comprised of blatant misleading &quot;facts&quot; and lacks any verity, whatsoever.  My advice to you sir, not that you'd take it, is to get your own facts straight and stop projecting your lack of knowledge on everyone else.  <br><br>-iboneg<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukaziqueal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 477<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 1:48:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a few fyi's</span><hr size=1> It's all about the spin you put on it. I could take any argument against IV and turn it around only to have it respun the next post by someone else. I remember that SF incident when I was in PO. The spin that was chosen for it was that SF outright ganked our schedueled Naggy when it was them that told us of the imminent server down (about 10 seconds before he was schedueled by us on this board). When the fighting broke out SF was made to look very bad when in fact PO was just as underhanded (if not more so) in the whole affair.<br><br>Most of us in IV realize this and now avoid these flames. If you want to talk to me about anything at all, do it in game. I won't do it here for the amusement of the rest of the server who have nothing to do with it. Nor will I feed the lowlifes that live off of these flames as the highlight of their days. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvehn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 454<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 2:05:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a few fyi's</span><hr size=1> I think the last thing we want is for anonymous posters to talk to for us.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukruizigrrl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KruiziGrrl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 6:21:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ^^</span><hr size=1> in EQ lingo:<br><br>           &gt;<br>               &gt;<br>iboneg           &gt;  osobearoso<br>               &gt;<br>           &gt;<br><br><br><br><br>i'm lvl 0.<br>yeah let the patricians of EQ speak ... like Kaziqueal and Vehn *COUGH* LOL<br><br>iboneg for prezzzz! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubrogaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brogaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 8:04:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ^^</span><hr size=1> I dont know who you are Osobearoso but your facts are all messed up.
