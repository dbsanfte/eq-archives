I've really got my heart set on a German Shepherd Dog.  They are about the most beautyifull dogs, and sound very much like the perfect breed.  however, I live in an apartment currently, and am unsure if shepherds can deal with it.  <br>

There are a couple in my building that seem to get along just fine. <br>
<br>
I'd just research the crap out of whatever breed you plan to get so that you know what to expect (if you find a mix you want, look up both breeds!). I would have been in for some big surprises with my puppy if I hadn't been prepared.  The official akc.org and breed pages don't have the space to really tell the whole story, but you can find out alot about what it's like to live with a particular breed by looking into the smaller pages and F.A.Q.s. You'll also want to find out if the breed you go with is genetically inclined towards any medical problems (I know overbreeding in German Shepherds has caused some problems with their hips), or weird little behavioral ticks (my pup's breed has ALOT of these), etc. <br>
<br>
But big yay for dogs!

border collies however are alittle on the hyper side, super sweet, not a yappy dog tho, just a bundle of energy<br>
australian shepards decended from dingos, alittle bit of a temper sometimes, but easily managed<br>
blue heelers are just a nice smart pretty layed back dog, but they like to heel you like cattle when they are puppies, not too bad, just invest in some boots...hehe<br>
dalmations arent the brightest in my experience with them...<br>
rat terriors are very small dogs, sometimes if the mom is yappy, the puppies might be too, very adorable, EXTREMELY lovable, wont stop being lovable sometimes....bundle of energy, long or short hair, very smart for their size, which is down to teacup size.<br>

Some apartments have size and breed restrictions, and if there are breed restrictions, often German Shepherds will be on the list (they are at my place, and a couple of other places I looked at). Its an unfair restriction, assuming that just because they CAN be trained as an attack dog, that the breed in general is aggressive, which is BS, pet peeve of mine, rage, ahem, but it is sometimes there regardless, and you'll want to find out before you get the puppy.<br>
<br>
German shepherds are also on the top ten list for intelligence, so you shouldn't feel like you're selling yourself short (although I disagree with Yos that its Border Collies, Austrailian Shepherds, Blue Heelers, most lists I've seen have been Border Collies at #1, with some order of Poodle and Golden Retriever afterwards, but who wants a poodle? ew.). But really, as far as training goes, if you figure out your strategy before you get going, it should go quickly regardless. Bigger dogs will be easier to housetrain simply because the &quot;storage space&quot; is greater (you can train a poodle to do every trick in the book, but if you don't get home in time, it'll still piddle on the floor). They're a dominant breed though, so you need to let them know who the leader of the pack is from the very start. Shibas are a dominant breed too, and its taken constant reminders since I got mine in October to keep him aware of the fact that he's not the boss of me (he's not!!), but even as he recognizes me as in charge, he immediately challenges anyone else who walks through the front door. It is so much easier to train a dog who acknowledges you as the boss, especially when you're dealing with a dominant breed (watch out if you get the leader of the puppy pack of a dominant breed!).<br>
<br>
On a side note, woo for border collies! My best friend has two, and they're awesome dogs, totally living up to their title as the smartest breed (although her sister has one that's dumb as a rock, the poor thing). They both live in houses with large yards however, and even with that, they require a good deal of walking, as they're very energetic dogs. The breed in general is also rather prone to chasing cars (as a result of the keen attention to motion innate to breeders), which pretty much means unless you have the time and energy to devote very early on, in most cases, you're not going to wind up with a dog you can have off of a leash in an unenclosed area. My friend's mom is a teacher, so she had the summer to devote to training the one pup, and he's very attentive, but the second dog was a rescue pup, and didn't receive much of any training in her first two years, and as a result, routinely escapes the yard and runs. The fact that they're so intelligent also makes them somewhat more difficult to train -- they'll understand you, to be sure, but they may just decide to ignore you. But they're so fun, it makes the extra work worth it.  <br>
<br>
Dogs are just so fun, and we're a batch of dog owners on this board. Me, Khal&amp;Dem, Relik, Yos, Fleek, Sin, Split, Erz, c'mon out of the woodwork, I know there's more than that! You'll have more advice than you ever wanted (and possibly do already!).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upyanfir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyanfir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Firestarter</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#0033FF>(3/5/02 2:11:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fcriterionfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=322.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I wanna get a dog</span><hr size=1> hehe, If you ever want to know about sighthounds, I'm the girl with the answers there ...<br>

I think I've got my heart set on the GSD (btw, Saji is a cool name), although the Siberian Husky and Australian Shepherd are not entirely out.  I don't think I'll have enought rumping room for a Border Collie, although they look to be fine poochies.  Also, I think Shibas look like adorable teddy bears.<br>
<br>
I just hope German Shepherds are inherantly cat eaters.  I'd be in trouble if our cat became a snack.<br>
<br>
Our Apartment lease states &quot;There currently is not weight limit.&quot;  Which is pretty kick ass.  I thought something was up since I've seen someone walking a big old white GSD and some sort of medium sized retreiver type.  My only obstacle is convincing my GF she wants a puppy NOW (well, the spring).<br>
<br>
What's the deal with crate training?  Do you stick your widdle puppy in a big crate for the day (seems kinda mean when the kitty gets free reign)?  I'm trying to figure out the best arrangement for a puppy until it becomes house/apartment trained.<br>
<br>

Or maybe he is pretty smart, but he'll do things just to spite us. For instance, when we say &quot;Max, wanna go outside?!&quot; his little ears get perky and that little head cocks to the side, and then he takes off for the front door. He'll do his thing outside and come in just as happy as before. BUT, he loves being outside when we let him, so if he knows we're leaving him home he'll do his thing on the floor while we're gone just because. He is great with kids and people in general. He even gets along with the cat, although it's hilarious to see that our cat is bigger than the dog now! But they play great together. We tried to train Max to be in his kennel when we're gone, but it didn't work very long. Dogs generally won't &quot;go&quot; where they sleep, but Max always did. He was just a puppy when we tried this so maybe it was fright or something, but I'm really hoping we can kennel train him when we move.

ive heard of them being pretty decent smart, but these dogs she had were just incredibly stupid and never understood anything, except how to pull you behind it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
strong as anything and fun to pull you in a sled! hehe<br>
<br>
if your looking for a doggie that can follow you anywhere you go without being on a leash, ive seen poodles do it,any herd dog does it.<br>
<br>
hunting dogs are taught to be roamers however and will usually need to be on a leash, BUT not always, my brothers dog is an english setter (highly recommended, very sedate)  it stays with you pretty well, but easily distracted, LOVES their cats too.<br>
greyhounds ive seen do it tho, they are also hunting dogs, not many people know, but they are used for hunting, and even killing wolves, too fast and skinny for the wolves to fight back, ive heard they can be mean dogs tho, but ive only met very sweet ones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
hehe im a doggie fanatic if you cant tell, i love all doggies, these are just my experiences with certain breeds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
oooh, and english bull dogs are very very sweet doggies however many fight stories youve heard.....haha<br>
rottweilers are actually extremely sweet dogs too, but are too easily turned into aggressive guard dogs from their size, and they are most likely to get the pure bred disease, rage syndrom.  thats what happens when you hear these freak accidents where the owners are shocked and amazed and the dog even turns on them.  so maybe not a great idea.<br>
<br>
wolves.  yes you can have a wolf, or actually part wolf as a pet.  you have to know how to train the dog in a positive way, or it will turn on you.  they can be your best friend if you do it right, but you just cant punish them.  it doesnt care about other dogs or distractions, will only pay attention to you, will follow you everywhere like you are the pack leader, it can be playful and cute, but you gotta have alot of patience, and they have to be put down around the age of 12 because they will turn on you.<br>
smarter than any real dog you can have.  almost scary smart.  i know a breeder if your interested, i dont know if i can get ahold of him now, its been a few years.<br>
<br>
ok well sorry about the novel i just wrote, i LOVE doggies, and these are most of the dogs ive had experience being around, and or training.<br>
ill take a pic of my doggie, and my brothers english setter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
it will be cute, they love each other hehe. <p><img src="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/affliction/plague.gif" title="I am Plague.

<br>
Owned an Australian shepard.. it was a great dog, kid friendly.  Not quite as big as a German shepard.  (full German Shepards are huge)<br>
<br>
German sheards once about 6 months old are a little big in an apartment.  Which means stuff gets knocked over alot.<br>
<br>
the dog i have now is a huge mutt. (Lab,chow,rot, and german shepard)  it was also the runt which makes a huge difference.  He isnt the sharpest knife in the drawer, heck he makes Max look like a genius, but it often is an advantage.  His timidness made it easy to train him to stay on the tile floors.  He isnt smart enough to figure out how to go up stairs.  He hasnt had any real chewing issues.<br>
<br>
also owned a Pitbull.  That was my favorite dog, but by far our most dangerous.  He never hurt any people, but no matter how nice anyone says their pitbull is, the instincts are still there.  He was a great guard dog,  all of about 10 people were able to go in the gate to out back yard, however, if you came out the back door to the house then Buster wouldnt care.  He was very playful and a real social dog.  His biggest problem was hunting instincts, while it was funny to watch him hunt squirrels(which he was a pro) it became less humorous when neighbors started losing cats :P<br>
<br>
<br>
anyhow, those are my experiences.<br>

we found him in Max's mouth once or twice. Max didn't realize that Jinx was too tiny to play back. <br>
<br>
But now that Jinx is the size he is (in the newest pic), he makes Max whine and yelp. It's hilarious!!!  <p><br>
