Been playing various P&P RPG's, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Super Hero variants for 20+ years myself.  Have GM'd as well as been a spectator.  Contrary to our friend Highlandermojo, I enjoy matching wits with a GOOD Gm and the challenges that having a thinking mind on the other side of the table can bring to a good campaign.  It was my love for those games that brought me to the computer variants.  Sorry Highlander, but a good "human" GM'd campaign is like reading a great novel or series.  It evokes your OWN imagination as to the surroundings, the background, the story line, and it makes you think.  <br><br>I am very fond of riddles and as a GM I encorporated a lot of those things into my campaigns, givings hints to the answer during some part of the adventure and then springing the riddle on the players later on.  Also, having a human GM means you aren't going to die to some stupid computer generated error and have some Game GM tell you "Sorry thats a feature, we can't help you with that".<br><br>Plus I have seen and been a part of some of the most imaginative and fun roleplaying you could ever imagine. <p><table>  <TR><TD width=112 rowSpan=4><A href="http://www.eqraid.org"><IMG height=80 src="http://www.eqraid.org/ciw.gif" width=100 border=0></A></TD><TD width=417><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B><A href="http://www.eqraid.org/ciw-db/profile.php?profile=Daraden">Daraden Ironfang</B></A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD width=417><FONT face=Verdana size=2><b><A href="http://www.eqraid.org">Clan Icewind</A> Member</b></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD width=417><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>Level 57 Myrmidon</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD width=417><FONT face=Verdana size=2><a href="http://homepages.internetconnect.net/~anson357/"><b>Portraits  by Daraden</b></a><b> - </b>Zebuxorux</FONT></TD></TR></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uazaule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azaule</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/95/1892695.JPG BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(5/30/01 1:09:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/86/1897386.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paper and Pencil RPGS</span><hr size=1> I have been playing paper RPGs for a long time, almost 10 years now. Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Marvel Super Heroes were my games of choice. I enjoy paper RPGs very much because of the role-playing aspect and chance to act. I had been involved in a AD&amp;D campaign that went on from high school well into college. Always playing with the same friends and same world. As time passed some of us had lives to start living and left little time for gathering and playing around a kitchen table <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . So then EQ came out and now we could group and make new adventures in a different world. Now I have to admit the level of actual role-playing in this game makes me sick at times but again it's still fun to hang with friends and make new friends. Having an actual human GM is amazing when you have someone with a good imagination. And like Daraden said &quot;a good &quot;human&quot; GM'd campaign is like reading a great novel or series&quot;. If you never never liked any of the paper RPGs you were exposed to you might be an hack and slash type player. And EQ is basically hack and slash any way you look at it. I have some friends I played RPGs with for years who have that mentality and there was never anything wrong with that, those same friends are awesome EQ players and have accomplished things I think I never will. No matter what I prefer good ole' paper and pen to computer RPGs any day, but still EQ is so convenient :P<br><br> <p>Azaule Singingfox<br>Level <font color=green>55</font> Bard<br><font color=red>The Sixstring Samurai of The Zebuxoruk</font><br> <CENTER><IMAGE SRC="http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/95/1750495.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ullewyndesperado.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llewyn Desperado</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(5/30/01 6:50:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paper and Pencil RPGS</span><hr size=1> I played several different types of these.
