Did you even bother considering what I posted before you responded?<br>
<br>
Let's clarify something:  The US was not at war with Germany until December 11th, 1941. Funny thing about the fact that trade between nations is only completely cut off when war is declared, idn't it?<br>
<br>
However, the Lend-Lease Act of 1941 was specifically written to supply war materials to Britain and China.  It was later expanded to include the USSR, which wasn't included originally thanks to sanctions in place in response to the USSR's invasion of Finland in 1939.  <br>
<br>
Off the top of my head, I can name weapon systems that went to Britain and Russia...but i don't remember any of them going to any of the Axis powers.  <br>
<br>
Buffalo fighter...Britain<br>
Aircobra fighter...Russians loved 'em, Americans didn't<br>
M3 Medium tank...also known as the Lee<br>
M5 Light Tank...also known as the Stuart<br>
<br>
Plus, the US also gave mothballed WW1 destroyers to the Brits.<br>
<br>
So, while I can't deny that the US traded war materials to both sides, I'd say that the amount traded to the eventual United Nations substantially dwarfed the amount that went to the Axis powers. <br>
<br>
So, Kerai, my question is, exactly what war materiel did the US ship to Germany?  Be specific, please. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=187084"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Colphax Moonleaf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
15/04/1939 : President Roosevelt seeks assurances from Germany and Italy that they would not attack another European country. However, such assurances were not forthcoming. Hitler and Mussolini knew that Roosevelt’s hands were tied by the 1935-1937 Neutrality Acts, which forbade the USA from giving help to either side in the event of war.<br>
 <br>
04/11/1939 :<br>
 Although President Roosevelt has declared American neutrality in the war in Europe, a Neutrality Act is signed that allows the US to send arms and other aid to Britain and France. <br>
<br>
10/06/1940 : President Roosevelt announces a shift from neutrality to &quot;non-belligerency,&quot; while condemning Germany and Italy and promising material aid to both Britain and France. <br>
<br>
03/09/1940 : The US Congress finally agrees to the handing over of 50 old destroyers in return for 99 year leases of British Naval bases in Antigua, St. Lucia, Trinidad, British Guiana the Bahamas, Jamaica and Argentia. <br>
<br>
29/12/1940 : Roosevelt tells Americans: &quot;We must be the great arsenal of the democracies.&quot; <br>
<br>
10/01/1941 : Roosevelt introduces his 'Lend Lease' bill to the House of Representatives as House Resolution 1776 (H.R. 1776), after recognising that neither Britain or China could continue paying indefinitely for material supplied. This allowed the fighting allies to pay the USA back in kind, but after the war. He likened this to 'lending a neighbour a garden hose to put out a fire'. <br>
<br>
25/05/1941 : German Navy Chief, Admiral Raeder warns that US convoying of British war supplies would be considered an act of war. <br>
<br>
01/08/1941 : Roosevelt stops US oil supplies to the ‘aggressors’. <br>
<br>
13/11/1941 : President Roosevelt announces the arming of American merchant vessels carrying Lend-Lease cargo to Britain. The US Congress and Senate, vote by a small majority to repeal the 1939 Neutrality Act. <br>

I simply disagree that Russia could have fought of the German's without America entering the war.  The Germans were a few measely miles from Moscow when the Russians sent several divisions from the eastern side of Russia to Moscow for the it's defense.  I find it highly unlikely that Russia could have done that if the americans (along with the british) had not been putting pressure on japan in the asian theatre.  I also fail to see how Russia could have made it without america supplies and allied 24 hour bombing of the german infastructure.  Add to this the fact that britian (and later the US) had wittled down the german airforce significantly.  Germany never had to concour every single city of a country to take it over (only the powerbases).  Once Paris fell, france fell.  The same would have been true (in all likelihood) of russia in regards to Moscow.  It's possible Stalin could have fled and commanded from exile but the command stucture, one Moscow fell, would have been all fucked up and I believe Germany would have rolled them after that.<br>

Beating an army is what an army does but history has proven time and time again that they're not that succesful in holding and maintaining a country or conquered land with inhabitants..<br>

I will agree with you on this point.  Hitler's empire was ultimately doomed.  Even if he had concoured Russia there is no way a dictatorship could last for decades (not one that large anyway).  Even a large dictatorship like Russia, fell after decades of corruption and a poor economic model (communism).  So, even if Hitler had managed to secure all of europe (which is possible in my mind), I agree it wouldn't have lasted in the after war.<br>
