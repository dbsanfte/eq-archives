!!! ;)</span><hr size=1> I'm beginning to think that Yosha is actually Birch in disguise in this thread. <br>
I give up here. I was trying to inject your thinking with a little objectivity Yosha, but like most other <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS[/B} and yes I mean YOU! You hide behind your book, and you summarily dismiss anyone else's opinion that doesn't jvie with your way of thinking. <br>
You're a sheep. No, you're not one of Jesus's little lambs, you are simply a sheep being led around with a leash and force fed dry grain mixed with excrement. I'm not sorry if I offend you here. You have done enough to take what seemed like a nice discussion between a number of people with their own beliefs who could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> objectively</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> view that other people's beliefs may differ from theri own. <br>
Ultimately, that is what makes humans special after all. We have our own thoughts, our own feelings, our own beliefs. We can be whatever we want to make ourselves. You can say what you want and try to tell me &quot;No, you are what you are because God made you that way.&quot; In a way, you'd be correct, but you wouldn't really understand why. <br>
My religion is this: Be kind to others. Try to understand how they feel. Try not to judge people until you have had a chance to learn something about them. If you disagree with someone, try to see their side of things, while asking that they try to see yours. <br>
I guess it's just as simple as that. No, true Islam is not based on hate. I don't believe that anymore than I believe true Catholicism is based on guilt or true Christianity is based on following Jesus' every word to the letter. <br>
Couple more thigns to say then I'm all done here. <br>
Yosha, you really prove your ignorance when you talk about the Israeli-Arab conflict. Yes, it is a battle for land. Ok you are right. Why do you think they are fighting over these couple of small pieces of land that would be worthless otherwise to either faction? These are lands surrounding a site that is considered holy to two different religions. High ranking officials in each party would like to sieze control of it. Again, the politicians take religion and use it to whip their followers (in this case, the Arab Israelis on one side, and the Israeli Jews on the other) into a fervor of religious fanaticism, each side claiming divine right to govern that specific plot of land. There is NO other reason for them to be fighting over this land. Both tribes live in a state with already established guidelines. Israel will NOT get any bigger or smaller no matter who claims control of the contested areas. There is no oil in that little space. No diamonds. Nothing of any real monetary worth or anything else that warring people fighting over <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> land</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would want.<br>
It's all about religion. <br>
My final word on this: from what I understand, Yosha, Christianity, as Jesus supposedly taught it, has a lot to do with humility. You should learn some. Maybe someone will actually take you seriously then. Right now, you just sound like a spoiled child that isn't getting the candy. Bearing that thought in mind, I hereby disengage myself from this discussi</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utryunn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tryunn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.spazzmania.com/Ohtrux/A.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/24/02 2:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=324>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !!! ;)</span><hr size=1> BTW, sorry, I screwed up an EZ code in that last post.

I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> hate</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people that do that, with a passion. I like when people state their religion and are willing to comment objectively on it. Not insult others because that one of their religion did something idiotic.

I feel the need to repeat this because each time I say it, you don't understand. Where you see the insulting christianity from the above I don't know. Now please, stop insulting other religions before you look like more of a fool. <p>Kerai Cookies<br>

<br>
  Some people say religion was created to control the masses, to gain power, etc.  Off the top of my head I can only think of one religion that was created for that purpose (scientology, created by a science fiction writer in order to get rich, which he admitted to Isaac Asimov during a meeting in the 1940's).  The vast majority of religions came into being to provide answers to questions the people had at the time.  The 'creators' of those religions did not have any idea of controlling large populations with them, they merely found something they believed and taught it to others.  That does not imply that their beliefs were true then or are true now, but there was certainly no vast plan for global domination.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The god of the gaps&quot; is what most western peoples believe in today, and they call it christianity or catholicism or unitarianism or anything else they like.  The beliefs of the past which were previously governed by theology get gradually subsumed by the application of the scientific method in order to determine the causes of something rather than simply defining the cause to be supernatural (gods).  This has greatly altered the beliefs of the more popular religions, because in order to remain popular a connection to the modern lives of its believers must be established.  Note that I say the beliefs of the followers have been altered, not that 'sacred' writings had been altered.  While alterations in the bible have occurred, most of them were during the very early formative years of christianity and others were due to translation.<br>
<br>
  Many people claim their beliefs are based on the bible, or some other set of writings that their particular religion holds as sacred.  Their predecessors several hundred years ago would have said the same thing, yet if the two met they would find so many differences in their beliefs that they would probably wind up fighting a land battle in the middle east.  How can both the modern believer and the past beleiver be correct? The answer is that neither are correct. Their beliefs were not based ENTIRELY on their particular scripture, but on the culture they were born into and like it or not our modern culture is heavily based on science and the benefits of rigorous application of the scientific method.  Call yourself christian if you like, or methodist or whatever, but be reconciled that your ancestors would call you a heretic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uyoshamendel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YoshaMendel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/24/02 5:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=328>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/arvcondor/radioactivejewman.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !!! ;)</span><hr size=1> lmfao, tryrunn did you even read what i had to say like three posts ago? i said that i haven't insulted any religion besides islam. i think what everyone else has tro beleive is fine, i was pointing out waht 2 individual groups had to say. god youre an idiot. this discussion from the start was never about religion, it was abuot people bashing christianity with no one else to defend. i come to defend and all of a sudden im a zealot. funny how that works...<br>
also if you knew a fuck about what happened after WWII in 1948, you would know about the original israeli palestine conflict and how it was COMPLETELY about land. please don't call me ignorant when it seems i know more about this than you :-\<br>
and don't tell me what the koran says either, you said it doesnt deal with violence/hate. stfu, yes it does, ive seen the words in their holy book myself.<br>
please show me where ive said a single bad word aobut any other faith besides islam (atheism isn't a faith). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/24/02 6:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=329>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !!! ;)</span><hr size=1> PLease guys quit talkin to this Yosha person so it will go away and stop ruining this thread.

In fact there are many christians who posted their beliefs in this thread. I don't have a problem with your religion or the way you choose to follow it, but I do have a problem with you insulting other religions. Islam is not violent, I know many muslims and I can tell you, they are not violent, they are as violent as christians are.

I've decided to join a religion. I'm joining the Church of the SubGenius. I will, from this point on follow the teachings of the venerable J.R. &quot;BOB&quot; Dobbs only. He is my master. <br>
&quot;BOB&quot; is always right, and &quot;BOB&quot; tells me to embrace slack! YES! That is what I shall do! SLACK NOW! SLACK FOREVER! ALL HAIL BOB! HAIL ERIS! ALL HAIL DISCORIDA! Down with all the false prophets I say. Down with Jesus! Down with Muhammed! They all, in their own time, shall see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer! I will not be turned away from my mission: To convert each and every one of you into a true SubGenius sucker, er, customer! That's right! For a small fee, you too can join the the SubGenius! If you would like to learn more, post here your email address and then I will send you an email with a post office box number where you may send a self addressed stamped envelope, and a check for $39.90. Please allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery of your official SubGenius Kit complete with authentic looking badge and gun, and book full of inspirational quotes lovingly plagiarized from the old Bazooka  Joe (TM) bubblegum wrappers! <br>
<br>
I do hope that you will all join me in Texas on the day the X-Ists come to take us away in their pleasure ships. We will be the singers of the songs then, my friends. We will be the dreamers of the dreams!<br>
<br>

<br>
*cough*No*cough*<br>
<br>
I DO know quite a bit about the roots of the Palestinian conflict and it has nothing to do with land.<br>
<br>
Shall I? Alrighty.<br>
<br>
During the pre,during, and post holocaust years Jews were being displaced due to Nazi Germany. Some fled to the US (such as Einstein) while others ventured over to the British colony of Palestine. Now, some years before a belief called Zionism began to take root with many Russian and European Jews. Now basically what this idea was that Jews needed a home and since they weren't going to get one in Europe they decided that since God said they could have all the land near Jerusalem (don't know exact words) they figured they'd settle there. Now, as more and more Jews began to settle there the massive Arab population began to feel threatened. They wanted them out.. one way or another they got the English against them.<br>
<br>
Ok skip a LOT of information.<br>
<br>
The Israelites become a united force with war hardened soldiers moving into Israel after World War 2. The English pull out due to Israel uprisings and before the UN could put down solid borders the Arab world attacks Israel.<br>
<br>
Now, that is the beginning of the actual armed conflict. I don't see anything about land. The Israel's wanted a home, after one of the worst genocides ever witnessed by man, promised to them in THEIR Holy Book which in my opinion is just as valid as the Bible (or was it the bible?) and the Arabs didn't want foreigners entering their land so they attacked them based on their religion (anti-semitism).<br>
<br>
I think it's laughable that'd you would think this was over land. Palestine is a wasteland. If it wasn't for Israel's advanced methods of agriculture (which they could teach to the rest of the Arab world if they would respect Israel) the entire area would still be a barren desert. They wanted the area because it was &quot;promised to them&quot; and it was the area with many holy sites.<br>
<br>
Land.. hah!<br>

I'm not a completely reasonable person, relying on reason would probably be smarter, but I'm not smart either. A lot of the time I just act on feeling. Unreasonable, rash, sometimes even hurtful to others out of blatant stupidity - illogical. My writing is sometimes just anger, not logic... though the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> idea</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> behind the anger is realistic. My posts are endless bashing, obviously not the best way to get my ideas out. But they clearly sum up my extreme disgust towards religion. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> E X T R E M E</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  disgust. My hate of religion even to me seems a 'little' harsh, but I will never get past it, never fucking ever. Religion is something that makes me very, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> angry, ignorant as I may be about some of its aspects. I hate control because I'm probably the type of person that needs to be controlled... and religion is the most controlling force in the world - what else could drive people to murderous suicides so? Religion that would can be compared to ideology, which is not always a bad thing - many African American leaders had an ideology that led them to achieve goals probably unachievable without such a driving force. Though ideology is not a control, ideology brought on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> by a religion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a control I loathe to the bone. Collective control. As a COMPLETE atheist I denounce god to the end, there is none. So, if there is no god therefore there is no reason for people to live their lives as monks, to live their lives praising religion and abiding by the commandments! I cry for those people that do, fuck me if I do, but I get pissed because to me they are wasting their lives because of religion. If god does not exist so why pull shit like September eleventh?! Because: the people that do, BELEIVE in god one hundred percent! They do it for nothing in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> reality, I think what I feel is worse than what religious people feel when denouncing us atheisits! Try and understand why I am so angry. In every scenario I can think of people are hurt or wasted, or restricted because of religion. If I were a leader though, I would never push anyone away from their religion, I am always for freedom... but I would still hate it SOOOOOOOOO much.<br>
Look: the Christian crusades are very comparable to the Palestine &quot;strap-on-a-bomb-kill-some-Jews&quot; phenomenon. Poor Christians in medieval time pillaged and stole using god as a mask to acquire food and money. Today a Palestinian men blow themselves up so their families will receive, as well, money, to live. Two very similar lifestyles. I know for a fact that the bible states &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;, a; twnd I'm skeptical that the Koran tolerates <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SUCH EXTRRME</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> acts of horrible violence - yet in both religions these atrocities were committed using god as a cover.  Things like this anger me greatly against religion and that’s why I hate it so much. Religion to me is the most complete mind control.  I think the average person reading this doesn't understand how angry I get towards religion. Religions tell you how to live your life, what to do and what not to, that is something I hate as much as the violence I see from them. The ONE thing in this world I hate the most is religion - Yep, I hate it THAT much! That's why I'm not the type of person that can always reasonably argue about this subject, sorry. I have religious friends and I like them, but I do not respect their religion at all, nothing in the world can force me to respect religion. I don't hate people, there are very few people I hate in this world, I hate the religion! I understand religions can help people and provide care for starving children etc... and I admire that, but the idea behind everything that has to do with religion is what makes me scream out inside against it. I guess I've calmed down a little, and I understand saying things about the bible is sacrilege to you Yosha, and probabaly offends you, but I really truly mean them - in an offensive way not to you, but to religion, I've got nothing against you, I just wish you were not religious! Of course I understand when YOU get mad at ME, that's what religion is all about, if you are religious and someone offends your religion they offend you - look at the middle east again, or almost any instance in history of true religious violence...I can never ever respect religion no matter what even though I try not to judge people I know who are religious. I've only called religious people stupid out of anger and I denounce that here and now, I have too much anger towards religion sometimes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Religion never makes anyone a stupid or bad in truth - in my eyes it only blinds them. You understand, I see RELIGION as the bad, not the people - they're just wrong. For example I would never do anything harmful towards a person because they are religious, that’s out of the question. Humanity has hurt itself throughout history, but I try and agree with Anne Frank in her quote said before she was brutally killed by the people she had hope in.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;In spite of everything I still believe that people are good at heart!&quot;<br>
<br>
Being religious doesn’t define anyone as a person. Even if the person believes they are fully defined by being a Christian,too bad... it's something I'll just ignore... I wish they were not religious, but it’s something only they can change for themselves... Freedom is more important than anything, religious or non religious. People have the right to choose and do what they want, then listen to me yell and scream <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ! Religous peoples ideas are coming from faith and often not reason, mine are coming from anger... its sadly similar.<br>
<br>
Heh, hopefully I have made myself somewhat clear on this issue. I hope I haven’t been contradicting myself TOO much in this post =-0!<br>

First of all, why hasn't anyone yelled at Tokepot? He just bashed religion as a whole more than anyone. He said he HATED IT AND WILL NEVER RESPECT IT. I make one comment on atheism and I get a load of shit for it.<br>
Kind of interesting, isn't it? That's all I did, make a comment on atheists that I PERSONALLY know, not every signle one, and a comment on Islam (and what fucking idiot said that I misread the Koran can go fuck themselves, I'll give you god damn chapter and verse if you want it you stupid fuck). I never mentioned ANY OTHER RELIGION!!! If you idiots took the time to re-read my posts, you would see that and finally stop putting words into my mouth.<br>
If I seem hot tempered, fuck it, I really have lost care. Anytime someone bashes religion, thats cool, but when someone goes against a few atheists everyone is on their case. wtf is that? <br>
Let me reiterate myself, this is very important: I NEVER MENTIONED ONE RELIGION BESIDES ISLAM. Anyone that said I hate those that don't beleive or have no respect, shut the fuck up. Please. Never once did I say that, and it's because of people Kerai and Tyrunn mostly that people get the wrong impression of what I;m trying to say. Kerai, Tyrunn, you are both fucking idiots.

I do not have a problem with Christians. <br>

From most of what I've read in this thread, neither do most people, including Kerai.<br>

Go back through this thread and really read it. There are posts by people who are Christians, Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, Agnostics, and even Wiccans. <br>
Most of the discussion is pretty even handed, and people exchanging ideas in an objective open minded fashion. Having a philosophical debate. A discussion. Indeed, that is realy the kind of discussion I really like to have on these matters. I guess I have a hard time giving up on people. I don't want to convert you to my religious beliefs, Yosha. I really don't care what yours are. <br>

The point you are missing here, the reason people like me and Kerai have a problem with you is the way you come off with your opinion. <br>

I'd actually been avoiding this thread like the plague specifically because I didn't want to get involved in bickering back and forth with one person, knowing full well that that's what would happen.<br>
<br>
I'd like to start contributing some intelligent discussion to this thread again. I apologize to everyone for having jumped into this petty war of words with someone. Then again this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in R&amp;F. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Honestly, I belive in what I posted at first. Simply, &quot;Do unto other as you would have them do unto you.&quot; A line right out of the bible, but I believe could have come from any great book of any religion. It's about compassion. It's about humility. It's about having the courage to put everything you've ever learned and believed, everything you thought you knew aside, and simply allow yourself the opportunity to admit that you might be wrong. Then again, you might not. I guess, in the long run, it's about resolving conflict. No conflict can be resolved without the willingness of all parties involved. Chances are, if you KNOW you're right, why bother listening to your enemy? I guess the major problems I have with most religions is that it seems many of their followers are so POSITIVE that THEIR way is the ONE TRUE way, they are not willing to put aside their differences with others long enough to entertain the idea that maybe there is room enough in the world for all of us. <br>
<br>
Then again, as I've heard in many different forms at least in the last few years or so, maybe it's simply time for a new religion to take rise. Something to swep the masses off their feet. One that encompasses EVERYones' beliefs. A religion that teaches all of us that it's ok to be different. Until one comes along though, I'm stickin' with my own way. <br>
<br>
For those people that HAVE a faith, I don't truly believe that all of them are blind sheep. Some of them, in their hearts, truly KNOW something about why they've been put here. They've found the answers to at least some of the mysteries of our existence.<br>
I do have a question for some of you though. I mean this in a respectful way as well... Can any of you describe a defining moment that led you to your current religion? I mean if it wasn't the religion you were born into? Or, even if you were, is there a specific event from your life that made you kinda go, &quot;Yeah! This really IS what it's all about,&quot;?<br>
<br>
For those people who are atheist/agnostic, well, I guess most of you have already posted to this forum anyways. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Maybe it's just that some folks are more cautious than others. Some people have had the wool pulled over their eyes a few times already in their lives and are slow to trust blindly in anything. Maybe they just choose of their own free will, no strings attached, to just not believe. I tend to lean towards belief of the former in this case though. I admit, though, I could be wrong. <br>
<br>
For myself, as I believe I said before... I don't fit into any of the above categories really. By no means do I think I'm special for this, I'm sure there are others in my boat. I guess I've always felt like one of those French Existentialist guys. I've always been a big fan of Sartre since I read a few of his things. I went so far as to get the word Nausea tattooed on my leg actually. I just really identified with his description of the way the main character reacted to being in close company with other humans. <br>
For the record, I believe in God. <br>
I believe in divinity. I believe that there are certain humans that are more touched by it than others, but ultimately, we are ALL OF US a part of God, and conversely, that God is a part of all of us. Circular thinking, doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a logical stand point, but i'm not really talking about logic anyways. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

A good book for anyone to read, christian, agnostic, or atheist, is called a &quot;A Case for Faith&quot;.  A good book and very interesting read.  The name of the author eludes me at this time.  It's basically about the author, who was an athiest, set out to prove that God did not or could not exist.  What he did was prove himself wrong.  He has another one called &quot;A Case for Christ&quot;.  Haven't read this one yet, but with EverCrack, who hs time to read. :P<br>

Anywaz, Tryunn, nice post.<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd throw in about defining moments. Even as an athiest one might have one, but alas, I am not one of those. As a child, my parents were never devout in anything, my grandparents on my mothers side are devout baptists and I used to loathe going to spend the weekend with them cause they dragged me to church on sunday and frankly, it bored me to tears. I went down to the child area and got in trouble with the teachers because I coloured in a picture of jesus purple or something =) Since my grandfather passed away, my grandmother has tried converting us to religion =/ She calls us and asks us to go to church more often and such. I respect her relgion but it annoys me when she does this. She doesn't even know I'm athiest, prob give her a heart attack.<br>
<br>
I guess the defining thing that turns me off religion is I have to just believe. I just can't do it. Science, sure it can be wrong and they haven't explained everything, but there are people working on that. <br>
Then there is the fact of what some religious people do. First there is the zealots, who I just find pathetic when they suicide murder some people because 'God' said to, then there is those that push their religion on others. I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HATE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that. I honestly don't care if your a satanist, just don't come trying to convert me. I don't try to convert you to athiesm, so stop trying to convert me to whatever the fuck you believe in.<br>
Just over time I just kinda accepted that I didn't believe in God and, so far, I haven't been hit by a car or a random tree falling =P <p>Kerai Cookies<br>

I'm done arguing. I think in my last thread I established that. I also think I asked a question or two of the other readers in general. Questions that I would very much like the answers to. If you have nothing constructive to add, then don't bother. I for one, would like to see this thread get back on the constructive theological debate train, thanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td
