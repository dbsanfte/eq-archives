<br>
Point A: &quot;The is nothing wrong with being gay.&quot; I disagree with this one.  Whether you believe that people were create by an intelligent being or whether you believe that people evolved from rocks, it should still be clear that the penis was made to go into the vagina and not through the rectum.  There are countless examples to back this up, but anyone with a little common sense does not need a biology lesson to see this obvious fact.  By the way, if you say, &quot;I mean there is nothing MORALLY wrong with being gay&quot;, then you have just conceded the existance of a supreme, intelligent designer (God).  This backs you into a tight corner where you are forced to defend how you know that God does not view homosexuality as morally wrong.  Good luck with that.<br>
<br>
Point B: &quot;Homosexuals are everywhere.&quot;  I agree with you 100% on this one.  So are pedophiles, liars, thieves, rapists, etc.  It is impossible to know what type of depravities the people you come in contact indulge themselves in unless they get caught ot choose to make them known to you.  So what?  I fail to see the significance of the fact that their are gay people all around to the argument against using the word 'gay' as an insult.<br>
<br>
Point C: &quot;Calling a homosexual gay is the same as calling a balck person a nigger.&quot;  I disagree and wish I could smack you for saying it.  What a stupid-assed comparison.  Let me ask you this:  If point B is true and most of us are probably friends with gay people without even being aware of it, then are we also friends with black people without being aware of it?  The truth is that black people are black from birth and have so say in the matter.  Their is little or nothing that they can do to hide the fact that they are black.  Some people look at them and make an instant judgement on their character and then treat them according to this preconceived notion.  They have endured centuries of hardship and discrimination for something that they could not change even if they tried with all of their heart.<br>
<br>
A fag or dike, on the other hand, can blend in very easily.  Also, the behaviors which classify them as homosexuals are voluntary.  Simply put, a man has the choice: &quot;I can suck dick and fuck other guys in the ass or I can not do those things.&quot;  This choice is usually only removed when you go to prison.  A man may not be able to choose who he is attracted to, but he can choose how he reacts to that attraction.  For example, a 40-year old man may get the urge to go to the local elementary school, grab a nine-year-old, take her home, and have wild sex all day with her.  OR the man may get that urge, say to himself, &quot;I know from everything that society (family, school, etc) has taught me that this is an unatural and unhealthy urge.  I need to seek professional help to help me control my behavior.&quot;  If the man molests the child, he becomes a pedophile.  If he doesn't, he becomes a patient.<br>
<br>
People are not a product of their environment nor are they a product of their genetics.  They are a product of their CHOICES.  You choose to do a certain behavior and that becomes a part of you.  If you choose to steal, you are a thief.  If you want to steal, but don't do it, you are not a thief.<br>
<br>
A homosexual, by definition, is a person who willingly has sex with a partner of the same sex as themselves.  Therefore, being a homosexual is a choice, while being black is not.  Degrading someone for being black is as ignorant as an act can be.  Degrading someone for bad behaviors that they can control, however, is perfectly fine.  If you catch someone in a lie and you call them a liar, good for you.  If a man tells you he sucks cock, and you tell him he is a fag, perfectly fine.  If the shoe fits, wear it.<br>
<br>
Point D: &quot;The God of the Bible does not say that homosexuality is wrong.&quot;  /smack.  Come on...seriously.  This one does not even deserve a response.  You can argue all day about whether the Bible is true, whether it is inspired by God, etc.  However, whether it is true or false, it DOES condemn homosexuality in many, many places.  To say that it doesn't is sheer idiocy.  Read the book of Romans for starters.<br>
<br>
Anyway, when I use the words fag, gay, etc, I generally don't even think of any homosexual connotations.  It's like when I say, &quot;This job sucks!&quot;, the image of my job sucking a dick never pops into my mind.  If I stop and think about it, I can figure out that the expression, &quot;such-and-such sucks&quot; originally came from the idea of sucking dick, but it has lost that meaning nowadays to a large part.  The same with gay, fag, etc.  Gay usually just means negative...nothing more and nothing less.<br>
<br>
One last thing, you said that &quot;educated, decent human beings understand&quot; the truthfulness of your 4 points.  Personally, I am a very educated.  However, I have never met any decent human beings much above the age of 10 (myself included).  People suck and are not decent.  If you think they are, you have a much bigger problem than being ghey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueloihim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eloihim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/02 2:29:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Homophobes and Language</span><hr size=1> i agree i have ignored aremo since.<br>
<br>
daniel and his eunouch supervisor where involved in &quot;tendor love&quot;  <br>
<br>
but again who's manuscrip ya reading?<br>
<br>
when a group starts using a term that has been targeted to<br>
insult them, it is their way of &quot;owning&quot; that term, to make it less hateful, and to ease the pain. it is the first step of building up a groups self esteem and self respect.<br>
<br>
i believe that gay and ghey are two different terms. regardless of the richard simmons poster, he is ghey for different reasons than he is gay. (but he's so damn happy!)<br>
<br>
really what the basis of this thread is, is that someone is taking a personal stand, to let others know in his environment how they feel, there is nothing wrong with that, just as dissenting opinions have veiwpoints too. although there is time and place for everything. i don't like to sit at work and hear negative comments about anyone gay bi or straight.<br>
i don't want to hear how the straight guy nailed a hottie, nor <br>
do i want to hear about &quot;that fag&quot;. thats sexual harrasment, and theres laws against it.<br>
<br>
are people losing respect for others? as a society are we diving to new lows?<br>
i don't know? lots of folks are working their asses off to support single parent households or child support payments,<br>
with all those hours someone else is raising the kids. ussually other kids.<br>
<br>
 we pack our poor into huge cheap efficient housing, where no parent has control over what their kids see.<br>
theres folks drinking on the corner, selling dubs, smacking their &quot;bitch whore&quot;, whatever. they see thievery and disrespect, where getting over on someone is more important than feeling good about what you accomplish.<br>
<br>
so with our kids getting these reinforced perspectives and the parent/parents working more, they are away from their children to provide the positive influence that they should.<br>
<br>
its an double edged sword, although we all must be responsible for whatever mistakes we make in life, to be born poor these days. means to be chided to &quot;pull yourself up by the bootstraps&quot; on one hand, and then blamed for not knowing where your kids are at 9 pm cause your still at your second job.<br>
and then you hear about the social programs ending, your busses are breaking down , routes are reduced, mass transit isn't even on the table anymore, social services, education, and retirement communities all taking hits, while the breaks on taxes and corporate welfare never gets a second look. <br>
<br>
a state woo's companies to move in, giving incredible breaks, (not to mention what the acountants are able to do with the fed acntants) yes taxes go up for you and me, yes services are elimated, but do these companies ever get asked to pitch in? to reexamine their contribution? no.<br>
<br>
why?<br>
<br>
and how did i get here from ghey?<br>
<br>
i will never know how you feel until you tell me.<br>

If you paid any attention to research, you would know that evidence <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> strongly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> suggests that sexual preference is determined to a large degree by genetics, and to a lesser, but still important extent, by circumstantial upbringing.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I suppose a gay person can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> choose</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not to have sex with another man or woman, just as you can choose to have sex with someone of the opposite gender.  Trying to stifle the basic sexual impulse is pretty futile.<br>
<br>
That also assumes that one (narrow-minded and zealously hyper-sensitive in defense of their fragile little world as you appear to be) thinks people have any control over whom they find themselves attracted to.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> it should still be clear that the penis was made to go into the vagina and not through the rectum.

<br>
And it's quite obvious that the penis wasn't meant for the palm of your hand either, but hey, I won't say anything if you won't.  There is a whole philosophical argument based on the idea of utility surrounding this.  A hammer is theoretically designed for hammering nails, but it can be used for plenty of other functions just as well, such as hammering in the skulls abortion clinic doctors, or clubbing baby seals.<br>
<br>
The God of the Bible does not say that homosexuality is wrong.&quot; /smack. Come on...seriously. This one does not even deserve a response. You can argue all day about whether the Bible is true, whether it is inspired by God, etc. However, whether it is true or false, it DOES condemn homosexuality in many, many places. To say that it doesn't is sheer idiocy. Read the book of Romans for starters<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>
<br>
Romans was written by Paul, an apostate (no not apostle, go look it up) who himself was believed according to tradition, gay.  Please show me where Jesus has a sermon on the soapbox proclaiming how gays are devil-spawn and defile God's good creation.  You'll notice he never says anything hateful about anyone.  In fact, every place in the Bible where the laws condone killing for punishment or committing various acts against other people, it's written by Rabbinic leaders, or some zealot like Paul.  Paul was like the Jerry Falwell of his day.  <br>
<br>
But, from your beliefs contained in your post, (which were obviously spoon-fed to you for the short time you've been alived and obviously established a firm and rigid code of morality for everyone to abide by), I feel like I'm arguing with a brick wall.<br>
<br>
It's wonderful how you also feel that there aren't any decent human beings out there.  Your optimism and love for the glory of God are really apparent by your cheery attitude and unconditional willingness to attempt to love and understand others.  But what the fuck does Jesus know, anyway?<br>

All you can do is let the person know that the words offend you and hope they are considerate enough to not use them when they are aware you are present in the future.

You run your mouth talking about how others are hateful (in this case by using the word 'gay'), but then you unleash a hateful attack on someone just because they disagree with you.  If you were really the embassador of love and goodwill that you try to pawn yourself off as, you would not feel the need to call people uneducated, narrow-minded. etc just because they disagree with you.  <br>
<br>
A couple quick things.  1) As far as evidence strongly showing that the desire to suck dick is genetic....please explain to me how one member of a pair of identical twins can be gay while the other can be straight?  Identical twins, as I'm sure you know, have the EXACT same DNA.  Most likely, they are brought up in about the same environment too.  What is very different about the two?  The choices they make in life.  One might do the right thing all the time and end up happy and successful.  The other might make all the wrong choices and end up on death row.  2) Please explain to me what is wrong with being narrow minded when matters of truth are involved.  If someone says, &quot;2+2=5&quot;, I will say, &quot;No it doesn't.&quot;  Does that make me narrow minded about mathematics?  Hell yes.  The simple fact is that a statement is either true or false, and people should be narrow-minded about accepting the truth and not allowing themselves to accept what is false.  So, if being gay is a choice, people should not be willing to concede the point that it is genetic in an argument about the subject.  3) If you re-read my first post in this thread, you will note that I said that the Bible, whether right or wrong, condemns homosexuality.  The book of Romans is part of the Bible.  Trying to discredit the book of Romans by making absurd comments like &quot;Paul was like Jerry Springer&quot; or &quot;Paul was gay&quot; lends absolutely no support to counter my argument that the Bible condemns homosexuality.  As a quick side note, you are living in a dream-world if you think Jesus never spoke harshly to anyone.  Making that kind of statement shows pretty clearly that you have never read the Bible, though you seem to want to pass yourself off as an expert on the subject.  You reminds me of that snob in the bar in Good Will Hunting that kept trying to quote other authors as if they were his original opinions.  Read just the first book of the New Testament and you will see Jesus unload on the Pharises and others....it's actually quite cool.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm sure from my posts that you've decided that I hate homosexuals and am a hate crime waiting to happen.  Far from the truth.  What I hate is 'gay politics', political correctness, and all that other garbage.  If you want to suck dick, go for it.  It's none of my business.  Just because it's wrong, doesn't mean I give a shit that you do it.  After all, sitting in front of a computer wasting your life away playing EQ is wrong and I do that quite often.  So what?  I already know that I'm going to hell and I don't really give a shit.  Your problem is that you are doing shit that you know is wrong and trying to make it appear not wrong by trying to get rid of God.  If there is no God, then there is no such thing as a logical basis for right and wrong.  Therefore, you can sodomize your friends all you want without the attached feelings of guild and shame that would normally accompany this act.  How convenient for you.  I'd have much more respect for you if you'd just stand up and say, &quot;I know that it is wrong for me to take a cock up my ass, but I really enjoy it.  Therefore, fuck it!  I'm going to do what I want, and if God doesn't like it then fuck him too.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubackster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Backster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/02 11:22:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Homophobes and Language</span><hr size=1> You'd be amazed at how little gay sex revolves around taking anything up anyone's ass and is more likely to involve oral sex.

Anyway, Aarcanus.  Where to begin.<br>
<br>
1)  I don't think calling you uneducated and narrow-minded is hateful.  Although I cringe at using the comparison, but Jesus wasn't being hateful when he ripped into the pharisees as you so described.  He was simply pointing out how inconsistent and misguided they were, as I'm doing with you now.  Yes, he did it with fire, and righteous anger (such as being angry over the mistreatment of other human beings) is perfectly legitimate.  So don't try calling me some flaming liberal hippy whose arguments are so twisted by the pot he smokes.<br>
<br>
FYI-- I'm straight, straight, straight, but not like it matters.  <br>
You can still have your fantasies about me though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, you can distinguish different books of the Bible.  To give you the most base and crude example, the 4 gospels, written almost a hundred years after Jesus' death, and almost certainly NOT written by the apostles themselves, all contradict each other, and were not in fact written in the order they appear.  Mark came first, as the others show a less sophisticated style and clearly borrow material from Mark.  <br>
<br>
I don't hate God.  I'm not trying to get rid of Him.  I think God (Jesus too), would applaud one's efforts to try and curb the trend of hate that has become so fashionable amongst the conservatives of the day.  <br>
<br>

FYI, humans aren't the only species on this planet to have incidences of homosexuality. It's been seen in everything from the animals we keep as pets (cats/dogs) to apes in the jungle.<br>
<br>
If the person to whom they were attracted were really a choice, you'd be advocating that there's conscious intelligence in insects, cats, dogs, fish, birds, etc. As for them acting on those impulses, everybody acts on their sexual impulses, some people aren't capable of having casual sex with somebody they aren't really attracted to. In the metaphoric sense, they can't get it up for them. Would you ask that these people go through their lives completely celibate? I'd like to see you take the same action before you impose it on others.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway. How did this get squirreled into a gay rights brigade? Simply put, we shouldn't use words that offend people. Contrary to what Aremo would have you believe, we have a responsibility to get along with one another, and a large part of that is not pissing each other off.<br>
<br>

Not like it batters, but my perspective is that of a 21-year old straight male who grew up in a small town in Ontario, Canada. I'd never even seen a person who wasn't a WASP before grade 5 when I went to a private school, to give you an idea of how small the town was. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaurianne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurianne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mana Whore</span><br>  Posts: 1094<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/02 12:44:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Homophobes and Language</span><hr size=1> WTB proofreading....<br>

The fact is, there hasn't been as much historical oppression of gays as they just weren't allowed to exist in most cultures - the human cost to those individuals would have been tremendous in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Anyways, there's little merit to the argument that as one group isn't as oppressed as another, it's ok to make derogatory remarks about the less oppressed group.  Sounds like a good argument for chauvinism in a place like America, where women are economically better off statistically than blacks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urangergoldeneyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 589<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/02 1:06:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Homophobes and Language</span><hr size=1> /sigh  you missed my point entirely, but like everyone else in society you color someone elses remarks and thoughts with your own prejudices rather than examine someones words in a non-biased way. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:papyrus;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'10pt'">
