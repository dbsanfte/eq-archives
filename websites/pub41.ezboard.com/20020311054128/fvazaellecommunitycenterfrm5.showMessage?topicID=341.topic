Been talking to divide on IRC and we're just ranting on and on about chinese parents and horror stories!  If you're a chinese kid you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.<br><br>- The &quot;save money&quot; syndrome.  Parents are rich as fuck.  And yet, my mom still clips coupons from the sunday paper.  Looks at the price of every single thing she buys.  My mom actually made a little money allocation sheet for me, like all my spending now in my own apartment vs. all my spending if I moved back home.  <br><br>- The &quot;hanging fish from the kitchen cabinets&quot; syndrome.  Yes you heard me right.  She'd take these fish, or eel, or whatever, and salt them up, and then hang them from the fucking kitchen cabinet knobs to dry.  It's fucking disgusting.  I go into the kitchen looking for a cup of water.  I open the cabinet, while this dead fish is hanging in my face waiting to smack me any moment, I get my cup and I'm too grossed out to even drink water.<br><br>- The &quot;you need slippers in your apartment/house&quot; syndrome.  I don't know wtf is up with chinese parents and slippers, my parents have like a closet full of slippers I swear.  They try to give me slippers and I tell 'em &quot;no! I don't need slippers, I have carpeting!!!&quot;<br><br>- The &quot;I called you and you didn't answer your phone where are you&quot; syndrome.  The other day I went to my parents house to pick up some food, got off work at 10, got there at 10:30.  I went home, there's 3 messages on my answering machine, at 10:25, 10:26, and 10:27 saying &quot;where are you? you forget to come over? call me now&quot;.  And then if they can't get ahold of you, the next day it's like &quot;hi I have food for you, where were you yesterday?&quot; hi mom I'm not 16 thx.<br><br>- The &quot;la&quot; syndrome.  Yes, lemme explain this in detail cuz most of you people do it without knowing what it really means!  Chinese people, not just parents have the tendency to say la after everything, it's just like canadians with &quot;eh?&quot;.  Like &quot;hao bu hao la&quot; meaning &quot;is it ok?&quot; but the la isn't needed.  Other words that can go after sentences that means absolutely nothing include, but not limited to &quot;ba&quot; and &quot;ma&quot;.  thx ma~<br><br>- The &quot;next door neighbor is chinese, they have son, you should date la&quot; syndrome.  Ok hi, don't need you to set me up with some weird freak that can't get a date kk.  <br><br>- The &quot;I hate your american boyfriend&quot; syndrome.  This is true for almost every single boyfriend that you can have.  They will hate him, he will never be good enough, and never be smart enough for them.  &quot;you need to marry somebody that's smarter and makes more money than you la!&quot; that's what they'll say.  Ya, as if every guy I date I want to marry or something :P <br><br>- The &quot;unidentifiable container in the fridge&quot; syndrome.  You find this container full of black goop and it's just NASTY and yer like, WTF IS THIS MOM and she's like, oh I eat that.  um, eww?  There's also a need for chinese parents to pickle things that should not be pickled and leaving it in the fridge. <br><br>- And finally, the ultimate chinese parent thing, the &quot;we're going to live our lives through you&quot; syndrome.  My parents have my entire life planned out in 5 easy steps!  &quot;we come to america with only 100 dollars, now we have big house and big car and struggle, you no have to struggle if you go to school and get good education and make lot money and meet good chinese husband la&quot; well golly gee that sounds swell lets go!  teehee~~!<br><br>I don't live with my parents anymore, haven't for a long time thank god.  I'm sure I'm missing a lot of weird stuff chinese parents do.  And tell us what weird/crazy shit your parents do!!!  <br><br><br><br> <p>[58 Useless] Evie (Nerfed) <<ahref="http://www.invirtue.com">In Virtue</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uzaralironhide.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaral Ironhide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/01 4:53:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: chinese parents - you know what I'm talking about!</span><hr size=1> I'm not chinese but I have witnessed all this first hand, across many cultures.

The dried fish, yes!! but that was kept in the pantry. They were like the nicest people I have ever met in my life though and were very attentive to guests in the house. Even if we were just playing nintendo they would be in the room every 10 minutes asking if we wanted anything. Another thing I noticed was the sheer amount of produce in the house.

Anything that can be eaten is thrown in a crockpot and cooked for 2 days with no spices or anything. Once it melds together into stewy mass of mushy meat, carrots, and potatoes it is ready to eat. Potatoes with EVERY single dinner you will eat for your whole life.<br><br>Bring a girl home to meet the parants and they fucking know by some goddamn 6th sense if she is Catholic or Protestant by one look at them. &quot;Ack son, why don't you bring home a wee protestant lass&quot;.

My dad's a druggie and one time, at my 18th b-day party, it got busted. The cops found some smoke and he got fined. They said they knew there was more in the house and that he should fess up. He said nothing. After they left he looks over at my friend and tells him to get up out of the recliner, he pops open the leg rest and pulls out a fat bag. My friend was like WTF? and my dad replies &quot;reasonable deniability&quot; ... yeah that was fun<br><br>-clothes 10 years out of date. you know, you have seen us white trailor trash people with our clothese from the 80's and orange sweatpants and flip-flops.
