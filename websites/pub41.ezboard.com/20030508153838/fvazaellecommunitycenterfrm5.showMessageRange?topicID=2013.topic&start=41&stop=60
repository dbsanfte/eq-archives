Creative minds we have. <br>
<br>
Yugi was in my previous Guild and when she quit we talked ( <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">over 9 months ago ~ August for those of you just catching up</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> ) and I took over. Anyone who knows me has knows since then that I have been continuing to experience Yugi while continuing to learn a chanter ( I only played Deandrea to 50 ). I have added 8 points of Flowing Thought and 20 + AA's. Over the following months I have became very good at Enchanter and you can ask anyone who has grouped with me the same. I know Plane of Justice Trials are easy but the week PoP was released I passed a lot of friends as Yugi and you have to have *some* skill to do. /shrug <br>
<br>
Other notable chanters who were friends: Copy = Goanad ( according to Fantasy )  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ... who cares ...<br>

This is a forum for all you that are fed up or think that eotd is being unfair. I was deguilded today because I am not reliable enough for daily raiding.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok Denubis~ we do have members forums for things like this, I hadn't taken away members access but we still do have a public page. Your statement is not true. We have people who haven't logged in since LoYs who have not been removed, some who literally only Raid one or two days per week. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>One</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the reasons you were removed ( as you were told in game ) was you would show up then shortly into the Raid then have to log or AFK for extended periods often... you being a Druid also used as healer on groups can see where that might cause a problem. In addition you would aso be seen farming in Chardok or elsewhere when we needed someone there. <br>
<br>
If you go to our Messageboard, where you applied twice it says:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Eye of the Deceiver is a Raiding Guild, which means if you are online you will be expected to partake in the day / evenings ongoing Raids. We aim to begin around 3:30pm - 4pm pacific time. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am very sorry if that isn't clear, but again it isn't the only reason you were removed and we went over the other reasons which don't really concern others.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ipeerc<br>

<br>
Ipeerc is a good shaman, that's all. After telling me he was ebaying his character he deguilded to farm BoT and CT to sell loot to make his character better. After rejoining a week later he proceeded to ask for every single drop with wisdom or mana ~ Ipeerc is unhappy, unhappy with the Officers not awarding someone who is going to sell their account. Finally figuring out that Ipeerc was getting no more loot, deguilded again, class act.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I find it ironically funny that the guild leader has been missing for almost a week prior to today, without letting anyone know where he has been or whats going on .....

<br>
I was sick Ipeerc, yes amazing even I get sick.. it happens. Nobody was 'left in the dark' as you make out, I have Officers who can conduct Raids when I'm not there. <br>
<br>
The last line I beffled at, considering I'm on more than Glaciusw &gt;&lt; I also am usually 2 or 3 boxing, those of you that actually Raid with us know to send tells to all, heh.<br>

First off you weren't in the Guild long enough to ask or have access to the Messageboard most likely, and in your short stay I believe you did get a Vindi Breastplate. Then after a Cowl of Mortality dropped you decided you wanted it. Other people including a Warrior and Monk who were in the Guild much longer, Raided more and needed upgrades also asked. They were respectively chosen and then you hand a fit and left, nice. We award loyalty and *skill*. I am very sorry you feel you took precedence. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Under normal circumstances, I don't think it is anyones business but the members. Guilds aren't free.<br>
<br>
Since we began the Guild has spent  over 700k on spells alone for various members.. all listed in the Guild Bank ~<br>
<br>
We started from scratch, 3 people.. Nocturno has a lot of work so mainly Solax and I started this Guild. Solax wasn't some old Main Tank from another Guild we had to get him an agro weapon. SoD's are not cheap and this one ( back in December ) cost us close to 400k. <br>
<br>
As with most Guilds, when droppable loot is gotten on a Raid and it is not an upgrade for someone it is put in the bank either to keep for a future member, a current members twink if they want to buy from bank, or just to sell for Guild expences. All of which is on the Guild messageboard along with spells in case anyone needs.<br>
<br>
The system we use to decide loot is as follows. When something drops we ask for /tells from people who could use the item as an Upgrade. Once we get the names of interested people the Officers, in the Officer channel discuss who should receive what item. It is not decided by one person and the decision is based on mainly Raid Attendance and who it would upgrade the most. <br>
<br>
We are a growing guild and are going to be using a DKP system soon to decide loot awards.. as Raiya said isn't an easy job. A lot of people are unhappy while a few people are pleased and still indifferent.<br>
<br>
Anyone who knows me knows i would have sold  before if that is what I wanted to do, and I could have sold some when Ipeerc asked me for the whopping $400 for his account Damn.. so much money.. ~_~ but I don't have any reason to.<br>
Ipeerc needs money for bills, sometimes you need to manage your RL better. ( RL&gt;EQ right Ipeerc? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
As for me Im happy with EQ and wouldn't have started this Guild with my friends otherwise. EQ is a game, not all of us have the time to play but have to remember that it is a game. Not an investment, or a job.. if I wanted to make money on EQ i'd 6box BoT for drops <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  not start a Guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Since I have been Guild Leader, I have received one item that dropped from the Guild. ( go go account value ) </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This was long, I'm sure I missed some thing I wanted to respond to but Im not quite the VCC person anymore.. although I'm sure I still have fans ( /wave ) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The last thing I wanted to list was some of the things we Raid. ( Just for da Lowf ~ ) We have been working on 2 clerics and 20 people mostly the past week or so, which is difficult but have managed to take out the following notable mobs recently: <br>
<br>
Dozekar the Cursed<br>
Telkorener<br>
Gozzrem<br>
Derakor the Vindicator<br>
Zlandicar<br>
Klandicar<br>
Trak / Velk<br>
<br>
Have also 23 Sleeper's Tomb Keys and will be hooking up our melee with Primals soon so we can move onto other targets.<br>
<br>
Which is not bad for only being around only 4 months, starting from only a couple people.. not an old Guild.<br>
<br>
Looking for people interested in having fun and Raiding.<br>
We updated our list of levels / class requirments, take a look if interested.<br>

Just this line I had to mention, according to my knowledge monk epic haste doesn't stack with ench haste so essentially renders it useless on raids (and most groups) in terms of haste.<br>

<br>
Sorry pal, but you are wrong. I never said one word about it til after i deguilded and you sent me a tell.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;First off you weren't in the Guild long enough to ask or have access to the Messageboard most likely&quot;<br>
<br>
I was in guild 3 weeks and was guilded and by NOT having access is just plain stupid. It allows peeps to think your hiding stuff especially when questions are asked and ignored.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;and in your short stay I believe you did get a Vindi Breastplate&quot;<br>
<br>
I raided plenty the time i was there and helped kill over 30 named mobs, i earned it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Other people including a Warrior and Monk who were in the Guild much longer, Raided more and needed upgrades also asked&quot;<br>
<br>
Point is, i dont see it has that much of an upgrade for either compared to the upgrade it would have been for about 6 other *suckers*. Also, i may be wrong about this and i may be thinking of someone else, but im not too sure Belbo(warrior) was even &quot;in the Guild&quot; that much longer. Hell, he isnt even on the member roster yet and i was(which you recently took me off) and im thinking this is another ebayed account of Faithluv(officer) anyway. As for the Wyyca(monk) most everyone else is there for close to an hour waiting to start and then we finnally start clearing and we nearing Zlardicar when she logs on and says am i too late? Hurry! She shows up just before we charge in.....<br>
<br>
&quot;We award loyalty and *skill*&quot;<br>
<br>
If thats the case, then how Solax get Uber? You dont engage an Uber mob as the MA and call for assist on your first swing and not expect others to grab aggro at times. You think your doing something special and are Uber because your killing certain named mobs and now its gone to your head that you have *skills*. Fact is, the named mobs you have been killing has been overkill and any guild with the force that you have used to raid these mobs could do just as well, your not special.<br>
<br>
Wanna talk about *skill*?<br>
<br>
Skill is NOT when your MA goes down tanking CT the other nite when we had his ass killed twice and your raidleader panicks and doesnt know who to call to have the healers switch up on causing 2 un-necessary wipes. I said something about it after the 1st wipe and i'll be gawd-damn if it didnt do a bit of good as it happened again the 2nd wipe.<br>
Solax goes down and mob turns on me so i use /def disc but dont call assist because Ludd is SA but noone calls anything....30 seconds later im dead and not one heal and soon after wipe #2.....is that what you call *skills*? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raiynominouscloud>Raiyn Ominouscloud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 9:47:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ipeerc</span><hr size=1>  Ipeerc, I have the facts I was guilded with Denubis and I know him to be a selfish piece of shit  as you'll note from my post, I stated he was a selfish person and I know this for a FACT!  Regardless of how EoTD is treating their people on raids, and obviously it can't be all bad, according to Denubis he followed them around for 2 hours that evening after his deguilding to beg for an explanation.<br>
  The FACT is that Denubis is renowned for leaving or being deguilded and then slamming the guild or its members.  That was the point I was making.<br>
  Also before you make statements like this &quot; could give 2 shits and your 1 inch penis how many guilds Denubis has or hasn't been in in the last 5000 years of his EQ career. &quot;  you may take into consideration that there are really women playing this game and we don't have penis' in case your mommy forgot to explain it to you.<br>

My guild has dictatorship loot style.   We have had practically zero issues with awarding loots and if we do we talk about it in guild chat or tells and work it out as friends.  Calling each other names and accusing people of shit that you have no proof is really bad.  Are these not your guildmates(or old guildmates)? If you do not believe your guild leader is honorable then you should not have been in the guild.  If you assume the worst about people and don't trust people then dictatorship-style of guild will not work for you.  I see lots of accusations from old guildmates but nobody has any proof he is ebaying anything... Does anyone actually have any proof or any solid facts that would indicate he is ebaying or taking items and selling them on secret mule?  Maybe he is just banking stuff for future use like he says.  I dont know Yugi, so I'm not saying he is legit or not, but sounds to me like some people did not get the loots they wanted and are crying like hell about it and making up shit with absolutely no facts to be vindictive. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198911">Corpsed</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treeslover>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1287<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 12:44:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ipeerc</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Point is, i dont see it has that much of an upgrade for either compared to the upgrade it would have been for about 6 other *suckers*.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You say you DONT know Yugi so dont know the truth about him, yet, in the same sentence, even tho you DONT know me you can clearly pretend you do know me as a person who is making up shit about him and crying about loots?<br>
<br>
I pass on so much loots even in pickup groups it aintt even funny. Plus, it NOT just one here bitching about him its quite a few who left the guild and i dont even know denubis3 and as for Ipeerc, we just had a falling out and a  HUGE arguement a few nites before, so why would i be here to agree with them?<br>
Like i said if you think it had to do with one insident then your skipping parts of the posts and props to all his loyal guildies who HAVENT come to his defense here and many wont. I'm sure he'll have a few drop in soon too tho.<br>
<br>
Also, i wouldnt have never ever even posted here about shit hadnt he /reported me like a little bitch after sending me /tells the way he did.<br>
I said nothing about it, deguilded, would have gone on my merry little way and never looked back but he has to send a tell being a dick.<br>
<br>
In fact, this shit is SOOOOO un-important that i should have myself shot as it is for allowing myself to waste my time here. Two years of EQ and not even 30 post count yet. I can assure you, i'll waste no more on this subject or any others for that matter.<br>

<br>
Since I try to avoid drama and play Everquest for fun I will try to keep this post to the point.  <br>
<br>
Here is some background information about EOTD. Mainly two people, Yugi and I erected the guild.  We did not form from any merger of guilds nor did we form knowing that we would have a stable base of 20 members.  EOTD was created from scratch and we lost almost all of our initial members due to the fact that we could not do any raid with the small number of members.  We decided to make a guild that wasn’t all 60+ and equip our members and grow with them to be what we are today.  <br>
<br>
Now to dispel some misinformation made in previous posts:<br>
<br>
Denubis was deguilded the 1st time because he looted an item in Kael Drakkal that was awarded to another druid.  On raids Denubis would go ahead of the whole raid snare mobs and try to solo them until the raid caught up to him when I ask everyone on raids not to go ahead of the MA or the monks. The 2nd time he was deguilded it was because when we would raid he would be in Chardok, doing what I do not know.  I understand that RL &gt; EQ but when your online and the guild is raiding we expect everyone 60+ to attend.<br>
(this was more then 1 time and we don’t deguild because RL happens and you need to afk, if you are on a raid and have to leave for RL reason we xloc you or use a potion its not a problem)<br>
<br>
I already talked to Kyrak in game about why he was deguilded; I don’t know all the facts I just know what I was told.<br>
<br>
Caladair I did talk to you about joining us.  I briefly knew you from my DV days and you had some game knowledge.  I wanted you and Caz to give us a shot and you said you would go wherever Caz went, this was when you both were guildless.  I don’t know your definition of “hack” but when someone gives you their login and password to their account I don’t think typing in information given is hacking.<br>
<br>
Criploc I don’t know you personally but from reading your post I determined you know nothing.  If you mean trying to equip everyone in guild with armor and trying to award loyalty, skill and raid attendance is “fucked up shit” then its clearly fucked up shit.  I know the raid feature in everquest is new but take the time to read up on its features.  In a raid the raid leader appoints who can and can’t loot, what would be the point of clicking everything single person in raid to be able to loot?  Why do we have an armor gem mule? A spell gem mule? Maybe its because someone has to loot these items and maintain a database of current spells and gems on our message board while making sure all our Clerics Wizards and Enchanters have enough peridots. As for the send tells if you need we aren’t mind readers, we can’t tell if you need an upgrade by looking at a computer monitor.  The Magelos aren’t up to date so we can’t determine who is best suited for an upgrade from them.  <br>
I have explained countless times how not all raids are added to raid points, we are working on a DKP system and the points you see in guild management screen aren’t from every single raid.  Which officer did you send a tell to? I know I have replied to your tells. For the record you did deguild yourself right after you weren’t awarded a CoM.  When I asked for tells for the COM I received a tell from Romules Belbo and Criploc.  Rom had a cocw belbo cof and you had a seb cloak.  I felt at the time that giving CoM to belbo and having him hand down his CoF to Wycca would be best decision, it would upgrade two people.  Plus the previous days you had sent me tells about how you were going to deguild because Ipeerc was being rude to you and wouldn’t buff you.  I replied with “don’t worry about Ipeerc he won’t be in guild long” and sure enough after Ipeerc realized he wasn’t going to get awarded any loot for him to Ebay he deguilded.  <br>
<br>
On the Zland raid you attended Criploc how many people died? 0. I call assist like I do because I know I can hold agro and the sooner the mob is dead the sooner we can move on to the next mob on our list.  Clearly killing gozz and telk with 20 people is overkill maybe next time I will tank naked to show you my skillz.  You wan’t to take a shot at me, go ahead but your posts speak for themselves.  I know what I’m doing, do you?<br>
<br>
Ipeerc I have no doubt you’re a good shaman.  When you joined you hardcored lvled and raided with us. We rewarded you properly, trying to equip you the best we could so you would survive ‘X’ mob.  Most people that have joined us didn’t have equal to HoT armor so we did HoT to equip everyone.  Our goal is to hit ST in force and move from there but if we have people going to ST with real bad gear its not helping us.  We must equip those vital to a successful raid i.e. healers/tanks/dps<br>
<br>
I hope this clears up something, if anyone has a problem Eye of the Deceiver and its members shoot me a tell in game and you will get an appropriate reply.<br>

I dont know why im allowing myself to be sucked back into this after i said i was through, must be a weakness at the moment. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Did you not read where i said it was just one of many strange crap that has been going on and one of the many reasons peeps have been deguilding and one of the many reasons others who have sent me /tells agreeing also have plans of deguilding soon.<br>
<br>
This wasnt JUST about whos getting the loots. Its about many things. I altho wouldnt have minded winning it, the truth is it wasnt about me NOT getting the drop. It was the fact that, we are told, &quot;send tell if its an upgrade with your old item&quot;<br>
I did not see the winner as that big of an upgrade while others it would have been a HUGE upgraded for NOT just myself.<br>
<br>
Did you miss where i said that some are not recieving their raid points while others have?<br>
Did you miss where i said that the question is ignored when asked about raid point?<br>
Did you miss where i said that access is being denied to website where you can read up on whats happening and where things stand.<br>
Did you miss where i said if peeps(officers) are avoiding questions, then it makes one think they are hiding something?<br>
Did you miss where i said that i said fook it and left guild because of a small mountain of strange going ons?<br>
Did you miss where i said i left guild and didnt rant about anything in /guildchat /say /rs /ooc /shout or any other channel until Yugi sends me a tell talking out his ass til the point i got mad and started bashing him back to the point he started crying and /reported?<br>
Did you miss where i said that GM Nocturi contacted me and i admitted everything that i did including having him have to put 5 of my toons on /ignore because he sent /tells first being a total prick and i got shitty back and im sure they got copies of me telling him in FUCK OFF and prolly by the time they heard my story and his story and checked my background and checked his background that the GM's only final remark to me was, &quot;Sorry to bother you sir&quot;<br>
Did you miss where i said that this guildleader talks to you like your some kinna 13 year old kid and would garner more respect talking to a grownup like a grownup?<br>
Did you miss where i said this guildleader is all nicey nicey at first and then after you join up turns into a dick?<br>
I can go on and on and on.....<br>
<br>
The only reason the loot deal is an issue here is because its the final cumilation(spelled wrong) of what occured right before i deguilded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know for a fact he has not awarded loot dropped at raids and just kept them for his own&quot;<br>
<br>
I am almost 100% sure i know who Yugi's mule is in the Bazaar that has 2, 3 even 400k on it at any given time with loot drops coming from mostly all /raid type mobs, but being that im not 100% sure i wont mention the name.<br>
But i will tell ya this, i have been thinking it was his mule for over a week and then last nite after posting in this thread, i get a tell from this same mule right outta blue and at the end of his message, says LOSER!! just the same way Ryell/Yugi typed it to me that nite.....capital letters and 2 !! at the end.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;like the leader hacking a warriors account that left the guild cuz he thought he didnt deserve the loots he got or some crap&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Corpsed, did you ask for proof of this as well or is this a known fact? <br>
 <br>
<br>

To be truthful...i have nothing bad to say about you. I have never gotten any bad treatment from you and thats a fact, unforturntly the same cant be said with the way Yugi/Ryell talks to a person.<br>
<br>
&quot;On the Zland raid you attended Criploc how many people died? 0&quot;<br>
<br>
I died and was at max aggro and even turned off attack once i got aggro yet Ryell decided not to heal me.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I call assist like I do because I know I can hold agro and the sooner the mob is dead the sooner we can move on to the next mob on our list&quot;<br>
<br>
You dont hold aggro like you think you do. I have had to many times turn off attack and back away slowly OUT OF max aggro range just to lose it and a few other warriors have sent me tells saying the same thing. Lets face it, you cant just call Assist on every mobs soon as you attack and expect other tanks to not grab aggro here and there then bitch when they do(Yugi/Ryell) and say fook ya your not getting healed and lets you die. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=corpsedagain>CorpsedAgain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1682<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 5:46:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Did you miss...</span><hr size=1> the part where you got sucked back into the thread even tho you said you were done and dont care <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
