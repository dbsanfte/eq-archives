I'm not really sure if this is the right place to put this but it needs to be somewhere.  Unfortunately it was decided by someone that the best course of action to deal with a problem(s) was to try to hide it (deleting posts and such).  If your reading this from a nuetral outside position things may appear quite scewed.  You really had to have been in and experienced the entire spectrum of events that have been going on for the past few months.  I'm really sorry, I almost can't make myself submit this post.  I always tried my hardest to get people what they wanted maybe its all my own fault for wanting people to be happy.  Never wanted this to end up on a public forum but you have left me no other choice, I have tried talking with the responsible party/parties but as always have just been ignored.  Just happens that the final straw for me had to do with the sleeper's tomb and the rejection (fix of a &quot;mistake&quot;) of another member of the guild after all his work, but any and every situation we've come across is the same scenario played over and again.<br><br><br>=============================================<br><br><br>pawn - A person or an entity used to further the purposes of another<br><br>ty·rant - An absolute ruler who governs without restrictions.<br><br>Sound familiar? Screw ST and keys that crap dont matter. This is what we see everyday. Everyday.  You all know who you are, the &quot;core&quot; aoa, and then there is the rest of us, the outsiders (*cough* pawn *cough*).  Those in any power position know that if you don't give a little bit to keep people happy eventually all those &quot;little people&quot; are finially going to get to the point where they've had enough.  Guess what you guys are there now. I hope you find something to fix this problem fast or you might as well live with the fact that your &quot;old aoa&quot; is always going to be &quot;old aoa&quot;.<br><br>I'm so proud of *****'s decision, mistake or not at least he was willing to make a just decision based on current situations.  You guys know as well as i do your not going to ST for at least another month (nearly certainly longer with participation as it has been), so wtf is the problem with letting ******** go?  Exactly, not a single thing.<br><br>&quot;Our goal is to GET AOA INTO ST NOT ONE MEMBER.&quot;  So true as long as your on the inside group.  This is whats called &quot;propoganda&quot;.  You know full well that saying that attempts to boost guild morale, giving people that glimmer of hope.  Why cant you just say the truth, &quot;our goal is to get all the worthwhile people into ST asap, the rest of you can do it later after we've had our fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What ***** didn't understand was that our preset order was done because we want to get in that zone as a guild as soon as possible.&quot;  Refer to paragraph 1 - 3 thanks.<br><br>&quot;This would have been a personal upgrade for you not really benefiting the guild since you are the only one with them. This concept is easy to understand.&quot;  There is no personal upgrade in a guild, WTF? Every piece of loot someone gets is a piece of loot the ENTIRE GUILD benefits from. Me, you, or someone else, its all has a cumulative effect on the overall performance, which is of the utmost importance.<br><br>&quot;locking now because I KNOW this will get out of hand in a sec.&quot;  You know that for sure dont you Aztlan. Supressing free speech is always the first thing to do when you know things are not going your way.<br><br>Sorry people most likely aren't going to be able to read this and ********'s original post again, it has really been a very eye opening experience.  So scary and the feeling of inferiority are overwhelming.  I just hope this will be around long enough to have a decent amount of penetration.  If anything at least a couple people will talk about it and get the ball of change moving.<br><br>*edit* I don't want to have this removed, in that event I'm going to have to place this on an open public forum. Everyone has a right to know others people's feelings on things, if all of us were oblivious to each other nothing would ever go anywhere would it?  Right or wrong, good for my image or not, we are all entitled to our opinions.

I have never seen them have issues with Loot or anything like that.  Mills left and Dagon was very busy - too busy to lead which left AoA &quot;leaderless&quot; for a while and caused a lot of issues.<br><br>I have had no bad experiences with AoA since their rebirth recently.  So, from an outsider's perspective, they seem to be doing well.  Since I am not an insider, I will not comment on your comments.  All I can say is that you will NEVER have 100% satisfaction from all members in a guild.  Some people will see things differently.  I am sure that if EVERYONE saw things as you saw them, then there wouldn't be an AoA as we speak.<br><br>Thanks for sharing your view/opinion.  I think as a server, we are all &quot;family&quot; of some sorts.  However, I would warn against anyone forming an opinion of an entire guild over 1 person's post.  This is their opinion and I take it as that. <p><p><img border="0" src="http://www.noctuserus.com/images/esmersig.jpg" width="275" height="150"></p><p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.noctuserus.com/">Web Site</a> /<a href="mailto:esmeralda@noctuserus.com">EMail</a></font></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usumdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sumdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 9:10:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://scentsationaldreamers.com/boots/sumdar.jpg HEIGHT=170 WIDTH=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /hung Colous</span><hr size=1> Bump Esmerelda, good post.<br><br>Colous, I have know u a long time and hope things work out for you.

Anyone mods want to me out?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucuffinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cuffinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 2:54:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> drenth? you think thats me? umm..I've known you for a long time, and if you think thats me..heh<br>I still have a great deal of respect for aoa and wouldn't ever flame them.<br>And one more thing, Jocasta quit eq so its not him either. <p>Cuffin Stickymuffin<br>60 Rogue<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2549>Magelo</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucuffinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cuffinn</A> at: 6/8/02 2:56:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umystykal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mystykal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Never Asks Nicely :)</span><br>  Posts: 1739<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 4:15:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Cervantes is not Cuffin or Jarv, try again asswipe.   <p><BR><strong><b><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101487>Mystykal Force</a><BR>High Priest Of Zeb<BR>Crusaders of Plilo</b></strong><BR><end><end><BR><a href=http://pub21.ezboard.com/bflamecentral>Hot Cyber</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uelmasoulseer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElmaSoulseer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 5:30:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Drenth, what would cause you to make such wild speculation as to believing Cuffin is Cervantes?<br><br>What connects Cervantes to Cuffin and Jocasta, save this board? Nothing, and you fucking know it. I've noticed in other threads you post claiming Cervantes is Cuffin. <br><br>From your lack of knowing that Cerv is a separate entity I can tell you didn't even bother to follow through with figuring out who was who.<br><br>Sounds to me like you have a serious penis envy issue, if you keep projecting the people you have envy for's persona onto others.<br><br>From now on I suggest you deal with your envy issues and quit claiming anyone who pisses you off is &quot;Cuffin.&quot;<br><br>How about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> grow a nutsack and get a
