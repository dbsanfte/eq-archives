<br>
Weary from the guild search, I have created my own Guild.  It has been approved and I am awaiting people for the Soul Marking step of Guild Creation.  <br>
<br>
This is a plea for assistance.  I was left by the original folks who had agreed to assist me in creating the guild.  There was a disagreement with the Guild Name (Guff of Divine Souls) and I have not been allowed to change it by the GM and will loose my guild creating opportunity if I do not establish (soul mark) this guild.  <br>
<br>
I do seek members preferably 46 and above, but in the mean time, I would be grateful for any level character to assist me in the Soul Marking event.  I think most of you know that 10 people are required to be in the same zone, to meet with the Server GM for Soul Marking before the Tag can be worn.   <br>
<br>
This final step has not happened.   Your assistance would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in the guild or assisting me in the Soul Mark (You can have more than one char in separate guilds or the creation process too), email me or send a tell in game.  I play primarily CST 5PM to Midnight.<br>
<br>
Thank you all<br>

The Guff is a storehouse for souls, from which each person born receives one.  The notion is that there is a finite number of them, and when it is empty, the world ends.<br>
<br>
I don't pretend to be a scholar on Hebrew items, (I am not even Jewish) but I recall seeing it a couple places.<br>
<br>
While an intriguing concept for a guild, it will go over the head of 99.999% of the EQ player base.<br>
<br>
I would have to agree that if you cannot find the requisite number of people to create the guild, it is doomed to failure in the end.  Anyone who joins based on your appeal will either have no binding interest in seeing it succeed, or have plans of their own which may or may not run parallel to your own.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you, though...<br>

None of these responses were called for.  <br>
<br>
The only thing that was asked is, some people get together to help create a guild tag.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br>

<br>
For the plethora of useless comments that neither support the subject matter, or provide any positive suggestions<br>
<br>
Since I received so many frank and disheartening opinions, I've decided to give my opinion on the helpful and friendly comments I have gotten from guilded, members who posted their ideas about my request for assistance.  <br>
<br>
I only came here looking for some people to use their low level characters to help me establish the guild tag.  Thats it.  Nothing more.<br>
<br>
But, Lets review some of your comments, shall we?<br>
<br>

Hello genius..  Thats why I am here.  See Paragraph #1 below.   <br>
<br>
I decided go for a public forum, where mature and friendly people reside and see if you will help me get this guild tag created.  It was my mistake to use this message board.  <br>
<br>
You know, your comment is like a mechanic telling a customer, who came in to have his car repaired...<br>
<br>
 &quot;How do you expect to drive this car home, if its broke&quot;?  <br>

<br>
Can you explain the mechanics of that suggestion and how it would help me?  I've alreadys stated that I have petitioned and it was turned down.  Having a &quot;good friend&quot; create one doesnt solve anything either, as I need 10 people to redo the whole guild creation process.<br>
<br>

<br>
Who asked you to translate anything?  Actually, I think your comments were probably the most useless of them all.  You never came here with any intentions on giving assistance, did you?  <br>
<br>
BTW, Are you Binder Trueshots from Eci?    <br>

My request for assistance went over the head of 99.999% of the people who responded.  Why did you set back and allow this bashing to take place? Thank you for educating people on what a &quot;Guff&quot; is.<br>
<br>
ShaelynWyldheart Wrote:  I would have to agree that if you cannot find the requisite number of people to create the guild, it is doomed to failure on the end.  <br>
<br>
Wrong.  Where do you get that from?  Is there some MoJo out there that I dont know about, or are you saying &quot;If you dont have enough people, you can't create a guild?&quot;  Which, would be totally irrelevant.  I don't think thats what you meant.  Their is no formula or rule that reads that the people involved in the guild creation process, are responsible for the success of that guilds future or the success of that guild rides on how many people were willing to spend the time to create it.  A guilds success stands on what happenes after the guild tag is created, not before.  The survival of the guild is based on the treatment of its members and the quality of the members involved.  Also, the guilds purpose, stand in the community, etc have unfluencing factors in guild success.  These are all attributes that grow and appear long after the guild creation process.  Granted, the first few (1-20) members, have a tremedous influence on the guilds direction, but I didnt really come here seeking members.  I can't believe an Admin joined in on this crusifiction.  <br>

<br>
The guild was approved the same day we created it.  I recieved an in chat tell from the GM saying &quot;Great Idea!&quot;  The Guff was designed to assist people with their epics.  Once the guildmembers had theirs, we would be available to assist others with the necessary raids needed, hence the name Divine Souls.  We were going to go with &quot;Forgotten Souls&quot;, which related to the those who were usually overlooked.  So we stuck with &quot;Divine&quot; in the fact that we will assist the unfortunate/overlooked in acquiring what they deserve.  We wanted a name for a &quot;holding area&quot; or &quot;house&quot;, so I suggested &quot;The Guff&quot; from the Bible.  I WAS shooting for an Raiding Guild, but GoDS, as you put it, was a catchy little abbreviation that was born from the original idea, not the purpose behind the name.  You probably think that the guild name Knights of Eternal Good was born just because &quot; KEG &quot; was such a cool abbreviation of their guild name, don't you?  Who are you anyways?  <br>
<br>
<br>
Look, none of you people came here to help, only to ridicule.  <br>
I came here for assistance, and all I got was smart allic comments.  Really, you all should be ashamed of yourself.  Its ridicoulous the way you Jackals set on your hind gaunches, scowering the boards, looking for messages like mine, that are open to a free attack.   <br>
<br>
This guild will be born, without your approval, because your approval and opinions of these ideas doesn't mean squat to me.  <br>
<br>
I have run across so many people who need assistance in getting their epics.  Its ridiculous of the levels they have to drop too in order to get it.  Finally, there will be a guild where someone can send a formal request for assistance, and an Entire guild will be there to help them.  I see members in large guilds who have not gotten their epics because they are not the most liked by the officers or the most popular in their guild, or they are simply overlooked but they are so quiet in guild chat.  <br>
<br>
If anything will make this guild fail, it will not be the people who helped create the tag or the difficulty of getting it created.  It will be you people, when these comments are reviewed on this board by others.  <br>
<br>
There will be someone who uses this idea or a part of it, and it will be created and survive.  For how long, I do not know.   The idea is a good, the name is a good one, and your opinions were not asked for.<br>
<br>
REPRISAL:<br>
<br>
For those of you who did not quite understand the simple request of the original post, let me put it more simply.<br>
<br>
1.  The only thing I have asked for, is for someone to use a low level character to help us establish this guilds tag, out of the kindness of your hearts, because that is the root of our cause.  Meet with me in NRo at a specific time, on a specific day, say you represent this guild. You may use /guildremove after the GM is gone.  <br>
<br>
2.  You interest in the guild is not required or requested.  <br>
<br>
3.  I am not asking for your opinions.<br>
<br>
4.  I AM NOT recruiting. <br>

<br>
<br>
Any guild created through shouting in zone for new guildmates, using the general channels in the chat feature for EQ, or even recruiting on a community board will ultimately meet it's demise at the hand of it's own members as more and more of them realize that they don't know each other,  have anything in common with,  or even like their guildmates.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guilds are not formed this way.   I am sure anyone that replied with a smart ass response could have spent the time explaining it as I just have because most of them I recognize as being around as long or as long as I have.  Most of them recognize the folly in your attempt at forming a guild and chose to toast you a little.<br>
<br>
<br>
My suggestion:  Realize the fact that you don't have enough to form a strong guild. (not strong in the sense of what you can do but strong in the sense that at the first sign of trouble most people in these guilds run to the next one they can find)<br>
<br>
Let the guild come to you,  through your interactions with the other members of this community, through your reputation as you build it,  through time spent.     The guild you found based off of these three things will provide you with much more satisfaction then what you are attempting here.<br>

<br>
1, People to start it<br>
2, People to maintain it<br>
<br>
You seem to want to start a Guild without having either. Kind of defeats the point in making a Guild surely? Unless you want to be in your own private Guild of 1 (which would be disbanded after a whilke for having less than 10 people) which is also rather silly.<br>
<br>
Or you think that your guild will take off once you get it started? If you don't know the people to start the Guild, then you'll be filling it up with people you don't know just for the sake of having a Guild Tag after your name? Point being?<br>
<br>
I hope it's not getting to the point where there's a mentality &quot;you're not anyone if you're not in a Guild&quot;, albeit, the Guild mentality of Zebuxurok does kind of push that, which is a shame. <p><H2 align=center><FONT color=#660000>Xoralundra Dagnabbit</FONT></H2>

<br>
None of these responses were called for. <br>
<br>
The only thing that was asked is, some people get together to help create a guild tag. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<br>
Your opinions were not asked for and your responses are nothing less than a public &quot;bashing&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
A) Its an open forum...dont like it, tough hop.<br>
<br>
B) He got as much help as you can expect from some of the people that frequent this board. Consider it blessing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utahliatreekin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tahlia Treekin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thug of Nature</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(7/29/01 12:07:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need Assistance from my Zeb Brethren</span><hr size=1> I have read this thread several times and each time I have tried to read it from your point of view, Nobless and Eriic's. I don't see it. I've played this game for a LONG time but I've only been reading the boards for a little over 8 months and I know bashing and trust me when I say I know a flame. Example of a flame: &quot;I think I might have figured out why the original 10 people left you. They must have given you an honest opinion full of sincere intent and you did not like their opinion and decided and tear out their throats. &quot; This post is a 4 out of 10 on the flame scale. If I left in all the things I had deleted it would be a 9 out of 10 but I decided to take a different position.<br>
<br>
You felt the need to form an assault on those who posted after you and critique them with snideness and aggression that was absent in this thread until you and Nobless posted.<br>
<br>
Mystykal's post was a legitimate concern. Your guild does not start after you get the tag. The birth of a guild begins when you and a minimum 9 other people say &quot;Hey, lets make ourselves a guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Binnen tried to understand the name only because you said the 10 people left due to the guild name. Not everyone knows the Old Testament, is a Demi Moore fan, or reads all the Trivial Pursuit cards. Also, you said, &quot;and will loose my guild creating opportunity if I do not establish (soul mark) this guild.&quot; Hmm, after reading that line I do believe that is why Binnen recommended a friend to help you and then the friend could have you tagged as a Guild Leader.<br>
<br>
Shaelyn, like myself, knows a flame/bashing a mile away and if it had become that she would have moved it to The Inferno section of this board. Instead, she was helpful by explaining the name of your guild. She even took her helpfulness a step further and expanded on Mystykal's post by showing why the guild would not succeed due to lack of shared interest. <br>
<br>
After that is basic board stuff, people make funny comments, take a thread 180 degrees to the left, and continue the discussion from there. If you had returned and addressed their concerns and questions and explained yourself a bit more you might of received the help you were requesting. Instead you chose to make line liners and quick quips. Many times in this game people band together to help each other out if they can be shown the goal is a worthwhile cause and you failed to do that this time.<br>
<br>
Eventhough, you chose to twist people's words and be negative in general I wish you luck. You have a great premise for a guild. Many people don't get their epics due to a lack of uberness and resources.<br>
<br>
On a separate note all together, if Mystykal, Binnen, or Shaelyn felt I translated their posts incorrectly feel free to correct me. I felt you three had been helpful by sharing your experience and was repaid unkindly. <p><font size=-1>

And you pick a really stupid guild name.  That's cool, the guild name and the leader should go together, and in this case it does.<br>

NO WONDER you have no friends. Adjust your attitude or never expect any help.<br>

I think what the poster is asking, just for 9 others to show up with low level alts (or whatever alts) and just be guilded to make the guild official.  At that point he really doesnt care if you stay or go.  <br>
As to why he doesnt already have 9 others who he would really like to see in the guild?  /shrug.  I don't know.  <br>
<br>
Seems alot of misinterpetation(sp) was going on. Hope that helped a bit with it.  Good luck with the guild.<br>
