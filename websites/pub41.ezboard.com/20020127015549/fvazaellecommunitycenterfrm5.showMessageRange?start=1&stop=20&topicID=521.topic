class=title> its come to my attention</span><hr size=1> its come to my attention that there may be some rumors floating about, about my break up with CC so im going to tell u all here what happened in hopes of killing and fasle rumors.. <br><br>I had been in WW for well over 13hours killin dragons with CC and some freinds etc... miran was there in and out all day never really there for good....<br><br>after these 13+ hours Myga spawned (DB dragon) at the time i was the only wizard in the zone all the sudden pop here comes miran 10mins later as we are about to get the pull.. then i get a tell saying miran was on a twink and someone( i have a names but thats not important) told her and she logged over to loot the blood.....<br><br>needless to say i was flaming pissed at this point i had been there for hours on end and miran was playing a twink rather then helpin the guild and friends ... i sent a tell to baldrik to hopefully work this all out and i probly did not take the best approach but it resulted in the end me saying then u better guild remove me .. i knew i was gunna be flaming mad... well myga was pulled and killed and it happen that MORRIS (NOT ME) trained sont on us morris did this as a total foobar more or less was not intentional at all..<br><br>miran's body was not able to be found and ressed before it rotted... while the corpse was rotting i was screamin in guild chat some not so nice things... the things i said about baldrik were un-called for i dont disagree... i should have handled it better then i did simple as that.. the things i said about miran( not nice at all) i dont regret at all other then wishing her RL death cause i dont really wish anyone RL harm over a game thats just stupid....<br><br>at this point baldrik guildremoved me as i was very deserving of i dont disagree with his call at all i would have done it to me also....<br><br>i dont think many (other then like miran) in CC hate me i think alot we let down or insulted by my elementary reaction but dont hate me... im still close to a large number of CC...<br><br>the idea that i applied to other guilds( agony, PO, arise etc) is totally false i left CC and i went to letha and said can u invite me she agreed .. i dont think any of the other officers would have questioned it either.. ive always known EA was like home to me and so have most of EA.. i didnt even think about another guild let alone apply <br><br>EA has always been brothers and sisters to me and now im one of them simple as that<br><br>its a new day but ill always have lot of ties to CC i love most of them still and i think most of them love me but we know it was not a perfect match now even though it was for a long time<br><br>this is the entire truth u can varify it with any of the CC officers ( morris, baldrik, fubbik)<br><br>Peace out-- <br><br>PS--as defense to miran i would like to say that she had spent more time over the last weeks lookin for Myga then me ....but the idea that someone would come from a twink bothers me if she had been there the whole time or even been there the last few hours i would have conseeded np at all

Make some effort to talk to ppl in game about what happened before you jump to conclusions.  I've talked to quite a few ppl in Caer about this to get the facts straight, and this is a summary of what I've been told.<br><br>Miran had been camping Myga and clearing PH's all week.  She was playing an alt because she had 30 mins to play before she had to leave for RL reasons and the guild was going to TOV.  Budiphi hadn't done shit to get Myga to pop.<br><br>They were in WW killing dragons (not Myga PH's, but statics).  They happened to stumble upon Myga, Miran was told to log in and come to WW so they could kill Myga, which she did.<br><br>Budiphi is right in one thing... all indications point to him NOT having trained CC after not getting the loot.  From what I heard from talking to CC members, the actual cause of the Sontalek train was unclear, but most (including Miran) do not believe that Budiphi caused it.<br><br>Baldrik awarded the loot to Miran.  That was his call, he's the guild leader, and it's a god loot system in CC (like any of the major guilds on this server).  At this point, Budiphi proceeded to call Miran all manner of horrible names, profanities which i cannot repeat here, and even went so far as to wish her death in RL... all over a piece of imaginary loot in a video game.  This is clearly a sick, disturbed individual.  He was guildremoved by Baldrik for this at the request of more than one CC member, Miran not among those.<br><br>In the 2 major guilds I have been in, there have been occasions when I thought I deserved some piece of loot over someone else.  Sometimes the person that got it was a friend of mine, sometimes not.  I did what nearly all people in eq do in circumstances like this, I /ooc Grats So-and-so! and I move on.  I don't proceed to insult them and wish death on them or the leader of the guild or officer who awarded the loot.<br><br>If you want to know about what happened, talk to some people in Caer about it.  I've talked to quite a few, and every single one felt horrible for Miran and thought Budiphi was 100 percent out of line, and most were glad he was guildremoved.  Take a look at the posts that have already been made by Caer people, and the posts that I'm sure will follow.  You won't see much if anything that supports Budiphi.  Plain and simple, he was wrong.  He's immature, vindictive, and greedy, and Caer will be much better off for having left him behind.  Caer is a high quality guild with a lot of nice people, clearly not the place for someone like Budiphi.  I pity EA for having to put up with him now, and I seriously wonder why they would choose to invite him.<br><br>Budiphi has only succeeded in hurting his already pathetic reputation on this server.  As far as whether he applied to other guilds, I don't honestly know.  I do know that he didn't apply to PO, and I also know he would stand zero chance of getting into PO even if he did want to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upyneforrester.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyne Forrester</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/29/01 3:25:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=521.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /boggle</span><hr size=1> I stand corrected and I apologize for it. <p>Pyne Forrester "American Biker" and proud member of Arise!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubudiphiownzjoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BudiphiOWNZJOO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/29/01 3:47:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=521.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /boggle</span><hr size=1> ammelen im glad that u think im a horrible person for standing up for something i belive in like ive said a million times it should have been handled alot better but the over all point was made (again not how i wanted to make it but..)<br><br>Dyst i know u wanted me to say im sorry for everything i did and that fact that i cant/wont bothers u sorry dude but ill say it again im sorry that i handled it how i did, im sorry that i hurt or let down my friends around me but im not sorry nor do i regret standing up and speaking out or gettin my point heard simple as that i am me i not a coosh give in person i stand up simple as that..<br><br>others may be content being a following subordinate and simply taking orders and listening to others im not i live life sometimes its unpopular but i have very few regrets in life.. last i checked im living in America and i have the right to voice my opinion rather then sit and go /ooc gratz so and so as some others have said i should have.. <br><br>fact of the matter is I do not like miran at all.. i did not like the fact that someone would come from a twink to take loot at all.. those bother me simple as that and i sttod up for my opinion maybe not the right way and in the heat of the moment i went to far simple as that and if u wanna hate me for that fine be on your marry way but dont judge ppl off rumors and lies  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dyst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/29/01 4:08:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=521.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /boggle</span><hr size=1> I couldn't care less wether you apologized or not or wether you are in cc or not.
