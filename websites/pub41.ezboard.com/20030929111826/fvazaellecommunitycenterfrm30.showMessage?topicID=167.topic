<br>
First off let me state that I never supported the USA in either its UN drive or its Unilateral invasion of Iraq.  I honest beleive that, while S. Hussein's WMD were a reason for the invasion, I have no illusions as to what(I believe) were the real reasons.<br>
<br>
One of those is oil, not ness. the ownership or control, but the benefit of having another American ally in the middle east. Especially at a time when the traditional mid east allies are starting to look a little wrong in the lime light back on US soil.  Those traditionally allies of course being both Israel and Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia coming up as weak on terror in the news has most definatly caused a few in power to lose a good nites sleep.  Further more, the last time any race fenced in another race turned up badly for the Germans, and I fear the same will happen to the Israelis.<br>
<br>
My point being this, and more so then a point, it is a question.  Why is the USA still in Iraq?  How much nation building can you actually do when most commons citizens wish you to leave, and a sizable minority(some Loyalist for sure, but not all) wish to see you agents of nation building and stabilization dead; furthermore how could the population of the US allow it to go on?  I highly doubt S. Hussein will be little more then an impotetant voice till the end of his days.  And if he does, I am sure Jeb will be office in 8 or so years to clean up. (hehe, sorry)<br>
I honestly beleive that the US will fail at its new 'role' of nation builder, after all you don't respect power unless you earn it.  Saddam was given power in Iraq by and large by the States.  Look where it got you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1652<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/03 5:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=167.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraq === Somewhatish longer</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
We'd be foolish to leave Iraq now.  Americans are nearly unanimous in believing that, whether or not the initial invasion was the right thing to do, we now must remain and finish the job.  If we leave now, several things could happen, all of which are undesirable.<br>
<br>
1) Saddam could return to power.<br>
2) Anarchy, many people dying, no enforcement of law, and no real government.<br>
3) Muslim fundamentalist state could arise out of the Shi'ite majority.<br>
<br>
These are all bad things.<br>
<br>
Will we be successful in establishing a democracy?  Well, I really cannot say.  I give us about 50/50 odds, could go either way.  However, we have to try.<br>
<br>
Leaving now would be a disaster.<br>
<br>
I expect we'll be in Iraq for at least another year, maybe more.  It's necessary that when we leave, the government we have helped to establish has a military and police force to maintain power an order with or it will certainly collapse.  Democracy needs to get a foothold, we're there to help it get that foothold.<br>

Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events but sadam was a murdering, torturing dictator who ruled by fear.  I guess in your sick anti American mind its ok for his son to drive around in a van snatching and raping women.  If their families complained he would send back pedicels of her body in a box.  I guess you think the mass graves are no big deal, neither are his many torture chambers.  You must think it's quite all right for him to attempt to take over neighboring countries for their oil, or to have chemical and biological weapons.  Sadam and his sons would ass fuck you and cut your head off while they raped your mother just because you looked at them wrong, or because they felt like it.  You support this guy?  Get a grip.<br>
<br>
Now to answer your question.  It is obvious why we are still in iraq.  I can't belive you have to ask that question.  I bet deep down you already know the answer but your mind is skewed from your anti Americanism.<br>
<br>
1) we are still there to set up an economy to improve the living conditions of the people there<br>
2) we are still there to kill off the stragglers who still support sadam and may try to take over if we left<br>
3) we are there to keep the peace and prevent crime such as looting and pillaging.<br>
4) we are there to help set up a fair democratic government for the people to live by <br>
5) we are still looking for sadam<br>

<br>
Well, this is the problem.  In the United States, we elect representatives.  When the representatives are elected, they enact laws.  We then follow those laws.<br>
<br>
A revote is blatantly and completely against the law.  There is no such thing allowed.<br>
<br>
To do so would have been to violate the laws of the state of Florida.<br>
<br>
So I guess if you call following the laws enacted by the representatives of the people unfair and undemocratic, then I guess we are guilty as charged.<br>

Actually Bush won cause the people filled out their cards right. If you are pissed at at bush being president because your &quot;stupid&quot; people that voted for Gore couldnt do it right, you should have a talk with them. Btw a full recount was done and Bush won anyways.<br>

Hey moron, there had already been 2 recounts.  Gore was calling for a THIRD recount.<br>

The courts stopped it from mattering but the recount was done after Bush was certified, and he won anyways.<br>

While researching the book, &quot;VOTESCAM&quot;, the Collier brothers actually managed to videotape members of the League of Women voters forging ballots, and found hard evidence that Shouptronics and Printomatic vote machines were rigged in the Dade County Elections. In the Shouptronics, the wheels of the mechanical counters were shaved to cause miscounts. In the Printomatic machines, a malfunction revealed that the paper tape with the voting results had been pre-printed before the voting even started! The Colliers, along with attorney Ellis Rubin, handed the evidence to the assistant State Attorney for Florida. Sadly, that assistant State Attorney was Janet Reno, who in a pattern we have all become too familer with, killed the investigation. 60 Minutes taped a segment on the Dade County Vote Fraud, but never aired it.<br>

Which part are you questioning?  That there were already 2 recounts or that in recounts done after the election Bush won anyways?<br>
<br>
For the first part, that's extremely well known.  Ask any American who watched the entire scenario unfold.  After the initial count, there was a machine recount (recount 1).  This showed Bush still won.  Then after that there were manual recounts in the places where Gore was leading substantially.  Again, every American will remember seeing this on TV as voting boards sat there looking at paper ballots and voting on them (btw all the voting boards involved were controlled by Democrats, the part of Al Gore).<br>
<br>
If you want to see the results of several independent recounts, all of which showed Bush did indeed win after the fact:<br>

Bush won in THREE counts.  Gore wanted to push for even more counts in the hope that he might be able to pull out a win.  The courts said that enough recounts had been done and it was time to move on.  After the fact, multiple recounts all supported Bush and many even widened his lead.<br>
<br>
There was no wrongdoing here.  Gore was just being a sore loser.<br>
