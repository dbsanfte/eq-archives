This game is sure not rocket science and every class has it pretty easy when all they are trying to do is fill thier role. Whether your job is casting a CH in a rotation, tanking a mob and holding agro, fighting at max melee range to keep from getting killed, nuking the correct amount so as not to get squashed, ect.... each class after 60 levels of playing their toon should be doing their normal actions pretty bloody simply. Occasionally a person can go out of their way to do some amazing feat to save a raid but usually we are just doing the same thing we always do. The fights in EQ are really quite static, from fight to fight each class does the same thing over and over. Raiding is just like a exp camp where you kill the same mob over and over, the mob is tougher and you kill less per a hour but it still becomes routine.<br>
<br>
That is why I wish fights were different, I wish Verant would alter things and mix it up. Such fights as the 10th ring, ring of fire, burrower parasite, grimling war, ring of vulak, Shei, and maybe afew others are really quite cool because they are different and dont follow the so common routine of most uber encounters. People actually have to think a little more in these fights and be on their toes. I love a fight where right from the getgo you are constantly having to think and alter your current action as the scene changes around you. If you have ever fought the final mob in the ring of slime you will know the kind of fight that makes me sick of the same ole same ole. Dain, Yelinak, AoW, KTMax, Statue, Rhags 1 and 2, THO, IV, Grieg, Tunare, CT, and many more fights are all borring and sin and almost indistinguishable from one another. Sure there are slight differences but they are window dressing, they are still MT + CH chain fights of atrition. A fight like AoW might be tough but only because he dishes such a sick amount of damage in one flurry round that a tank nearly dies often, if a cleric misses his mark the tank dies and all is lost. But that fight still is simple in theory and takes pure timeing of heals to make it easy, no thinking is involved beyond making sure you time your heal right. No thinking is involved for a melee except to stay at max melee range and unengage at tank changes either so dont think I am saying only clerics have it easy, we all do. This game is not a game of strategy for most fights, it is a game of clicking talent and following pre-made fighting strategy. I want to have to think and adapt in battles to changing situations.<br>
<br>
This really reminds me of a post I just read, a person stated they had bought a cheat book on pac-man. Supposedly all you have to do is follow the path laid out in the book and you will alwasys avoid the ghosts since they are programed to move the exact same way every time. Well that's EQ in a nutshell. If you follow the preordained path every time for each fight exactly the same then you are guarenteed success. And so many of the various mobs have very similar paths it just gets old. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upigboyph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PigboyPH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1296<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 11:40:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Diversity n classes</span><hr size=1> Maybe this is the wrong game for you?<br>

If they were not, you could kill every mob in eq on the first try.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to go into details on why each fight is so different, but I think if you really believe your only job is to keep max melee range, then you don't understand the encounters and don't play your class well.  Do most encounters require cheal? yes.  Do most encounters require attacking a mob? yes.  That's the nature of the game.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between being ok at eq and being really good at eq.  There's quite a bit you can do in this game to have a major impact on fights.  Many people fall into the &quot;hit a and afk&quot; mentality.  This doesn't mean that it's the game's fault, it means that the player is not very good.<br>
<br>
Try a cheal chain and tell me again it's easy.  It's not.  The first time I tried a cheal chain myself we lost the fight cause I fucked up.  Now I chain fairly regularly and consider myself good at it, but it took practice, and it's the most intense thing I have yet done in eq.  It's not easy at all.<br>
<br>
I've wiped MANY times because clerics fuck up the cheal chain, sometimes horribly.  If it's so easy, why do tanks ever die?  If you work it out, most chains are tight enough so that the main tank should never die, if executed correctly.  If you really believe a cheal chain is a simple thing, then you are effectively calling a substantial portion of your guild morons.<br>
<br>
I really don't think eq is the game for you.  Most of us spend our time talking about how we could tweak eq to make it a bit better here or there, all the while understanding that it's an amazing game, the best we've ever played.  You want to turn an apple into a pineapple.  Why not just buy a pineapple instead?<br>

I think EQ2 is Sony/Verant's answer to &quot;fixing&quot; Everquest.  The problems that exist in EQ have developed over the 3 years of EQ's existence, and most of them *ahem...archery/spells and z-axis* are rooted in the base code,which would require too much change to fix while keeping encounters balanced.  All the complaints we have about EQ will be addressed in EQ2...and 3 years later, there will be new complaints....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

OK after 3 and a half years of playing this game in just about every area I have quite abit of experiance as to how the game works. Most of the secrets of the combat engine are quite well known after all these years from in game tests and out of game code reading. Seriously how would you have any idea about what I know or dont know about the game mechanics and be able to therefore judge that there are people who know so much more? Hell I dont even know who the fuck you are.<br>
<br>
Anyways, dont forget what I said in the beginning, I was answering Ammelen's original post so if you dont like this thread or it's topic then how about you bitch at him? He loaded his question in that he basically stated he loves CH chains right off the hop and cannot seem to understand why anyone would want anything different, well I am trying to let him know why so many people are feeling the game would be better on a different system. So stop being a ignorant prick and if you dont have anything meaningful to add about the actual debate going on in the thread then dont bother posting baseless slander and just fuck off OK.<br>

Couple things I wanted to point out really quick...<br>
<br>
Tropics, have you done a CHeal chain before?<br>
<br>
Yes the game is not rocket science, I agree, but it does take practice and w/ practice you aquire, &quot;Skill&quot;.<br>
<br>
Each class changes dramatically from 50-60, so they don't really get 60 levels to practice it.  And they certainly don't get 60 levels of Cheal chain practice before their first role in a cheal chain.<br>
<br>
Each class has its difficulties on a raid, if all you're doing is hitting auto-attack and standing at max distance....sorry. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221" target="new">Haels~</a> - Uber Gimp Cleric<br>

I read your posts from someone who believes &quot;more is better&quot; and who considers &quot;pushing the limits&quot; is something you do in your pick-up after 5 or 6 Buds..<br>
<br>
Yes, Cheal is probably over-powered, but I think alot of things in EQ have been incorporated wrongly. Constructive critism has to have some sort of &quot;constructive&quot; component.<br>
<br>
For example: Every Expansion Warrior weapons get bettter DPS until we get to where we are now when warriors do as much as Kurnak Monks...<br>
Solution.. Introduce more Bane style quests, Take away the warriors &quot;generic taunt on all mob&quot; weapon and make them have to research and quest new items.<br>
This would allow melee to upgrade throughout expansions without unbalncing the previous Expansions with insane DPS.<br>

I'm impressed that VI was able to create encounters where CH isn't used in the same old way. Encounters where everyone has a more active role. Mobs that require teamwork and skill to take down. I'm glad that people like Ammelen and Baldrik can enjoy encounters where the guild with better tactics/skills can kill a mob, where a guild with just more members cannot.<br>

Can you think of any other spell that starts off at roughly a 4-to-1 effect-to-mana ratio (1600 hp for 400 mana) and becomes a 25-to-1 ratio (10000 hps for 400 mana) at the end?

<br>
I personally was one of the people that started up the entire conversation on the FoH board regarding how ridiculously borked CH has become over the years - relatively speaking everything in EQ skillwise, equipment wise, spellwise - is eclipsed by something else in some regard. This is an important part of the game known as CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. (if any of you are currently in college and planning to go into game development remember those words - they're really important, trust me) <br>
<br>
Whereas with a Warrior or a Wizard you will acquire a new weapon or spell or whatever to improve upon your character, the cleric class stays relatively stagnant once CH becomes efficient(around level 50 or so w/ today's equipment) - new buff here and there and better &quot;secondary&quot; heals. <br>
<br>
How would you feel as a Wizard, if Manaburn was a vendor spell that you got at level 39 and cost 400 mana w/ a 10 sec cast time and no recast delay(and fundamentally the same otherwise - damage the same as current so as to overshadow all other spells)?<br>
<br>
That is EXACTLY what CH is to a cleric... it's like Ding! Woohoo, 51, I can scribe Remedy finally so I can spot heal better when I screw up and wait too long to CH... Or wow, a new piece of gear that is 1/10th of a CH upgrade to my old gear. (and yes, I said that exact thing a few times ^_^)<br>

Is it too late to fix? More than likely... with so much being balanced based on it there would be months of retuning lots of content, doesn't mean they couldn't do blanket changes to mob damage output/mana etc. - In XP and raid situations both, of course - but most likely it would be a financial mistake for VI to do at this point. (Most people fear change, even for the better)<br>
<br>
What CH should have been if they hadn't been lazy when they were coding it in the first place is a spell with a scaling mana cost based on the amount it heals(simplest coding method probably being mana cost based on the level of the target)<br>
<br>
And Pigboy/Haels and anyone else who thinks CH Chains are difficult in the slightest (And I mean to do from the standpoint of an individual cleric, not to figure out the appropriate interval for a mobs damage output and latency - that certainly takes a level of skill to determine), I'd really recommend trying out another class all the cleric class boils down to is timing and efficiency - if you can't handle one of the two fundamentals you're a shitty ass cleric.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for those that can't imagine an EQ w/o CH, imagine all these things that could have existed since they currently can't due to CH trivializing them.<br>
<br>
1. Much Higher AC cap.<br>
Nothing quite like the farce which is monk tanking v. warrior tanking - pretty much the same mitigation and significantly higher avoidance for monks - if only they had a few more HP and some form of a taunt skill they could just scrap the warrior class all together.<br>
<br>
2. Less ridiculous Mob Damage Output.<br>
Sure extended encounters are fun so the HP/AC could stay relatively high(although in some cases, the AC is obviously a &quot;tad&quot; overboard), but where is the fun in being a nonmelee annoying a mob for ONE ROUND and dying. Dying isn't fun - Doing the same thing precisely the same way everytime gets boring. (Catch-22 anyone?)<br>
<br>

Course, after you do something over and over again, anything becomes routine.  It took EA 5 shots before we finally killed Aaryonar the first time.  Now he's dropping like Fippy, and yes, it's starting to feel routine.  There's no way around that.  Learn a mob, learn a routine.  If mob dies, routine is successful, repeat next time.<br>
<br>
Whether or not the mob requires a Cheal chain or a spamming of spot heals, when the routine is figured out, that's what you're gonna use.<br>
<br>
This would happen whether or not cheal was in the game.  Once you learn how to beat a mob, once you learn the timing, the resists, the debuffs, the whatevers... it'd become routine.<br>
<br>
Cheal just makes a convienent target.  Perhaps the only *reasonable* argument I've heard is that clerics dont' get heal upgrades.  (1000hp, 2000hp, 3000hp...).  Verant would still make mobs around the spells.  Now that warriors have defensive, VI makes mobs around that.  VI has stated that FD has got abused.  Monks shouldnt' pull.  Yet they've designed encounters that basically require breaking.<br>
<br>
It boils down simply to the fact that players are more clever than any team of designers.  I remember reading an article about the old days of text based muds and one of the main upgrades to one game in it's early days was the addition of an axe as a new weapon.  The playerbase was thrilled, and went out to look for trees to cut down, but none of the designers ever put in a tree.<br>
<br>
Is it our fault it's flawed now?  Or is it Verant's?<br>
<br>
Makes ya wonder...<br>
<br>
Well...makes me wonder at least  (-8<br>

<br>
I'll start off by saying that compared to the top-end gameplay of action oriented games like Quake, nothing in EQ that I've witnessed requires very much skill.  Most of what does currently require traditional gaming skills in EQ is found in PVP play or in EQ's past, when the game was younger and tougher.<br>
<br>
When I say that cheal chains require skill, I'm speaking subjectively within the context of EQ.<br>
<br>
There is not a lot of skill required to merely do a cheal chain.  However, with the chains that I've seen, and the chains that I've been part of, there is a lot of room for an individual to do his/her job well and for the clerics to work off of each other and coordinate as a team.<br>
<br>
I believe that a big difference between a guild who can do mobs with a minimal amount of resources and a guild that needs to zerg is smart, efficient healing.<br>
<br>
Because of the nature of cheal, it does require more timing and thought than any other heal.<br>
<br>
Would SOE do heals differently if they had an opportunity?  Of course.  They would redo countless elements of the game differently.  They never envisioned Cheal as a battle spell and don't like it.  This is true of much of the game such as FD pulling, camps, etc..  The players have really defined EQ gameplay, and I always felt that this pissed the hell out of Brad.<br>
<br>
But, players making use of available tools tools in unconventional ways helps make EQ fun.  If people did everything the way Brad had intended, the game would be very boring.  Tactics are fun, and people not only enjoy coming up with them, but implementing them.<br>
<br>
As for character advancement, well, I liked to use all of my available heal lines.  I always understood that cheal was self-scaling, and was effectively upgraded with each expansion. A more varried top-line heal would not have made the class any more enjoyable, and certainly wouldn't have the epic feel of cheal.  Clerics don't have the advancement enjoyments of other classes, but I think that comes with role specialization in EQ.  Clerics envy Druids for diversity, Druids envy clerics for specialization.  Shrug.<br>
<br>
The balance of the entire game is out of whack.  To blame cheal for that is wrong, to single out cheal is pointless.  Cheal chains weren't necessary and weren't really used until mobs with massive HP's in SOV, and AC obviously was going to be capped in SOV whether players came up with cheal chains or not.  Much of EQ has evolved past its original design documented, and much in EQ has reached caps of some sort at some point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 886<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 9:41:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Tenken,<br>

Cheal is a single spell, but it is akin to its own spell line.  At level 39, cheal is only going to be healing 800hp or so, in VT it's going to heal for 1-5K.  It's not really a 10K heal, in terms of practical use.

Ok, although my 1600hp at level 39 is assuming a somewhat twinked warrior's max hp, the average CH on a 39 warrior would be 800 to 1000 if you are playing safe. Your VT example is based on a CH chain healing 1000 if few hits land, to 5000 at worse case (any more and the MT is dead). But in an XP group, at full main assist health, the cleric can basically go /afk, take a smoke, get a drink, etc., come back and use 400 mana to recover 6000hps. At level 60, with top gear, that's maybe 10, 15 percent of the cleric's total mana to heal 80 to 90 percent of the warriors health.<br>
<br>
FD is another ability/spell that's flawed, but if it was removed, it would take much less effort retuning the game than if CH was removed. Defensive, probably easier seeing as it's used mostly on high-end encounters, much less to adjust.<br>
<br>
What I'd like to see is a replacement to CH at level 39 that has a similar cast time and mana cost, but heal a max of 1600hps. Then at level 49, an upgrade with a slightly higher cost, same cast time, but heal for 2400 or so. Then at level 59 you get a modified Complete, with the 10 second cast, but a variable cost based on the level of the person healed, maybe level * 10, minimum 400).<br>

I much preferred the days of the old EXP groups when clerics had to heal frequently. This is a gameplay issue, not a cheal specific issue.  A cleric was very busy in an exp group before the masses got a hold of 45+ AC BP's and such.  Before SOV equipment became common, not many people would consider having a monk/rogue/ranger tank, but they can do it perfectly effectively now.  Back then, you wouldn't want to cheal them actually, because their health went down too fast and it just wasn't mana efficient.<br>
<br>
Cheal isn't more broken or out of whack than the rest of the game at this point.  <br>
<br>
And no, I don't see anything wrong with a self balancing spell.  It's the same as having (generally):<br>
<br>
39 cheal 1 400 800<br>
49 cheal 2 400 1200<br>
55 cheal 3 400 2000<br>
60 cheal 4 400 3000<br>
ancient cheal 400 5000<br>
<br>
Yes, the mana stays the same, but it's the ratio that's important anyway.  I don't think that those ratios are totally out of whack for a spell with a 10 second casting time for a class that is specialized. [edit: especilly when cheal isn't helped by casting time mod items]<br>
<br>
You asked if the removal of any other spell can break the game, and I countered with other abilities that, with their removal, would break the game just as much.  You couldn't do high end encounters without defensive, for instance.  Sure, you could rebalance the game to compensate, and you could do the same for cheal, if the need was there, but it's not, not without a complete game redesign.<br>
<br>
What makes cheal great is that the more capable the cleric, the more capable the spell is.  If you have the balls to wait 5 seconds longer, you're more mana efficient, your group is better.  This may not matter in a single group with neo-gimp tanks who have 1300AC, but again, that's all gameplay. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A> at: 8/10/02 11:18:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utropicsdelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TropicsDelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 975<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 1:55:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> OK first of all I am glad Vaclav posted, a SK trying to argue this with a bunch of clerics was pretty difficult.

OK this is true, but the reason this happens is because mobs have no AI to speak of. They dont think and once you kill a mob one way that EXACT same fight will happen the exact same way every time. Give Aary some smarts and allow mobs to alter their fighing styles as they start losing to a routine and a new challange arises at every fight. Of course Aary atm is far too buff to actually make intelligent, CC and PO combined would get wiped out by Aaryonar if he was being played by a human. He would have to be altered.<br>

<br>
Right now for EA in ToV that is true. That whole zone is about fighting single mobs with differing strategies to each, once you know each mob the whole zone is trivial. I would argue though that something like the Grimling war never becomes routine. I would say a Shei fight has alot more of a chance to be a little different each time. The HP fight can be quite different between times you fight it. And why? These are not single mob encounters, once you get more then one mob into the equation the chances of thing being unique and happening different each time increase. I would like to see the primary mobs weakened and alot more guards and such and that brings me to feign death.<br>
<br>
Feign death should be nerfed so that mobs dont lose agro ever until they are all at their spawn point. AKA if you break a spawn and 2 mobs run at ya and you feign the mobs will start back to where they came from. Now if one mob reaches the spawn point while the other is quite a ways away then only the one that has not reached the spawn point will come back and the spawn is broken and therefore trivialised. What should happen is if 2 mobs come and you feign then the mobs will start back to the spawn point. The ONLY way that you should be able to get up is if BOTH mobs are back at the spawn point. If even one mob is still not at the spawn point and you get up then all mobs you had agroed should return. This makes Feign Death truely just a life saving spell and removes it from benig a pulling spell other then to test new areas to see how many mobs are going to come on a pull.<br>
<br>
Mob1<br>
Mob2<br>
<br>
SK casts on mob 1 pissing both off<br>
<br>
Mob 1 and 2 come running<br>
<br>
SK feigns<br>
<br>
Mob 2 walks back towards spawn point<br>
<br>
Mob 2 reaches spawn point<br>
<br>
Mob 1 starts walking back<br>
<br>
SK jumps up and still has mob 1 agro<br>
<br>
Mob1 shouts &quot;Shit! this SK is still alive mob 2, lets kill him!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mob1 and mob 2 are still after SK.<br>
<br>
The only way you would lose the agro is if BOTH mobs were back at the spawn point.<br>
<br>
By doing this to feign death you make it so that multiple mob fights are not so easy to break for a SK or a monk and therefore trivialise content that was meant to be a war. In wars where there are a ton of mobs CH is alot less effective due to the agro caused on mobs that may not be tanked and taunted at that exact moment therefore bringing more thought and thinking back into the fight.<br>

The problems you state I covered in my parenthetical.. yes, figuring out that sort of stuff is mainly an issue that should fall to the brass - leaving it up to too many people to guesstimate the appropriate interval leads to confusion and confusion leads to hesitation, etc. <br>
<br>
I guess knowing when to CH out of the normal sync because of someone lagging can be difficult depending on your tools available - I had a nice little kitchen timer I had velcroed to my monitor to crutch me with that.<br>
<br>
Ceros-<br>
<br>
My standpoint fundamentally comes from affecting people's opinions to mold future concepts, not to effect EQ too much - I still find EQ related properties an interesting read, but the gameplay itself means little to me personally as I no longer play.<br>
<br>
Do you think the effect of CH on EQ has been something that future MMORPG titles should share? My answer to that would be a definite no - unless there is an AI compensation. (For example, in a PVP heavy game it could work, as long as all &quot;teams&quot; had equal availabilty to it - and, erhm, that's technically not AI but it's the only good opponent intelligence I expect to see for at least a decade or so ^_~)<br>
