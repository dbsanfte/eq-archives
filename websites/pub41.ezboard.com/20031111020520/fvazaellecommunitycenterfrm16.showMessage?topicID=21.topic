1.  Meeting and grouping with others for hunting, camps, and raids.<br>
2.  Acquiring and upgrading equipment to make #1 more feasible through trade and negotiation.<br>
<br>
Statement:  The numerous Guilds address #1 quite thoroughly and to a large extent #2 as well.<br>
<br>
Question:  Has there ever been a Guild established that concentrates on Commerce as it's first Goal?<br>
<br>
Problem:  Trades, whether for money or other, take place in every zone in the world of Norrath.  But because of the complexities of the world sometimes finding a Buyer or Seller can be arduous.  Broadcast auctions are limited to the zone of the Seller or Buyer.  Traveling to the Tunnel in E.C. can be relatively expensive and/or time consuming.  Further, once you arrive, there is no guarantee you can find a Buyer or Seller.<br>
<br>
Solution:  A group of PCs, a Commerce Guild if you will, could organize and assign players to cover certain zones in an effort to connect Buyers and Sellers.  These agents could take consignments from other PCs to help them find a market.  A PC could place an order to sell or buy a certain item with the Guild.  The Zone Agent would send this order to the Pit Boss in E.C.  The Pit Boss would broadcast the order out to other members of the Guild throughout the entire world.  When another Agent finds a matching Customer for the Broadcasted item said Agent would notify the Pit Boss.  The Pit Boss would communicate with both Agents to negotiate a price or instruct Agents to tell the PCs the names of interested parties.  Of course this would cost both the Buyer and the Seller a fee.  5% on items 100pp or over?  Delivery is up to the PCs involved.  Once the names are exchanged the Guild has completed it's service.<br>
<br>
Who wins?:<br>
Seller: Finds a quick market<br>
Buyer: Finds the item they want quickly<br>
Seller's Agent: Makes 5% from Seller<br>
Buyer's Agent: Makes 5% from Buyer<br>
Pit Boss:  Earns a commission directly from the Guild as a percent of the days activity he conducted.<br>
Guild:  Membership is free.  But active members must pay a fee to the Guild based upon their activity payable once a week.  50% of paid commissions?<br>
<br>
Why this might work:<br>
1.  Guild could advertise their connections by Auction.  Example: &quot;Commerce Guild now taking Buy or Sell orders in 40 zones&quot;.  I think most PCs would like the idea of this network when trying to sell or buy expensive items.  If a PC is looking to pay 10K for a FBSS then he probably won't be grudge a 500pp commission if he is matched with a Seller in a matter of minutes.  (lol, maybe he would).<br>
2.  Anyone could become an Agent.  No minimum level to join is required.  Level 1 PCs can excel at this as much as Level 50 PCs.  No upfront fee to join.  Only pay as you play and complete transactions.<br>
3.  Zones assigned first come first serve.  The Pitt boss would assign certain zones to agents based on first come first serve.  If an Agent logs on at 2:00pm and the Butcher Block zone is open then that agent gets the assignment and maybe one open adjacent zone if the agent has time to handle 2.  Pitt Boss can keep a waiting list for active players requesting particular zones.  One agent leaves, then the Agent at the top of the list gets the zone.<br>
4.  Factor while you do other things:  This would not require a 100% of the Agent's attention.  They can fight, camp, and raid while assigned to a zone.  They simply need to note Pit Boss orders and occasionally send out an Auction message for Order Taking or Order Offering.  Just keep your eyes open for potential business.<br>
5.  Income:  Do the numbers.  If an agent brokers five deals in one week worth a total of 20kpp then he makes 1000pp in commissions less 500pp in Guild Membership fees.  Thats 500pp for just typing.  If a Pit Boss brokers 20kpp in one weeks worth of transactions then he might get 2.5% or 500pp.   The rest would go to Guild Officers and a General Fund.<br>
<br>
Of course there are many problems with this but I have other ideas to make this work.  I am interested to know if anyone else would like to explore this possibility with me.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Roddingham<br>

<br>
Here are some problems I see with your charter.<br>
<br>
1.  Commissions being set.  I think each broker should set his own commission rate or perhaps set a payment to owner price (i.e. Owner says get me 100pp, I don't care what you sell for)<br>
<br>
2. Guild fees seem steep.  You are asking capitalistic entreprenuers to join (its their kind of guild) yet you are basing fees on heavy taxes.  <br>
<br>
3.  Guild fees go towards what exactly?.....you never explained that.  What exactly is that paying for.  You made an example of how much the broker can make but geez, just think of what some lucky bastard who is collecting the fees going to make.  Also, how are you going to enforce the reporting and paying of the taxes?<br>
<br>
If I were to do this it would be simple:<br>
1. Guild set up to promote business w/in the world of Norrath.<br>
2. Membership is strictly on an invite basis and members will be upheld to the most extreme principles of fair trade and honesty.  Anyone seeing our guild tag will know they can fully trust said broker, even with selling items between two different characters (ie get cash from main, give item to alt.)<br>
3. Membership is not limited to mains. <br>
4. No fees for belonging to the guild exist as the guild has no costs associated with it.<br>
5. No price wars between members.  No member will sell below a current members auctions when in the same zone.<br>
6. Any changes to the charter must be voted on and accepted by a Quorom (2/3's ) vote.<br>
<br>
Much could be done with a guild of this sort. <p>Herder

I was beginning to wonder if the idea was worthless from the silence I received after it posted.  <br>
<br>
I have read your post on the economy and agree that PCs should be able to make the best equipment.  That with item degrade (of some type) might be an improvement to the economy.<br>
<br>
Responding to your post in order:<br>
<br>
1.“I think each broker should set his own commission rate or perhaps set a payment to owner price”.  <br>
<br>
This is an excellent idea and the guild should or would probably evolve into this anyway.  But, to start out I think it should be as easy as possible.  Commission rate should be standard so customers don’t resent the Guild and refuse to use us because we don’t provide an equitable service regardless of Agent or Zone.  Same goes for a set payment which has the additional problem of the actual exchange of the items in question.  If the deal you arrange is too sweet then the Buyer and Seller may get very unhappy if they talk during the exchange and find out that you made 50% on the deal.  Of course you could just buy the item from the seller once you find a Buyer but that would require a lot of start up capital.<br>
<br>
2.“Guild fees seem steep”.  <br>
<br>
It is all relative.  Would you rather have 500pp after paying 500pp in fees or would you rather have nothing.  The strength of the Guild would be the network.  This requires coordination, which costs time and money.  The Guild is offering its agents a connected network of markets around the world.  All you have to do is type, negotiate price, and provide the connection.  You don’t have to sit still or travel abroad.  It would be cake.  Also, I was just throwing out a number on the fees.<br>
<br>
3.“Guild fees go towards what exactly”.  <br>
<br>
This system requires several key personnel to make it work.  The Pit Boss must be organized and cannot do anything else while on duty.  He must keep a record of all Buy Orders, Sell Orders, and completed transactions detailed by agent and amount.  The Pit Boss is the centerpiece otherwise you would have 50 agents in the field working their own list in a global manner that would lead to spammed guild speak and lose of control.  Before logging off the Pit Boss would submit his records to a V.P. of Operations in charge of coordinating successive Pit Bosses as well as recruiting new Agents.  You would need a CFO who would use the records to calculate fees and commissions.  The CFO would also be in charge of collecting the fees and distributing the commissions (think Druid with port and sow). There would be more needed of course but all these people would need to be paid for their service.   Salaries would be public notice and majority approved by Senior members.  The rest would go to a fund that could be used as the Guild wishes (finance a library of uber equipment that could be checked out by Guild members for raids).  I am not trying to make anyone a millionaire.  As far as enforcing commissions goes, the only punishment you can dole out for fee avoidance would be de-guilding.  I am sure some will be dishonest in the short run but if you are a long run thinker then you will realize the future potential of good membership with the Guild.<br>
<br>
Addressing your ideas:<br>
1.“Guild set up to promote business”.  Obviously I agree.<br>
2.I agree with everything stated about membership, ethics, and reputation.<br>
3.I agree, membership should not be limited to Mains.<br>
4.“No fees for belonging to the guild exists as the guild has no costs associated with it”.  O.k., here I disagree for the reasons stated above.  But in general, no cost to join. Pay as you complete deals.  This would not be that hard for Agents.  Keep your eyes open, send out orders over the auction, negotiate when needed, and pay your fees once a week.<br>
5.“No price wars between members”.  With a standard commission this would be a none issue.<br>
6.“Changes must be ratified by 2/3 majority” No problem there.<br>
<br>
The main thing I was considering when formulating this was “how easy could you make it for agents in the field”?  This is pretty simple yet could be very profitable to anyone, any level.  Sure, the details at the top would require work, coordination, and RL communication but it would also be a lot of fun (if you enjoy this sort of thing). <br>
<br>
Herder, again, thanks for responding.  If you like, we could exchange Phone numbers and discuss it more in depth.  I would appreciate anyone’s comments or suggestions.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Roddingham <br>
<br>
P.S. All of the above was stated using my original train of thought.<br>
<br>
Second thoughts:  Herder, you could be right or at least more right than me.  A simple system of agents charging their own commissions for helping to make a connection on one end would be far easier.  No fees. No pit bosses. No VP of Op, No CFO, and no whatever else.  It would literally be a group of people using Guild speak to buy and sell things on a Global scale.  I know most Guilds already do this to an extent but we could be known as the Guide to contact when you need something bought or sold fast.  You would still have to make sure you have good coverage of a lot of zones.  Having 50 agents in 10 zones competing for the same business at different commission amounts could be a bad problem but you could overcome that with a standard percent.<br>
<br>
My original idea is probably too complicated and that is probably why no one else responded. So maybe we should start with your modification and go from there.<br>
<br>
Is anyone else interested? <br>

The whole idea of a guild dedicated to buying/selling would be the people itself and as the individuals grow and prosper, the guild would too I would think.<br>
<br>
As far as one person coordinating sales/buys etc, I think you open yourself up to corruption but I think that way about everything.<br>
<br>
I would be interested in putting an alt in this guild. <p>Herder
