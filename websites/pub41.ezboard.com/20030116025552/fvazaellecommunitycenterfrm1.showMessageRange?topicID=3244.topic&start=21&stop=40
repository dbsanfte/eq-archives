MITCH ALBOM: America's year of loss, courage, unity, strength <br>

<br>
<br>
A message to Osama bin Laden on the one-year anniversary of his terror: <br>
<br>
You failed. <br>
<br>
If you are dead, you failed, because you are not in some blessed place, sitting under the Yum Yum tree. You are in a corner of hell reserved for murderers. <br>
<br>
And if you live on, you failed, too. Because you are hidden in some cave in a forsaken corner of the world, forced to recognize the truth: What you sought to weaken, you fortified. What you sought to terrorize, you emboldened. <br>
<br>
How does it feel, to have so woefully miscalculated? We are smarter, stronger, more aware and more involved. We treat our neighbors with more patience and our country with more love. <br>
<br>
If you sought to destroy our spirit, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you sought to destroy our will, you failed. <br>
<br>
And if you sought to destroy our institutions, you failed, big time, even on the very day you had the advantage. One of the four planes you stole last Sept. 11 did not even make its mark. It was retaken by passengers who proved there is no need to fear you or your cowardly henchmen. With two words, &quot;Let's roll,&quot; that plane was driven into the ground, and instead of taking down a monument, it became one. Its Pennsylvania crash site is an inspirational place. <br>
<br>
For us, not for you. <br>
<br>
You gave us something to feel good about. <br>
<br>
How does it feel? <br>
<br>
You failed. <br>
<br>
If you planned on demoralizing us, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you planned on dividing us, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you planned on destabilizing us, we're still here. Our streets, our schools, our government, our freedom. You, on the other hand, lost your sand lot. You lost your real estate. You lost your roof and your umbrella, your shelter from the storm, you lost something all of us can claim, but you no longer can. You lost your home. <br>
<br>
You lost your friendly host, the Taliban. You lost caves and training camps and what little infrastructure you had. You scatter with a breeze, leaving maps and tapes and bags and boots as you race for a place to hide, a bug scampering behind the refrigerator. Do you think people are inspired by such flight? Do you think people admire it? <br>
<br>
If you sought to command respect, you failed. <br>
<br>
And if you sought to affect our patriotism -- well, you couldn't have done much worse. In a single day, thanks to your heinous act, this nation transformed, from a people who saw their country as a place worth enjoying, to a people who saw their country as a place worth saving. <br>
<br>
You made us fierce. You made us united. You made us mad, and that's a deadly thing to do. <br>
<br>
But if you sought to make us fear you, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you sought to make us respect you, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you sought to make us listen to you, you failed. Most people don't even bother with the translation of your cryptic messages anymore. We flip channels. We move on. We ignore your hate. <br>
<br>
If you sought to win converts, you lost. <br>
<br>
If you sought to make things better for your people, you lost. <br>
<br>
If you sought to rally Muslims to your warped and pathetic view, you lost more than you can calculate. Life has rarely been worse for those who follow your religion. They are scrutinized, harassed, singled out and picked on. They hate this. But they hate you more for bringing it upon them. You did not gain their allegiance, only their wrath. <br>
<br>
If you sought to unnerve us, you lost. <br>
<br>
If you sought to undermine us, you lost. <br>
<br>
If you sought to put a permanent dent in the American economy, well, look again. The airlines are still flying. Wall Street still functions. Your financial flow, on the other hand, has never been more scrutinized. And while we haven't shut off every faucet, we've shut a few. The world is not your ATM anymore. <br>
<br>
How does it feel? <br>
<br>
If you dreamed of victory, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you dreamed of domination, you failed. <br>
<br>
If you dreamed of Muslims on one side, Westerners on the other, you failed. <br>
<br>
And if you dreamed of glory and righteousness and, most of all, your god's blessing -- you do not have it. No matter how many times you invoke his name, you do not have it. No god loves you. No god forgives you. No god blesses you. No god condones you. <br>
<br>
Today we remember your day of destruction, but not you. Today we honor those who fell, but not you. We suffered that day, we suffered and we grieved, but then we did what we do best. We came back stronger. We came back united. We stood up straight and resolved more than ever that our way of life is precious and true and loving and right. <br>
<br>
We buried our dead. We mourned for them. Today, we remember. But tomorrow, the world goes on. <br>
<br>
You failed, bin Laden, in every important way. It is one year after your fire in the sky. We've cleaned up our ashes. <br>
<br>
The only ones left are yours.<br>

Perhaps more so the people of the Uniformed Services of NYC.  The FDNY, The NYPD, The Port Athority, the others who helped out and died doing their job, trying to save people who merely showed up for work on a day that was to be like no other.<br>

<br>
Everytime I think for more than a few seconds of the plane where the people fought back, I cry.  I do because with them, and all those who died trying to help those in the towers, are all REAL heroes.  Something that's been hard for me to see in our society.<br>
<br>
I believe in what those people did, and the society that has produced those people.  Being a strong, proud Canadian, there's much about American laws and culture I disagree with.  But at the basis, at the core, our cultures agree on individuals being as free as possible to live their lives.  <br>
<br>
To any who doubt it, Canadians supports the USA as strongly as the American people do on this day, and in anything that is likely to come from it.  People have died, and will likely die in defense of our values.  Everyone who has and will, willl be remembered by countless Canadians like myself with tears and pride.<br>

Hey Wyndy, I love this country but I dont agree with everything the government says. Does that mean I can come to your house and smash your head in? I know your innocent and dont deserve it but what the hell the government pissed me off so its Ok if I kill you right?<br>

You have the right to disagree with us, but we do not have the right to disagree with you.<br>
In my opinion, posting the post you posted today, is proof you are one of the most insensitive people walking the face ot the earth.<br>
No one asked what you believe in this post. This was not the place or the time for your opinion.<br>
This post was supposed to be in rememberance, not a bash.<br>
It was supposed to be a show of support, look at the title.<br>
Imagine going to a funeral and looking down at some mothers child, laying dead in a coffin and saying, &quot;Twas her dadss fault for calling her to cross that street right there.&quot; In front of the mom.<br>
Maybe you are right, who cares, that was not the time nor the place to do it nor war this.<br>
So please do not dare insult us by saying it is okay to disagree with us but we cannot disagree with you.<br>
Those people died so you can disagree with us, each and everyone of them did.<br>
Now respect them enough to save your comments for another time or another post.<br>

I'll never forget either. Having 22 years service as a volunteer firefighter and 18 years service as a paramedic I know how those rescuers felt that day. Some knew they were going into buildings that would eventually collapse. But it's our duty that we swore to protect and serve the public. <br>
<br>
Emergency services personnel usually do not fear what they must do. We train in what to do in these cases. But when the tide turns as the quote below states. Then Emergency Services personnel worry.<br>
<br>
One FDNY firefighter was quoted as saying when the 2nd plane crashed. &quot;Their trying to kill us&quot; This I will always remember.<br>

Wyndigo,<br>
  I understand your opinion that the US government policy attracted terrorism.  I do not share it.  I am of the opinion that every man and woman on this planet is responsible for his OWN behavoir.  US policy may be warped, but we're not the ones financing people to fly planes into buildings.  What was done was not in response to US Policy, it was done <br>
<br>
  I understand your opinion, I disagree with it.  In the true spirt of patriotism that I feel (no, not BLIND patriotism, not UNTHINKING patritiosm, not the flipside of the mob mentality I mention above) and in the true spirit of honoring those who have died to protect BOTH of our rights I salute and defend your voicing your opposing views.  <br>
<br>
  I do think this is the wrong thead to do so, however.  Please keep this as a memorial for the people in New York, Philly, Washington who died.  Take the discussion of the ideaology of why they died and how we keep it from happening again to another thread.  We all NEED to consider these but not here. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282269">Beltalek Stormborne</a><BR>Sorcerer of Unyielding Power, Vazaelle

<br>
  Umian, are you referring to all the innocents that have recently died in Afghanistan, as battle statistics?  Or the ones that have died in the past under the Taliban Regime?<br>
  Do you think that when we mourn for the 1000's of people here, that it doesn't include the fact that their deaths have started a major landslide of horror?  There will be 1000's more dead before this is all over, maybe 10s of thousands.  I mourn each and every one of them, except the evil motherfuckers that started it all because of some crazed fanaticsm.<br>
  Do you think the deaths will stop if America just stands back and lets it happen?  <br>
   Tell me of anytime that the amount of people that we lost in one single terrorist incident was not mourned by their own people? You can't because it's never happened. Tell me also that you can watch the towers crumple, hear the words "lets Roll" as men sacrifice themselves for the lives of many more, and think about that pilot in the airplane that was being forced to kill his countrymen by flying into the towers under threat of a knife.  Tell me you can think of all that and not mourn with us on the anniversary of the worst  day any of us have ever experienced? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3244.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3244.topic&start=41&stop=53>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=3244.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=3244.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3244.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.threadControl?topicID=3244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3244.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3244.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">Planes of Power<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
