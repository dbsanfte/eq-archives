Basically the Government has about as much right to dictate to you the terms of a Civil marriage as the Pope does to dictate the terms of a Catholic Marriage. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The only real reason to keep government involved in marriage is that there are complex legal repercussions of this union.  While marriage sometimes (certainly historically and currently not always) starts with love, and usually (but not always) involves a religious ceremony, in the end it is a grand civil contract.  It has implications in property, legal guardianship over and access to children, power of attorney, inheritance, shared government and job benefits and responsibilities...well I guess I really don't have to try and list em all, most people know this.<br>
<br>
You can never remove the State from marriage due to the legal nature of that contractual union.  The mechanisms of legally working out the consequences of changes to or breaches of that contract are entirely in the Judicial branch of government, and I certainly wouldn't want some church council working them out.<br>
<br>
While it might burn the butts of people who see nationwide legal marriage for non-heteros as increasingly inevitable, well heres a tissue.

<br>
Two people can be married in their backyard by their great uncle if they want to be.  It depends on your interpretation of marriage.  If two people are sentimental enough, they could perform a very serious rite in which they declare each other eternally belonging to the other.  The reason it's not often done is because society's perception of marriage is doing it with the legal bind that comes along with it.<br>
<br>
In the end, nobody can dictate your marriage unless you want to do it in the civil sense, as Ayiar noted.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=backster>Backster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 404<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/03 11:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=122.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abolish Marriage</span><hr size=1> In Canada the government does have the right to dictate the requirements for marriage, for all the reasons Sauria stated - it has legal implications.  The government is bound by the constitution, however, and our Supreme Court just ruled that it was unconstitutional to make distinctions on access to marriage based on the sexual orientation of the individuals.  Creating a separate label with all the legal ramifications of &quot;marriage&quot; such as a domestic partnership registration, was similarly found unconstitutional.<br>
<br>
The government was just in the midst of a cross country set of hearing to get public feedback on three options:<br>
<br>
1) do nothing and leave marriage opposite sex only (found to be unconstitutional since then)<br>
<br>
2) create a domestic partnership regime (found to be unconstitutional since then)<br>
<br>
3) change the definition of marriage to include same sex couples (legislation being drafted to do just that being referred to our Supreme Court to determine its constitutionality as we speak)<br>
<br>
4) get out of the business of marriage altogether - this was the most novel route and one which was liked by neither the social conservatives or liberals - the conservatives wanted to maintain &quot;marriage&quot; as an important legal institution and the liberals insist that important legal institutions need to be equally available to all.  <br>
<br>
The gay and lesbian community had little desire to be seen as &quot;killing marriage for everyone&quot; so doing away with the state's involvement in marriage was not seen as a good outcome. <br>
<br>
On a side note, the concern that Adam and Steve will encourage little Johnny to be a homosexual is premised on it being preferential that Johnny become a heterosexual.  Given the equality guarantees under our constitution, based on recognizing the inherent self-worth of all individuals, encouraging heterosexuality is not a legally justifiable goal of the state.<br>
<br>
As America's Justice Scalia would say, &quot;&quot;the court has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just a little Canadian perspective on where we're at compared to the US.<br>

They're dictating the type of marriage in which you are legally bound together.  They're not dictating marriage if you want to go to a beach with 10 friends and agree before them that you and the person you're binding to will be forever loyal and faithful to each other, and support each other.  Legally, that may not be considered married, but it's marriage to the couple involved as well as the witnesses.  <br>
<br>
Marriage itself is not dictated, it's the basis in which your marriage exists.  The legal system merely disregards what someone claims to be a marriage that is not legal for practicality purposes.  For instance, you could enter a child custody proceeding and claim to be previously married, but if it was not legal they merely disregard it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=backster>Backster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 405<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/03 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=122.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abolish Marriage</span><hr size=1> Heh, I'm a lawyer so I was talking about legal &quot;marriage&quot;.  <br>

My understanding of the question was &quot;What right does the state have to dictate the terms of marriage?&quot;, so my discussion was with respect to the legal implications and legal analysis of &quot;why&quot; the state is involved in civil marriage.<br>

Outside the legal setting, you can marry your dog by saying &quot;i marry roo&quot; but it doesn't make it true from a legal perspective.

Most of the homosexuals i know seem to think that its unwise to allow themselves marry due to the vagaries of homosexual life, lots of partying, and a pretty open sexual life.  Not entirely a bad thing really, either gay or straight.  Sure there are thos couples that last a long time, and by all means they should marry. But for others, it makes little real difference in there life, aside from another 'trapping of normalacy' which only further alienates gays from the a large group of people, and really makes no difference to the rest of the planets population.(if last sentence threw u, reread it, it makes sense)<br>

This is actually what I'd like to see happen in the US.  Get the government completely out of the marriage business, and remove the implications of marriage currently in our legal system.  Then people could choose to define marriage any way they want, and it would have no effect on the government from a financial point of view.<br>
<br>
As it is now, the government does have a reason to care about marriages.  It affects estate taxes, income taxes, health decisions, and many other aspects of our lives from a legal point of view.  We need to extricate the government from marriage, something which is really none of the government's concern.<br>

Impossible, Civil marriages are a contract, just the same as if you've written down a contract to purchase 35 bars of gold by December.  You can be in breach of said contract, and hence the legal system HAS to be involved if one contradicts the breach.  There are also certain obligations inherint in the contract.<br>

I won't bother touching on your tax issues, since they really aren't that involved with marriage with the possible exception of the old tax &quot;penalty&quot; for being married. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Say you and your partner have been together 40 years,<br>
neither of you has any family left to speak of, and something happens that puts your partner in a vegitative state. You know that he/she doesn't want to be left that way, but you (according to the law) have no call in that desision. Hell the hospital doesn't even have to let you visit because you are not considered immidiate family. That's fucked up right?<br>
<br>
Now say he/she dies, you have no right to survivor benefits, property will not transfer to you unless they had a will, and if some nephew that your partner had never met comes crawling out of the woodwork they could legally take what should be yours. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am not a lesbian, but I do know and am related to many homosexual people.(so are most people wether they know it or not) They are normal people like any other couple and should receive all they rights and benefits of marriage. Period.<br>
Marriage should not be abolished, but it should include every man and woman who want to get married.<br>

I don't think there should be special legal benefits for people because they marry.  I think if you want to designate someone to receive your property when you die, you should make a will.  If you want to designate someone to make medical choices about you, you should draw up a power of attorney and living will.  Etc...  I think that our legal system as is favors people who marry, i.e. people that follow a religious tradition, and I don't think the law has any business in that.<br>
<br>
Your argument is that marriage is a legal contract.  That's my whole point.  It is a legal contract, but I don't think it should be.  It should be a religious ceremony and should have no more legal importance than one's first communion.<br>

If one person is on the deed, he/she keeps the house.  If we wish to have some more complicated set of instructions on how to deal with divorce, we'd have to set that up in advance, and it could be anything we agreed upon<br>
<br>
Children are separate from marriage.  The courts would still have to decide that, married or unmarried.  Marriage really does nothing to make the problem of who gets the kids any simpler, and it has no bearing on your claim on children.  That's all about DNA.<br>

I'm sorry.. I read this and can't stop laughing.  So what would you suggest?  To decide who gets the child we draw guns at 50 paces?  The reason marriages are civil now is because of the complexities surrounding divorce and divvying up of the marital assets.  The mitigating circumstances, etc.. etc..<br>
<br>
If there wasn't legal bindings surrounding marriage, divorce would compromise nothing more than who can disappear from the house with the most assets before the other one thinks to do it first. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Who gets the children has nothing to do with marriage.  It has to do with DNA.  If there is a married couple, or an unmarried couple, there is no difference legally speaking in how children would be divided.  Marriage has no bearing on right to custody of children.<br>
<br>
As for items, it would be dealt with just like any other 2 people living together that aren't married.<br>
