<br>
Five of my friends were headed down to CT to camp some items. Being short a cleric, someone in the group invited a person named 'canyaresme'. Ok, whatever... lets go check this out, I said to myself.<br>
<br>
Since we were the only ones in the zone, we decided to do the Planks. After a few hours of camping we have obtained one earring. The cleric says she has to go. Ok, lets do loot and evac to zone.<br>
<br>
The leader of the group asks, Does anyone have a problem with NBG?... everyone but this, canyaresme, person agrees with it. In the spirit of not making her feel bad we decided to just go ahead and roll.<br>
<br>
~~~ I'll interject a little info here about the group<br>
<br>
The group consisted of 4 of my guild members (Monk, SK, Shaman, Enchanter of UL), a guildless wizard, and the cleric (canyaresme of AoA)<br>
<br>
While we saw her say she wanted to roll on the item, in our guild chat the non melee people said if they win they will give it to one of the melee. So, that being said... we had a pretty good chance of wining the item on the roll, and rightfully so, having a melee in the group get the earring.<br>
<br>
~~~ ok back to the story<br>
<br>
She seeds, we all roll, she wins.<br>
<br>
Instead of bringing it up in the group, I sent personal tells trying to bring some light to her little world that the item rolled on was for a Melee character. After a good 10 mins of discussion, her final reason for rolling on the item was to give it to her b/f. She said he would never get one if she didn't get every group she was in to let her roll.<br>
<br>
My response to that was to get her lazy ass monk b/f to come down and spend his time camping the thing instead of stealing some other melees work.<br>
<br>
And, in case you don't know, there is another item that drops down there for the casters... so she was not down there for nothing. Obviously the melee would not have rolled on the FT3 boots if they dropped.<br>
<br>
~~~~<br>
So, I know what your thinking.<br>
<br>
We all agreed to roll on the item and had a fair chance at it.<br>
<br>
1. We did not agree at all to let everyone roll, but as stated above, we were trying to be nice and use our odds to win it instead of putting that greedy cleric in her place.<br>
2. A casters at the high end game should be well aware of what items go with what class and should have some ethics when deciding on what to roll on.<br>
<br>
That is the first and last time I will be grouping with Canyaresme. I would suggest that you stay away from this one as well if you want to improve Your character at all.<br>
<br>
Also, I hope the monk that wears this earring holds his head up high knowning he didn't do jack shit to earn it.<br>

You knew if you gave her a chance to roll that she could win. If you didn't then you are naive.Then you tried to convince her to agree to nbg by guilting her which was shitty. Pickup groups typically have to agree on the loot system and you did.<br>
<br>
While I appreciate your sincerity in rolling to help a friend I can't say that canyaresme is greedy at all.<br>

As it stands, the only one that deserves to be flamed is you.  Not only did everyone agree to rolling for the item, but you went ahead and gave the winner guilt trip tells.  Nothings worse, ever in any situation, then winning some loot and getting hate tells for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubududan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bududan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#333333>(4/29/02 10:20:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=535.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A greedy cleric</span><hr size=1> I won't bash canya beyond saying this...She is greedy, but so are a LOT of peeps in the game, regardless of lvl..lol..Just move on, and continue camping CT..good luck getting another earring )<br>

Learn it, live it. If they want to give it to their b/f or sell it in EC that is their business. They contribute just as much to the group as anyone else and should have equal rights to the loot. NBG doesn't work when you don't have the same group of people with you every night. <br>
<br>
It really blows when you go to some pickup camp and all you do is rotate out melees who are going to nbg whatever the hell is going to drop. Jade mace, rbg, or your earring. <br>
<br>
Now if there is an equal distribution of caster and melee loot then NBG can actually work but you have to establish that before the group starts killing stuff. Saying that IF the FT3 boots woulda dropped your melees wouldn't have rolled is real sweet of ya... considering they never dropped. <p><img src="http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/27/27446/pages/62703/lobaksig2copy.jpg" border=0></a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/unosothedruid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Noso the Druid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(4/29/02 10:31:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=535.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A greedy cleric</span><hr size=1> NBG in a pickup group is stupid unless its no drop. period.<br>

I see nothing wrong with a caster rolling on a non no-drop item, the cleric worked just as hard as you.. <br>
<br>
I think you are the greedy one for trying to guilt someone out of an item they worked to get as well, who cares if they will &quot;use&quot; it, or sell it, she won it that seems to be the only point here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uharrow187.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harrow187</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#333333>(4/29/02 11:00:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=535.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A greedy cleric</span><hr size=1> And you point is what? to show everyone how dumb ass you are?<br>
<br>
As soon as a I make or join a group I determine/ask the loot rules. You didnt tell her rules up front? And your supposedly 60? Helllloooo McFly!<br>
<br>
I'm sure you all laughed to yourself in guild how the cleric had no chance for the item, but then she won and you get mad? Using loot rules you agreed too? And you come here to flame her? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!<br>
<br>
*puh* - the greedy ones appear to be you. Bet you werent bitching while all those heals and uber-buffs were cast on your asses! She worked just as hard as you did for that earring and deserved an equal shot at it! Especially if no rules were established up front.<br>
<br>
I always find it amazing how loot rules change or get modified once something drops thats uber-valuable (i.e. &quot;Oh, well I know we said we'd roll on good drops but this is REAL nice and think NBG is the way to go - and *LOOK* I happen to need it more than anyone here *SHOCK*&quot;).<br>
<br>
I think the real person to avoid grouping with is you and your guild. AoA has a great rep for their peeps and how they comport themselves. Unknown Legacy has no rep that I'm aware of but appears to be acquiring one.<br>
<br>
As for what Can wanted to do with it... well she won it and MY GOD... what a bitch! She wants to give it to her b/f instead of selling it! The Nerve! puh-lease! I hope he wheres it with pride and tells the whole server that his g/f risked her ass in CT to get it for him!<br>
<br>
I'm curious as to how much of your gear was garnered by rolling for an item and keeping/trading/selling same. And save the breath, I'll do it for you:<br>
<br>
&quot;All of my gear was gotten as NBG and I *NEVER* rolled on or took something that I couldnt use- ever- cross my heart- etc etc&quot;<br>

The six of you worked towards anything that dropped. For something to drop that a person in the group can use to better his character is awesome.<br>
<br>
Why would you be so greedy as to take that away from someone? Are you too caught up in how much plat you can get from an item? or That you know someone that can use it, but they can't get it themselves?<br>
<br>
Most of you said we did not esstablish loot rules when the group was formed. Your Right. I, at the high level game, just assume people are above the immature greed and would love to see someone acutally trying for an item get it. (and not in this case some weak monk that gets stuff handed to him by his greedful g/f)<br>
<br>
I know some of you won't understand this because you are in a higher level guild that items drop better than what you currently have daily. Some of us preffer grouping with friends and actually working up to something good.<br>
<br>
Some of you stated that she was there working just as hard as everyone else in the group. That she was. Her reward? Like everyone else.. exp. Also like everyone else.. a chance at loot. Knowning whats drops down there, you would only assume that the melee would get an earring if it dropped and the casters the boots. OBVIOUSLY. Whats so hard about that?<br>
<br>
Yeah Yeah...<br>
&quot;its easy to say that since the boots didn't drop&quot;<br>
well, believe what ya want there, but not everyone is like her.<br>
<br>
If you recall above, everyone agree'd on NBG when the issue came up, (uh huh, it should have been when the group started) except her. Which included 3 casters and only 2 melee. I didn't see those other casters bitching about not getting there loot. Well guess what... it didn't drop, the melee item did. Sorry. You got good exp, should be happy with that.<br>

So that &quot;3 other casters&quot; BS does not hold water.  Obviously, had a 6th friend been available, you never would have invited this cleric; or maybe there *was* a 6th friend and you left them standing at the bank because they were not the right class to camp the loot you wanted that session.  Either way, you needed a certain class and invited someone to propel you towards your goal.  How very efficient of you.<br>
<br>
She did not know you all, apparently, so why in God's name would she assume that any of you had legitimate NBG claims anyway?  For all she knew you might've camped 20 of these earrings already and sold them all.  She has every right to expect to roll for a fair shot.  Your group played it fairly and rolled, and you had a 5 out of 6 chance of getting the earring amongst your group of friends but you lost it.  Things didn't turn out quite the way they were supposed to, eh?  Your 5 friends were supposed to win the roll with those odds and the cleric was supposed to go her own way having served her purpose, right?<br>
<br>
Waah.  Apparently the rest of your group could handle the actual outcome, but oh no, not you, you had to harass her about it.  What a complete.....do I even need to say it?  <br>

That's why I barely ever do pick up groups. <br>
<br>
Today what started as a group of friends eventually ended up being partly a pick-up group. We played in chef/bar in seb all afternoon. Mrylo helm is one of the many drops we get. Does my rogue get it? Nope. I ended up buying it off the guy who won because not everyone agreed with NBG. Sure I was a little upset, but it will always be like that when you group with people you don't know.<br>
<br>
Besides, if you have 5 friends and one invite, the invite ALWAYS wins the roll! I think it's coded in the game somewhere. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uavelynn01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Avelynn01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(4/30/02 1:48:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=535.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A greedy cleric</span><hr size=1> haha 5 against 1 and she won the roll and you get all bent and call her greedy.<br>

Next time make rules beforehand, not give someone a ration of shit becuase you got greedy and didnt want to share the spoils of group.<br>
<br>
So be happy you might have lost out on a earring but you did get exp !<br>
