<br>
When Cursed was up, it made sense to do him. You couldn't have enough Bloodfrenzy's unless every tank had. We still had tanks who needed Bloodfrenzy until one of our last kills I believe (last war to need was Banoin at the time I think?). Might have even been our last kill that he got it. Not totally sure, Baps or Zamtin would know better. Equipping tanks to be able to hold agro better is part of progression, even if it's a step backwards when it comes to which zones are &quot;more high end.&quot; Enraging Blow weapons don't grow on trees. There are still only 4 weapons with it as a proc. Two in Ssra, one in Kael, and the other from Tactics.<br>
<br>
And, as far as the &quot;made a guide/GM&quot; solve it, is your memory really that bad? It wasn't us who petitioned, it was you (as in PO, since you seem to be the type of person who will pick at details). We already had Glyphed nearly dead when Fubbik decided to GIVE UP the spawn. We wiped, rezzed, and did something else. You let it despawn, respawn, engaged, lost, and we killed it the next day, remember? <br>

I'm not criticizing you. I'm just pointing out that this thread is obviously a joke. It makes sense to do Cursed sure, but do you contend that KT or Aerin'Dar hold loot that even remotely compares to what drops in VT?<br>
<br>
The thread is about moving on, doing the same mob over 40 or 50 times is so not moving on. Thus the blatantly obvious joke.<br>
<br>
Again noone is criticing your tactics<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I mean, those kind of tactics are valid - they will piss you off if you're on the wrong end but they're valid, and effective.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Does KT hold good loot for a VT guild? No, but it's some of the best loot outside VT and it makes sense to keep it out of the competition's hands if you can.<br>
<br>
Does Aerin'Dar loot suck? Yep, but at the time you had Hoh to yourself, only a few BoT keys, and spells were dropping frequently in the zone. I would've kept it to myself if I could too.<br>
<br>
Bloodfrenzy? If having every tank with a Bloodfrenzy is that important, why not farm the easier mob to get them all Hategivers as well? Surely it didn't have anything to do with keeping his other VT quality loot out of the hand of a guild trying to gear up for Emp.<br>
<br>
All good reasons to kill mobs, noone is saying they aren't. So don't get your drawers drawn up you crack over it when it's mentioned.<br>
<br>
Whatever, I haven't played in over 6 months(Daddor has access my toon if you see it) and I'm off to test SWG some more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zamtin00>Zamtin00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/03 10:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4209.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Progression</span><hr size=1> I haven't read the last page but we really did only do VT twice once PoP was out, but that doesn't mean many people didn't wanna do VT. It's just because half the guild wanted progression and half wanted to farm a bit more because PoP loot sucked at the time. All we had to look forward to was Sol Tower minis, which is about 1/8 the RVR VT was. And that is a lot of Curseds, but remember Ssra was crashing about 3 times a week for a month there.. man that was fun. I think we got 3 in 1 day once. As for Cursed loot, it's way too good for a mob you could kill with 24 people even back then.. there was still cursed loot I'm sure CC members would have used til very recently... and shit Goldenrod still owns. All our new casters would *still* love Emperor Robes and Shawls too I'm sure, but we have priorities atm. <br>

Take for example the little things, have you noticed that the elemental bosses were all done in a certain order by all guilds? Fenin, xegony, coirnav rathe. Did they have to be done in that order? nope but why did everyone did them in that specific order? i could understand rathe being done last because of the bugged zone, but the zone it self before being classified as &quot;bugged&quot; was worked on last by most guilds. Was it because of the difficulty level? i doubt, because all these encounters are difficult if you dont know what you're up against, but becomes trivial after you figure out whats going on, and how, and what to do.<br>
<br>
So, Notice any trends yet?<br>
<br>
OK lets look at luclin. Take for instance seru who is killed as the last luclin boss by most guilds. His loots are arguably decent and worth killing for but he is killed after AHR by most guilds, even tho this encounter is doable w/o VT gears and is trivial before VT with low raid numbers. But, why is it done like that? it's because of the &quot;trend&quot; that most people follow, attempting encounters according to the capability level of the previous guilds that did it. <br>
And probably for this reason, is why we have alot of people stalling and farming equipment before they move on, resulting in alot of first time kills, or may we say overkills?<br>
<br>
Why most people play like this? <br>
Probably because they consider their time wasted if they were to take a chance against a new encounter, with the idea that they dont have what it takes? <br>
But imo time is only wasted if you spend it farming, as opposed to attempting new encounters and trying to figure it out on your own. You never know if you'll happen to figure out a strat that everyone over looked, making the encounter easier than it looks or atleast doable with less than it took others complete.<br>

Coirnav even tis blowable thus takes a few times to get to know, and 3 days wait till next tyr.<br>

Xegony requires keys, and a few ring events to get those keys.<br>

<br>
As my girlfriend and I xp in BoT daily for hours on end, I do my best to respect people's camps, ect.  However when people say they are camping Deep Earth and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>every</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mob at DE is up, clearly it is not camped, in my opinion.  At that point it becomes a race and your friends lost, simple as that.  I've lost races to Tashi and even other CC before but you don't see me crying about it.  Last time I checked,  Vaz was an FFA server.<br>
<br>
We have alot of fun going after the minis while in BoT.  Sometimes we get them, and sometimes they are camped.  Keep in mind that 2 of the 3 characters that I own are not CC (due to working hours) and ornate is a huge upgrade for them.  I also twink friends like Nenwen.  People who's accounts I use also xp with us and often win loot (like Niblan's c4 clicky pants.)  And only 1 in 100 minis drop ornate, most of the time you walk away with a Spectral or Rune if you are lucky.<br>
<br>
Also, the actions of the characters I XP are mine, not some &quot;blanket cc action&quot;.  All botted characters are AFK with a forwarding tell address.  <br>
<br>
I play EverQuest because it's something my GF and I both enjoy doing.  I also love XPing -- always have.  I despise quests, and tradeskills (though I am slowly working on baking -- 210 or so atm.)  Nothing gets my blood flowing like having 4-5 mobs in camp (when cups decides to go wild and pull) and watching the crew mow them down.  Taking down minis is also a blast.<br>
<br>
It'll be interesting when they remove the key restriction.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He wasn't even really in the form you know him as now til sometime last summer. On top of that PoP gimped him even more so like I said he's 10 man, before you needed about 4 groups, but BEFORE all the nerfs and all the other shit he was a challenging encounter. This is also why Seru was killed last. <br>
<br>
Zia summed up the above fairly well, imo. It took us about 5 weeks to get Xegony key because everything wasn't &quot;working as intended TM. Afterlife had been farming the stupidly easy xegony a month before it got retuned to not be easier than Terris Thule. Coirnav was known as bugged. Fennin was a complete gimp the first 3 times we killed him ( still is, just more hp ). That's why guilds took that path and well Earth... don't make me remember the horror, or I may do some crazy shit like cyber Birk. Now that everything is actually well &quot;WORKING&quot;, I'd say any order works but Fennin is still easiest and the Rathe is best to be done towards the end, just to save yourself the pain for the last.<br>

<br>
You mean this is why the vast majority of guilds killed Seru last, right?  Cause Afterlife killed Seru before any guild had killed Emp, from what I recall.. <br>
<br>
After that everyone gave up on the idea of Seru, realizing Emp was the key to VT, which is the real reason why everyone decided to do Seru last.  At the time, getting Seru bane and an Arx key was a pain in the ass, it was much more risk vs. reward to just plow through your VT keys and do Seru on your own timetable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prybutok@vazaellecommunitycenter>Prybutok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1902<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/1/03 5:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4209.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://prybutok.homestead.com/files/djprymini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> The real reason people don't kill Seru is cause his loots are very nice but all/all. <br>

Old buddy.<br>
<br>
Guilds progress at their own pace.  And really, there's no reason to want to be in elementals as soon as possible if your guild isnt hardcore enough to eventually kill the Rathe and move to Plane of Time.  Now we sit in elemental planes killing the same damn bosses every 3 days for nigh unto infinity, until we are geared to the bone and decide to guild an extra 30 people so we can take down The Rathe and the PoTime trials.<br>
<br>
Then we gear those new people... in the same fucking way.<br>
<br>
Progression will happen, but i much enjoyed the PoP content prior to elementals to the stuff we're doing now.  Bertox was a blast the first couple of times, Rallos was fun to learn (hint hint to a certain retarded guild out there, it's a lot more fun to learn the encounter and do it right than it is to zerg it with 85 people).  Agnarr was fun to figure out, but you get to elementals and all that challenge is pretty much wiped out.  Cheal chains on the MA again (sometimes SL) and some wizards and rangers.  /yawn.<br>
<br>
Triality has moved extremely quickly, to accuse them of farming old content seems a bit retarded, as I believe since PoP came out, they formed, and are now in Vex Thal and tier 3?  Not that far behind the speed of &quot;In Virtue.&quot;   They are a fairly solid guild that's moving up fast, i see them being in elementals in a month or 2 tops.<br>
<br>
Eternal Advocates farmed VT for a long time, they decided to go the route we didnt, and continue to block it from the next guild to kill the emperor and gear themselves up.  Not a stupid decision really, except now they dont get the attendance to move forward.  I'm sure their attendance will come eventually, but wouldnt place a bet on when they hit elementals at this point.<br>
<br>
Appotus Dominus has always been a slow moving guild.  They arent in it for the fast-paced race of the endgame, they farm the mobs their members want to kill, at their own pace, and they move on, eventually.  They dont really care to rush on from the members that i know there.  Although I have been told by a certain pretentious druid that he could have had a guild in elementals 5 months ago if he cared to.  /gasp =O<br>
<br>
Walkers moved pretty quickly into PoP imo.  They didnt move ahead in the way you'd probably consider &quot;Progression&quot; but they grabbed PoP pretty early for a guild of their tier.  Killed Grummus, pushed the quests and were like the 4th guild into BoT i believe.  And they continue to try new things and move forward in Planes of Power (Terris Thule etc... i know they've at least attempted).<br>
<br>
Agony, new guild, evidently a lot of members from what occured the other night.  I think they are jumping the gun on progression (killing RZ before you kill any of the previous flagging mobs doesnt seem all that &quot;progressive&quot;),  but they're definitely grabbing the expansion by the tail, even if they end up taking a ride or 2 around the block as they cling on to it for dear life.  I think they've killed TT and Behemoth, I'd imagine their leadership will realize bertox is a better first kill than RZ soon and they'll be in elementals in a couple of months too.<br>
<br>
Vazaelle is a low populated server.  In the endgame there arent enough clerics to go around right now.  We ended up killing RZ with 5 clerics, not to flex our uber nutsack, but because we had no choice.  On our best days we field 7, and on the bigger servers guilds are fielding 11-15 clerics for some events.  You wont ever have that kind of depth of certain classes on Vazaelle unfortunately, so as people come into the upper tiers, the classbase will spread out more, slowing down progression more, etc etc and causing a nasty cycle.<br>
<br>
We've done well for ourselves and at this point we have umm....<br>
<br>
2 guilds in elementals<br>
3 guilds in Tier 3<br>
2 guilds in Tier 2<br>
and multitudious guilds in tier 1.<br>
<br>
Stuff doesnt really stay up long at this point in time, but unlike some of the older servers, we get a lot more mobs per guild.  So at least the few people our server does have can get equipped quickly =)<br>

Or at least that is how it sounds to me.   The guilds on this server are no where near being as far along as all other guilds on other servers.   <br>
<br>
I believe another point he was making is that as far as progression goes I believe other guilds such as Triality, EA, and AD have the ability to be a lot farther along than they are atm.  Even PO could be farther along than they are given the context of time around and where you are now according to the perspective of this post.    <br>
<br>
I don't believe it is anyones responsibility though to tell a guild where they should be and how they should do it.  To think you are right and other are wrong in the way the game should be played is fucking gay.   <br>
<br>
The reason this logic is fucked is because there are many ways to do an encounter and one way is not going to make a differance over another.   Look at EA and AD when they were competing in ssra.   At the time the mobs EA were wiping to AD had done and the mobs AD were wiping to EA could do.   You can sit here and debate random faggotry all day and it won't change how people do things or how they progress.  <br>
<br>
One thing that will light a fire under people's asses are competition from other guilds which people here on Vazaelle have been fortunate not to encounter much cause of population.   I think people have it to good here sometimes.   People get the leisure of doing things on thier own time table probably the readon why people do farm old shit cause nothing pushing them out of the content.  Why not farm shit if you don't get headaches from it. <br>
