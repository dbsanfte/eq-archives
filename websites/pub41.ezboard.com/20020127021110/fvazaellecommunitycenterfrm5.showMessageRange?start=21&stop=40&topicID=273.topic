(Well, actually, just abortion, not rape.  You see, I never said that Luang wouldn't CONSENT to being fucked in the ass.  10% of American women will try anal sex sometime in their lifetime.  Not all enjoy it, of course.  I'm not sure what the prevalence is among Chinese mail-order brides, but i'm sure it's close to 10%.  Anyway, i guess i was promoting anal-sex.  Wait a minute, no..  Actually I was just encouraging Caillison to fuck Luang in the ass.  So I was really just promoting anal sex between members of a specific couple.  Hmmm.  You know, actually, when i think about it, I really wasn't &quot;promoting&quot; abortion.  I was merely saying how nice it would have been if the Chinese had continued this practice because it MIGHT have prevented the birth of Luang.  I then encouraged Luang's mother to have abortions if she ever again gets pregnant.  This would also have prevented Luang from being born and millions of other chinese girls wouldn't have to die.  So, even though I am pro-choice I would never intentionally push my views on anyone except for my intended targets:  Luang and Caillison.)<br>
<br>
Sorry, Sotae.  It sounds like you found my post to be extremely persuasive and difficult to ignore.  Please resist the urges i implanted in your mind.  You should make your own decision about abortion, genocide, and anal sex (if you haven't already).  My efforts were to convey this message to Luang/collision only.<br>
<br>
Hopefully everyone else influenced by my subversive promotions of abortion and child molestation will stop immediately and wipe all those harmful thoughts away.<br>
<br>
Sotae and I know how easily influenced these Mboard readers are.  I will discontinue posting such endorsements from now on.  I'd hate to be RESPONSIBLE for someone getting an abortion or having anal sex.<br>

I'm not sure how being a proponent of abortion is grounds for having posts removed, seeing as the practice is legal in the vast majority of countries.  So.. if being a proponent of abortion is disallowed, is being pro-life also disallowed, or is this board now limited to only belief systems and philosophies in which the moderators agree? Also, no mention of rape was ever made in any of the posts.  Anal sex with your 12 year old chinese wife, yes... rape, no.  I'll maybe spend a bit of time looking for abortion references to be deleted in the future.  Maybe I'll even make some of my own and see if this rule is an actual rule or a completely arbitrary decision because Karburan scored  a double bow crit on your 'get me offended' button. <p>Bammbi, the Ranger with the nice ass.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uqxired.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/01 10:09:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=273.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sticks and stones will break my bones, but... yea</span><hr size=1> there is no denying that Karburan is 100 percent right, but hey, thast just my thought <p>Quarken

..but when it comes to what Sotae removed?  No.  It's a good thing.<br>

Not only does this board have rules, ezboard has rules, and such content is not appreciated by them either.  If someone complained to an Ezboard admin about that post, it would have been removed, and this board may have received a warning.<br>
<br>
I don't think most users want a total FFA board, where anything goes.  Even if they do, I don't agree that is appropriate for this board, and I support the rights of the moderators to maintain this board as they see fit.<br>
<br>
Just because it didn't offend you does not mean that it does not offend and hurt others.  <br>

This is a community site, and has traffic from and should contain content appropriate to those of all ages, genders, and racial backgrounds.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umeiren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meiren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/01 11:53:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=273.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> But look at this way...</span><hr size=1> So we are censoring offensive material?<br>

Ok... tell me how, &quot;Fuck off and die pls thx.&quot; isnt offensive?  Sounds like some people would get offended.  <br>
<br>
One of my friends is offended by all the tri-negro references on this board.  He feels it is racist.  So should all those references be deleted?<br>
<br>
Gawd some of the things people said about Krystiana should have definitely been deleted.  Did they all get deleted?  No.  Why? Probably because the moderators didnt like her.  This is censorship based on personal preference.  Thats why it is bullshit.  Give a nice long list of what goes and what doesnt.  A consistent list that doesnt contradict itself, and Im sure there will be less bitching about this.<br>
<br>
I dont think I can ever support moderation of boards that is totally biased with the hammer being brought down at will.  How vague can you get with the label, &quot;offensive material&quot;.  Puh-lease.<br>
<br>
And if you are going to put the phrase, &quot;No editing&quot; under the title of the board, please, no editing.<br>
<br>
Because it is moderated and set up by them they should be able to delete whatever they want you might say.  Hrm... Im sure many infamous rulers down through history reserved the right to do what ever they wanted to their subjects.

The moderators do.  Not everyone will agree with their decisions.  I'm sure some people feel that this board isn't moderated enough, while others feel that it's moderated too much.  They draw the line, they decide what is and what isn't appropriate.<br>

First Karburan's post was removed for racism and sexism.  Turns out there was no racism and sexism.  Then it was removed for promoting abortion and rape.  If those were the real reasons then far more posts would have been removed so the only conclusion is that this is merely another excuse.  I don't think its too much to ask from a moderator that they give a clear and explicit description of exactly which words terms and phrases were 'beyond the pale' in any given post and describe exactly how this goes beyond the limits of this board as defined both by its moderators and by Ezboard.  If a moderator cannot provide a simple and clear explanation of just how a post breaks these rules then it seems likely that no rule was broken and in fact a moderator is merely personally offended.<br>
<br>
  Nobody is asking for a FFA board.  We would like to see the rules described more clearly and followed on a consistent basis.  If rules themselves cannot be clarified then a history of deleted posts and exact descriptions of the reasons for such deletions will gradually form a system of precedents which can be used to determine the acceptability of any given comment.<br>
<br>
  I don't beleive Karb's comments were removed for racism or sexism, for abortion or rape.  They pushed a button and did their intended job, to insult and offend like so many other posts on this board and so many other flame boards.  Perhaps a rule should be added such as 'offending one or all of the moderators is grounds for removal of the post and possible banning'. <p>Bammbi, the Ranger with the nice ass.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ahliana>Ahliana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/01 6:57:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=273.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> As a card carrying lesbian then, I must object to ALL posts on the board that make reference to &quot;gay&quot; in an unfavorable manner.<br>
<br>
Please go through the threads and remove those posts immediately.<br>
<br>
I cannot believe that while they are brutally murdering young gay people around the world that you would allow such jokes and comments on this board.<br>
<br>
I am appalled.  I expect you to go through each and every thread removing those references.  I am sure the time involved is trivial compared to evil message you will be eradicating.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I have contacted the people at EZ-Board so that they may monitor the extremely homophobic and potentially dangerous conversations going on here.   I would hate for you to receive a warning.<br>
