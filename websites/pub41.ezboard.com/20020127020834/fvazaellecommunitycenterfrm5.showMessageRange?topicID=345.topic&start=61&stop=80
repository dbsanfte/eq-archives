Lets say Munchkins of Mayhem. They would be so Uber now if all their ex piece of shit members didnt leave em. It was and is still a great guild.But they lost members one right after another because they wern't uber enough as the others and they almost even folded all together, even had a vote once upon a time to continue or not. But why would it come to that? Cause this server is fuckin jaded. I don't care what any of you egotistical power gaming RL evading fucks say. There are so many BETTER GUILDS then the fab four and the upcomming guilds. For some reason though they will never be uber. Why? Cause they actually believe  and hold true to what the game is really about. From reading the replys that were attacking Herder's post, why the fuck is it so wrong to not want to raid or strive to become egotistical like the other 55-60?<br>
<br>
 Ya know maybe it's me Herder and Tropics. Maybe we actually care how our friends are treated/act/and feel. Maybe it means more to us just to kill greens and shoot the shit then go marching off on some egotistical guildleading dickheads every whim.  I know I am gonna get super flamed for this rant, but eh so what. I get sick of that oh wait till you get to the planes bullshit, or you think your guild is ever gonna be able to do anythng now, who the fuck cares, it's my thoughts and comments. My main rant is the attitude of today's players<br>
<br>
Hey maybe I am jaded. I knew what EQ was like once upon a time. Maybe its me thats jaded in the end. Maybe I was spoiled when back in the day most had respect for each other and the shit that goes on nowadays didnt used to happen. Call it evolution call it genocide of the good guys who knows. But I know whats important to me, Herder to him, even IV&quot;S super pud jerking bitch of a member vehnn knows whats important to him. We all have opinions, its like religion and politics. You cant bash someone for thier beliefs or thoughts, so don't come on here acting high and mighty like your fucking special. Cause on this board we are all on the same playing field and we are all even. The main fucking problem with VAZ is respect for people. Hey like I said, old eq was different then this. I dunno if its cause majority of the pl,.ayers are kids now or just alot more fucking losers with no lives, but either way I guess I am jaded or I was spoiled, either one.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usilvirthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvir the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 12:45:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> I think we all missed the most important point of this thread.<br>

<br>
I joined my first guild in my late 40's.  I joined the guild ONLY because a very good friend of mine begged me to.  Long story short after awile I really loved the guild.  We were a &quot;social&quot; guild more than anything.  We were not uber, we didn't really &quot;raid&quot; but I had made a lot of friends.  The guild leader ended up leaving EQ for awhile and the guild folded.   It was a great guild with great people.  <br>
<br>
I stayed guildless for awhile trying to figure out what I wanted from EQ in general.  Most of my friends had scattered to many different guilds, started alts or stopped playing EQ, and I was having a hard time choosing where to call home next.  I made the decision to follow some friends to Hope's Beginning.  Again, I found a great guild with great people.  I really loved HB, it was a great guild.  But again the leader left and it merged with PO, where I am now a member. <br>
<br>
I have seen all the things Herder mentioned in all three of the guilds I have been involved with.  It happens, you either accept it and stay or you leave and move on.  I think it's a very personal choice you have to make for yourself.   I think you really need to know what type of guild you are joining.  Group with the members, go on raids, ask questions, read the guild boards.  The reasons people remain unguilded are as varied as the reasons people join a guild.  <br>
<br>
The funniest thing I have noticed about this thread is the question was asked of UNGUILDED level 46+ people.  The first one fitting that description to post was immediately blasted for his views by guild leaders/officers/former leaders etc.  Very amusing I must say. <br>

<br>
When I think about vazaelle in general I think about the GREAT players who have &quot;settled&quot; for shitty guilds.  Guilds where the rl clique gets all the loot, guilds led by MORONS, but.. great members out side of the leadership.  And this is my question to you people: why do you put up with it?  Why are you &quot;settling&quot; for a guild?  Why not get 10 of your friends and do it the right way?  YOU DONT NEED A GUILD FOR SAKE OF BEING IN A GUILD.  <br>
<br>
I got basically 1-55 without a guild, I got to know people in IV, they got to know me - and I figured out it was an excellent match, with great leadership and great members and a EQ philosphey I agreed with 100%.  I didn't &quot;settle&quot; at all, and if I found out while raiding or meeting members that IV wasn't the guild for me I wouldn't have persued membership.  You (in general) deserve better than being used to get the clique in charge loot, you deserve better than moronic leaders that don't have a clue, won't get better, and cause you to get 3 hours of sleep at night because you stay up late CRing constantly.  Take a minute to reflect on your guild situation.  If you're not 100% happy with your guild, grow a pair and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do something about it.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
One last thing: to all those people who say &quot;oh vaz sucks now that all the guilds are assholes and no one is nice anymore&quot; etc etc - fuck you.  The majority of the 55+ players are people who have had high level characters on other servers.  This server is no different than any other - because of human nature.  Those of you who came to vaz to make it your own personal utopia need to get a reality check.  If you're unhappy with the current state of vazaelle you're really unhappy with the game of everquest, because its the same fucking thing anywhere you go.<br>
<br>
And bish - I started playing around release as well.  And you know what: it was never any different man, you're deluding yourself if you think pre-rok days were that much better.

Psyknight was correct, it was totally uncalled for and I am truly sorry I wrote it.  I hope you can forgive me.  I was feeling persecuted for my opinions and developing a bunker mentality, however, there are no good excuses for that kind of statement.  It was an opinion and while I disagree, I can still respect it.<br>
<br>
Secondly, for the people who have stood up and said they have witnessed the injustices that happen within guilds, at great risk of stepping on toes, props to you.  I know that many people fear not getting in a good guild.  I think by this time you realize that if a guild doesn't want to treat you as an individual then it really doesn't matter anyway if they invite you, you're better off without them.<br>
<br>
Many people in game have asked me why I am not guilded.  When Jules posted his question I thought this would be a good time to outline why I remain unguilded.  While my choices may seem negative I have a solid reason behind them.  I don't look for a guild to do things for me, I look for a guild to do things with.  Its not a subtle difference.  <br>
<br>
Many people in this thread have accused me of being bitter.  I was in Promethian Order from Level 28 to 55.  I guess you could say I was one of the few remaining old timers.  PO has seen some very rough times. I stuck with PO, even when it seemed that PO was about to disband, and I think I was pretty essential in their regrowth.  I have seen internal fighting, an attempted coup d'tat and many other things that would have torn a lesser guild apart.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what anyone may think, I still think PO is a good guild.  Keadaian, while he has his faults, works very hard to provide a common source of fun for many members.  I disagreed with guild priorities, loot distribution, communication of guild objectives and guild growth but it never became a bitter issue.  I like to think that I still have friends in PO. <br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I still run into people in game who are amazed that I left PO because I was so discreet about it.  I left without fanfare or a big fuss.  No big post on a public board for the whole world to see.  Does that sound like a bitter guildie? <br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, I am not going to say what I want a guild to do for me because then I would be a user.   <p>Herder

I stayed guildless til 35. Played Meridian 59 and hated my guilds there, so didn't want to do it again. But my two best friends in EQ joined one and eventually, after MUCH cajoling on their part, I joined.<br>
<br>
I joined because of my friends. As long as they are members, I will be a member. Yes, I like xp and loot, but I like hanging out with Spankin and Florum a bit more. We've probably spent more time bonking, bsing, dieing, and emoting each other than leveling. I've watched them die as many times as they've watched me die. The 3 of us woulda been 60 long ago if we actually took it seriously.<br>
<br>
Coincidentally, it happens to be the guild Bishop helped found. He was, shall we say, semi-retired at the time and I only recently met him as he has returned to playing a bit more. Just about every post I've read from him both here and in the guild boards has been about friendship being more important than loot and xp. My kinda guy. <br>
<br>
So Bishop, although Vaz may not be the perfect utopian server you want, don't worry about it. There are some of us out there like you. And if most of the server happens to be looting xp hungry players, it'll just make you appreciate the ones who aren't even more. <br>

I wanna be level 60. I wanna have all my skills maxed. I wanna have all the best armor &amp; weapons. But if it doesn't happen, so what? After all, it is only a game. <br>

And yeah, Sbiship, I used to watch my bf play EQ way pre-ROK and IMO it was different. EQ has expanded A LOT. Verant will just keep on producing expansion after expansion, sequel after sequel, it's a very enviable, and viable ;p business model. Even though you may not realize it, I think that adding zones to Norrath greatly increases the immersiveness of the game. How can you compare the days when Naggy and Vox were THE DRAGONS vs now when you have Dragons and Other Uber Mobs everywhere you look? The level of &quot;competition&quot; totally changes, the goals of each EQ player changes too, (remember the pre-epic quest days?)and with that, the game changes. Players are pushed to &quot;experience this&quot; and &quot;experience that.&quot; And so EQ became the huge time-sink that it now is. Oh well.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uthumpslots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thumpslots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 11:00:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> Jules!!!!!!<br>

<br>
Communism works well in any smalled closed community that accepts it.  There are plenty of examples of real life communism at work, the most oft quoted being the Kibbutzes in Israel.  Guilds are a fairly good structure for communism as well.<br>
<br>
Herder left w/ a minimum of fanfare because he was clear as to what his difference of opinion was with me and a good portion of the rest of the guild.  It was a seperation that took some time to become clear, but we really were going in a different direction than he wanted to and over the course of a few weeks and many discussion in /gu it was clear to him and us that it was best for him.  As a result of his honesty and the open discussions, there was never any feeling of betrayal -- nobody had any reason whatsoever to doubt his reasons for leaving.  I have a lot of respect for him for being so forthcoming about it.<br>
<br>
I think there are a lot of people that read this that agree with much of what Herder had to say.  However, the way he phrased it, laced with Orwellian undertones, will keep many people from coming out in support of his poiints.<br>
<br>
Hell, I agree with some of what Herder had to say.<br>
<br>
I don't honestly think there is such a thing as a perfect method of dristributing high end loot.  I think there are good ways and bad ways, and even the good ways have flaws.  In PO loot is assigned by class leaders, division leaders or me, depending on the loot.  Most of the time there's a fair amount of discussion between the officers before it's awarded.  Sometimes we make mistakes.  I can think of several such instances.  In my heart of hearts however I think most members of PO know that the officers truly try to do what is best for the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
VI has chosen to make the high end game a situation in which you need multiple groups to face down a single mob.  By far the most effective strategy is to have a small number of warriors that take turns focusing the mobs aggro onto them.  It is far more mana efficient and workable to have all of the clerics keeping one tank standing then to have the mob rampaging from player to player.  Given that, if a guild wants to kill bigger and bigger mobs, it's critical that they have a small number of tanks that have as much AC as possible so they can stand toe to toe with the mob.  That means that if the guild wants to advance, the vast majority of uber tank loot is going to fall onto a few people.  And those are going to be the people that are there raid after raid... that have the time (note I didn't say dedication... you can be dedicated, but still have real life committments that prevent you from having the time) and the skills to be the main tank.  <br>
<br>
Let's take an easy example.  Yedelma, pos dragon in WW.  Has no AoE attack, pure melee mob.  If your main tank can hold aggro, the rest of your melee class could fight him naked w/ just a haste item and weapons and be 99% as effective as they would be in full ToV armor.  Why?  Because if your strategy is tight, only one person should be taking any melee dmg at all.  <br>
<br>
Obviously, most of the time it's not quite that simple.  Mobs have aoe's so everyone else needs to have the best resists possible.  The main tank might lose aggro for a second or two, so naked is not a great way to fight.<br>
<br>
As a guild you can choose to try to outfit all of your tanks equally... but you aren't going to make any progress that way.  You're going to be stuck killing the same mobs over and over and over again until people get bored and start leaving.  And sure, loot would be equitable then... But if instead you gear up your main battle tanks and move on to better things, everyone will have better gear in the long run.  Those that don't have the time to be the main tanks won't be first in line for uber loot... but if they're in a guild that can do end game mobs, at least they'll be in line.  <br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with deciding you'd rather go solo or stay in a more casual guild than to be warrior #10 or shaman #5 or cleric #999 in a large guild.  A lot of it depends on what you play for.  <br>
<br>
It's a tough balance.  It's something I struggle with as a guild leader.  I'm human and prone to error... prone to being influenced conciously or subconciously... But I continue to do the best I can and to want the best for everyone in my guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upsyknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Psyknight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 11:25:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/tx2/keithklier/images/spectre3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to all unguilded level 46plus here...</span><hr size=1> /wave Keleios! =) No, I'm not coming back, was just bored at work and had nothing better to do hehe. <br>
<br>
I dunno. I led a guild on Nameless from the time Gameless opened to the day Vazaelle opened. I think most of the negative attitude built around guilds have to do with the more successful guilds in terms of loot wise and the &quot;rat race&quot;<br>
<br>
My guild wasn't uber. We were a roleplaying social guild, at least originally. We had a very extensive application process and in the end, had a roleplaying event that included the entire guild for a quest type thing. Instead of us pushing levels to get to Hate, or something, we'd spend the entire night laughing in /gu while our applicant was trying to figure out the next part to the quest and run to guildmemberB to get the next step. It was great fun. Then as we grew and levels grew, the guild rotated towards raiding. I don't think some people understand how much the guild leader is actually led by the majority of the guild. If you don't do what the majority wants, people leave. I think this was the start of the downfall, the split between RP guild to Raid Guild. To keep your guild retention, you try to make them happy. <br>
<br>
I think for me personally, I don't think I've ever had a time where people didn't feel that they could speak their minds to me, regardless of loot. I think for one, because they trusted me as a person, and knew me as a friend. Each person, because we spent so much time and effort on their application process to get to know them on a personal level. I think on top of that, they weren't greedy about loot because it wasn't thought as an option in a roleplaying guild to get uber loot. Lastly, I think they understood the time and effort I put in to making the guild special for them and that I'd actually sit down and talk with each of them. Trust and communication is vital in any relationship, and must be constantly worked upon.  <br>
<br>
Well, as I learned what it was like to lead a raiding guild, I realized we needed class balance and levels. So, instead of roleplaying questing for joining, it went to recruitment for soandso levels for whichever classes. Clerics who were normally spending a few hours at the wall in Misty helping newbs and roleplaying with them, ended up spending 5 to 6 in Hate sweating not to screw a CHeal. Enchanters were begged to spend multiple hours and deaths to keep the raid rolling. New faces in the guild who had no intentions of roleplaying, but getting uber loot were in the guild and I think it created too much divergence too quickly. In the end, you had people one foot in, one foot out. <br>
<br>
If anybody asks if I was not fair on loot when it was distributed, I believe I was as fair as I could be, at least nobody, even after I was gone, bitched about how I did loot. Ask Moppin, who joined us on several consecutive Hate Raids, received a Indo BP even on top of my own guild's warriors. Though I kinda cringed, I felt I made the fair decision. <br>
<br>
Coming to Vazaelle, and shooting for the high end game, it just wasn't what I was looking for after I had aspirations about it. I just felt let down because I had high expectations. It's nobody's fault really but my own. I finally became disillusioned after I really delved in it. The guilds I was a part of, and even led in one case, were great people. I couldn't have asked for anything more than what they provided. I don't think it was the guild, I think it was my own expectations of how the high end game *could* be, and in reality, how different it was. <br>
<br>
The fact still remains, it doesn't have to be the way it is. But it takes a communal effort to change it to be a better situation. However, there will always be those who rely on the dissention and chaos to maintain power. A divide and conquer tactic. It works, but for me, it just makes me weary and sick of it. I just choose to bow out and find something funner to do. /shrug <p><b>Skeenk Da'Steenka<BR>

But since this has leveled out to a fairly civil discussion I would like to make a comment about Loot distribution.  First thing I want ya to do is log on to the EQ weapons and armor database at planeteverquest.com. Now pick out a class..hell even narrow it down to a race. Now start perusing equipment via their search engine.I'll save you the trouble..there is a SHITLOAD of equipment out there with all different stat bonuses and AC, and effects. My contention is that it is impossible to be completely fair and or make the most efficient placement of equipment to the proper personnel. <br>
<br>
 The guildleader position is a nightmare even with good personnel. And god forbid you make some bad recruiting decisions ! A leader has to stay on top of an incredibly immense and evolving game world, with changing mechanics and tactics.He has to properly equip an entire guild the best possible way he can.he has to schedule events while ensuring peoples RL schedules are considered and the proper classes are present.He has to schedule the order of those raids to best maximize progression of his peoples skill and equipment. All the while , keeping in mind different peoples varied levels of dedication to fellow members and the guild.Then he has to manage all the quirky personalities he has assembled and try  to keep them happy and feeling wanted. It would be  easier if the members stuck it out..cause eventually you will get to everyone. But alas, that does not happen. People leave for many reasons , and you are left starting from scratch with the new person that took his place.<br>
 Now take that stressed GL and put him in a Raid where he and his leaders are trying to manage  fifty things at once and ask him to know exactly what each person is wearing currently , compare it with a dropped item, sort out the greedy pricks that are JUST there for the loot and never help anyone else out for anything; and give it to the most deserving member or the member that will make the guild stronger as a whole. I say an impossible task to  do correctly all the time. And even when done correctly, it is  an objective decision. There will always be someone who feels somewhat slighted, even good players, with good hearts.( some are more vocal than others). This is natural, cause it is hard to sit thru a 5 hour raid and leave with nothing sometimes; even more so if the raid had some trouble along the way.<br>
  Now there are effective ways to manage a lot of these issues; Keadiaen(sp) touched on a few. I guess my main point , is that many people seem to expect  perfection from their guild. It is not gonna happen..EVER. Verant has made it necessary to operate  an efficient large scale guild in order to  attempt or complete all the challenges they have  set. Now while many gamers are more casual or are still exploring Norrath..other people have done all the old world and Kunark till they are bored to tears. The challenges they still want to attempt in this game require dedication, and organization. You can't see the results overnight though, and thats when people get frustrated and feeling used.  The Guilds that stick it out, are the ones that succeed. The people looking for instant gratification get fed up and leave. &quot;family guilds&quot; and the like are easier to manage, but those style guilds seldom end up on the rant board.<br>
  I don't know where I am headed with all this except to say,  more people need to balance their goals and expectations. This game is clearly not fun for many people, but they are too addicted to quit.Guilds should be a gathering of friends, hopefully skilled friends. But you cant put 50 random highly skilled players together and expect them to be succesful. You have to have friendships as a base or you will never survive the storms ahead.<br>

You have to acknowledge that strategy, I think anyone capable of needing that strategy learns the hard way that they need it.<br>
<br>
But there is one very valid problem with that strategy. A problem that I imagine frustrates many guild leaders. If someone is a melee character in your guild, and is not one of the 3 'main tank warriors', is their desire to see themselves in a support role for the good of the guild stronger than their desire to be more of a core person in that guild? A guild can always survive by cycling in new 'not-the-main-tank-but-i-do-melee-sometimes' warriors, paladins, and sk's but then it's just a revolving door. How do you make this slant of item distribution hold their interest in being active enough to attend raids without having them harbor a desire to slide into one of those spots? How do you remove jealousy and contention?<br>
<br>
I imagine it's a pretty damn hard thing to get done in any group large enough to have this problem in the first place. I'd wager this spreads around also. You need clerics to heal. I'm sure the druids (who already made their strongest contribution to the raid by porting everyone there and casting a pair of buffs) have a valid reason to feel second rate. I don't think anyone has doubts on whether or not you need a paladin, or any type of hybrid to get something done.<br>
<br>
It just comes down to needing a warrior in high ac gear to main tank and so the items have to get dumped in that direction at the cost of the other members of the guild.<br>
<br>
In the long run, everyone will have those items (assuming the guild is making the right choice and keeping things together) but is it really worth making your main tank 5% more effective by disappointing 5% of your guild ? [random number, could be whatever]<br>
<br>
I think Procax has it right on with having a fair system in place. I also think if your main tank's capability to 'tank' a mob is so dependant on whether or not they upgrade each of their items by 2-3 ac, maybe the guild isn't ready for that encounter yet afterall.<br>

Most likely if they're in your guild, they should be your friend.  So treat them like it.  If they have a problem, don't just try and brush it under the carpet, talk to them.  And show them you fucking care about them individually.  No one likes to be considered a &quot;lost cause&quot; or judged not worth the time to spend chatting over a problem.  If that occurs, yeah, you got a serious problem.  De-guilding is the final solution to all guild related problems.
