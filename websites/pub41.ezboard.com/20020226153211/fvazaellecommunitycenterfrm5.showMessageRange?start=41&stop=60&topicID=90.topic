<br>
<br>
and yeah everyone, I'm sorry if I came off as a PO'd youth.<br>
<br>
I know I made language mistakes in the past. And for this im sorry, as im obviously paying the price now in the present. It was just really dissapointing, the time gap between my 3rd warning, and suspension was well over 3 months.<br>
<br>
and yes I totally understand where you all are coming from with the &quot;past actions reflect current tendancies&quot; arguement. I just want to know though, honestly... In your heart of hearts, was what i did. The final incident worthy of any punishment in any degree.<br>
<br>
<br>
(please disregard that taror post, i dont know wtf he is on)<br>
<br>
if you dont believe my account of what happened, talk to gaeelae, bodil, or soulmyst. Those are the only people i can remember who were there that can give accurate details of what happened (should be close to mine) <br>
<br>
so yeah, that bein said... do you really really REALLY think what I did (aiding in the slaughter of gm npc's) is an offence? was my final act wrong? if I had any knowladge of it being wrong in the first place (still cant find any information anywhere regarding this type of situation) believe oh me, i wouldn't have even been in the zone.<br>

I dont give a ratz ass one way or the other, only reason i posted what i did, was because YOU left out some of the details. Disregard tarors post, Bah I was only trying to hail the Ref, Bah Thewhole conversion with the GM Jay, you kept trying to justify your actions, NOT 1 i fucked up, and im sorry. Most Kids your age can admit when the make a mistake, but like my 8 y/o son, Its never his fault, or something caused me to do it. lol Now that you have some free time, go out and learn some other lessons of life, because you just are not getting this one down.BTW ill tell you WTF im on.

<br>
Number one, when I originally attacked the ref. It *WAS* an accident. If you were there, and included the rest of the story you would also have mentioned that i even apologized to the ref. Did the ref poof after I attacked her?<br>
<br>
***NO***<br>
<br>
I'm sorry I was rude to your guildmate, one of the maybe 2 or 3 individuals who seemed displeased with the outcome.<br>
<br>
But my main beef with you, is that if you are going to post claiming my account of what happened was whacked. Then at least get your &quot;story&quot; straight.<br>
<br>
I dont know where this information is coming from. But obviously its not from your mouth. Soulmyst said it best &quot;if you want to see npc's fight, go to lake of ill omen&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Can you honestly say that you'd rather see 2 npc's fight, rather than kill them yourself? more than half the people there seemed agree with the latter =\<br>

You called it like you saw it, then you need glasses.<br>

Are you really going to sit there and say that *I* killed the first npc because i got the deathblow? wtf is that? come on!!!!! <br>
<br>
I'm sorry your low level ass didn't get phat lootz from this event. Other than that what exactly did us killing the gm's do to you? and if your a grown man, and you actually thought hearing the guides say &quot;im gonna beat you silly!&quot; and other stupid lame comments back and forth while sitting there for well over 10 minutes is fun.

I grew up in a household where whenever I got caught lieying, and merely that alone. I'd get pushed around alot, So yeah I came to the conclusion (after being caught nearly every single damn time) That I wasn't a very good liar, And also that the consequances to lieying aren't always too great either.<br>
<br>
I personally believe in being honest and up front with giving all information required to form an opinion on a matter like this. I hate it when people give me halfassed explanations. Or even worse lie to me, I wish they'd just save their breath. I'd rather know no information at all, than false information.<br>
