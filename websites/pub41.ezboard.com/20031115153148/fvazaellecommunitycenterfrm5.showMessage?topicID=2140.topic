You see ligr and Bahlu were inside CC bottom feeding and claiming the entire orc pit. Some friends of mine who came over to play goto CC for some exp and fun. One calls for a camp check about the bottom orcs.... Hears nothing but can see there is not a single orc up... So my 2 friends continue to walk towards the pit to see if maybe it was a group or something. Low and behold they see a lil pally dorf lvl 53 pharming the hell out of the lower area ... an orc pops on my friends so the war defends the healer and Bahlu runs over and starts pounding it dead.<br>
<br>
My friends start heading to town and laughed at bottom feeding the orcs when Bahlu tells them they need to learn what camp check is or something to that effect. Ligr proceeds to ad the commit about &quot;you should try camp check stupid&quot; or something along those lines but calling my friends stupid. <br>
<br>
They ask why all the bottom feeding and Bahlu says he can make 2k a day in CC... ligr says he is there for crafting supplies... thats cool ause crafts suck ass. <br>
<br>
Well my friends leave and i heard about this crap and decided to go and engage every nonengaged mob. I mean its fair on a FFA server ... clearly Bottm feeding for PP is &gt; than anyone lower lvl needing exp. SO for blocking any one from getting exp while caliming half a zone becuase they can kill it and being lil dickwads i came for fun. Hell im an asshole and that is nothing new. <br>
<br>
Well once it starts they start complaining ... i left Ligr alone for a while till i was reminded about my friends being assholes and also since he started in on me over /occ.(bahlu was my target) SO i walked up and down the pit and burnt it all to the ground. <br>
<br>
There were other groups in the zone and i made it clear i was leaving them alone as they were nice. Hell almost all of them found it funny since these 2 had been jerks to so many others in the zone before i showed up. A few even showed up to help and watch and make popcorn.<br>
<br>
So while my very fun chat with these 2 over /ooc i learned that ....<br>
<br>
1) Ligr is doesnt see a racists comment when he says  &quot;little japanise kids who they are going to ban... just like you&quot; there were other remarks but ill leave those out as this is not a racists thread.<br>
<br>
Psst im not from japan.<br>
<br>
2) i am clearly racists when i said i would not judge an entire group of people by the actions of one. IE all agony must be just like you.... anyhow sorry to my guildmates who must be just like me. I guess all of PO are just like AKE and all of Triality are lil Evilgohanz (/shudder gnome corpse humping necros.)<br>
<br>
3) They were getting AA from the orcs. And im Marry Popins.<br>
<br>
4) And i clearly am a &quot;moron&quot;, &quot;asshole&quot;, and a few others names that are off my chat screen =(... Anyhow i never denied these ... i liked that part.<br>
<br>
5) that i am not blacklisted from his guild and from his friends etc etc. <br>
Id hope your friends arent mindless drones who follow your every command.<br>
<br>
So at the end as i grew tired of playing with the greedy lil blockers, i hear CAMP CHECK... so outa fun i say Bahlu and Ligr and ligr says he now has what he needs to report me ... so as i sit here writing this i am waiting patiently for a Guide or Gm ... prolly the GUIDE he already spoke with... hmm interesting the Guide chose to not do a damned thing when he first spoke with him... to show up and scold me for killing non engaged mobs.<br>
<br>
So anyhow... For all of you out there who think your personal greed and bottom feeding and are lil assholes who block low lvl players from exp cause your money needs are clearly &gt; than thier fun or exp ... Just remember ... just because you can out kill them doesnt mean you should... There is always someone more powerfull and stronger ... <br>
<br>
The idea that .. ITS OK FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING BUT WRONG IF SOMEONE ELSE DOES IT BACK! is lame and you will eat this line a few times in your life.<br>
<br>
So enjoy you lil shit tards who are so pathetic to block a group of lower lvl players from exp because you need some lame pp.<br>
<br>
clearly a 58 and 53 pally gets awsome aa exp and money in a zone designed for 30-40 lvl players. Cockblocks work both ways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravendawn>RavenDawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/3/03 5:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2140.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> corrections</span><hr size=1> 5) that i am not blacklisted from his guild and from his friends etc etc. <br>

They were there first and clearing the mobs, you should have left them alone.  They have as much right to be there as you do.  It doesn't matter if your're there for xp, items, or whatever.<br>
<br>
What you did was pnp a bunch of people because they refused to leave a camp they were at before you even entered the zone.<br>

I dont care if they had the camp or not ... i wasnt there to take it and neither were my firends... they were leaving and these 2 dips shits started some shit. <br>

Bottom feeding and pissing on people sucks and i returned the favor. Ammelen if you claimed all of one zone and were a dick about it id tell you you get what you deserve... especialy if you were a cock about it.<br>

Let's try to understand that the PnP are rules that are so vague they are open to vast interpretation.  Now.  Let's also clear up a few myths about what IS and what isn't an offense meriting a warning.<br>
<br>
Myth #1:  If the mob is green to you, and blue to me, I have more of a right to kill it than you do.<br>
<br>
WRONG.  According to the Polices and Prodedures section of the Guide Handbook, the only person that has the right to kill a mob is the person, group, or raid that aggroed the monster first.  In fact, it specifically mentions that slumming is allowed.<br>
Also, in many cases, a guide or GM has been known to rule in favor of someone who is seeking rare components for tradeskills OVER someone who just wants xp.<br>
<br>
Myth #2:  People who use AE spells to kill mobs are exploiting.<br>
<br>
WRONG.  AE spells are not prohibited by Policies and Procedures.  The only thing that is prohibited are offenses that are called 'Resource violations'.  You could petition someone for rounding up the mobs and runnning them around for 15 minutes in Valor, but you can't petition someone for grabbing all the mobs and AE killing them.  They aggroed each individual mob first.<br>
<br>
Myth #3:  If I do first damage to a mob, it's mine legally, even if someone else aggroed it first.<br>
<br>
WRONG.  First aggro is first aggro, whether from proximity, spell, sitting, low health, etc.  The first person to get aggro is considered the first person who engaged the mob.  You do not have a right to attack it until that combat resolves, unless requested to do so, at which point, action or inaction is up to you.<br>
<br>
Myth #4:  I saved someone from dying and helped kill their mob, without asking.  I did more damage and got the kill.  They petitioned ME for saving them!  I have nothing to worry about!<br>
<br>
MAYBE.  It depends.  Technically, you KS'd them.  If you explained yourself to the guide, it's very possible you won't get a warning.  Even better if you explained yourself to the players, though.<br>
<br>
But the fact of the matter is... you aren't 100 percent positive they didn't have a miraculous plan to pull through the fight.  So mind your own business.  Rez fixes everything, anyway.<br>
<br>
Myth #5: I called camp check, and no one answered, so their camp is mine.<br>
<br>
Are you one of those fuckheads that believes that if your roommate dies, you get straight A's? *smack* Now for your ABC's of camps.<br>
<br>
a) There are no camps, SoE doesn't recognize them.  <br>
b) There are only mob engagement rules.  <br>
c) SoE employees would rather you fucking learn to not play like babies, and handle problems maturely.<br>
<br>
Guides are the court of last resort in a mob/camp dispute.  If you go to court, you better be a good lawyer, verstahen Zie, Chachi?<br>

In our next installment, we'll talk about the solutions guides use to get you idiot faggots to get along.<br>

Raven-<br>
<br>
Why were they hostile to you?  Maybe I misunderstood, but it seemed to me they had a camp, you decided their camp wasn't important, moved in, and as a result they got hostile.  That seems justified to me, but maybe I misunderstood what happened?  (By you I mean the lowbies wanting to xp.)<br>
<br>
I'd get hostile if I were farming something and some lowbies decided that my camp didn't matter.<br>
<br>
Lowf is right that camps are not recognized by Verant.  However, nearly all EQ players do recognize them, and pnp is considered extremely poor form.<br>

<br>
As far as camps being not recognized, yeah that's true.  However that just means you're not going to get a warning from a GM.  There are much worse things that could happen than a warning.

She's putting out a very MILD version of what life is like there now.<br>
<br>
Basically, it seems to be a tradeskillers/pharmers &gt; XPers zone. I've been there on an alt, XPing away in a group, look around, and lo and behold, every freaking orc is suddenly GONE by people who showed up while we were fighting. Asked to leave a few spawns up for the group only killing a handful at all (no super twinks, these), I got approximately what Ravendawn's friends got in reply.<br>
<br>
The fact that I didn't do the same as she did just goes to show she's more ebil than me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have the same attachment to the zone as an XP spot as her, though (and not coincidentally, first time I met her was in an XP group where we teamed up to kill that uba queen).<br>
<br>
There's a lot of freaking lamers monopolizing low end zones now that most of the people capable of knocking their asses to next Tuesday are focussed on other content. If I were a true newbie, I'd stay the hell off this server and go for much younger ones, where the scumbags still have to deal with consequences more often. <p><a href="http://www.EQPixelArmy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-animated-banner-animation.gif" height="120" width="80" alt="EQPA" border=0></a><a href=" http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-animated-banner-text.gif" height=120 width=272 alt="Whizbang Dustyboots" border=0></a><br><font size=1><a href="http://www.tinkering.org" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-bottom-tinkering250.gif" height=13 width=234 vspace=3 alt="You have become better at Tinkering!

Seeing as Bahlu is in Lucid Chimera and is a very mild mannered, sweet Pally I find it hard to believe also.<br>
  I will speak to Bahlu and get his side of the story but I would appreciate a /tell to an officer of his guild, myself if you wish, prior to you posting something like this on the VCC boards.<br>
  I've also found quite often that stories like these are usually totally blown out of proportion and completely one sided.<br>
If you care to show me some logs you can email them to me at raiyneq@yahoo.com.<br>
  I think Lucid Chimeras reputation as a guild would at least cause you to think twice about Bahlu's participation in this.<br>
 Please contact me in game, I will be happy to discuss this further.<br>
  Thank you . <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Calling them scumbags doesnt really do anything but maybe make you feel better.  Farming is farming, it is no less important than Xping.  Sure he could go farm somewhere else, just as you can go XP somewhere else. If you are there first then its yours.  If you can kill every orc in CC before they start to respawn they should be yours (although there are technically no &quot;camps&quot;.  People getting XP in CC pay the same amount as the guy farming green cons in CC.  <br>
<br>
     Sounds like a communication problem, i have never known Bahlu to be hostile.  I know Bahlu has been spending much time in CC lately, but there is nothing wrong with that.  Sounds like the person who posted this thread definately showed the poorest behavior of the parties involved.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1686<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/4/03 12:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2140.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> I can see what they were thinking.

If I wanted to farm, and saw an xp group there already, I'd leave them as many spawns as they can kill and kill the rest.<br>
<br>
If I was farming, and a group came and told me they wanted some of the spawns to xp, I'd probably refuse.  My need to farm items is no less important than their need to farm xp.<br>

Hmm...k...<br>
<br>
Seriously there is what like FOUR? spawns tops in the orc pit, maybe three, been a while.<br>
<br>
If you're farming ore, the top hall owns the pit hands down.  Less camped, more miners.  Less need to move to find them and waste your time in the process.<br>
<br>
If you're willing to farm shit for 2k a day, send me a tell some time.  Must be seriously poor to waste your time getting no exp for 2k a day.<br>
<br>
Everything turns green around 44 there except possibly light blue watchman which dont matter since they dont drop ore anyways (only miners drop ore).  The part about the aa might work if you were farming in Velks instead of cc.  &lt;3 the aaxp off green mobs /nod. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sindace>Sindace</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/4/03 12:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2140.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> eh, read that wrong.  thought it said they claimed to be getting aa's by farming there, which it didnt.<br>

if they were farming there first, it's their camp regardless.  their time spent in eq = your time spent in eq regardless of how it was spent.  i farmed velium probably 10-12 months ago, if someone wanted exp from my camp they could go elsewhere in the zone to find it.<br>

They were leaving... they got jumped by an orc ( ever been to CC? ) .. anyhow, they were leaving when they get told they need to learn what a camp check is and get called lil assholes... they ask why bottom feed and are told basically money.... They never asked them to leave or give the camp. They never killed a single orc.<br>
<br>
If i goto West commons and AE the entire place and claim the zone thats fair. I mean if i was there and can kill it i have that right.... Doing such a thing and getting mad at someone who kills a mob in WC (or defends themselves) when i clearly have it camped and they didnt respect me by not doing a CAMP CHECK would make me right? WRONG that makes me an asshole and makes me a griefer of anyone who would use the zone for what its designed for.<br>
<br>
Just because i can kill it in one swoop doesnt mean i should. Im not talking about the legal rights or wanting to be very lawyer ish over this... I came and was a dick... I came to be that way. I wished this wasnt the first time ive seen such trash in lower lvl zones... If your fucking lvl 60+ and are in zone designed for lower lvl players, show some fucking respect ...Atleast pharm when its empty or stear clear of lowbies etc. Hell work out a deal for mobs for the items you want. Leave zones alone that are way green to you.... you disrupt an entire zone when you pharm and clear an entire zone... IMHO you are greifing lower lvl players for personal greed. You are cockblocking other players simply because you CAN. I will become an asshole to players who think that because they are higher lvl it gives them the right. I came and was just that person... Everything was ok until i showed up and mirrored the treatment.<br>

You didn't do to them what they did to you.  They only wanted to maintain a camp they already had.  You came in and stole a camp that someone else was already at.  Big difference.<br>
