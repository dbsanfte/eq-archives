Dude, that is awesome.  I'm still trying to dry off my shorts after that one.  Haven't laughed that hard since we watched you wipe on klandi 3 times then did him flawlessly (well, after all the trains that your guild was throwing at us died down).  Saying something like that might work if others actually believed it.  However, I don't think there is 1 person on vaz, even in your guild, that can say &quot;venthos is a guy that would not breach any of VI's policies, he would never train, ks, etc.&quot;  and btw, the whole &quot;i am god&quot; thing is so last year, get over it and actually start leading your guild.  Pretty bad when your biggest hits are still va'dyn, lodi, and alley dragons in ww.<br>
<br>
Also, did I hear someone say they wiped on lodi?  If you are level 60+ and you go to duo lodi and wipe, do me a couple quick things to insure it never happens again.   1) get a rope, 2)  tie rope around neck , 3) hang self <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lumaddaron>lumaddaron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/8/03 6:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1847.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> <br>

We were to busy, either bieng trained or having wandering mobs attack us we engaged klandi one time the other times we were attacked by the alley dragons and they aggroed klandi or trien to zone to WW from the .. multiple alley dragons *cough* pathing through at once, klandi was aggroed. Umm it seems we were all to busy engaging klandi once and having the first cleric in cheal order LD, and gettting attacked by alley dragons to train you. If you choose to sit at the zone to DN waiting to gank klandi thats yer business we did not go out of our way to run mobs to you but where you choose to sit to wait to gank a mob is your buisness not mine but i for one am going to one 20 feet to DN and not 20 miles to sleepers grotto.<br>
<br>
<br>
However It is rather a joke that venthos follows all of VI's policys. I have never personally seen him KS, or Train or do anything at all dishonorable. However almost all humor has a basis in fact and im sure hes trained people before. Anyway Send i thought yer a good guy and i still think you are but please get yer facts straight.(some of VI's policys are assinine like the fact that if someone sat at some druid epic camp for 14 hours and someone higher level just walks up gets first aggro and gets the mob after being there 15 minutes)<br>
<br>
<br>
Danitha, it was fun competing for lodi with you hehe 2x once you didnt try to engage and 2nd time we were there first, got first aggro, And out dpsed. I have come there and there were people siting there waiting on lodi and ill just leave. It still was fun goin for lodi with yah, i btw for now have stopped killing lodi because of all the drama and bs i have to put up with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sendaught I used to kill Lodi on my own Not as a guild event, I kill it with 2-3 people including myself. I have to my knowledge never been killed by Lodizal. I have come mighty close like the time about 14 celestial navigators were trieng to ks me, and it only took 5 to stop them but i was summoned into the water LOH pull out it was all good. (one of the people is a pre 50s rogue who times for me) <p>Lumaddaron <br>

I wasn't trying to flame you guys over that incident.  When you guys were attempting klandi for the 3rd time of the day (venthos had even told me it was your 3rd attempt at him), I had my guild zone into DN to avoid causing you lag.  I wasn't worried of agro, as we are on cov faction and maybe 1 or 2 people on the raid were kos.  What had bothered me was the fact that after you wiped, we set up for klandi, got our people in position, was about 2 seconds from hitting autoattack to engage, then I see &quot;omg, dragons coming this way, wait&quot;.. <br>
<br>
I'm sure it wasn't people intentionally training people to our area to screw us up.  Probably just some kos folks heading back to the DN area to do rezzes and such.  What bothered me is the fact that your leaders didn't tell you guys to stay clear of DN until we were done, as we had given you the same courtesy when we were in the area.  Anyway, we ended up owning klandi and all was good. Just bugs me that we had to wait an extra 15 minutes due to the trains =P<br>
