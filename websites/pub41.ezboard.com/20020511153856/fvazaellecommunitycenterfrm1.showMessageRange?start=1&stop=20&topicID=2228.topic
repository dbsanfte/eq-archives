Benchmarks'll show you that.  AMDs are also a hell of a lot cheaper for a roughly equivalent processor.<br>
<br>
AMDs are also a but more snippity.  They run hot and require a lot of cooling, so the case tends to be loud when compared to an equivalent Intel case.  If you're computer-oriented, playing around with your AMD set-up is half the fun.  If you're not, it's a bloody hassle.<br>
<br>
In the end, if you get a top-of-the-line processor/mobo of either, it should work fine for most of what EQ can toss at it.  It's really more a question of personal preference weighing their direct performance characteristic vs. budget.  On a budget an AMD set-up will let you get snazzier peripherals.<br>

Anyhow...<br>

If you do go Intel, do try to grab a 1.6a Northwood CPU.  Those chips just LOVE overclocking.  2.2 GHz on the stock heatsink is easy, 2.4 is doable at 1.65v, and with an aftermarket HSF you can pull 2.6-2.8, and watercooled can get you to 3.0+ GHz. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaurianne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurianne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 703<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 1:09:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2228.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AMD vs. Intel</span><hr size=1> I'd say AMD. Not only does it cost significantly less than the Intel, it out performs them on FPU calculations. For the non-techie, that means multimedia is better on an AMD unless the software is specifically coded to use the Intel-only features. They can't do that with EQ, though, because it will cripple it on AMD, and they'd have a class action on their hands.<br>
<br>
The video card performance thing is a function of your motherboard more than anything else. Get a high end motherboard, and you'll do better. The problem with all those comparisons is that they compare a $200 AMD board to a $400 Intel board. I paid more for my motherboard than I did for my processor, and never have a problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Incidentally, even if it were because of the processor, only an idiot would spend an extra $400 for an improvement from 100fps to 110fps, since your monitor likely can't display more than 85fps anyway. <p><center><a href="http://orderofantondwer.cjb.net" target=_new>

I'd be careful giving that overclocking recommendation, one of my friends from work who has a WATERCOOLED system(yes, the same one you read about on the net, he took some ridiculous amount of cash - around 2k I think - and made his own watercooling system) has had those CPU's burn out TWICE on him within a month of overclocking them to 2.2 GHz, he's been running his third one at 2.0 GHz for a few months without any significant hitches...<br>
<br>
Of course he could be pro-AMD by slamming Intel and be talking out of his ass, I only work with the guy and haven't verified anything by screwing with his machine or anything.<br>
<br>
Biggest tip I can give for AMD users(being one myself), is be aware how heat works in your house and accomodate for it,  Iviy and myself have the same configuration machine down to every piece on opposite sides of the same room and now that the weather is starting to warm up here in the North East, her machine had started to creap up into the danger levels for heat while mine only creeped up a few degrees C - all fans clean, etc. just part of how the air circulates in our room I suppose - so her machine is borrowing a floor fan to help circulate the air around - which brought it back to around where my machine's heat was...<br>
<br>
As for reliability.... AMD is pretty much as reliable as any Intel I have owned, actually more reliable than the Intel 386 and 486 DX2 I have owned... only catch is, when problems arise IMO you need to know a little more tech to solve whatever issue comes up since it always seems to be odd stuff - like my one K6-2 that would hang during Win95 installation unless I dropped into safe mode during the 2nd reboot to install the IDE driver then... (and still trying to figure out why Iviy's stepfather's machine thinks it has 2 monitors connected to it's single video card...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uanikacrystalwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anika Crystalwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 807<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 2:00:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2228.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://216.122.250.134/html/phnxarmx2.gif width=100 height=102></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AMD vs. Intel</span><hr size=1> Well, I'm not positive of the setup your friend was using Vaclav, so I can't speak to any problems that he had, but at 2.4 GHZ at 1.60v vcore, my Intel is running a cool 104F idle, and about 122F when at 100% utilization, and that's with the factory HSF.  Now given, if you don't know what you're in for, overclocking can be very risky, especially with AMD's which fry insanely fast.  <br>
<br>
On the flip side, new Intel chips have a very advanced heat sensor logic that steps down the CPU speed automatically when high temperature levels are noted.  There was a video linked from hardocp.com a couple of weeks ago where someone actually took the heatsink off a P4 Northwood while the system was running a Quake demo.  The system slowed dramatically, but the CPU lived, and the system operated fine.  The AMD's hit 600+ F within 2 seconds and burned to a crisp.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, once you start getting over 15% above the rated vcore of a CPU, you need to start being very careful.  More than 20%, and you need to be insanely cautious and complete.  (Lapping, using high grade thermal grease, etc)  <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, I still say that for the price, a nice 1.6a P4 is the way to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ujabartik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jabartik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 2:11:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2228.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.users.qwest.net/~autt1/jaba_01.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AMD vs. Intel</span><hr size=1> <br>
My current system is a P4, and my reason for going with that instead of amd was not processor dependant, it was MB dependant.  My secondary system is an AMD and I did not have problems with the processor on it so much as the MB when it was new.  With all the 4in1 driver updates it works pretty smooth now, but back when I got it, I had problems with about every new game I tried on it.  After that experience, I'm very reluctant to buy any via chipset that has not been on the market at least 6 months and has its bugs worked out.  <br>
<br>
I recently upgraded a friends system with a 1.2 athlon and made sure to get a board that had been on the market a while for stability, and it runs reliably and does not seem to have any heat problems.<br>
<br>
I like AMD, and their processors are the best bang for your buck out there, but if you go with one, be very selective about the motherboard you get.<br>

The comparisons are usually overheating, the P4 will actually UNDERclock itself to cool itself down and not fry the chip. But in any AMD case the chip literally melts. I think that AMD still has some heat problems to sort out, other than that, well its up to you... <p><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15296>Forse</a></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uforseten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Forse Ten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 10:16:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2228.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Forse/fullsize/Tilgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AMD vs. Intel</span><hr size=1> Plus Compatibility <br>

GeForce 4 MX are worse than GeForce 3. The Ti series of GeForce 4 is comparable, or better.<br>

Forse - The heat's not really an issue if you set the case up right =). My Athlon XP 1700+ is currently oc'd to 2200+, and is running at 21 celcius peak. (that's about 72 farenheit, for you USA types). I'm not water cooled, but have a massive heatsink on the chip with about 5cm of fins (2 inches), as well as a powerful fan. I also have 6 chassis fans (3 front, 3 back) to maximize circulation through the computer. But then... I spent way too much on my computer. About $2500 USD total.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (But Windows boots up from cold in 20 seconds and I zone in under 15 seconds! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueqjetx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ JetX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://eqscreenshot.homestead.com/files/icon57.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1226<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 10:49:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2228.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cderekrun//MOVIETHANG.gif Height=200 Width=105></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AMD vs. Intel</span><hr size=1> Gah I am starting to think I paid too much for my new computer =\, I should have just went to best buy or something ;p.<br>
