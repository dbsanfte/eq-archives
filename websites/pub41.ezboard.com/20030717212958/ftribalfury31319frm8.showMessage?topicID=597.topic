<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>EDIT: Scan down below for new updates on raid area</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Tribal Fury is one of the oldest guilds on Vazaelle.  It is one of the few guilds on the server that was a family oriented guild that survived a transformation into a guild that raids but isn't a &quot;raiding&quot; guild.  Let me explain that to those just showing up.  We raid.  We raid well.  The results of some of our raids are guild goals.  The only reason I don't raise the flag of us being a raiding guild - is because we don't raid every day and don't organize the way those guys do.  <br>
<br>
Tribal Fury has a VERY good reputation on Vazaelle.  We respect camps, don't KS or Ninja (nor play with those who do).  Wearing that TF tag is an honor in my opinion - so wear it well.<br>
<br>
 Except for mobo days, I don't expect to see most players at all raids.  And that is ok.  I mean with 40 players on line - it is not expected to bring everyone to farm Jade reavers, hit VS or VSR - or do factioning in KD.  Another part of not being a &quot;raiding&quot; guild is that most players in Tribal fury don't play every day.  I would say the average is about 4-5 days a week.  with some players only playing twice a week, and some nuts playing 10 hours 7 days a week.   The chances of you seeing me play on a wednesday are pretty low.  I also will not often play during the day on weekends like a lot of people do... I am constrained by family and personal goals there.<br>
<br>
Tribal Fury continues to be &quot;our&quot; home in Everquest.  A place where you can get pick up support for quests and exp groups.  Also, we have the firepower to continue to progress on taking down the boss mobs as part of the so called &quot;end game.&quot;  Now that our ability to take down boss mobs has increased (29)  we will be able to more often hit these guys and spread the winnings around.<br>
<br>
Pensfan - at this time, go ahead and award access to our private member forum to all trial members.   Petitioners will still not get access until we vote them in.<br>
<br>
Ralphasaur is the new Spell bank.    To Further aid us in buffing up our guild bank, folks save your research parts for over 50 research if you recognize it. Give it to Ralph or Fadari if you catch up tp them and don't know who else to give it to.<br>
<br>
I will continue to serve as guild equipment bank.  With a few members leaving - once I consolidate their leavings from the peeps that collected them - I will see what I will give out.  Ultlimaty I will have 1 set of gear for plate, melee, priest, int caster that is &quot;fair&quot; for over 50 play.  they will be reserved in the event of a poofed corpse or any naked server xfers that show up.  Gear that is unawarded at raids ( due to lack of usefullness) will be sold to add cash to our raid cash bank.  Any caster that uses gems at a raid that DOESN'T get dots, etc. for the raid - get with Pensfan, Kunglao or myself for compentsation later.<br>
<br>
Ok the following issues are finnaly where I wanted them:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bluejump --><img src=http://www.tribalfury.org/emoticons/bluejump.gif ALT=":bluejump"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bluejump --><img src=http://www.tribalfury.org/emoticons/bluejump.gif ALT=":bluejump"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Raid loot policy - Tribal Fury is looking at going to a point system.  LOOKING AT - not decided.  based on discussion in members only - going to look real close on if we implement this - or hold with what we already have.  current system is GOD loot - Raid leader decides who gets what loot.  Raid leader takes into consideration - who gets the best upgrade, who by getting the upgrade will best help the guild, who is most deserving of the loot based on raid participation and general guild kharma.<br>
<br>
Raid leadership: There will be Guild raids.  our new raid loot policy will apply to these raids.  These raids will be run by me and Pensfan at this time.  THese raids will be mobo days(Tues) 1st and 3rd Friday (Pens) and 2nd and some 4ths by me and SOME Thursdays - ran by pens or me.  on the whole tho - I want Thursday to be the day of the week that anyone can organize a raid of their choosing - that is a 2 - 3 group event - subject to having an officer step in to &quot;help&quot; if there are issues comming up.  These will be YOUR raids and you establish the loot rules at the time of posting your raid.  Thursday raids will not be subject to our new loot policy (soon to be published) unless Pens or I lead them (At the moment).  I am still looking for 2 - 3 people to serve as back up raid leaders to pens and I - cause if both of us can not be online at the same time - I would hate to see the event fail due to no experianced leadership.  If you want to lead a raid on a thursday or for a sat/ sunday - send a tell to me, or another officer to see how it synchs with what we are doing before you post it.  OFFICERS - don't just veto all players interested in posting their own raids.  I consider all players eligible to run a 3 group or less raid on stuff that we frequent farm.  THursdays, Sat/ sun are good days for non mainstream raids.<br>
<br>
pick ups :  Guys - YOU need to do &quot;/ all guild &quot; before asking for pick up support and take a good look at what is going on - who is where - who is online.  TF isn't online 24/7 with the cababilty to mobilize and you need to remember that.  Not saying in the least not ask for guild support - just pace yourself.  And consider the day.  See below for our weekly Rhythm<br>
<br>
Raid schedule : For now :<br>
-Mondays Completly Raid free.  No pick ups - no 2 group action etc.  If more than 6 peoples show up somewhere - by all means raid up if you like... just not encouraging any PLANNED multi group action these days and discouraging any pick up requests.<br>
- Tuesday mobo days<br>
- Wednesdays this is a good day for quest help - organized minor events etc.<br>
- Thursday minor guild raids.  Raid leadership is open to all full members - Pensfan, myself or a person an officer names MAY take over raid at any time if the officers make a call that the raid leader is in over his head.  nothing personal - but for the betterment of the guild.<br>
- Friday and saturday.  For now - 1st and 3rd Fridays are Pensfan's designated raid days.  he will post where we hit.  2nd Saturday and some 4ths are My raid days.  The unscheduled days can be mobo days IF: the right peeps are on to bother.  not mobolizing on these days if the firepower isn't there.<br>
- Sunday.  no &quot;guild&quot; raids will be planed on these days.  feel free to organize your own events if you like,  don't feel bad if no one signs up.  This is an unlikely day to mobilize.<br>
<br>
Epic progression priority: Ok folks.  Epics.  Let me make an anouncement.  If you want to get an Epic - sweet.  If you want me to plan it - I will prolly put you on the list in my head of what events to plan when I see you show for events that help theguild.  ATM I am planning epic hits for Modok, Nistari, Infirno, Sumven, Ralphasaur, Deodorax (even tho the slacker refuses to come to the web site), Laldari, Kaylar, Azzenkar, Haylie, sameil, Arielyn, Masakrex, Tuvyen - and the gimp, Dealing, mytmaxx.  <br>
<br>
 THAT SAID - there is a shift in our guild focus afoot.  Many of the mobs we can drop now drop loot seriously better than epics.  Dropping these guys when we can - will take some priority over focusing on epics like we have for the last 6 months.  I figure a lot of epic work can be done on our Wendsday and Thursdays.  some of my raids will still be to get epics.  Just realize that Since we can get weapons better than some epics - we might as well focus on that over old Kunark weaps.  Oh - one other thing, didn't see your name on the list? thats cause I have detected either very little interest from you in attending events to help other peeps get theirs - or I don't know you are even interested in your epic.  gotta post if you are or I don't know about it.  Or your epic interest surfaced after I had writen this post. (see original date)<br>
<br>
Current goals.  I will also post a goal(s) of the month during the last week of each month - for the following month.  Guild goals will be posted in members only forum.<br>
<br>
Ok - I will post whatever I fogot to include here when I realize I forgot it.<br>
<br>
Fair paths<br>
