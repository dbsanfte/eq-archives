Hell levels and post hell level penalties are being removed.  Exp gain up to level 10 is going to be accelerated.  Staring at the book to meditate will no longer be required at any level.  Level 9 and under pops up with all gear after a death.<br>
<br>
Give me a fucking break!  Why not just make it where all players start level 50 and get it over with.  What the fuck is the point of learning the game while you level?  <br>
<br>
The game is already a hell of a lot easier to level to 50 in than it was three years ago because of better equipment available at cheaper prices.  Having a lammy at level 20 now is nothing out of the ordinary, whereas 3 years ago weapons with that damage/delay ratio didn't even exist in the game.<br>
<br>
It's getting to the point that you can be a fucking retard and make it to high levels.  Its a form of socialism being applied to EQ.  EQ is about competition not socialism.  If I wanted socialism I'd go back to the fucking real world where stupid people try and leech off those with brains and motivation. <p><center>

They just won't have hell levels.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't see the big deal about hell levels pre-50 as they are always waaaaaay over-exaggerated. People think they last longer because they become discouraged and start alts or a million other things that stop the XP from flowing.<br>
<br>
The XP gain up to level 10 acceleration thing I'm not sold on. FIrst of all, it wasn't slow to begin with. Why must it be much faster? Because DAoC is faster? BS. When I was a true n00b, I could care less how slow I levelled pre-10. In fact, I didn't KNOW it was slow at all. Things don't slow down at all for a goo dmany levels, so I don't see the point.<br>
<br>
Starting with all of your gear pre-10 is a bad idea. The quicker a n00b learns the value of a CR and how to accomplish it the better. All I wish is that VI would eliminate the corpse-poof concept. Instead, at the end of 7 RL days, someone's corpse should appear at their current bind point. Their's still a significant penalty for not recovering a corpse.<br>
<br>
The treatment of n00bs reminds me of a Friends episode. Chandler wants to give Joey some dough, so he invents a card game as they go, where Joey continually wins money. The rules are ridiculous and completely contrived. Eventually Joey gets the money, but he then plays Ross in the game and loses it all by the same stupid rules invented to help him.<br>
<br>
What's this mean? N00bs are going to be &quot;weaker&quot; because they have it easier. Then again, perhaps they'll have a little more fun, so it just MIGHT balance out.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to see the book going, however, I'm not certain that casters should be able to see their surroundings either. Staring at the book is part of balancing the awesome powers of casters. Casters get a lot of neat toys like the ability to bind anywhere, gate, nice damage, etc.<br>
<br>
I suggest casters look at something more interesting, but not the game world. Psychadelic vortex! Whoohoo!<br>
<br>
I can't agree with the idea that this is socialism however. This doesn't eliminate competiton at all. N00bs still have to work for their supper.  <p><img border="0" src="http://www.mindspring.com/~smullen/images/sigtmp.jpg" width="250" height="128"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ustalkin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stalkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#333333>(3/18/02 2:46:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=469.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/stalkinpowers/stalkstfu.jpg WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Horrible Change for the Game of EQ</span><hr size=1> First off hell levels are not really being removed, the exp it takes to level from 1-50 now will be the same as after they fix the hell levels.

Well said.<br>
<br>
It saddens me to see these changes.  They could keep the level of difficulty for lower levels and increase the content and get better results IMHO. But I think you're right in the &quot;dumbing down&quot; aspect.<br>
<br>
This sounds just like the lowering of testing standards in school systems.  I  remember taking the SAT eons ago and making an 1170 on it. and that was great... Since I've taken it, they've lowered the standards and now my score would translate into about 1380 or something... they have a ratio wheel to figure out what old scores are under the new system. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What does this lowering of standards in Eq do for us?<br>
Well,... it's similar to schooling.  Although our children  get an education, the standards of teaching are lowered to  accomodate so that students can get by on the national tests and the school's graduation rate is high.  As a result, kids goof off even  more, whiny-ass parents complain at PTA meetings, and standards are lowered again, causing national  testing to lower standards again.  Pretty soon we end up with uneducated people going to college, causing those systems to adjust, and ultimately people that are virtually uneducated compared to the people three generations before them are suddenly in the workforce.<br>
<br>
Similarly, EQ lowers standards of leveling. (no corpses lowbies, no book, etc).  As a result, people will whine about nit-picky aspects of the game instead of things that really need to be addressed, VI &amp; SOE lower standards again, listening to the new generation of players who had it easier than previous generations.  The older generations' opinions get shelved because they're &quot;already hooked&quot; and VI wants  to know what &quot;New players&quot; want that would lure even MORE people to the game.  <br>
<br>
Then more changes will ensue, all the while changing things in order to make more money by making superficial changes to lure people in, instead of making enduring enhancements to the game their older players suggest. (which would overall improve the game and get them more customer retention - but they won't see that at ALL from a marketing standpoint. They figure the amount of new players will outweigh the ones that leave.)<br>
<br>
End result:  All older generation players leave 'cause the game Sucks comparatively in their eyes, New people abound in the world of Norrath, people comparatively uneducated in their respective classes get to higher levels, making high-end gaming less enjoyable for those that know what they're doing.  VI says &quot;Why are they all leaving ?!? We made a TON of changes already!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p><table><tr><td style="filter: glow(color= "c0ff40", strength=2); color: "c0c0ff"><font size "big"><font color = "8080c0"><b>MrEd Superstar </td></tr></table></b></font></font>

<br>
Hell levels have all of what to do with getting to 50?  Nothing.  Any special reason I needed to spend 2 weeks in dreadlands to get through 45 instead of the 1 week it took for 44 and 46?  PLEASE tell me what that did for me, or anyone, as a player?<br>
According to one website's opinion, the exp needed for a dwarf cleric to get out of level 44 is 7,380,000<br>
level 45 is 16, 835,800<br>
level 46 is 8,695,000<br>
<br>
ANY freakin reason why 45 is 2 times harder?<br>
<br>
IT's also my understanding that the game isnt changed to get to 50.  They arent reducing the total amnt of exp needed to 50, just smoothing out the curve.  <br>
<br>
Medding without looking at the book. FINALLY.  WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT OF THAT?  Why, because we did it to 35 everyone in the game should suffer.  Know what, my father used punch cards to operate his PC at work, why dont we go back to that?<br>
<br>
The comment about every level 20 having a lammy and level 20 in full thurg .. we're on a VERY mature server.  Our server is made up of 2 of the OLDEST servers in the game.  Many of the people on it are Beta types of people.  After putting in 100-200 played days, you expect your twinks to have rusty scimitars?  Hmm, not.<br>
<br>
Besides, everyone knows Darwin.  Survival of the fittest.  How many level 50+ morons will get groups after they prove their morons?  About as many as do now.  So they either learn and adapt, or quit.<br>
<br>
I think it's funny the stuff we BITCHED about for so long finally gets fixed, and, we bitch  <p><HTML>

<br>
grading on the new curve meant a student who scored 800 on the verbal test in 1996 did not necessarily achieve perfection, but rather the equivalent of about 730. <br>
<br>
as you can see it lowers the testing scores from pre 98.<br>

How many people have given up this game we all love in frustration over stupid trivial stuff?  I like the fact that people dying under level 10 will be popping up with their gear intact and no body to go try and find.<br>
<br>
Yes, it's just like DAoC, but is that necessarily a bad thing?  Removing the hell levels was once said to be 'impossible' and that the game code would have to be entirely rewritten.<br>
<br>
I think the people complaining about these completely positive changes are people who feel that now, people will be able to reach level so-and-so without the same amount of work.<br>

For once in my life I say gg VI.<br>

That book while medding was silly and its high time its gone.  This doesn't affect us at the high end any at all.  This isn't the end of EQ.  The worst this could be called is a marketing ploy, and hey, I guess VI wants to make money off it, go figure. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81033>I'm the Hound, damnit!</a>

Hell, I was in banded gear up until around 40ish then I did ivy quests.  My weapons of choice pre 50 were Ykesha (8/24 75dd proc) and they went for around 10 12k and a fluxblade once I got one.  My AC was around 800ish I think.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to today.  I'm pretty sure next to no new rangers even know or have heard of ivy etched.  Why?  Because you can buy better stuff for the cost of the gems, and by the time you're of level to do the quests you can just go kill some orcs and get better much much faster.  As for weaponry...I doubt another ranger will ever use a fluxblade or a hate whip.  You can buy much much better and even camp better before you can even hit the planes.  That 10 12k I spent on my uber 8/24 sword back in the day will buy you 3 or 4 lammy.<br>
<br>
Oh well, pretty soon when looking for group members instead of asking just for level and class you're going to have to ask for level, class, and played time hehe. <p><center>

I think the frustration Pilsbane and others have with these type changes is that we have all endured up to three years of these annoyances. Worse, we have complained continually that some of them serve no purpose and we were ignored for three years.<br>
<br>
Now, they are making changes after 2+ years of ignoring us, and you know it isn't being done to make their old customers happy. It is to make the game more enjoyable to new people who  haven't resolved themselves to paying 10 bucks a month. <p><table width="262" border="1" height="102" align="center">

I see this as a way for them to concentrate on high level content.  Whenever they do something for the post 60 crowd whats the first thing they hear?  All the lower level folks complaining that they get nothing.  You've all seen it.  &quot;There aren't any zones for us to hunt in.&quot;  &quot;Everying is too high level for us to hunt.&quot;  Now VI can say they have made things easier for them and they can more easily climb in levels.  I can hope at least right? : )  Its about sales.  They want to keep us all and at the same time allow a &quot;newbie&quot; to enjoy the game more.<br>

IMHO, it *DID* have a point. That's best described with an example:<br>
<br>
I have a young necro twink. He likes to kite over in Nro. But sometimes he gets low on mana (who doesn't?), so he needs to med. Now, let's take a look at both situations:<br>
<br>
a) While medding in Nro...<br>
<br>
    With book-stare on:<br>
<br>
I med, but a zombie walks over and startles me. I am thus forced to run.<br>
<br>
    Without book-stare:<br>
<br>
I see a zombie coming, and quickly move away.<br>
<br>
b) Lower-levels have less mana, so<br>
<br>
    With book stare:<br>
<br>
I run oom while kiting a snake, so I am forced to zone it off.<br>
<br>
    Without book stare:<br>
<br>
I keep the snake snared so I can med-kite, standing up if he comes too near and moving back, which will quickly restore my mana to kill it.<br>
<br>
Thus, lower-level casters don't have downtime (or a LOT less) because of the lack of the book. It'll make leveling my necro a whole bunch easier, that's for sure. I remember I was freaking ecstatic when my paladin (yah, they have mana) got rid of his book at 35. Made soloing in GD a thousand times easier since I could see any and all adds coming my way. <p><HR>
