<br>
Jdogg: You're wet already. I can smell your stink from here. <br>
<br>
QT-Pie: WHAT?! <br>

Jdogg: I execute standing position 12 from the Kama Sutra. Passion fills the room. Your head is close to the ceiling fan. <br>
<br>
Jdogg: You leave everything to jdogg. <br>
<br>
Jdogg: I am completely inside of you. You are my dik puppet. I put on a little play. <br>
<br>
QT-Pie: This is weird. I should go. <br>

<br>
J-Dogg: I touch you on your lettuce, you massage my spinach... Sexily. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: I ride your buttocks, like they were amber waves of grains. <br>
<br>
Katey69: Grain doesn't really turn me on... I was thinking more along the lines of carrots and zucchinis. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: my zucchinis carresses your carrots. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: Damn baby your right, this shiat is HOT.<br>
<br>
Katey69 ... <br>

J-Dogg: Help me pull my boots off baby. <br>
<br>
Mandy4u26: Whats that smell? <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: Rotting toes. <br>
<br>
Mandy4u26: Ummm... <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: My boots pop off. My feet are black. The toes crumble off with the slightest touch. The dead black tissue that was once my skin chips off in large crispy flakes. A smell of death pervades the room. Gangrenous pus drips from the ends of the stumps where my toes were. I look deep in your eyes, and shove my tongue down your throat. <br>
<br>
Mandy4u26: ... <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: You carress my ass, and trim my pubes... <br>
<br>
<br>

DirtyKate: I don't remember you.. but thanx <br>
<br>
J-dogg: Wanna cyber? <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: OK, but don't tell anybody (wink) <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Who are you? <br>
<br>
J-dogg: I've got blond hair, blue eyes, I work out a lot. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: And I have a part time job delivering for Papa John's <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: You sound sexy.. I bet you want me in the back of your car.. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: Maybe some other time. You should call up Papa John's and make an order <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Haha! OK <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Hello! I'd like an extra-EXTRA large pizza just dripping with sauce. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: Well, first they would say, &quot;Hello, this is Papa John's, how may I help you&quot;, then they tell you the specials, and then you would make your order. So that's an X-Large. What toppings do you want? <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: I want everything, baby! <br>
<br>
J-dogg: Is this a delivery?<br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Umm...Yes<br>
<br>
DirtyKate: So you're bringing the pizza to my house now? Cause I'm home alone... and I think I'll take a shower... <br>
<br>
J-dogg: Good. It will take about fifteen minutes to cook, and then I'll drive to your house. <br>
<br>
&lt;pause&gt; <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Jdogg, I'm almost finished with my shower... Hurry up! <br>
<br>
J-dogg: You can't hurry good pizza. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: I'm on my way now though <br>
<br>
&lt;pause&gt; <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: So you're at my front door now. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: How did you know? <br>
<br>
J-dogg: I knock but you can't hear me cause you're in the shower. So I let myself in, and walk inside. I put the pizza down on your coffee table. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: Are you ready to get nasty, baby? I'm as hot as a pizza oven <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Oooohh yeah. I step out of the shower and I'm all wet and cold. Warm me up baby <br>
<br>
J-dogg: So you're still in the bathroom? <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Yeah, I'm wrapping a towel around myself. <br>
<br>
J-dogg: I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants with my other hand. As I penetrate the gooey cheese, I moan in ecstacy. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are rough, but the sauce is deliciously soothing. I blow my load in seconds. As you leave the bathroom, I exit through the front door.... <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: wtf? <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: You perverted piece of shiat <br>
<br>
DirtyKate: Fuk <br>
<br>
<br>
----------<br>
J-Dogg: I pull out my schlong, and rub it on your breasts... <br>

<br>
Partner: Oh yeah, that feels good j. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: Smack, Smack, yeeeaahhh. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: I make some toast and eat it off your ass. Land O' Lakes butter all in your crack. Mmmm. <br>
<br>
Partner: you like that? <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: I peel some bananas. <br>
<br>
Partner: Oh, what are you gonna do with those? <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: get me peanuts. Peanuts from the ballpark. <br>
<br>
Partner: Peanuts? <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: Ken Griffey Jr. Yeaaaaahhh. <br>
<br>
Partner: What are you talking about? <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: I'm spent, I jump down into the alley and smoke a fatty. I throw rocks at the cats. <br>
<br>
Partner: This is stupid. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: Stone Cold Steve Austin gives me some beer. <br>
<br>
J-Dogg: Wanna Wrestle Stone Cold? <br>
