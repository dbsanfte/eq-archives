<br>
The admittance standards to get into the military, and to get into certain specialist sections of any military are largely based on physical tests.  Strength, speed, endurance etc..<br>
<br>
Based on a 48hrs show I saw a few months ago, it seems that men and women are judged against separate standards.<br>
<br>
As an arbitrary example Men had run with a backpack weighing 40lbs for 10 miles in a time less than 60 minutes.  Women had to do the same 10 miles with 40lbs in 90 minutes.<br>
<br>
Basically they are allowing women in based on a lower standard.<br>
<br>
These standard are probably based on what the average man and woman can do.  The man is asked to be 110% of the average and the woman the same 110% of average.  The &quot;norm&quot; just differs due to the fact that women are generally shorter, weaker, and lighter.<br>
<br>
Should the military be forced to lower standards in the name of affirmative action?  Does this in fact weaken the Marines, or the Infantry?  Does integration actually strengthen some branches such as the Air Force? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bbloodtide14744.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cullyn>Cullyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/01 3:27:47 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/eeexcellent.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Women in the military - should we set a double standard?</span><hr size=1> I believe that the standards should be completely equal for both men and women.  I will contend though that current standards are most likely skewed to favor men.  Women are naturally more skilled in many areas that can benifit military.  Generally women have better senses (sight, smell) and according to most psycological studies, women work better in group settings (right up the military's alley).  I have also seen studies that indicate women (in general) have a higher tolerance for pain (childbirth, OUCH!) and greater endurance than men.  <br>
<br>
Men generally excel in tests of brute strength, speed, have better hearing, and are generally better coordinated physically (speaking in terms of averages).  <br>
<br>
<br>
I would favor applying the same standards to everyone in a sex-blind manner, but the tests should be updated to reflect areas that are natural strengths to women.   <br>
<br>
I'd like to add that this by no means an area in which I have any expertese, but I have always been interested in reading about studies comparing quantifiable differences in men and women.  The theories of how traditional male/female roles throughout human evolution have defined modern male/female abilities are quite interesting to me.  (ex.  women see better because they were the ones gathering small berries and seeds for food, men sprint better because they were out chasing down deer, etc.). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uuraniumcw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>UraniumCW</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/15/01 4:59:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Women in the military - should we set a double standard?</span><hr size=1> That's what I mean.<br>
<br>
Women in the air force is good.  Reflexes, sight etc.  Their increased body fat alledgedly help withstand g-forces as well.<br>
<br>
Men as grunts is good.  Larger muscle/body mass means larger possible packs and larger weapons.<br>
<br>
I think that there are lower requirements for women to get into the General Infantry than for men.  They don't say for instance &quot;Can you carry a 200lb pack?&quot;, instead it's 120lbs for women and 200lbs for men.<br>

That is kind of like saying we have this guy over here running for president, he knows alot about foreign policy, he is intelligent, and a good leader.  Now over here we have a black woman who cannot read, is rude,arrogant, and prone to acting rashly.  They are both equally qualified to be president.<br>
<br>
  It just doesn't make sense.  A physical job requires someone physically capable of doing the job, what if a smaller man could fill the requirements that the womens test offered, if he was the same height and weight as the average woman?  he would be the equal of a woman with the same results, but they would discriminate against him for being male. If a company does this with anything but physical requirements they would quickly find themselves sued for sexual discrimination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umagiuos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magiuos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.larryelmore.com/images/Finished%20color/dl02.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/17/01 2:35:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Women in the military - should we set a double standard?</span><hr size=1> This kind of politically correctnessdoes one thing....<br>

<br>
It's the same thing as affirmative action -- proponents of &quot;double standards&quot; support equality through discrimination.  So many people want &quot;equality&quot;, then equate &quot;equality&quot; with forced preferences (through reduced standards or quotas).<br>
<br>
If you want to compete, then compete on the same playing field.  You should be able to think, lift, run, etc. at the same level as everyone else, no exceptions, I don't care about your race, age, sexual orientation, or class (except druids.  druids suck.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uspioctor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spioctor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 710<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/01 4:10:01 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.donorlaw.com/spio4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Women in the military - should we set a double standard?</span><hr size=1> Not sure how you can equate affirmative action programs for purposes of a college education versus serving in the military.  The goal behind AA was to give a preference to similarly situated individuals--not a handicap like in golf where the lesser qualified obtained the posistion.  Either way, AA had no place in the military as it related to combat assignments.<br>
<br>
Also, while its nice rhetoric, quotas in affirmative actions are not and were not permissible.  The policy behind AA was to level the playing field and break down barriers that historically existed in our country.  Personally, I no longer see a viable role for affirmative action as all Americans now have equal access to employment and education. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>

<br>
And as to the palying field being equal Spio, yer dead wrong. Not all americans have the same opportunities.  Especially when those making the hiring decicions themselves are biased for whatever reasons.<br>
<br>
In high school i watched many of my idiot friends apply for jobs as waiters or whatnot at local businesses....when i applied at the same businesses i was not considered for the same positions, simply because my application has a hispanic last name. My real name is Christo Martinez.  I actually surprised several of my prospective employers when i came to interview...One actually told me he was expecting a mexican and was hoping to get one, because they are such good workers, and don't chat with the waiters.  In some ways in my life i've been able to use it to my advantage, but much of my life is still affected by nothing other than my hispanic last name.  My family hasnt spoken spanish in the last 100 years, yet we all still get the hispanic yellow pages, and my last damn Census was Mainly in spanish.  So don't feed me that it's equal BS, it's improved but it takes ALOT of hard work to get beyond the fact that ppl will discriminate against you B4 they even lay eyes on you. <br>

I remain troubled by the bigots and racist that permeate our society.  My main point is that the need for AA has been significantly reduced through the use of education, sensitivity training and anti-discrimination statutes.  Coupled with several decades of being given opportunities that were previously not available, the need for AA is not as great as in the past.  <br>
<br>
Also, racism and bigotry is not limited to the "majority" as minorities can be as intolerant of others as the white christian male has been over the past two centuries. <p><center><A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17657"><IMG src=http://www.donorlaw.com/Spio.bmp></center></a>
