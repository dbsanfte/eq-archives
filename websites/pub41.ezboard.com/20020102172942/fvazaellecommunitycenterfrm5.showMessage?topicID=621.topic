<br>
Hunting in KC for 3 hours on Saturday.  I was the only warrior in group.  I managed to pull a Caller of Sathir back to the left moat, and we killed the mob...  Lo and behold, the first ever cobalt drop I'd ever seen here...  Couple ppl in group started to congratulate me.  But the leader of the group who was MLing for us, looted the warrior only cobalt boots.  He said we needed to roll for them.  I pointed out they were warrior only, and I was the only warrior in the group.  Didn't seem to matter to him, he said to roll.  A cleric ended up winning the roll for the boots, and walked away happy with something she couldn't even use.<br>
<br>
I was pretty pissed about it, but the leader Cameljon tried to explain to me that it was the only fair thing to do.  Told me I'd have a better chance getting cobalt if I just went out and purchased them.<br>
<br>
This was a non-guild group, everyone was from different guilds.  Still, I've always played by NBG guidelines.  I'll never be able to afford cobalt, as I never have any money.  Any gear I outgrow gets passed down to someone else that can use it.  <br>
<br>
Am I right to be pissed here, or was the leader acting appropriately?  If he was, then should I start rolling on everything that drops, even if I can't use it, because I might be able to sell the gear, or sell multiquesting rights with it?<br>
<br>
Not pissed at the cleric who won, she was just doing what the group leader said to do, to roll.  But I'm kinda pissed that Cameljon took an item that would obviously benefit the warrior (who's still mostly in crafted or worse at lvl 51) and randomed it out to the entire group.<br>

I feel your pain man.  When I was doing a lot of time in KC, I kept trying to get the CY camp, in the hopes that Swarmcaller would drop.  Swarmcaller...an excellent 2hs Ranger only weapon.  Many Sentry's later...one finally dropped.  I started salivating immediately.  Best weapon I'm likely to see in a long time.  Leader says we must roll for it, as the casters don't really get any drops in there and it's not fair to them.  I agreed, and thankfully won the roll.  Kind of pissed me off at the time, and I still to this day don't understand why.<br>
<br>
Last night, however, I was in Fungus Grove (?) with an excellent group who agreed NBG on any spell drops, random on anything no one NEEDED.  We ended up with lots of spells to distribute, and 2 Mushroom Veils to /random for.<br>
<br>
I prefer NBG, and I may be a sap, but if I win a roll for something that someone else in the group needs, I tend to give it to them.<br>

NBG is sometimes abused by people who &quot;bank&quot; their drop before going to the dungeon and claim that they &quot;need&quot; the drop, only to be seen selling one later.<br>
<br>
6 people enter the dungeon, put their xp, time and knowledge on the line and you want to cut them out of the split?<br>

NBG is for good friends (who know each other well) and guild groups (where benefit of all &gt; benefit of the individual).  <br>

NBG was pretty much the rule of thumb on vaz for a longtime and in some situations I still try to stick with it or argue for it, but in essence with so many twinks these days and new ppl that have never had anything, its kinda hard these days to be all chivalrous and shit.<br>

When no one had gear when vaz popped, it was NBG almost ALWAYS, but as with anything, time will make its mark. <p>

about the topic, NBG is long dead, the sooner you realize this the better for your sanity, nobody likes it but that's how this is now, also you can do what some people do, you don't take any loot, but if class specific shit drops that's going to you, if nothing drops don't you say, that you got nothing and now you want to roll on stuff....like some people...if this doesn't work and the group is a pure greed group, then you should roll on the celestial healing even if the cleric doesn't have it, he can buy it off ya for 1k if he needs it<br>

Just start a group of your own, tell them you want to use NBG rules, and you are even willing to let them roll on your item you are replacing.  You may want to say that you are hear trying to exp, and possibly claim some cobalt gear to upgrade your crafted.  Maybe they will allow it, maybe not.  There are alot of casters that may be in KC trying to camp for a cobalt roll to sell to buy stuff for themselves.  As a druid, I have noticed the lack of caster stuff dropping(KD Arena F. U.).  But, way it goes.  I can say this cause I have seen it first person.  Exped in CoM for hrs with pick up group, they very well knew I wanted a trance stick.  One dropped, I got it.  However, nothing at all dropped for casters all weekend long.  NBG can work, but I bet the casters coulda used the 4k from that trance stick if they would've won it.  Think of it that way.  <br>
<br>
But I agree with Herder as well...NBG is often a friends only thing, but nice when a group decides on it up front and sticks to it.  And offer your old stuff for them to roll on if they give you Cobalt or whatever warrior item you got.  They want to get better too, and it will cost them alot more on average to improve gear than a warrior...(lack of drops).<br>
<br>
Sorry you lost roll, but I gotta go with decision of group since I am assuming it wasn't set up as NBG up front.<br>

Pickup groups were considered grabbing from a group of individuals whom you may not be guilded with, but that you've certainly xp'd with from time to time over the course of levelling.<br>
<br>
Today's level 40-55's are a distinctly different group, being a hodge-podge of twinks from those 60's that got bored or decided to switch classes, to the slow levellers who are casual players to the people who can never pick one character they like so instead level 4 at once.  Considering that nobody in these three groups tends to know any of the others, nor their reputations per se, there is a distinctly different environment to group in.  Consider that money didn't mean as much back in the &quot;old days&quot; because practically the only chance you had at getting that FBCR was to actually be there when it dropped.  Buying one was considered.... silly.<br>
<br>
As far as NBG as a general whole, I find it silly that casters bitch about the whole &quot;There's nothing there for me shit&quot;.  Let's be honest, 90% of the gear in this game is aimed towards Melee's.  If you are expecting some sorta 50/50 deal when you go out XPing then you are not only retarded, but you are delusional.  I have yet to see a group, guild, pickup whatever that did not award the casters in the group the caster drops immediately. (Generally because melee know casters get fucked over in the loot distribution).  So quit yer fucking whining casters.<br>

Point is, we weren't there for loot, we just got lucky.  Had we been there looking for loot, we would not have been parked at the left moat.  Run to OT, see how many ppl are there for the loot.  Nobody, because it's not a loot-rich area.  Ppl go there for xp.  We were all in KC for the xp.  I just happened to sneak up and snag a mob that rarely drops a nice loot.  And it happened to drop a serious upgrade to my equipment, and there was nobody else in the group who could benefit from the item.<br>
<br>
As I see it, we were already trying to split loot fairly, by having a ML do all the looting, to split at the end.  Cobalt Boots would have benefited me, as I could have seriously used the armor upgrade.  To anybody else, they are strictly a cash item.  The boots are only a cash item if they get sold.  I didn't have any reason to sell them, as I needed them for an armor upgrade.  If we were truly trying to split loot evenly, I suppose we would have gone to a vendor, sold the boots, and split the money from there, and let whoever wanted them buy them.  Would have been a waste in my mind...<br>
<br>
I'm gonna continue to play by my NBG ideals, this hasn't persuaded me.  I'll just make sure the groups I get in have the same ideas of loot distribution as I do.  I may never have enough money to run by a horse now, no biggie.  I feel good knowing that as a group we reward all members for their participation by passing out loot to the person who most needs it.  Only in circumstances where multiple members have a use for an item is it rolled on, or instances where nobody has a use other than for selling, then it's also rolled on.<br>

<br>
Nope, how is it greed when I'm the only one that can *use* the cobalt boots?  If we would have had some super-uber cloak of permanant clarity drop, I'd not have said one word about letting one of the caster types have it.  Had there been another warrior there, I would have rolled for the item against him/her, and congratulated them had they won.<br>
<br>
This wasn't an example of a group there specifically farming a money item, such as an FBSS.  This was an xp group that got lucky, and got a rare warrior armor drop.  As the only warrior there, I feel that I should have been given the armor.  If the others in the group felt that that should have ended my take on the loot, then I would not have been given any of the money loot we were collecting, and I would not have rolled on any other nice loot that no one needed.<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter, it's over with now...  I'll just be careful who I group with in the future, and I'll make sure the groups I get into are of similar mind as I am about loot distribution.<br>
