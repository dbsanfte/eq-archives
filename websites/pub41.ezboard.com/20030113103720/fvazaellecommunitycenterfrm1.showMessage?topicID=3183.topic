Has everybody seen this on Dev Corner: <br>
<br>
&quot;Using the Test Server to Test <br>
We wanted to talk a bit about some of the recent changes we're testing out on the test server and how they affect our customers. <br>
<br>
Putting new ideas on the Test server is really an interesting thing to do sometimes. On the one hand, players are constantly requesting upgrades, changes, new features... yet when we need to test some of these new ideas out to see how they work in a real situation, lots of people jump up and down in a rage. This is aggravated by the fact that often people have incomplete information, so the new change may not even be what they think it is. New features, changes, and ideas on Test server are there to be tested. They may go live after some testing, they may get significantly changed, or they may end up not working out and being removed from test. <br>
<br>
If you see changes on Test that you like or dislike, by all means send in some feedback and let us know what you think - we're always happy to get more input from players. It also works to just post your opinions and reasons on one of the many class message boards in the EQ community, everyone on the dev team reads many of those boards each day and keeps up on the hot topics concerning each class. <br>
<br>
The game has grown and shifted enormously from when it was initially released, and the role of each class has changed in many ways. Some classes have worked out fairly well, some have seen significant changes in the past, and certainly a few need some meaningful alterations to fit into present-day EverQuest. We're well aware that not all classes have grown equally over time. When the game was originally designed, no classes needed to have things like a defining raid role, as frequent raiding simply didn't exist in the original view of the game. Over time, many new factors have popped up and were retroactively squeezed into class balance, with varying degrees of success. It's our goal that all classes have a vital role, scale well with other members of their class, and remains desirable in many situations. Attaining and keeping that balance with so many classes and play-styles is a slow process to get right. It's better for everyone involved if we take the time to correctly balance and test before moving to live servers, as it causes tremendous amounts of frustration to players when we need to change an item or ability they already are using. <br>
<br>
Some of the things we're working on right now will be controversial - some players are going to love them, and others are sure to be angry about the changes. By the time these changes are done, the game will be healthier, more entertaining, and better balanced for the majority of players. I know it's hard for people to keep a positive outlook when big things are changing around them and they don't necessarily see how it will turn out in the end, but I hope you'll continue to be patient and try to believe we have the good of all classes very much in mind as our goal. <br>
<br>
Some big changes on Test right now include the introduction of some new healing spells for priest classes. This is a sticky topic with many players, especially as it's left clerics with concerns about their desirability to groups and raids. The decision to make some changes to clerics has been a long time coming and much debated before we decided to move ahead with it. Clerics are an unusual class as at high levels they become mandatory for raid encounters, but often are thought of as unneeded in high level groups, and lack the ability to solo efficiently. With the introduction of some better raid-level heals for shamans and druids, clerics can be assured that we're intending to give them more versatility and greatly improve their group and solo roles. It should be possible to have any priest class function as an effective healer, but if you want the best and most efficient healing you'll always get that from a cleric. I'll stop by the cleric board and make a post about more of the cleric specific concerns, but you can be certain that the new heal spells for the other priests are not going to make clerics obsolete by any stretch of the imagination - expect for the role of a cleric to become more entertaining, versatile, and valued soon. <br>
<br>
Classes are continually being looked at and revised. If there are legitimate issues with your class, we'll certainly be addressing them over time. We're working our way through the classes and given time we'll be addressing each class with any needed fixes. These things take time, but we're committed to bringing you the best game possible. <br>
