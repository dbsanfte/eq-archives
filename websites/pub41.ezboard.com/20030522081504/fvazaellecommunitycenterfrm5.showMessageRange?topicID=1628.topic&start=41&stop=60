<br>
You're right, nationalism didn't create Hitler, Hitler created the nationalism to get his policies and control of the government.  I never argued that nationlism was the electing force, it was the hiding force that allowed him to take control.  A &quot;terrorist&quot; attack on the Reichstag allowed Hitler to declare martial law.<br>
<br>
The war on drugs is a permanent war.  There are many references, in the media, print etc that link the CIA as the biggest drugrunners around.  An amorphous war with no clear enemy.  A war that allows you to jail people and create a juggernaut of a security force industry.  The &quot;war&quot; on terrorism is the same.  <br>

Guard Battalion Called To Service <br>
<br>
<br>
By Kristin Buehner The Globe Gazette and AP 8-22-2 <br>
<br>
<br>
FORT DODGE (AP) - The Iowa Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery, will be ordered to federal active duty, the Department of Defense and the National Guard Bureau in Washington, D.C., have announced. <br>
<br>
The battalion, headquartered in Fort Dodge, will deploy to locations <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> within the United States</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for homeland security missions as part of Operation Noble Eagle II, Col. Robert King, public affairs officer for the Iowa National Guard, said Wednesday in a news release. The battalion includes units in Algona, Estherville, Spencer and Storm Lake. <br>
<br>
Duty locations are not being announced. <br>
<br>
Approximately 350 soldiers are affected, 71 of them from the Algona sub unit, King said. <br>
<br>
The soldiers will report to their local armories Saturday to begin home station processing at their unit armories and Camp Dodge in preparation for their deployment and movement to their duty locations. This will include completing administrative functions and loading their equipment for movement. <br>
<br>
The battalion will enter into federal active duty Sept. 3, King said. They must arrive at Fort Knox, Ky., their mobilization station, no later than Sept. 8. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> They will receive specialized training</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to further prepare them for their assignments before moving to their stateside duty locations. <br>
<br>
The soldiers will provide indirect fire support, using artillery weapons accurate from a distance of 11,000 to 12,000 meters, King said. <br>
<br>
The battalion's mobilization is critical to the accomplishment of the Department of Defense Homeland Defense Security Plan, said King. The Iowa soldiers will provide security at several locations. They will take their individual equipment, individual and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> crew-served weapons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and all other organizational equipment. They will also use vehicles and other equipment already in place at their duty locations. <br>
<br>
Fourteen soldiers will return to their armories after they are in-processed at Fort Knox. They will serve as the rear detachment and will be responsible for ongoing unit activities, such as recruiting, family and employer support coordination and providing leadership for non-deploying unit soldiers. <br>
<br>
The battalion is being ordered to active duty under a partial mobilization call-up that authorizes the president to order members of the National Guard and reserves to active duty. Duty can be extended for an additional year by the Secretary of the Army. <br>
<br>
Local community send-off ceremonies are being planned at each unit armory prior to Sept. 3. Details will be provided at a later date. The public is encouraged to attend. <br>
<br>
The 1st battalion, 194th field artillery, was last ordered to federal active duty in 1950 during the Korean War. The battalion served duty in Germany as occupation forces. <br>

<br>
An organization that claims to be "...more interested in compiling empirical evidence relating to current events than being a proponent of a particular theoretical position."<br>
<br>
But states as one of it's goals "Anti-war activists would find it easier to gather data and source material needed to produce literature aimed at informing the mainstream public." <br>
<br>
Instead of maintaining an impartial focus, states it is anti-government and anti-corporation. "...we can effectively work to undermine the belligerency of corporate rule, current U.S. foreign policy and the like..."<br>
<br>
This site is not an impartial, accurate reporting of events, this is a site with a political agenda "...we need to introduce some degree of specialization into the progressive left movement."<br>
<br>
The number of times "Activist" is used is frightening.<br>
<br>
This site is no better than the corporate media they are so against.  They spin facts to suit their needs as much as any of the politicians they hate.  They just do it in a way that suits their needs, and call it "accurate".  <br>

Sudan was surveilling him, collecting a &quot;vast intelligence database on Osama bin Laden and more than 200 leading members of his al-Qaeda terrorist network... [The US was] offered thick files, with photographs and detailed biographies of many of his principal cadres, and vital information about al-Qaeda's financial interests in many parts of the globe.&quot; After 9/11, a US agent who has seen the files on bin Laden's men in Khartoum says some were &quot;an inch and a half thick.&quot; <br>

<br>
Herder, read who is allowed to make reports to TIPS under their current assignment.   AFAIK, the only individuals who are allowed to give information to this line is those people involved in the current industries which are affected.  Perhaps you could correct me if I am wrong but this in no way involves John Q. Public.<br>
<br>
As far as this specific regiment being called up among many does not surprise me.   Are you honestly feeling that this specific regiment will be called up to quell domestic unrest?  More than likely I would suspect that this regiment has been called up for a &quot;possible&quot; action which the current administration feels is inevitable in Iraq.  If you are so foolish as to believe that the US Government would allow an artillery batallion to take action within the US and to call this homeland security, than you need to take a breather.<br>
<br>
  I need only point to the periods prior to the Korean and Vietnam conflicts to detail the point I am making.  In as such the United states presidents have taken it upon themselves to activate and ready those units they see as most likely being involved in a combat situation under &quot;other than likely&quot; pretenses.<br>
<br>
I'll most definitely eat my words when the 194th is dropping Shells on the anti-iraq people of Des Moines, Iowa.<br>

On their site they both proclaim that they are ""...more interested in compiling empirical evidence relating to current events than being a proponent of a particular theoretical position."<br>
<br>
(That means they will present evidence without regard to politics...agree?)<br>
<br>
Then they state:<br>
<br>
"...we can effectively work to undermine the belligerency of corporate rule, current U.S. foreign policy and the like..."<br>
<br>
(sounds like they are being a proponent of a political position)<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
"...we can effectively work to undermine the belligerency of corporate rule, current U.S. foreign policy and the like..."<br>
<br>
(hmmm...if that doesn't sound like they are being a proponent of a policial position, I'm not sure what does.)<br>
<br>
As much as I hate to pull a "dictionary rant", for your benefit I feel it is needed.<br>
<br>
The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (all I could find lying around) defines Hypocrisy as "The feigning of beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess..."<br>
<br>

Um where have you been? the Palestinians were there first, then after WW2 ended the jews started moving their and were granted Israel as a homelad, while the Palestinians got the West bank and the Gaza strip to live in. Then Israel kinda took those lands for their own and started settling there, leaving Palestinians homeless.

Anyway, most of the land that is Israel today (and a lot of land that isn't Israel today), belonged to them dating back thousands of years.  They have been conquered and driven from their homeland, or forced to assimilate, several times throughout history.<br>
<br>
The point being Israel has the right to take back what they think is rightfully theirs.  IMO, they are just driving off the squatters and the descendants of enemies who forced the Jews to scatter to the four corners of the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1975<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/02 9:55:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1628.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well</span><hr size=1> If historical precedence is a measure for land control, we here in the United States better start packing our bags.

Furthermore, the united monarchy of David and Solomon, which is described by the Bible as a regional power was at most a small tribal kingdom.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zionism was a movement founded in 1897 by a Viennese Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl.  His slogan was that &quot;a land without a people&quot; should be a national home for &quot;a people without a land&quot;.  In other words, he made the serious mistake of asserting that Palestine was effectively uninhabited.  There were also anti-Semitics who urged Jews to clear off to Palestine or to Uganda or Cyprus or Madagascar or other remote or isolated places considered by Herzl himself as alternative &quot;homelands.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even if the settlers in Palestine were Dutch or British, there would still be an Arab nationalist resistance to the loss of their land.<br>
<br>
There are two very valid arguments on both sides.  Palestinians have always been, throughout history, terroristic people, continually being kicked out of other countries when trying to settle there because of this.  However, Israel has already been established as a state and no amount of terrorism will change that.  In all honest, I don't think there will ever be an outcome that everyone will be happy with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uammerique.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ammerique</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/02 9:24:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1628.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> Everytime Palestine has waged a war with Israel, they lose land.
