<br>
We've all known that while there are lots of nice folks in EQ, we have our share of assholes too.  But when some nice /anon cleric runs by my lvl 20 alt with drive-by uber buffs, I'm greatful and appreciative of their kindness.  And I've spent my time tracking down the corpse of a young 'un who got in over her head.  So why not give away KEI?  Or Ageo?  Or SOW?  Or ports?<br>
<br>
Might as well start attacking PoK books and Nexus Scions because they killed the 10pp per port market.  Just silly.<br>
<br>
If you want to sell KEI, go to a different zone.  Or wait it out, Raja's not giving hugs 24/7.  <br>
<br>
Fact is, Antihuggies, as far as I'm concerned you're an adolescent whiner with poorly reasoned arguments and low self-esteem.  Get a life.<br>
<br>
Raja's a nice lady with a good philosophy, one that I followed before I ever met her.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Smile, and the whole world smiles with you.  <br>
<br>
And when my partner and I buff or do a favor for a young 'un, all we ask is that they pass on the kindness to someone else.<br>

I think Raja is doing a service to the server.  I am happy that we have someone who can cast a buff that clearly helps players to level. Regarding 100 pp days I say doh. All classes have ways to generate pp and loot. And the game is about loot that is the drops (many &quot;no&quot; drop). I have a 51 Druid capable of pp farming that can rival KEI casting pp from my 60 chanter. I (with Druid) went 50 to 51 without KEI using mainly self buffs and clickies. But KEI is so nice - can I hear someone complain about receiving 5 sec heals opposed to 10 sec heals? <br>
<br>
I had wondered about hugs when I was a mid 50s chanter and LFG. Well even if the group has KEI crowd control is necessary. Pops are the nature of the EQ world. So I do not believe that hugs is taking chanter's work. So far as 20k for the spell, what uber thing in EQ does not command that kind price?<br>
<br>
Regarding Anti, I am not interested in a union of KEI casters. Or any anti movement for that matter. I will cast when convenient AND there is a need. One evening I noticed as I was logging was lots of KEI less players in Nexus. Although tired I cast for a while. The pp was not bad but, I will work for mgb which is indeed the thing to cast. <br>
<br>
So hang in there Raja and keep up the hugs and (see other posting regarding KEI cost) charge when the coin lands on that other side. Ultimately, you have set the standard for donations from dark blues and twinks. That would be somewhere around 100pp on average. The average chanter has you to thank for this.<br>

But I do tradeskill and KEI is very thx for that, especially higher level tradeskilling where practices are expensive and skillups are rare.  Anyone who is skilling over 100 and doesn't get KEI is shooting themselves in the foot.<br>
<br>
I was at a forge one time and Herder came running by and offered to buff me.  I thought, how nice!  So I grouped and he KEIed me and ran off.  I had to ask a guildmate, &quot;what is Kodiaks Endless Intellect?&quot;  Liked what it did for my skillup rate though!<br>
<br>
Raja is very nice and has no life.  But still, very nice.  Philosophers would argue that there is no such thing as a selfless act and maybe she wants to be a server celebrity, well if so she's got it, and bully for her.  I think she's a sweetie.<br>
<br>
To the origional poster, I sure hope you got the spell for more reasons than making money.  Sure wish there was a way I could click a button and make 100pp.  I think Raja is both very nice and a shrewd businessperson. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ferret@vazaellecommunitycenter>Ferret</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/22/03 4:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1937.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lame</span><hr size=1> God forbid someone should cross the KEI mafia.<br>

I have not seen Anti lately but have not been casting as much in Nexus. Anti possibly did not understand page one in Economics which is supply and demand. When I got KEI about a month ago the KEI supply was catching up with demand (and right now there are 3 more KEI chanters in my guild alone). So supply is starting to get far ahead of demand. When I group with my alt cleric my first question to the leader &quot;is there a KEI chanter in the group and if not mind if I pick one up&quot; and I do buy from Raja.<br>
<br>
So are you going to make 50 to 100k casting in Nexus? It is going to soon take quite a while. Probably it would be faster in Sebilis etc. camps. Also there are many irritations outside of the lack of aa. A fairly large percentage of players get that KEI hit and run without even a roots for a donation. Yes I have gotten such things. Most chanters have. Most have gotten the multi paragraph tells. &quot;My account has been hacked and I am pp less plz plz plz etc etc.&quot; It is also easy to interrupt casting macros that will divert the KEI to another or make it not start with the trade window manipulation.<br>
<br>
Now under the laws of economics there will always be a chanter or two in Nexus. Just like there is a horse and buggy manufacturer (movies and weddings etc). But the big pp will be in the drops and not the increasingly rare calls for a KEI. So new 60s welcome to the club and sorry if you cant get a horse in a few hours of button pressing.<br>
<br>
So if you are someone who leveled a chanter to make big pp, I am afraid, you will be disappointed. If you leveled a chanter like me for fun, you will keep having fun. I like buffing and debuffing. After bashing and nuking mobs when I started the game, I was impressed by the depth of the chanter character. So best luck all.<br>
