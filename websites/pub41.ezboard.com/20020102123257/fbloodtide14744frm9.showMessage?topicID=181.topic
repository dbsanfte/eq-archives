Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that win95b supports firewire.  I got USB and AGP working under 95, but it looks like I'm finally going to have to upgrade my operating system.  I'd go to 2000, but it costs twice as much.  <br>
<br>
Looking for experiences.  Should I go to 98SE or ME?  I've heard some say that ME sucks, and to go with 98SE, and some that say ME works fine.  I'd just as soon by ME if all is equal since its newer, and presumably would last me longer (they both cost exactly the same).  <br>
<br>
Any thoughts?  <br>

I like 2k, but it is a bit expensive, tho you can sometimes get Profesional as an OEM version (cheaper) if you buy a HD too... so if you were looking to upgrade your hard drive get both at once and get the better operating system.<br>
<br>
I have never heard anybody who liked ME.  I'm sure some people did.  I didn't and none of my friends did.  We all thought it was a big pile of garbage.<br>
<br>
My opinion?  98SE if you can't afford to do the OEM version option for 2K.<br>

<br>
But as it turns out my problems stem from SoundBlaster Live and the VIA KT133 chipset at the moment so it is hard to say that ME was the problem.  I do know that when I had to Reformat my Hard Drive that ME was Very Simple to install and run...but that was the only thing so far that I have found that I truely like about it.<br>
<br>
it looks like the security on ME is a little more beefed up and ME is designed to be a networkable Operating system for households so if that is in your future you might consider it.  I have not tried the networking side of the program so I have no good or bad experience with it.<br>
<br>
oh well .. what ever you decide....go to the Microsoft Windows update page and do the critical updates before you start installing external hardware.  It will take some time to download everything but IMO it is worth the time to avoid some of the headaches that Microsoft has worked out of thier product.  If you are using Internet Explorer 5.5 you can find the link to the Windows Update site in the TOOLS menu at the top of the IE window.  This Advice is for BOTH operating systems! :) Depending on what you computer has on it as far as hardware is concerned...make sure that you have backed up all registration codes and you can keep all you Email folders by saving the files in C:\WINDOWS\Application Data\Identities\{a large number with lots of dashes! :)}\Microsoft\Outlook Express and saving all of the files with a .DBX file extension to a floppy or a CD if you have burner.  I spent about 2 hours collecting all that data on registration codes and I also save all the EQ files to CD and that seemed to cut down on the EQ reinstall downloads as well but I am still having a bit of a problem with a couple files...oh well I will figure them out eventually! :)<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope that helps! :)<br>

(You want your computer slower?) Granted some people do not have problems with ME, but plenty of people do. ME has several features that cause problems with software and hardware. I guarantee that Win 98 has less problems than ME, so you are just betting if your profile fits those who can use ME without problems. You do know that Windows XP is coming out soon? I think that leaves ME in a terrible position. ME has had a short life span and limited adoption by customers. Win98 is certainly more stable than any of the consumer OS's, I would buy it over ME if I lacked the cash for Win2k.<br>

I BUY my software.  I BUY CDs too.  What a novel concept for some.  I completely do not understand the attitude that you should just rip off software and music right and left.  Like we are all just entitiled to enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor for free.  <br>
<br>
Developing software is expensive.  Software companies need to make money.  Record companies have to make money, and god knows the artists deserve to make money.  When I was a broke college kid I used ripped software, but now that I actually have a real job, I'm perfectly happy to pay for the stuff I use.  It IS stealing, regardless of whatever sort of rationalization you use to justify it to yourself.  I know if I had worked hard to create something, I'd expect to get paid for it.  Last time I checked the US wasn't a socialist state, so you have to pay the bills somehow.  <br>
<br>
I ESPECIALLY pay for games.  Many game companies operate on slim profit margins.  If you enjoy a particular game, you should buy it.  The big guys like ID/Blizzard/etc. arent gonna notice it if some people pirate their game, but the little guys really get burned.  We would't have lots of the really innovative software that was out there if people didn't pay for it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info on ME though.  Its primarily for a DV camera that I am looking to buy, so I think Im going to go with ME.  I can get it online for about $77 for the full version (not the upgrade), which I would rather have than the upgrade version.  Its only about $30 more anyways.     <p><img src=http://home.swbell.net/denegar/cullyn.JPG><BR>

If you remember Win95 coming out, Microsoft put a min requirement of a 486 with 8mb of RAM (Absurd!). I do not know ME's min requirements off hand, but I know there are problems with ME on plenty of machines with *Porsche bodies*. Truth, ME is slower than 98, every OS that Microsoft releases is slower than the last. If you have some awesome system, your computer is still slower than it would be if you *Downgraded* your OS!<br>

<br>
I certainly wasn't trying to claim to never have used any.  I was flat broke for 4 years, and had easy access to tons of software for free.  When you have no capacity whatsoever to be buying software, it changes the equation a little.  I did occasionally feel guilty about it though.  <br>
<br>
<br>
My beef is with the attitude that some people have that they are &quot;stickin it to the man&quot; (or some nonsense like that) by pirating software or downloading MP3s.  Outside of microsoft a few other big companies, you're really just hurting the artists and/or programmers that put a lot of hard work into that program/music.  I've had people tell me stuff like &quot;those guys are rich, they dont need my money&quot;.  Sure they may be rich, but its because they had talent, and the worked hard to get there.  They deserve to be rich.  If I enjoy what they produce, then I'll purchase it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, for Cinari's question, Win2000 has a lot more to load up when its booting.  98 is just 95 on speed, 2000 is based on the NT kernel, and can't really be compared fairly to 98.  Now if ME booted slower on the faster machine, that would be crap.  Boot times have little to do with computer performance either.  I really could care less how long my PC takes to boot as long as its less than a few minutes, its just better chug out the frame rates when Im gaming :).<br>

<br>
Not always true. Certainly newer OS's have more housekeeping things to do when starting up. Longer boot times often occur because the system is loading more into memory. Every new process that is running on your computer slows it down. <br>
<br>
This is good reason to keep your computer's software at a minimum. Regular maintence of your computer should include getting irate when your girlfriend or significant other installs some cutesy girl program that puts 4 more icons into your taskbar.<br>
