<br>
Paul Buchanan: New World Order now in disorder <br>
<br>
01.04.2003 - <br>
<br>
Like most armchair pundits, I have been keeping a scorecard on the war: number of bombs dropped, number of troops, tanks, aeroplanes and chemical weapons on either side, number of battlefield and civilian casualties. <br>
<br>
However, it seems that these are just the statistics, and that the scorecard should be about who is winning and losing. Winning and losing wars is a matter of achieving political objectives through the use of force, in the short term and in the longer term. <br>
<br>
This is my assessment after one week of conflict. <br>
<br>
The biggest winner is Osama bin Laden. Wherever he is, living on the run, and even if he is a long-term loser who will pay with his life for his transgressions, he can take comfort that the sequels to his September 11 war pronouncement have played largely as planned. <br>
<br>
The Muslim world is increasingly agitated and united against what they see as American-led imperialist aggression. Even Iran, Iraq's bitter enemy, has joined sides with Syria in defending Saddam Hussein's regime. Support for the Palestinian cause rises in parallel to the loathing of the Israel-US axis. <br>
<br>
Several moderate Arab governments are increasingly pressured by populations galvanised into hatred by the war. Many have been forced to pull back from their pro-Western stances. <br>
<br>
For its part, the West is increasingly divided to the point that some of the strongest alliances and institutions of the Cold War risk collapsing. Among the largest members of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;, domestic opposition and disenchantment has risen along with the progress of the war and its body count. <br>
<br>
What were thought of as new and old partners in peace for the US, such as Russia and Turkey, have broken ranks and complicated the war plans (with repercussions that are uncertain but likely to be negative). <br>
<br>
Anti-war and anti-US sentiment is on the rise throughout Asia and Latin America. The terrorist threat continues unabated amid &quot;orange alerts&quot;, police raids, ricin, cyanide and anthrax threats, and the growing curtailment of civil liberties in a number of the world's most mature democracies. <br>
<br>
Regime change is in the air, and not of a voluntary or peaceful sort. The New World Order that ostensibly heralded the end of the Cold War is more akin to a Hobbesian state of nature, or at least a state of disorder. Bin Laden must be smiling. <br>
<br>
The losers are clearly the House of Saud, which, already deeply divided among itself, will fall as a result of the Iraq conflict. Unable to turn on its fundamentalist bases, and unable to wrench free from the economic domination of its Western masters, the Saudi elite has sealed its fate by backing a loser with the denial of any military aid - including use of its airspace - in the effort to remove Saddam from power. <br>
<br>
Regardless of the outcome of the war, the Saudis lose either way, as both their control of Opec and political influence will be significantly diminished, and regime change will also be their fate. Yet the casualties extend further than Iraq's neighbours. <br>
<br>
Tony Blair will lose as a result of this. He will be beholden to the Tories rather than his own party for his political survival, and eventually his former comrades will turn on him in a party coup more akin to what was envisioned for Saddam and his Baath Party minions. <br>
<br>
Should there be a post-war rise in terrorist attacks in Britain - and there most surely will be - he will shoulder the blame. <br>
<br>
Another loser will be George W. Bush. Like his father, he will be a one-term president. He has 18 months to finish the war with a categorical victory; rebuild Iraq and reconstruct a pro-Western elected (were that it were democratic) regime in Iraq; continue to prosecute the war on terror with some tangible success in finding bin Laden and dismantling the al Qaeda network while preventing further attacks on US interests at home and abroad; revitalise the US economy on the back of the war; and restore some semblance of diplomacy to his relations with the United Nations, &quot;old&quot; Europe, and most of the rest of the world. <br>
<br>
He will have to have contained the North Korean threat without seeming to be weak yet avoiding a regional holocaust. He will have to do all of this while holding to his programme of huge tax cuts for wealthier Americans coupled with more defence spending and an increased military presence abroad that invites a trickle flow of returning dead soldiers. <br>
<br>
With the presidential campaign under way in less than six months, that will be a tall order, and he will be able to meet the challenge only if the Democrats continue to parade clowns rather than viable candidates in the build-up to the party nomination. <br>
<br>
John Howard may be a loser, but given his ability to snatch victory from defeat and the strong conservative streak among the Australian electorate, he will suffer lightly compared to his larger coalition partners. <br>
<br>
But if the war drags on and the body count rises, he, too, will find himself swimming against the tide of public opinion. <br>
<br>
General Musharaf, of Pakistan, will be a loser, because he has alienated his people through his submission to the US and its anti-terror campaign within the country, and because he has been unable to quell the fundamentalist extremism that keeps tensions with India simmering over the conflict in Kashmir. <br>
<br>
The bottom line is that it will take a remarkable and seemingly impossible rally to prevent bin Laden and his teammates in terror from escaping with a monumental victory even as they meet their maker. <br>

My question:<br>
Where did you post the proven ties between Saddam and Al-Queda?<br>
<br>
My opinion is that Saddam is a dictator and deserves to die because of his reign of terror, his sons deserve to die because they are of his blood line (there must be some genetic defect there), and his entire pack of hangarounds need to die because they let that moron lead them.<br>
<br>

Your question was a red herring to begin with and you know it. I answered it completely in a manner designed to bring the salient elements of the question to light. <br>

The piece was published 4.1.03, I'll assume that the author of the article was paraphrasing when he says 1 week, since nobody is going to publish material with known out of date facts.  To say he doesn't or didn't &quot;know&quot; about them at the time of publication is silly.<br>
<br>
As to address the article itself, it's merely an Op.ed. piece.  What's so amazing or interesting about that?  Apart from the wild ascertations made by the author aside, I'd be happy to show you a similar right wing, centrist or left wing op.ed. that people can unilaterally shoot down as get this.. someone's opinion.<br>

I dont think for a moment that the world we live in will be hunky dory just because we take out one source of mideast radicialism. <br>
<br>
We have alot of work to do in that area of the world. Hopefully most of it can take place under better terms than the present issue with Iraq. <br>
<br>
But I'm baffled as to how war opponents can justify doing NOTHING in the face of this very real security risk that is embodied with radicalism\terrorism in the middle east? <br>
<br>
The &quot;rules of the game&quot; of international politics are very important. Before we decide on who gets what, so to speak, we have to all grant that certain modus operandi are not gonna be tolerated with terrorism being one method in that category. <br>
<br>
I think one reason why war opponents don't like such discussion is because they feel it's unfair that the US talk in such virtuous terms when, to these people at least, the US has not always acted in a way that is very virtuous. What do they mean when they point to lack of American &quot;virtue?&quot; Typically the litany starts with discussion of how the CIA undermined nationalist gov'ts in Iran, central america, south america, etc during the 1950's and into the 1970's. <br>
<br>
It's always assumed that these covert actions are &quot;bad&quot; in some objective sense. However, if you think about the stated goal of many of these operations, ie to maintain stability in these countries and the region, or to support anti-communist leaders in these areas, these goals are not &quot;Evil&quot; and are not undemocratic. They merely represent the values of a people and economic system that have proven themselves relatively more capable of meeting the basic needs of the people they've served over time. <br>
<br>
How could America be criticized for opposing communism? Has the world missed out on something grand because of American determination to contain and eliminate communism? Ask Cuba and North Koreans how their basic human needs are being met by that economic system. People everywhere, left to choose for themselves, throw off the shackles of communism. It was and is a failed social experiment. <br>
<br>
The United states has consistently opposed instability, tried to contain, and finally eliminate Communism, simply because we have experienced and reflect the experience of the majority of the world that knows that people can get better than what is offered through that political\economic system. <br>
<br>
Capitalism\Democracy may not be perfect, but it does have a profoundly better track record than other alternatives. <br>
<br>
Finally, if you don't like American values in this regard.....what is your alternative? What economic system do you intend to feed and provide for your people with? You don't like our values &quot;shoved down your throats?&quot;....what is YOUR alternative? <br>
<br>
I predict what we will find is that war opponents are really good at being against things, but not so good at alternatives or coming up with another reasonable path. <br>

Are you contending that Saddam has not acted out in radical manner vis a vis relations with other countries in the region? <br>
<br>
I'm saying that he's part and parcel of the &quot;destabilization entourage&quot; at work underminding the security of many civilized nations in this world. <br>
<br>
I hear you saying that he is not. <br>
<br>
You know, you constantly harp about me not answering this question or that question, but when you fail to get down to questions that really matter, then you become suspect......suspect as to your a priori motives.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raolfcq>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 973<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 7:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> No Im saying that it is orders of magnitude more destabilizing to go around invading everyone you view as a threat than simply letting them burn themselves out.

My point was quite simply.. it's an op. ed piece.  Your subject lines asked a question, and you provided the op. ed piece as your information.  Perhaps I had the wrong response.<br>
<br>
Holy FUCK, that just totally changed my opinion of everything, thank you for that totally fucking insightful tidbit of information.  I'm going to go wax my dick and scrub it with a cheese grater tonight to celebrate the event.<br>
<br>
or perhaps.. I'll just file it along with all the other opinion articles that I read from conservatives and liberals alike: Thx, I'll have my own opinion, plz provide me with some sorta facts to have a basis for your arguments rather than reaching outta fucking left field and saying the fairy godmother of knowledge spanked your ass with her gg info wand. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204898">Ayiar Frullaniaceae</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
