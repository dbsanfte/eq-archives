She telephones the police, and a nearby K-9 unit is the first to respond. As the officer and dog approach the house, the woman storms out onto the porch and shouts, “I get robbed, I call the police for help, and they send me a blind cop?”<br><br>A blonde who suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her goes out and buys a gun. She goes to his apartment unexpectedly, opens the door, and, sure enough, finds him naked in the arms of a redhead. Well, now she’s angry. She opens her purse and takes out the gun. But as she does so, she is overcome with grief and points the gun at her own head. <br><br>The boyfriend yells, &quot;No, honey, don’t do it.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Shut up,&quot; she says. &quot;You’re next.&quot;<br><br><br>A blonde goes into the dry cleaners to have her sweater cleaned. She asks the clerk, “How much?”<br><br>He doesn’t hear her correctly and says “Come again?”<br><br>She giggles and says “No…it’s just mustard this time.”<br><br><br>A young ventriloquist is touring the clubs and stops to entertain at a bar in a small town. He’s going through his usual run of silly blonde jokes when a big blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and says, “OK jerk, I’ve heard just about enough of your denigrating blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What do a person’s physical attributes have to do with their worth as a human being? It’s guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in my community, of reaching my full potential as a person…because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes but women at large…all in the name of humor.”<br>Flustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize, but the blonde pipes up, “You stay out of this mister, I’m talking to that little bastard on your knee!” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uterenya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terenya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Purser</span><br>  Posts: 859<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/14/02 11:18:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fodysseyxevfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=496.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few jokes</span><hr size=1> Rofl.. omg <br><br>You are safe from harm with me Sly..

He felt horny and asked her if she would have sex with him. <br>"Of course not, I am chaste!" cried the nun. The man felt rejected, and the bus driver saw that. As all the passengers were getting off the bus, the bus driver came over to the man. <br><br>"Listen, I know you must be disappointed because that nun rejected you, but I think I got a good plan for you. I know that the nun takes the bus to the cemetery every Sunday and prays by a grave near the back gate. You could trick her into having sex with you by pretending that you are God," he explained. <br><br>"Thanks!" exclaimed the man. "I'll do just that!" <br><br>And so the next Sunday, the man went to the cemetery and draped himself with a cloth as disguise. Sure enough, the nun, with a dark veil covering her head, was praying by the grave near the back gate. The man went over to her and proclaimed in a deep voice, "I AM GOD." <br><br>"Oh!" the nun cried. "What do you want me to do? Anything!" <br><br>"Have sex with me," the man answered. <br><br>The nun was hesitant. "Okay," she said<br><br>The man agreed, and they proceeded to make wild sex on the grass. The man was surprised at how well the nun performed, as it was her first time. But she would not let him undress her. <br><br>When they were done the man took off his cloth and said, "Ha, ha, I tricked you! I'm the guy from the bus!" <br><br>And the nun replied, "Ha, ha, I'm the bus driver!"<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thats me holy... mr mack daddy ! <br> <p><center><a href= "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109853"> J a y z - 60 Paladin <YKZ></a></center><br><HTML><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><a><img src="http://bol7.coba.unr.edu/plpics/kiksar/jayzspike.jpg" border=0 alt=></a></center><br></a></BODY></HTML></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueqjayz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ JayZ</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://ioms.homestead.com/files/R.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/17/02 2:04:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uterenya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terenya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Purser</span><br>  Posts: 867<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/17/02 2:38:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fodysseyxevfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=496.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few jokes</span><hr size=1> Statistics That I Know You've Been Losing Sleep<br>Over....<br><br><br>I can't help thinking about the pig.<br><br><br>If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days<br>you would have produced enough sound energy to heat<br>one cup of coffee.<br>(Hardly seems worth it.)<br>********************************************************<br>If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9<br>months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of<br>an atomic bomb.<br>(Now that's more like it!)<br>********************************************************<br>The human heart creates enough pressure when it<br>pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet.<br>(O.M.G.!)<br>********************************************************<br>A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes.<br>(In my next life, I want to be a pig.)<br>********************************************************<br>A cockroach will live nine days without its head<br>before it starves to death.<br>(Creepy.)<br>(I'm still not over the pig.)<br>********************************************************<br>Banging your head against a wall uses 150<br>calories an hour.<br>(Do not try this at home...... maybe at work.)<br>********************************************************<br>The male praying mantis cannot copulate while<br>its head is attached to its body.
