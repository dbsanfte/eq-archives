Really though, if I'd known that all those hours you spent in Iceclad were because you needed the Lodi piece as well as whatever Stormfeather drops, I'd have parked myself on that corspe and not moved until you had the chance to come loot it.  Next time be more aggressive and speak up for yourself; screw it if it makes you look greedy.<br>

I called in a friend of mine who brought not only a 60 warrior to tank but a 60 rogue and a 60 cleric because Max had been LD forever and a day.  We as a group/guild (there were only 7 people online and we were all there) decided to /random the map piece and the shield because we certainly could NOT have done Lodi without the help of my friends (as evidenced by the previous wipe out).  In cases such as these when we are askin another guild to help out then I do believe that using a method such as merit will not work out and that /random is the ONLY viable solution!  Other than that, I agree with most of what has been posted here other than the fact that we are putting loot into the bank to &quot;be distributed later&quot; and after a month or even longer said loot is still in the bank where it does no good whatsoever.  People present who can use it should use it period!<br>

You are talking about 2 comments i didnt say.<br>
<br>
I personally dont deal in specifics unless i know the whole deal.<br>
<br>
Please look back through my comments.<br>
<br>
I can say that all my comments come from lots and lots of experience with the same situations..<br>
<br>
And while i have been unable to raid as of the last few months, i have done a hell of alot of raiding, i have led raids, i have helped start policies with more then one guild. I also know how some of the simpler encounters go. I for one hope i can come back for raids sooner then later.. I miss it too damn much. <br>
<br>
AS far as the hostility from you... i dont quite understand why it came at me..but so be it.<br>

I just find it.... amusing, I suppose, that someone who hasn't been on the game for several months and is no longer an active participant in a guild, would come on that guild's message boards and tell that guild how its matters should be handled.  Regardless of your past standing in Odysseys or PL, you don't play EQ anymore, and I personally don't think it's appropriate the way you charge on the boards and tell the rest of us how it is.  Maybe you don't mean it that way, but if you &quot;look back through your comments,&quot; perhaps you'll see that's how you're coming across.<br>
<br>
It's something I've noticed of you since the day I gained acess to these boards.  It's really not that big of an issue for me, and normally I wouldn't say anything, but the other day I was pissed off and since I was blowing it all out, I let that out too.  Hell, ask any of the people I'm good friends with in game.  They'll tell you that I've yelled and ranted at them at one time or another, but the next day we were back to normal.<br>
<br>
So don't get me wrong; I don't have any sort of personal grudge against you.  If your RL works out enough so that you can get back on EQ, I look forward to getting to know you in game as a member of Odysseys.  Until then, good luck with whatever it is that you do.<br>

Seeing as how many of us are on different time zones, including officers and regular guild members, it might be helpful for the officers to have a list of guildies and what loot has been awarded to them lately, this in my opinion would help a lot in the decision making of who gets what loot. The officers will have access to this in case they are having a hard time deciding. Hell I have a hard time remembering what I did last week, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that our officers are not gonna be able to remember offhand what loot everyone has gotten. And since some officers are only able to attend certain amount of raids, blah what i'm trying to say is that not all our officers are on at ALL our raids, thus they do not really know what each officer has awarded what to those in guild who participated in the recent raid. With this chart that I propose it would help out a lot and hopefully lessen the aslkjing about how it seems some peeps in guild are favorites over others and in how loot is distributed. Just my 2cp. Flame me as u like it's late and just thought I would put in a suggestion.<br>

First of all  i was given the impression people from outside of guild helped with the kill, an it was under a small grp which i wasnt even involvd in. I was in gd at the time this all went down. Obviously i was wrong about this because people got really mad about it.<br>
<br>
Lodi is a easy kill an when people start questioning officers not at the kill it gets tricky via text. People cant fully explain who was camping what an who was all there for the kill. Lately lodi has been killed as soon as it spawns an many guilds are there even some trying to KS. I am the type of person that if i see other guild helping my guild do somethig then i feel they earned apiece of the pie also.<br>
<br>
The way i decide who gets the item is by rolling with other guild prior or after the kill. Rolling is evil way but nothing you can do about coming up with a solution to make both guilds happy at once w/o one feeling they got screwed over. <br>
<br>
When stuff like last week with maxum getting his shieldl ninja by other guild it becomes a grudge match. You cant expect officers to show up to all encounters like these, its like farming a uber rare mob in seb in a pickup grp an having officer decide who should get loot.<br>
<br>
Something like the scout is normally done with few guild members although sometimes you will encounter other guilds setting up to get it also. Scout becomes a race to see who can turn in bag an kill captain first. Many times this can be a huge problem of who has force first. When doing scout i try to be courtious to other guilds at the camp. If they have more than enough people to do kill captain i dont spam guild chat with tells for help with scout. If it looks like an equal race try to work something out with otheer guild before engagin battle.<br>
<br>
So many people have done scout it is impossible to keep a track record of how many each person has been to. When deciding loot it will be based on merit. People that have done scout once cant expect to get two bracers if some dont even have one. For the folks who really want two bracers then i say camp it an only use tells for people who already have bracer or dont need bracer to come help you kill it.<br>
<br>
Whoever was camping the mob is always considered a top candidate for loot from lodi or scout. It just boggling how  people get so upset over this loot. Lodi is average loot an people make it seem like your a gimp if ya dont have it. With a guild our status people should forget about lodi an aim for  something better, god knows there is items alot better out there specially with expansion.<br>

We have some that are online frequently, mornings we have had Tux and Jaraan (less Jar recently due to RL issues), and evenings we have had Teren early evening, and Sirt and Grubb later on (again, less Teren due to RL issues, and Sirt to his move).  With all those officers not online, we lose the presence (among other things) that we need to effectively recruit new members and to handle disputes over semi-rare mobs such as Lodizal and Wuoshi.  With that, I think we need to move quickly to install more officers that play in both times, so more can be avail and onsite at events like this.<br>
<br>
No offense Tux, you did what you thought was fine.  And you can't be everywhere, you play a lot, but need time to yourself just as anyone does.  But if an officer was there onsite and this happened, Micro and Jora wouldnt be questioned if they did the right thing or not....the officer at hand would instead.<br>

I have lost some intrest in the game and i finally realized i needed to get back into doing the things that i like to do.  The main reason i was mad about this is because a 10wis shield was given to someone who doesnt help the guild.  He makes effort to be there yes but he really doesnt have time to do things ever.  Only time hes ever on is during early morning.  I would have much rather seen jora have this shield.  More officers that are on more times is definately a viable solution.  Not flooding the guild with officers but having more people in power around to span the day.  I do wanna say that this post was written in one of the worst times ive had in EQ in a while so i was kinda pressured by the bad events happening with me and i exaggerated a small flaw in the guild.  With that said...this thread is done i hope. <p><p align="center">

<br>
haha Jayson was lvl 58 when all this went down thats too funny.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow this is how it is plain and simple.  If you camp Lodi for the mappiece....you get the map piece plain and simple.  If your camping for the shield.....make it known that thats what you are doing...and you will get the shield.  If your a gimp like microelf and dont say shit.....you dont get shit...<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally camped Lodi for several weeks when I first joined Ody and got KSed by the KS group several times.  I made it known that I wanted the mappiece and actually got to know the KS group and the guy told me the next time they got him he would give it to me.  He even went at length of getting my phone number and he was going to call me.  <br>
<br>
Eventually, I wasa able to spot Lodi before the KS group and called in the troops and we won.   Grubb was there and knew my situation and the nice guy that he is he awarded it to me b/c I was there for it and had been camping it and I had "made it known to others" that that was my intensions.  <br>
<br>
Also, make note that when all this happened I was still a trial member, so thanks once again pappa bear.<br>
<br>
GL to all you folks that dont have the map...my advice to you is send the KS group a tell they usually let the map rot anyways.<br>
