Lots of interesting and respectfull points of view!!  <br>
I am very happy to see that close-mindedness is not rampant here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I respect others rights to eat however they choose, though I hope everyone is making an informed decision! (My reason for sharing the article.)<br>
<br>
I personally try to buy food that is organicly grown and non-gmo.  I do own leather, from before I went veg, and plan on using it and/or keeping it till it is worn beyond use out of respect for the animal that gave its life for my 10 year old coat.  I did buy a new coat this year (lighter weight) that is 100% man made materials, which is also what I look for in shoes.  All my household products are organic and do not inclued chemicals or enviromental poisons.  <br>
<br>
It gives me a good feeling to know that I am doing all I can.  If I didnt live in an apartment I would be growing my own fruits and veggies.  <br>
<br>
To each their own! If you want more info check out <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/GMA/GoodMorningAmerica/GMA0201Obsessed_with_Fast_food.html">this</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.acsh.org/publications/priorities/0902/vegetarian.html">this</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Interesting information and different points of view.  I have also heard the book &quot;The Mad Cowboy&quot; was informative.<br>

<br>
First off, Vegan and all those that chose an eating style of vegetarian or total vegan, good for you!  I think we each and every one of us have the choice to do as we please!  It is a free country, this is AMERICA! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I myself am a meat eater.  I have never seriously considered going vegan or vegetarian.  I would however like to respond to a statement that Vegan made....<br>
<br>
&quot;Hunting is if you are living in a tribal culture because those people understand that they are part of nature and don't think they control nature like people of our culture do.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have been a 'hunter' most all my life.  I know that many dont agree with hunting, and I accept that.  I do not hunt just to 'kill' animals.  I clean and eat what I hunt.  I hunt to be outdoors in nature.  I hunt to enjoy the companionship of family and friends.  Not all hunters are 'red-necks' bent on killing something.  <br>
<br>
Believe it or not, hunting plays a large role in maintaining livable levels of animals in our society.  Hunting, managed by the Federal and State Wildlife and Game agencies, is a critical part of keeping the numbers of certain animals at a state which does not cause a disruption in nature in general.  Did you know that there are more deer in the U.S today than there were at the time the first colonists came to America?<br>
<br>
Without proper culling of heards of certain animals, they would over-run other areas of nature and cause a general imbalence.  Other species of animals and plants would suffer.  Yes I realize that deer populations have grown to such high levels because of the growth of agriculture in the U.S. (more food for them to eat) but this is a situation that must be dealt with.<br>
<br>
I could go on with examples of other animals, but I think I have made my point.  For those of you that disagree with hunting or eating meat, I hold you no ill will, and I would expect you would hold no ill will for me being a hunter.<br>
<br>
We all have choices in life, we need to respect each others differences, even if we disagree with them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>

<br>
You still can Cali.  If you have a deck, you can grow them in pots on the deck.  (I have done this myself -- the bigger pots, the better!)<br>
<br>
If you don't have a deck,  you can set up an area in your apartment with grow lights -- that is if you are that dedicated to it.  <br>
<br>
Health food stores have great stuff, but I find it very expensive.  I don't live in an apartment anymore, and when you own a house, life just gets, well.. very complicated -- especially in the financial aspects.  I buy food from farmers markets when I have the chance, or organic if it is comparable price.  But otherwise, I still stick to the regular stuff.<br>

I couldn't agree more, Cutt.  I have 2 friends who are vegetarians -- each for very different reasons.  They respect me, and I respect them.  I'm not a fanatic about eating meat, and they aren't fanatical about not eating it.<br>

Most of them eg. plastics, polyesters, acrylics are products of the petroleum industry. A massive amount of processing is involved with these. You might save a cow or pig by not wearing leather, but you impact a global ecosystem by using petroleum derivatives (remember the infamous Exxon spill on the west coast). Wools, leathers and silks are renewable materials that have much less environmental consequences attached to their use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=263100><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/upleasegovegan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PleaseGoVegan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=B9B95F>(1/10/02 10:59:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re:</span><hr size=1> First off Kaeleb of course I have no &quot;ill will&quot; towards you. Unfortunately one of my best friends decided he was going to start hunting again this season. Thankfully he hasn't killed anything yet. And I want to say I'm not attacking you or anyone else in my posts just expressing feelings, sometimes I say things a little to bluntly and I appoligize for that. I just have some major feelings about this subject <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
I left out a word in that line I typed that you quoted. I meant to say: &quot;Hunting is OK if you are living in a tribal culture because those people understand that they are part of nature and don't think they control nature like people of our culture do.&quot; <br>
<br>
See I will never agree with hunting of this culture. Take the one statement you wrote: &quot;Believe it or not, hunting plays a large role in maintaining livable levels of animals in our society.&quot; I have a problem with this because you say &quot;in our society&quot;, but nature/world was not put here just for &quot;our society&quot;. We can't control everything. We can't give them more food and less room to live to justify their deaths. Our culture has taught us if something affects our way of life then destroy when is causing &quot;the problem&quot;. <br>
<br>
Our culture really has to wake up or one day there will be no more culture/life on this planet. Not only are we killing ourselves off, but we've decided to take every other living thing down with us. Don't get me wrong I'm guilty to, I'm trying to change though. I know what I'm contributing to is wrong.<br>
<br>
Ok, enough of my negativity <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I like this discussion and hearing everyone's views. I know I probably sound like a nutcase, but I had an awakening 7 years ago. This is what I live for now. If I just change 1 person in my life I'll be happy. <br>

P.S. Hehe Grolmn, pleather is horrible. But they are coming out with some great leather alternatives that don't make your feet sweat and &quot;breathes&quot; like leather. I try to stick to canvas or hemp. I do have non-leather doc marten shoes for work though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showMessage?topicID=149.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showMessage?topicID=135.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=25><img src=http://people.mn.mediaone.net/tiya/highlanders/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.emailToFriend?topicID=139.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.threadControl?topicID=139.topic><img src=http://people.mn.mediaone.net/tiya/tm_close.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=139.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=139.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="tmalliance99801frm5">NWH General<option value="tmalliance99801frm6">NWH Trades<option value="tmalliance99801frm9">NWH Quests<option value="tmalliance99801frm8">NWH Officers<option value="tmalliance99801frm12">NWH Guild Only<option value="tmalliance99801frm10">HoS General<option value="tmalliance99801frm13">HoS Trades<option value="tmalliance99801frm14">HoS Quests<option value="tmalliance99801frm11">KD General<option value="tmalliance99801frm15">DAoC Archives<option value="tmalliance99801frm4">Alliance General Archives<option value="tmalliance99801frm3">Alliance Raid Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=B9B95F>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btmalliance99801>Northwind Highlanders</a><font color=B9B95F> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftmalliance99801frm5>NWH General</a> <font color=B9B95F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
