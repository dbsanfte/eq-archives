I have seen GMs have intimate long-term relationships with players on their server.  I have seen GMs make up reasons to change player names, even when they don't violate the name policy.<br>
<br>
That said, I don't know anything about Jaydrox.  He could be the first Guide/GM that never played favorites, didn't misuse his limited powers, etc.<br>
<br>
Just feel lucky that he:<br>
1) can communicate in English<br>
2) responds to petitions<br>
3) participates in events<br>
<br>
Good luck keeping your account.  I know several who have lost everything for much less than what you are accused of.<br>
<br>
Past history has shown us there is no such thing as a fair and impartial review.  If the server GM recommends an action by filling out the paperwork, that action will be implemented regardless of how wrong the GM may be.  It will be backed up all the way to Brad.  If you attempt to fight it, get used to stone walls and silence.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel banning is the ultimate reprisal and should never be done unless there is a strong LEGAL basis.  Clicking &quot;I accept&quot; on the EULA is not a strong legal basis for Verant to do anything they desire. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubled1234.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bled1234</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/26/01 4:23:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: jaydrox finally found an excuse to ban me</span><hr size=1> booyah neferati!<br>

You're looking for the Letter of the Law while Jaydrox seems to be relying on the Spirit of the Law. If Verant codified EVERY single situation in which a player could receive a warning or be banned, they would need a varitable army of guides to monitor everyone to ensure none broke a rule. Jaydrox seems to be interpreting the spirit of the law concerning zone disruption to say that killing an NPC controlled by a guide/GM in an event is inappropriate until there is a proper time. <br>
<br>
What is the proper time? Sometimes it's immediately as with the Halloween events where the sky would turn red, NPCs controlled by guides would pop into the zone and start attacking anyone. Sometimes it's after some dialogue exchanges between the guide/NPC and the PCs to learn that the guide/NPC has some type of evil intent that must be thwarted. Sometimes it's never and is simply something for the entertainment of all (giant gnomes fighting in the arena during a special event comes to mind as an example).<br>
<br>
Was Jaydrox singling you out, Bled? I'd say yes. And I'd say it's because you had established a pattern of being trouble (in the eyes of Verant) that allowed them to bring the hammer down on you this time. If you had not had those past warnings/suspension, I doubt you would be subject to banning now for attacking an NPC controlled by a GM/guide. But by your own past decisions, however clouded they may have been by self-induced exhaustion or whatever, you flagged yourself to Jaydrox. You set the sequence of events in motion, Jaydrox responded to them.<br>
<br>
Here's the catch: This happens IRL to people. Two people can do the exact same action that is inappropriate and one will get hammered because of past history committing mis-deeds and the other will get off with a slap on the wrist because he/she has no past history of mis-deeds. This, however, assumes that the action is not one that triggers maximum punitive response automatically, such as typing in a racial slur for Everquest.<br>
<br>
It stinks that you will have to start from level one if you choose to continue to play Everquest. All you can do is learn from these experiences and avoid repeating them.<br>

On vazaelle it seems to not only effected the gms, but half the server imo. Dude i know how you feel, my 47 sk was banned for saying the n word which is pretty lame.  Now Jaydrox i don't know personally and have had no experiences beyond the occassional /massage, but i'm 100% sure that every GM i've encountered on Vazaelle to come to with a situation is a complete and total DICK. Nothing i can do for you but tell ya sorry bro, either start a new account and move on, or just quit altogether, don't expect customer service (eqaccountstatus) to help, those guys are even bigger assholes, just consider yourself lucky, you got 3 warnings, i got 1 for foul language which i did on purpose at level 5 when i had the whole zone swearing (least 5 people got warned that day), just ask mojokyn ^_^; and then i got banned permanently.  It's not just the GMs that are gimps tho, most of the people are too, they all think that for some reason EverQuest is a chatting client, and that the fact that your xping and trying to get good items or doing quests or what not is all a little side game.  Anyway, would everyone take a moment to stop and think about shit before they say it, this is the 3rd suspension/ban on Vazaelle alone, this shit needs to stop, take this moment to learn from the current fuck ups and stop to think about what your saying before you say it. Me personally, i only joke around in guild and group if i know their cool, and in tells, cuz obviously no one else can take a joke, still tho, it's pretty fucking gay restarting at level 1 so if your a trash talker, nows the time to start watching what you say. <p><img src="http://mephistolf.tripod.com/Sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubled1234.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bled1234</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/27/01 5:46:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: jaydrox finally found an excuse to ban me</span><hr size=1> hehe amen, watch what you say<br>
<br>
The verant gestapo are everywhere, watching your every move <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If anything at all can be taken away from this, watch what you guys say. I'm positive the majority of people here cant say they've never sworn in front of somebody they didn't know while playing eq. And if you can, well then damn =) hehe<br>
<br>
banning is gay. so very very gay.<br>

She cut classes 4 times in one semester.<br>
She was late to class another 12 times the same semester.<br>
Then she received a warning, one more absence or tardy and you are on suspension.<br>
She was driving to work, saw an accident, stopped to help and was late to school.<br>
Today she will tell everyone she was suspended for helping someone in a wreck, never mentioning that if not for the other 16 episodes she would never have even had the conversation.<br>
You were warned and did not beleive that they would really do it. Indeed you put yourself in that postion, and ended up getting the results of your own actions.<br>
