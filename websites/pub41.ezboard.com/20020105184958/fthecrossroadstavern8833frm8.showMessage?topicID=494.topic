Seems strange that a lot of people find it hard to quit the game, but the reverse is true too, at least for me.  I find it that the longer I've been away from the game the harder it is for me to get gumption to log on and do something.  It practically takes an event for me to log on.<br>
<br>
Before when I was regularly playing EQ I seemed to make up excuses on why I HAD to be on.  Raid on Yelinak tonight, I have to be on!  Clearing Fear tonight I have to be on!  Helping this guy with the last step of his epic I need to be on!  Then when I took a night off to go see a movie or something I'd be wondering what was going online.<br>
<br>
Now I find myself making excuses to NOT log on.  Just graduated from College, need to find a career job before I start playing again.  Moving into an apartment, can't play until I get this done.  Getting a 2nd phone installed in my apartment can't play until its installed (which took over two months).  Hmmm I'm bored tonight maybe I'll log on, no wait actually I feel like playing some Starcraft...  Hmm maybe tonight, nah I'll play the new game I just bought Conquest.  <br>
<br>
For all the excuses I used to make for logging on when I used to play I find myself making an equal number of excuses to do something else instead of playing.  It's like I'm waiting for the perfect moment or something.  Last time I played was for the Fear break tutorial, the time before that was for Vox tutorial on 8/31.  Time before that I can't remember but three patches had gone by before I had logged on.  <br>
<br>
My question to you is this.  Do others go through this or is it just me?  I busted my ass to get to lvl 60 playing a lot of 40+ hour weeks when I finally got my hybrid Troll exp penalty impaired ass to 60 in January.  Two months later I quit the game because of in game personal reasons before I was really able to enjoy the golden raiding years without the monotous levelling.  I wasn't done with the game when I quit, I still wanted to play but I just lost my source of motivation. <p>----------------------- <BR>

Played for a while and it just lost steam with me,  It's not just EQ but the genre of games in general.   I think that the MMORPGs have gotten become stagnant.   I beta'd AO and also am in DAoCs.   Both of which had the possibility of being something great but as it stands right now won't because they streamlined the entire formula of this game.   WASH RINSE REPEAT until no longer neccessary.  The problem is that it is now tough for me to see beyond that in any of these games.  <br>
<br>
Also of concern is the ever increasing level of sheer stupidity within the uber loot.  I  mean some of the items I see coming out of these zones just cheapen the game in my opinion to the point where it can't be taken seriously anymore.<br>
<br>
Oh an axe with 80 AC on it?  Sure lets make it two that are both 1hs with stat bumps in every class.  Even more entertaining is that the player base refers to them as an end game which only sends the Sony goons back to the drawing board to dream up a better Carrot to keep the donkey on course.<br>
<br>
Then there is the entire idea that this game's golden age is coming to an end.   I won't even open that can of worms but I think the months of no flames in the inferno about anything in game lend credence to the idea.  I mean honestly when was the last time there was a huge nasty flame about a spawn that made you think back to the RTA or the E'ci equivalent? and no the LoM LoRDs issue doesn't count because no one even got upset with it.<br>
<br>
Just some random thoughts Zartuul....I am sure there are more out there from others.<br>

<br>
If you want to do something, you are motivated. I think you aren't motivated because you don't want to play.<br>
<br>
Of course, at level 60 you might feel an unconscious commitment to continue playing somethign that took that much of your time. <br>
<br>
It reminds me of high school. Years of your life involved. You meet interesting people and hang out, have fun. EQ adds adventure an a quasi-feeling of accomplishment, making it even more endearing. But in the end, we all move on. You can't go back.<br>
<br>
Except of course, in EQ you can. And perhaps that's the problem. If there was no way to reclaim your account after you quit, you'd never consider going back.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
Perhaps you're really waiting for SoL and new EQ content to spark your interest. That's understandable, but you'll certainly miss most of the content at your level, so perhaps that's disheartening as well.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
I say if you want to leave, cut the cord and don't look back. There are other games out there. Sure they may be sub-standard but they're interesting.<br>
<br>
Want in on a free beta? <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.legendofmir.net/">www.legendofmir.net/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
I don't know anything else about it. I'm sure you know of all the other games in the works as well.<br>
<br>
Don't forget Neverwinter Nights as well. If you have some EQ buddies, you could plan to play this together and make modules for one person to DM.<br>

<br>
its just not worth coming back to.  you only remember the good stuff in it, which is plentiful, but you forget the poor and crappy stuff - a lot more than the good.<br>

Some people are amazed I am not 60 already since everyone on my friends list is, hehe.  I can only do anything so much before I get bored.  I log on now and again, to chat more than anything, and have found it more fun to play an alt and actually SEE my xp bar moving than to camp s highlevel dungeon for hours and see a blue bub for my efforts.  Sorry, but I can't really see doing something like that anymore.  Just the thought of it makes my skin crawl.  DAoC is coming out, and I am gearing up to give it an honest shot, but there is little in EQ that I really care to see anymore, save my friends.  <br>
<br>
Since playing less EQ, my social life is back up BIG time, dating, hanging with buddies, sports, all fun things.  So, I don't think even if DAoC is the best thing sinced sliced bread, I will ever devote the extreme amount of time that I used to when EQ started.  It's just not in me anymore. =)  Off to dinner with my buds. =D  See ya! <p><center><B>Ciffu Longwinded</b><br><I>The Token Monkey</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uraene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Battle Druid, Artist</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(9/28/01 7:44:32 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ldnews.kyid.net/images/members/raene.jpg HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Question for those who have quit or took a long break</span><hr size=1> I've taken breaks before, not like Ciffu but my own :P <br>
<br>
I think part of what you're going through is the change of life...you're out of college, looking for a job? When we moved from DC to Atlanta it was over a month out of EQ. I remember before the move, thinking I'd go to AO for good and be less often in EQ...but EQ sucked me back in :D<br>
<br>
My daily breaks I take now are creative outlets...I do screenshot art which still involves me in game, and with people to some extent, but a large amount of time is spent working on it outside of EQ.<br>
<br>
Just do what you want to do, and if you want to venture back into EQ, you will.<br>

Too much of the high-level game was becoming an exercise in logistics(get 50 people to stop bickering, pay attention, and follow instructions) and masochistic patience(2 hour prep time for a 10 minute fight) instead a test of playing ability. <br>
<br>
I gave away all of Kelthana's tradeable gear, took her out to a quiet spot in the woods, put a virtual bullet into her brain, and cancelled. I've felt no need to return other than missing a lot of friends, and definitely won't be coming back to start playing again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umudgutsdisembowler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mudguts Disembowler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="[Image]http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org/Database/BinaryData.asp?ID=1378[/Image]" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(9/28/01 10:39:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org/Database/BinaryData.asp?ID=1378 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Question for those who have quit or took a long break</span><hr size=1> Hiya Kelth :)<br>

After getting rid of all tradeables, he, the ever roleplayer, went to PoG and sacrificed himself to Tunare, where he left his corpse there, never to return.  It was kind of cool.  I don't think I am at that stage, but as EQ gets less and less motivating to play, I think I will go and sacrifice myself to a Fippy.

Several times, I have had to CONVINCE myself to log on to check on my guild or whatever. Sometimes, I still actually WANT to play, but when I log on and check my friends and see that there are VERY few of them on anymore, I am a bit discouraged. A lot of my friends are quitting EQ. <br>
<br>
I guess once you hit 55, there's not much else to do. There is no more of that sense of accomplishment you get from doing things at lower levels. Everyone wants to be 55 or 60, but once you get here, where is there for you to go? What is there for you to do? I find I have much more fun either playing my alt cleric or just running around doing stupid stuff with my remaining friends on EQ. it's become more of a chat room than a game to me these days. That's very difficult for me to say because I am a die-hard gamer. =(<br>

I am going to play DAoC and EQ when DAoC goes live. Even though a rather sizeable amount of my friends appear to have dropped off the face of Norrath, I am going to continue playing to hang out with the remainder of my friends. It's still rather disheartening to see everyone leave. <br>

Either way, after moving people or waiting for an hour for the enchanter and cleric to show up so people will even start a group that I may or may not be lucky enough to get into, it's usually an hour or two into game time before I can even start playing at all.<br>
<br>
The time commitment is insane. The sitting and looking for a group for extended periods of time is depressing. So, when I can't deal with it I sometimes go play a twink. The warrior is kind of refreshing sometimes. She gets tells asking her if she wants to group when she hasn't even said she's looking for a group. That can be a good feeling. But I get really bored really rapidly. No one goes anywhere but loio, ot, and dl anymore. When my main was young there were constant camp checks in CT. Now there are a few farmers and a few plers in the zone. For some reason all the clueless morons have flocked to SK.<br>
<br>
So I guess what I'm saying is that the 50+ game takes too long in the way of logistics to make it any fun for a few casual hours, and the game to 50 is just monotonous--kill sarnaks for 10 levels, kill cacti and rhinos for 10 levels, kill drolvargs and spiders for ten levels *snore*<br>
<br>
I kind of thought I wanted to get to 60. I kind of thought I wanted some uber loot. But I'd also kind of like to spend some time with my babies before they grow up.<br>
<br>
To answer the question on the table, there have been times when I've taken breaks of just a few days and spent time with people whose real faces I can look at and felt like I was living life again when the thought of sitting down to play EQ was really pretty revolting to me. And there have been times when I've taken breaks of a month or two and started to actually almost feel like I could breathe again. But then I got sucked back in. Other than the wonderful people I've met in EQ, I really can't say there's much in the way of redeeming value in all the time I've wasted away playing this game. If I felt like I never wanted to play ever again I would consider it a blessing. And I will avoid all future online roleplaying games like the plague.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I may stick it out to 60; I may not. I feel myself getting ever closer to killing my characters and cancelling my accounts. And I think I will celebrate the day I do that. I think I might have done it before now, except that I need for my husband to do it with me so we can go back to a real life together. <p><br>

<br>
Since I'm level 60, this requires increasingly harder zones and mobs. This can seem like a treadmill after awhile. The initial glow of success gets replaced with the tedium of ph4rming every time you advace.<br>
<br>
I suspect this affects all players. The amount of time spent shouting &quot;Woot!! Awesome!!&quot; for real becomes a lot less than the amount of time spent in preparation, combat, and automatically pumping yer &quot;WTG %T!!&quot; hotkey.<br>

I have pretty much competed all the milestones for my main toon. Gotten epic, made 60th, leveled a couple other toons past 50, and seen pretty much every zone in norrath. <br>

When your hobby becomes a chore, that is a clear sign that it shouldn't be your hobby anymore.  After quitting my guild of 1.5 years, all the motivation to log on is gone. I have thought about joining another one, but then it just seems to be the same thing over again. <br>
<br>
Then I think about how much money I am saving by just zoning out playing EQ rather than go clubbing or buying other games.  Then I break down and log on for a weekend xp grindfest.  Its better to be bored and have some results of yer boredom validated on a little yellow/blue bar then just by a spot of drool on yer shirt. =P <p><font size="-1">Chibibroli Beguiler, 60 Dark Elf Phantasmist -<b></b>-<br>
