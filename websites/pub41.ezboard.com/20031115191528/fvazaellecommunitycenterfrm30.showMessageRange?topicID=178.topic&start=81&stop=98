<br>
If you were to take a poll of Americans and ask if the USSR was communist, you'd probably get 99% saying it was.  We grew up here fighting communism in the form of the Soviet Union.  We prayed in our churches (those of us who were catholic) against communism in Russia.<br>
<br>
I think that the term communism has evolved well beyond what the definition originally was, and by the more accepted and standard use of the word, the USSR most definitely was communist.<br>

<br>
It depends on the insurance policy you have.  Paradoxically, the best insurance policies (and the most expensive ones) tend to not pay for doctor visits, whereas the less expensive ones do.  It has to do with the structure of the policy.  I guess the simplest answer is that the plans that most Americans have require them to pay a copay for each visit which is usualyl $5 or $10, then the rest is covered by the insurance company.<br>

<br>
I would define socialized medicine as a single payer system.  In other words, the insurance is done by the government, not just funded by the government.  I would not consider a system by which the government subsidizes the purchase of private insurance to be socialized medicine, and such a system might avoid many of the problems associated with socialized medicine as it wouldn't remove competition.<br>

<br>
It's highly variable.  The Roman Catholic Church is probably runs more hospitals in the US than any other signle organization, but I could be off on that.  Certainly it's true around where I live.  Many hospitals are owned and operated by universities/medical schools.  There are also many hospitals run by local governments.  As far as I know, there are no hospitals run by the federal government other than veteran's hospitals.<br>

<br>
Well, the impressions I'm getting are based on a class on health care systems I took at Dartmouth as an undergrad.    The quality of services in the United States is better because there are fewer cost restriction measures and very cutting edge technology is used more often.  Also, the United States spends quite a bit more money on research than other countries.  Maybe I can dig up some notes from my class, but I remember that in comparing the systems, if you look at US versus other countries, most of the numbers look similar, or perhaps the US looks a bit worse.  However, if you drop out the uninsured, the US numbers are far superior to other countries.  This suggests that our system is the best in the world, but that we need to improve access to it for the segment of our population that is not insured.  The United States system costs more than any other system in the world as well.  The reason is primarily that we provide more comprehensive care.  It would cost even more within the confines of socialized medicine.  The other major reason the US healthcare system costs so much is the cost of lawsuits.  Americans will sue over everything.  It's estimated that about 10% of the cost of our medical system is directly related to lawsuits, and that doesn't include extra tests that are run by doctors to cover their asses.  Doctors actually run quite a few tests in the US that are not needed or indicated medically just to protect them from lawsuits.  This is a real problem in the US.<br>

Aside from the issue about the term &quot;non profit organization&quot; (assuming you meant a government agency and all the terrible inefficiencies therein discussed earlier) a non-profit hospital wouldn't draw the kind of doctors that are needed.

<br>
First of all, you can't group malpractice with administrative costs.  They're entirely different.  That's like saying military spending and peanut farming subsidies together constitute the largest part of our national budget.  It's not a relevant grouping.<br>
<br>
Changing to a socialized medical system would in itself have no effect on malpractice issues.  That's a separate issue that must be dealt with separately.  I agree it's a big problem though.  Personally, I think the way to change it is to make people who lose liable for the court costs incurred by the opposition.  That would give people some incentive not to press charges in weak cases.  This is a whole different issue though.<br>
<br>
The cost of basic care in the United States is actually less than it is in countries with socialized medicine (comparing the same service performed at the same level of quality in both countries).  The reason we spend so much more on medical care in terms of percentage of GDP etc is that the care we provide is so much better and we provide services not offered in socialized medical systems.  The inefficiencies of a non profit system would be massive.<br>
<br>
If you are right and a non profit medical system would be so much better, then one should be started.  It should compete with the profit based systems.  If it really is cheaper, people will choose it for their medical care as it will provide better care at a lower cost.  There is nothing stopping people from starting such a system.  What the ultra left radicals are asking is for us to create a non profit system and force everyone to pay into it because it cannot compete on its own.  If it could compete on its own, there would be no need to force people to join it.  If such a system offered superior care, I'd join it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a one time government subsidy of such a program would be good.  Maybe it would just need a bit of a cash infusion to get it started, and maybe it could even pay it back later on.  I'm all for providing alternatives in the market, I just don't want the government forcing us into any single plan.<br>

I would think that was obvious when my whole paragraph dealth with the competition amoungst insurance companies to avoid payment, but I tend to give people too much credit I guess.  I also sort of thought this debate was about national health <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>insurance</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, which might also provide you with a contextual clue.  Anyone who has taken English 101 would be able to figure this out and save themselves embarrassment.<br>
<br>
Malpractice is a separate issue, I just felt it should be mentioned since I was trying to sum up what the biggest problems we have in medical costs.  They have little to do with the actual cost of high-quality, readily available care, as some would have you beleive. Competition between insurance companies to avoid claims, between insurance companies and thier clients and clients' employers for the same reasons, malpractice suits for ridiculous amounts of money, and the lawyers who feed off of all of it are all issues that could be fixed without effecting care quality one bit.  Its pretty obvious there is a symbiotic relationship between lawyers and insurance companies that has nothing to do with actual medicine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1935<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/29/03 6:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Governmental insurance</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Its the insurance companies, not the hospitals, that I was referring to. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What would give you the idea that I was talking about hospitals?  I was talking about insurance companies.  I was speaking about creating a non profit insurance company that would be able to compete, much like a credit union competes with banks.<br>
<br>
I think you are completely wrong in suggesting that socializing the payment system will not affect the quality of the healthcare system itself.  It most definitely will.  There will be less money available to pay for services, so the quality of services will decline.<br>

This would create a best of all worlds.  Everyone would have health care and those that wish extra special care can get it via insurance.<br>

Many families would not be able to afford private insurance if they had to pay into a socialized medical system.  The very rich would be fine either way, but the middle/lower classes would be hurt by that and would get lower quality care.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind a government run system that allowed people to participate if they chose to but didn't cost you anything if you didn't want to participate.  I have no problem with anything full optional.<br>
<br>
I would favor a system in which everyone got a voucher.  They could use it on a government or private insurance system, or if they didn't want coverage at all, they could take it in cash (exception here for children who would have to be enrolled in some system of health insurance).  The government could be sure to not price the coverage over the level of the voucher.  Private insurance companies would have to compete with the government, and vice versa, ensuring cost efficiency.  After all, whichever system were more efficient would be favored, and no one would be forced into something they didn't want.<br>
