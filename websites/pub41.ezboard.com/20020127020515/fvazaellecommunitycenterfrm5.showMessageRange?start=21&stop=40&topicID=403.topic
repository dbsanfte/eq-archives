America wants to poke their nose into affairs of every country, wants to act as a policemen of the world. And well, it doesnt work out too well. Many countries feel like America has stepped beyond the line in their attempt to interfere with worlds affairs. That alone warrants some disdain from other countries, like Jonan said in his post on general board. And then add to this all these people who consider america to be a step above everyone else, well, that kinda creates a barrier between america and the rest of the world. And you are either on this side, or on that side. If there will be a war, it will cost america much much more then those lives that were lost in those explosions. Yes, there are times when a direct action is needed, and this is not one of them. Catch a few terrorists, punish them, issue a warning, collect reparations, but for god's sake, suck up your pride and let this one slide, otherwise you're gonna find yourself in a big shithole. A war just wouldnt be right, because a war will cause more killings, and more and more till there is noone left to wage a war anymore.<br>
<br>
That is how i feel, so feel free to flame/blame, whichever, but dont give me that bullshit, that i dont know how it is to lose someone in a war. My grandfather and mother both participated in WWII and both came out crippled with emotional and physical scars, so yeah i do know, and i do feel for those dead, but nevertheless my stance remains the same. America should blame herself for this and not others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucheggers.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cheggers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/01 1:33:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.tripod.co.uk/cheggers_da_halfling/knightof.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryonea is a piece of shit</span><hr size=1> &quot;America protects its interests.

No matter what country this happened to there would be outrage, and retaliation would be strongly called for.<br>
<br>
Anti-terrorism measures are carried out around the world all the time, by all nations. These are on a smaller scale then full blown airstrikes or war, but happen none the less. Israel actively carries out attacks on known terrorists, some call them assasinations. Other countries are more covert about these activities.<br>
<br>
Retaliation in my opinion would be an anti-terrorist activity. I certainly dont want war, or even collateral damage to innocent people. <br>

<br>
Majority rule? Does it mean that if 51% of americans have an IQ below 50 or think that America &gt; all, one of them should be elected as a president? Nope<br>
Well, lemme tell ya that among the people of europe, asia, russia, mid east, average USA citizen is viewed like this: fat, balding, lacking in style, ignorant, loud person, who has no concern whatsoever for any moral, cultural or scientific values and can only think about two things, sex and food. Sounds like someone you know? <br>
Since this is the majority, does it mean that everyone is like that? Of course not. I myself know many people who are way better than that (except for food/sex part). Since you are the majority here, it doesnt mean you are necessarily right.<br>
<br>
And where did the cowardly or unintelligent comment come from? Am i a coward because i dont want another war? Am i foolish or unintelligent for stating that america is not as invincible as you thought it is?<br>
<br>
&quot;Your in-game life will prolly be forever changed because of that&quot;<br>
I have my friends and you have yours. Are you saying that i will lose my friends because i speak my thoughts and my mind? Dunno, i know that real friends like you for who you are, and wont ditch you for speaking what you think.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i would rather not continue this thread and fuel it with more hatred and pain, but i cannot help myself but to reply /sigh.

Having said that, I found Ryonea's comments, and subsequent defense of them, both distasteful, disrespectful, and downright uncalled for.  I've never met him in game.  However his callous attitude towards the largest act of terrorism in the United States, and of the thousands of innocent people who were killed in this act of cowardice, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.<br>

They state ludicrous things, that they can hide behind by claiming free speech.  You can be arrested for what you say.  You can be shunned for what you say.  And since we do have free speech, always be prepared to be held responsible for what you say freely.  Your opinion isn't taken well here.  Maybe it's because we're dumb, inbreed Americans.  Or maybe it's because, unlike you, we're respectfull human beings.<br>

I might have missed it, but i am curious of your origins, so that i might understand your point better.  You don't seem to want a flame war like Ryonea.  I am curious to know what Americans have done to you, or if your an american yourself.<br>
<br>
As far as Ryonea is concerend.  Now you feel like flaming Texans? Is that because its the only state you know a catchy put down too?  Clearly you just want a flame war and i don't feel like giving you one, because everyone else is gunning for you.  I personally feel you are a no name that is seeking attention.  You want to be know as the person that &quot;stood up&quot; to the VCC and too a stand against everyone else.  Good for you man, your our hero.  You have been crowned King of nothing, and now hated.  You probally don't care, hell i don't care who/what you are. Just keep your ass comments to yourself.  Take a lesson from Deagol, he stands the same way as you.  Just dosn't post like you.<br>
