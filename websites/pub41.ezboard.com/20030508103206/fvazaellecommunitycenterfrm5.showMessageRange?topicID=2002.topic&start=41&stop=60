How goes it Jade ?  (assuming that's what you go by nowadays)  I'm in the middle of a major build here at work, and quite busy, but since I noticed your tit flapping in the wind here I thought I'd take some time to reply to your rant.  Granted, I think it was well written, so I'll give you credit for that.<br>

I am so fucking tired of everytime I try to get on with my life you try to fuck me over again.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Get over myself.  Let's see, the last time *I* directly brought you up was, well, a long time ago.  Chat with your buddy Aurianne about who keeps bringing you up, thx.  As far as fucking you over, you deserve every fucking ounce that comes your way till you take your last breath and say g'bye to the world and die.  In that instant I'll breathe a sigh of relief and be able to enjoy life again - assuming of course someone doesn't blame me for it and start another rant and cross post it 3 times.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm such a thorn in your side I haven't spoken to you in almost a goddammed year. But it makes me so proud to know that I've hurt you so badly you just can't forget me. Awww *hugs* *sniffles* you poor little thing. I tried to apologize and explain myself to you. I tried to tell you how fucking horrible a person I am for lying to you but you know what? I'M NOT SORRY ANYMORE. Frankly you can go fuck yourself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup, you apologized and tried to kiss my ass for showing yours.  How many people did you do the same thing to after me ?  How many people did you spread lies to concerning me ?  Guess what ?  I stopped giving a fuck shortly there after and decided to give the other side of the story.  Problem is, you've offered so much dick sucking on Vazaelle that your defenders (for the most part) won't hear the other side of the story, because you're innocent, aren't you ?<br>
<br>
Here, for you fucking morons that don't get it, and have screamed &quot;LIAR&quot; in the past, I'll double quote.  Get ready.<br>

NOONE wants to hear your fucking whines, cries and whatever else you have to say.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually my life is fine.  I'm living with someone you hate dearly and that alone makes my days run smoother.  As for what I've called you in the past and continue to call you today, they're still true, and I still mean them.  How many people are you cybering for sympathy this week ?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fuck this is enough already. I don't care one bit about you anymore. You talk your trash talk about me to every fucking person. I really don't care about that. You want to sing that same song that you are the fucking poor bastard that got taken advantage of. Fine go ahead, but you know what you didn't have to go through what I did and quite frankly, You will *NEVER* have the oppourtunity of having the satisfaction of knowing. Mostly because I really don't think you ever would give a shit anyway. NOR that it would make ANY difference.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Let's see.  At worst, your husband, err brother (I forget what he is now, it changed so many times) threaghtened to leave you.  You didn't like that and threaghtened his life or some shit.  Then you came back to the game for a while and got some more cyber friends and convinced them your life was hell.  See, I don't need the satisfaction.  I'm atleast half right without having the slightest clue.  Oh, and Sera, if you didn't care one bit, why not ask your friends to shush about bringing you up, and avoid posting this little rant ?<br>

K thx....You make me absolutely sick.

Such language.  Your children would gasp.  I guess Tsvarien has been logging you in for porting then.  As for the other parts, read above.<br>

Looks like you got the queen whore living right under your same roof. I don't give a damn about you or your life. Get some new fucking topics to talk about. At one point I thought you were above this shit, but you know you proved yourself *way* differently. Nice to see your *TRUE* colors.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Gee, let's see, considering I've talked to all of them.  Only 1 of those you mentioned still sits true, and after talking to *him*, it turns out he was just as much at fault, so, what's your point again ?  About names ?  Sure, I could name a handful.  Problem is they don't want to be brought to light because in certain circles in this game, you're not a cute little angel like you are to your supporters.  Some people would rather not have their name associated with yours, so I don't blame them for never speaking up.  As you can tell by now, I don't give a fuck and want everyone who hasn't had the pleasure (read: not that many) to know what you're about.  That way when they meet you on an alt or on another server, they don't get the same &quot;awww kiss my clit&quot; treatment the rest of us have.  Have a nice day, concerning that topic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To summarize, Go fuck yourself, and your whore, shut the fuck up because noone wants to hear your shit anymore.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sure, there's a lot around here that don't want to hear what I have to say.  Of course, then there are the dozen or so I've talked to in game (again, not mentioning names) that couldn't believe what they were getting themselves into.  Guess now you know why half your entourage disappeared about 3 months after you spilled the truth on me, huh.<br>
<br>
Back to work with me.  See the rest of you in game. <p><center>

Whether people want to pursue an online relationship is their choice.<br>
<br>
However, in this case, the drama has been brought to public. The drama is from more than a year ago now I believe. Until this point, the person who has gone public with it was always Goramon. Posting about it on the Fantasy board, he even posted something right on this board to warn people from the &quot;evil&quot; that is Seraluna(yes, that was sarcasm), months after whatever it was happened. Btw, in the other thread, Goramon did post some supposedly Real Life info, Pedi, which was the thing that made Seraluna post about this subject finally, I bet.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't exactly know what happens (please don't tell me, not interested), but it seems that Seraluna did something wrong toward Goramon and apologized about it. Whatever it was, I am not to judge any of them for whatever it was, it isn't my business, nor should it be.<br>
<br>
However, Goramon constantly claimed that not only he, but a lot of people have suffered from the evil that is Seraluna !!! This makes me laugh, it is exactly the same as claiming a lot of casters in Fantasy, who conveniently don't wish to come forward, felt we were a melee-centric guild. I know he didn't have the support he claimed (one person I know off agreed with Mr. Loam somewhat - it took one talk with Benoir to come to some kind of understanding). But of course, since all those people betrayed you Goramon, why not name them, the leadership then in Fantasy is gone now, so there is no harm in naming them, right ?<br>
<br>

From this point forward, these two parties can bitch about each other all they want, but they need to keep out the RL stuff. Anika drew that line a few months ago when another couple went for each other's throats and brought in RL stuff that wasn't appropriate for VCC.
