Many people love the signatures that are being used on the public forums. They are considered Artwork and the creators of those signatures can be considered Artists.<br>
<br>
I had the idea for this gallery as I was browsing through dozens of Communities and simply looked at the sigs. I caught myself visiting Communities for this sole purpose. i know I am not alone when I admit, I have been saving signatures on my harddisk just because I liked them. I made my own little gallery for myself. Considering the fact people often discuss about signatures, people spend days making them and considering the fact that signatures are an important part of their presence in the EverQuest Community, I decided that it may be a nice idea to make a gallery of signatures. <br>
Available for everyone.<br>
<br>
The signatures that I used are available to everyone already. They are being recently used on Public EverQuest Communities. My idea was that people that show their signature on public communities want them to be seen. Now instead of having everyone browse all around the net for hours to see them, I found it a good idea to put them in a public gallery. The result is the same, everyone can look at them. The difference is, the visitors don't have to search for them for hours.<br>
<br>
Please note:<br>
- I only used EverQuest Signatures that are being posted on public communities<br>
- No signature has ever been changed in any way. They are the original signatures of the owners<br>
- The signatures have been placed with the Server Community they are taken from aswell as the owners character name (note, not the artist - but the owner)<br>
- The Gallery has the sole purpose to give tribute to the artists and show the public what great artwork there is<br>
- There is no financial interest behind this idea<br>
<br>
I have recieved a lot of positive reactions, dozens of mails and answers from Artists aswell as visitors that loved the idea and wanted to participate and support it. However, a small percentage of visitors/artists have not liked it. In two communities, some copy right discussions have been started. I have used signatures for the Gallery, without asking for permission of the owner. This is correct. In the naive belief that people who post their signatures on public forums want their signature to be seen and would in no way have a problem with their signature being 'honored' in a gallery, I copied them and put them in the Gallery. This caused anger with a small percentage of the artists. it is truly not many, but simply the fact that it cause anger is enough for me to not enjoy this at all. <br>
<br>
The whole Copy Right discussion did not end in a final agreement whether I acted against the law by not linking, but copying those files in a Gallery. But to me, this does not matter. What matters is the fact that some few artists did not like it. It was never the intention to cause harm or even anger. The idea was to make the visitors happy by being able to look at this artwork, and make the artists happy by having a larger audience.<br>
<br>
The fact that some (even if not many) artists are against this, on one hand made me defend my idea and the purpose of the gallery, but on the other hand also made me think about it bigtime. It is not worth it to me to cause any anger with something that was just meant for public amusement.<br>
<br>
As a consequence, I have made the following decisions.<br>
<br>
- The Signature Gallery will stay online as long as it does not cause bandwidth problems on our server<br>
<br>
- I have taken down all signatures from Artists that did not agree with the Gallery<br>
<br>
- I will of course keep doing so. THere are not many signatures up there yet, and I think I have sorted out the very most of the signatures of artists that don't wish to have their artwork being in there<br>
<br>
- I will from now on not add any new signatures anymore unless I recieve an eMail from the owner with a written permission / the request of putting their work online<br>
<br>
- If you wish to have your work posted in the Gallery, send me an eMail with your request, your character name and your server<br>
<br>
<br>
This will minimize the Gallery and instead of thousands of signatures, there will be way less to be seen, but it should hopefully bring an end to the discussions.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to ask for your support in this matter. I still believe that the signature gallery is an idea that is well worth a try. The more signatures and permissions I recieve, the more it will be worth visiting the Gallery.<br>
<br>
It saddens me that my idea caused grief to a certain point, by a few people. But I hope that with these changes, we can keep the Gallery up and toll tribute not only to the ones that deserve it, but mostly to the ones that want it.<br>
