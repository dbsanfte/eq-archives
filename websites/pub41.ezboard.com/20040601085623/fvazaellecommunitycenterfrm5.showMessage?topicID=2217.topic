Whether it is simply to transfer him to a new server or he is being dismissed from SOE altogether we do not know.  However we can hope the latter.<br>
<br>
On to my post.  Everyone is quite aware of GM Jamlamin's track record of, for lack of a more colorful word, &quot;questionable&quot; actions.  Vantage had their first run in with Jamlamin just under a week ago.  It was as expected and lots of questionable things were done, some brinking on what I would say would be harassment.  I sent off an e-mail complaining about him to both eqcs@soe.sony.com and his Lead GM, Andrea Rose, at ARose@soe.sony.com.  I would love to claim credit for dealing the final blow to his career on Vazaelle, but decide for yourself.  Either way, it didn't help him out.<br>
<br>
Below are copies of the 4 e-mails sent back and forth between ARose and I.  The first being the initial email, then her reply, then my response, and then the final reply.  Judge for yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE INITIAL EMAIL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Greetings,<br>
<br>
I am forwarding this e-mail to both eqcs@soe.sony.com as well as who i'm told is the Lead-GM for GM Jamlamin, arose@soe.sony.com.<br>
<br>
Tonight, 10-07-03, is when this issue occured.  I am Venthos, the leader of a guild called Vantage, and we were mobilizing for a kill on Rumblecrush in Umbral Plains (zone: umbral).  Apparently another guild, Tanchiki, had the same plan.  We were both at the zone in starting to form, however when my guild reached roughly sufficient numbers we headed off towards Rumblecrush's temple area to finish mobilizing there to make the kill.  During this time of waiting for 1-2 more people to arrive at our new location as well as finalizing buffs, a monk from Tanchiki ran in and trained out Rumblecrush with his roughly 6-8 guardians.<br>
<br>
As a result my guild backed off, as if case the monk died and we were near, we would be trained.  From what I'm told Rumblecrush made it to the zone line and Tanchiki commenced killing it.  Tanchiki tells me shortly after them slaying Rumblecrush a train of several NPC's were run into them and they were either forced to zone or wiped out.  In the confusion of the train one of the (now former) members of my guild had decided to ninja loot the items off of Rumblecrush.  I had seen the loot messages scroll up on my screen as we were all in a raid still, and immediately did a /report of them and contacted Tanchiki's leader.  This type of behavior is not acceptable in Vantage and Blod was removed as a result.  I had let Tanchiki know this and that I am there to cooperate with them to swiftly get the return of their lost items.<br>
<br>
Eventually GM Jamlamin along with a Guide (who's name escapes me at the moment) to address the issue.  Afer GM Jamlamin asking me if Blod was still a member of my guild, myself, Blod, and a 3rd member of my guild, Britto, were summoned into the QCat dev box.  Apparently Tanchiki had accused Britto of the training and thus he was brung along as well.<br>
<br>
Immediately all three of our players were locked out to the point that we could only type.  It was apparent this wasn't a just discussion.  With no more than a question regarding Blod's membership to myself, I was wisked away and locked as if I was going to make a mad escape and that I myself had violated 10 some odd policies.  From the start I had informed GM Jamlamin my only intention was to cooperate and get this issue resolved.  I do not appreciate the hostility and demeaning method of his ways by locking me out as if hinting I was going to try and &quot;escape&quot; by gating.  I believe this is wavering on the line of harassment.<br>
<br>
GM Jamlamin then asked if he needed to bring any others in the get the story on what happened, we all replied no that we werent aware of any additional parties who may be involved.  It was at this point all three of us were FULLY locked out, to the point of not being able to even type.  In my opinion this goes as far to cross the line in harassment.  At no point during the entire issue from start the finish do I believe ANY three of us gave reason for such a lockout, let alone the lockout with typing ability issued prior.  We all wanted to cooperate (even Blod) and get this issued resolved.<br>
<br>
GM Jamlamin, after receiving the confession to the Ninja Looting from Blod, inquired about the training that apparently occured.  Neither of us three had the slghtest clue who was responsible.  However after roughly 5+ times of Jamlamin restating the question after receiving 5+ answer, continued to badger us as if trying to force one of us into falsely admitting so he could repremand another person for the night.<br>
<br>
After what I assume was roughly half an hour, GM Jamlamin finally came to the conclusion that there information regarding the training was insufficient, and that obviously Blod had confessed to Ninja Looting.  In my opinion these details were ironed out in the first 5 minutes of our responses, and Jamlamin was merely badgering us from that point on.  He also stated that he was issuing a Guild Warning onto my account (Venthos) for the actions of my former guild member Blod.<br>
<br>
I attempted to inquire about these issues after he had made the decision, however we were forcefully removed from QCat into plane of knowledge at which point GM Jamlamin failed to respond to any of my tells for 5-10 minutes.  Eventually GM Jamlamin replied stating that he had rethought and decided to give me the benefit of the doubt and merely note that issue that occured, noting that Blod was disband as a result.  He said it would not count as a warning to the guild.<br>
<br>
That is in summary what occured on that night.  I will not bother with sending the log files at this point as I'm aware you most likely do not accept them due to the fact that can be modified with little trouble.  However I will assume that GM Jamlamin does log everything that occurs during his shift(s) and that you can simply refer to that.<br>
<br>
The character whom I was on was &quot;Venthos&quot;, and the Station Account that character is on is &quot;STATION-NAME-DELETED&quot;.<br>
<br>
While I would like to believe GM Jamlamin in his claim that the note is not harmful in anyway towards the guild or myself, I would like to have that soulmark looked at and perhaps removed if possible.  Vantage at every opportunity were polite and cooperative to the fullest of our ability, and worked swiftly to remove Blod as well as speak with Tanchiki's leadership.  To be punished for this in my opinion is absurd.  It is impossible to be able to tell how a person may react in times of extreme anger or grief such as in the case tonight, and there was no way myself or anyone could tell Blod was going to do this.  Everyone in my guild was surprised to say the least when he did this.<br>
<br>
I would also like to note that at no point did any of my member's spout derogatory remarks at Tanchiki for anything, or even speak to Tanchiki for that matter.  I make sure to tell my guild to leave all interguild relations to myself and our officers, and to never respond to any provoking another person/guild may be doing.  On the same note, throughout and after the issue Tanchiki members continued to slander and spout derogatory phrases in ooc and other public channels in regards to this event.  In my opinion my guild did a stellar job in dealing with this unfortunate event and did everything possible to make it go as smoothly as possible.  For any Vantage member other than our former member, Blod, to be repremanded for our actions is absurd.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and I look forward to your reply,<br>

Greetings Brian,<br>
 <br>
I have looked into this issue for you. Your Guild nor your account received a warning for this as you did remove Blod from your Guild. The agreement that was made between you and GM Jamlamin was that if you invited Blod back into your Guild that you are indeed condoning the actions and as Guild Leader taking responsibility and receiving a warning for thus. As for the Training we had some reports that did indeed point to your Guild as doing this however the proof was not enough to take action and none was taken. If you have any further questions please feel free to reply to this email and it will be my pleasure to assist you.<br>

I wish you good fortune and fun adventures.<br>

Comments to the above email: The &quot;reports&quot; that she said implicated Vantage to the training were 4 Tanchiki saying Britto trained them (who had been sitting in a corner far from them the entire time, so they blamed him).<br>

Greetings,<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for looking into the issue.  I really appreciate it.  However one thing I'm still curious about is the actions taken by GM Jamlamin.  As I said before at every possible time, everyone involved were very cooperative and trying to get the issue sorted out and resolved.  However, we were treated unfairly in my opinion with being locked out of our consoles even to the point where we could not type.  I do not even consider the summoning to the QCat devbox a necessary thing to do given those circumstances.  No one was trying to run away or avoid GM Jamlamin and we were all standing around him in the first place before we were pulled off into QCat.  Is this standard procedure?  It almost felt as if we were being punished for cooperating and being calm.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

Greetings Brian,<br>
 <br>
It all depends on the issue that is involved. I apologize that you all were uncomfortable in this and I have taken action that this will not be an issue in the future. I did see a report on you all saying that if you did not respond to anything that the GM said then you all would be ok, But since that could have been about anything I did not pursue that.<br>
 <br>
I wish you a wonderful day and fun adventures.<br>

Comments on the email: The report of me saying if they did not respond they would be ok was apparently taken out of context (as I would assume Jamlamin's reports he files would be changed to meet his accusations).  Britto was afraid that Jamlamin would be banning us for something.  I told him that there's nothing Jamlamin can do, since we didnt do anything.  I said simply to stick to the story, which was the truth, and everything would be fine. Jamlamin continued to badger us for half an hour but after the answers never changed he gave up trying to get us to &quot;confess&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
I hope the read was enjoyable.  I'm glad I could contribute to the removal of Jamlamin from Vazaelle.  Hopefully Ikaruko (our new GM) will be much better.<br>

Welcome Ikaruko!<br>
