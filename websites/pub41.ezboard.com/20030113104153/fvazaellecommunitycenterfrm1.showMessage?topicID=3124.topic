I see people all over posting that they think complete heal was a mistake, a design flaw, or should for some reason be removed from the game.<br>
<br>
Why?!?<br>
<br>
I don't understand why people dislike the spell, in my opinion, it's one of the greatest things that could have happened to everquest.  It means that to keep a main tank up it requires skill and timing not just random spamming of heals.  It makes encounters more skill dependent and less zerg dependent.  It makes gear upgrades (most notably on tanks) actually matter.<br>
<br>
The primary reason that it matters how many hp a tank has is that the heal output produced by complete heal is directly tied to it.  Before I had complete heal with my cleric, I never bothered to buff tank hp.  It didn't matter, because without complete heal, there is no real advantage.<br>
<br>
Anyways, maybe I'm missing something, but I have no clue why people bitch about this spell, so please enlighten me.<br>

By a lot. Every late game encounter is run with a chain of cheals.<br>
<br>
Take a look at wizard nukes. There is no percentage based nuke. That would become overpowered for it's mana cost when used as time goes on as mudflation will cause mobs to have more hp as time goes on. The same holds true for dots, buffs, and every other spell. There is no damage shield that hits for 0.1% of a mob's life each time. It would be too overpowered, you would have to completely tune every encounter around the fact that the players would design their strategy around it.<br>
<br>
Much like we do with cheal.<br>
<br>
Once you are in the end game, who gives a fuck what the mana ratio on Chloroblast, Nature's Heal, Superior Heal, Divine Light, Elixir, etc. is? They all aren't cheal. So fuck them for late game encounters unless they are part of a 'rotation chain'. Like /elixirtorpor on a mage who makes rods.<br>
<br>
You might say.. but we could never survive some of these encounters in Velious/Luclin without a cheal chain! Guess why that is? It's because cheal was there first and the developers made those encounters demand a cheal chain.<br>
<br>
So now, instead of having a mix of adventurers come along to have a fun encounter, you have to have a warrior with defensive (another percentage modifier which was a design error) and you have to have 3+ clerics. Some content is 'off limits' without at least that; some classes are unvalued in comparison because of that.<br>
<br>
No single ability or spell should be that game defining without serious drawbacks. Much in the same way that mana burn is defined. No longer can they make a mob who has hit points that 4-6 mana burns can destroy it with anything decent lootwise without nagafen/vox code, it wouldn't be content used by the players of the appropriate level, it would just be farm material. Another ability that will impact all the future design for mobs in eq.<br>
<br>
Feign death is another example. Encounters must have 'feignproof' scenarios to not be trivial because of feign.<br>
<br>
Look around, there's a couple more of these poor-design abilities in the game. EQ is not a percentage based game. It's an integer game. Anything that is percentage oriented in EQ will, in time, become either unbalanced or something that you have to design content around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uanikacrystalwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anika Crystalwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 1149<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 4:19:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> CHeal is many things.<br>
<br>
It is the most powerful heal in the game.<br>
It is the most efficent heal in the game.<br>
It is the spell that makes 90% of the high end game 'doable'.<br>
<br>
Pretend for a moment that CHeal was replaced with a 2500 point heal.  Think about how that would change encounters.  Verant obviously has (i.e. the Creator and his quite clever 'Balence' curse), and I'd be willing to bet we see a good bit more of other tactics in PoP where CHeal is devalued in some way shape or form.<br>
<br>
Point is, Verant put a spell into the game that is the basis for all encounters.  Everything is balanced against a MT and a CHeal chain save for those Luclin encounters that are designed specifically to make that strategy impractical or troublesome.  There's a reason that focus items don't have any effect on CHeals - even the smallest mana conservation or faster cast time would have massive effects toward reducing the difficulty of Everquest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utotteswede.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TotteSwede</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 470<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 4:46:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> Yeah, take out cheal so we don´t need 8 clerics for some encounters.

Well, its a game designed and made (and played) by flawed creatures.<br>
<br>
Cheal isnt a percentile heal, its a difinitive amount, which atm no player can actually achieve (I could be wrong, but pretty sure its 8500hps).<br>
<br>
Does EQ DEMAND certain classes to play High End and beyond? Yes. Are these the only classes that substantially contribute to a force? No.<br>
<br>
Defensive... Sure, its perentile. But isnt evasive aswell? Can you reveal a better method of making Warriors stand out from other melee, their ability to mitigate over others... without introducing an innate Mitigation skill? It has duration and refresh times, these are both relatively short, allowing alot of versatility in a single high end encounter (which could last 20-30mins).<br>
<br>
Is Defensive overpowering? No more than Paladin/SK ability to create a maelstrom of agro at will.<br>
<br>
Defensive GREATLY decreases a Warriors damage component of Agro generation. Add to the fact his is in fron of the mob, and others behind not being riposte/dodged creating mych more damage agro. Sure, with &quot;prostetics&quot; a warrior can over come such minor inconvienances.<br>
<br>
Defensive isnt always the most effective way to reduce DPS (theres a great post explinging DB + DI, the two damage components of a MOB)<br>
<br>
Cheal has a base 10sec cast time. Combined with most Uber mobs ability to plow a non defensive tank in under 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we play EQ with emphasis on Defensive Warrior and Cheal rotations. If it wasnt this, it would be something else.<br>

<br>
Basically CHeal is a 100% heal and until you get tanks with more than 10Khp then it will simply continue to get more powerful. I think I read on Mobhunter or something that Furor has 7700hp. CHeal is still a CHeal no matter what numbers you ascribe to it.<br>
<br>
Many clerics hate CHeal for simple reason that it relegates them to a single button pushing/second counting roll. Instead of the more dynamic healing roll when you remove a tank from the equation.<br>
<br>
The other reason some clerics hate CHeal is that Verant aparently use this as an reason for not giving us more rounded abilities (I personally love my roll but then I'm only level 55). CHeal makes clerics irreplacable in certain circumstances and for this reason Verant aparently won't give us any new abilities (I'm still holding out for Mark Of Alcoholism though).<br>
<br>
I have a question now though... when an &quot;ubermob&quot; CHeals do they simply regain 10500hp or is it a genuine Complete Heal?<br>
<br>
Also what would your reaction be if you couldn't Complete Heal a tank with 15Khp with a spell which is called Complete Heal? If Verant ever tank hp levels above 10K they will either need to recode CHeal or simply make other forms of healing a viable alternative. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28162>Daerv Heroe</a><br><br>"Stopping you is not important," said the Earl.

I remeber at 50 (this is with tanks in kunark and some low end velious gear) it was a toss up if your 10 second heal was gonna hit the tank before he bit the bullet. <br>
<br>
Now I can throw off a CH at 30 sometimes 20 on high damage mobs in ssra (skirmishers and such not the ubers :P) and have a good chance of them hitting, not that I do but its happened before when the tank took too much dmg pulling the mobs or other occurances. <br>
<br>
However at 50 400 mana is a large chunk of your total mana pool like 3 or 4 was all I could get off.<br>
<br>
Higher tank hitpoint totals and larger mana pools have reduced the /drawback of CH into near total oblivion there is no reason why I should choose the 350 mana devine light over CH on a warrior unless im spoting for a roll on a uber mob.<br>

If CH had never existed the whole game would be diffrent. I doubt you would see mobs with 30 bajillion hp just to challange the players. Uber mobs would have been tuned around the next best heal.<br>
<br>
CH has also hurt the clerics, we dont get healing upgrades. Why becuse you are broken sorry no new heals for you here take this mark of karn remake instead. Not saying that our luclin spells sucked but as fat as healing goes we havent goten a real upgrade since kunark. <br>
<br>
I would love to have a better ratio heal then DL that doesnt take 10 seconds to cast but I doubt I will ever see it. because of the great fear that CH instills in developers. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Cheal is simply the most effective healing spell. By a lot. Every late game encounter is run with a chain of cheals.<br>
<br>
--Saalron<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It basically boils down to this:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You might say.. but we could never survive some of these encounters in Velious/Luclin without a cheal chain! Guess why that is? It's because cheal was there first and the developers made those encounters demand a cheal chain.<br>
<br>
--Saalron<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Complete Heal, as it is, is the most completely unbalancing spell in the game. It is THE spell that defines the design of all high-end encounters. No other spell has such a far reaching effect on the game. Feign Death (spell and skill) is close. When the level cap for EQ was 50, and the biggest thing you could do was a Naggy/Vox raid, CH was ok. The problem is, as the level cap rose to 60, and HP caps rose as well, CH became WAY too efficient. 400 mana for a spell that can heal &gt;8000 HPs every 12 seconds or so is crazy. Manaburn isn't anywhere near as efficient. In fact, as you get higher in levels, and your tank gets more HPs, CH just gets more and more efficient. Plus, this is a freaking level 39 spell!<br>
<br>
Look at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/data/item.asp?Id=1772">Donal's Chestplate of Mourning</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. The CH cast was nerfed on that item because it was unbelievably unbalancing. (BTW, I love how Casters Realm's description says, Dropped by: Trakanon, and Zone: Coming Soon!)<br>

Complete Heal is the most powerful heal in the game BECAUSE it is the most efficient heal. It is not only &quot;the spell that makes 90% of the high end game 'doable'&quot;, it is the spell that made 90% of the high-end game the way it is.<br>
<br>
IMO, Complete Heal cannot be taken out of the game. Not anymore. If it were, the whole high-end game would be undoable. Unless every single encounter was re-done to adjust mobs HPs and attacks to re-balance the game, EQ would be truly broken. It would change the whole character of the high-end game without CH. I'm sure ALOT of people would walk away from EQ if this were to happen.<br>
<br>
What about changing the spell? Capping the amount that it heals? Then it wouldn't be a COMPLETE Heal. How about changing the spell to cost more mana, like double or triple the cost, or maybe make it heal as a ratio of mana to HPs healed, like 5 HPs for 1 mana? Then you need to change the HPs and attacks of mobs to reflect the reduced efficiency of the spell, which is alot of mobs and encounters.<br>
<br>
Complete Heal, and it's effect on EQ has defined every encounter since the release of Kunark, maybe even before.<br>

<br>
Complete Heal, as it is currently, is a flawed spell. I don't believe that a spell that heals completely should be taken out of the game. It should, however, not increase so drastically in its efficiency (power) as people level.<br>
<br>
Imagine a spell that gave a caster a full mana bar in exchange for a fixed amount of HPs. I'm sure alot of people would cream over such a spell, but think of how it would trivialize the entire game. That is the effect that CH had on EQ.<br>
<br>
EQ would be an entirely different game if CH had not been put in. I cannot imagine the game without it, but it's interesting to try. <p><br>

<br>
Sure its easy to count to 4 but to dead with linkdead, changing tanks, unexpected aggro, modrodding and tons of other things makes it more complicated, especially in intense fight like the emperor that also last 20 mins.<br>
<br>
A CH chain alone isnt a safe thing either, many small tweaks really make the difference. The Caer CH chain 6 months ago was a sad thing compared to the smooth wave of heals it is today.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a 3 year old game, any game you play for more than 100 hours become completely trivial. The challenge is to make people work together towards a common goal. Its not possible to make a challenge for 1000 players that wont be extremely trivial once you tried it a some times. A way to do this would be to implant a random factor in the encounters like AoW could double flurry but might be slowable from time to time, or sometimes he would be perma rooted or who knows what. Problem with this is that when alot of people wipe it takes time and it would suck even more.<br>

Rant about all you like, this game owns and your /pl will prove that. (Or your complete disability to entertain yourself.)<br>

<br>
People do Naggy/Vox without CH chains. The only reason they're making yard trash mobs with 20k hitpoints that double for 250 is because of CH. Baldrik's opinion, however valid for the contemporary, doesn't consider that if CH hadn't been put into the game, things would have been very different. Look at the Kunark mobs/dragons... very few of them actually require a CH chain. Can kill Trakanon or Sev without a single CH being cast. (Almost have to on Trak because his AE means you need lots of spots.)<br>
<br>
While I don't want this to turn into a bitch session, Casters are pretty well balanced for Old World and Kunark. Enter Velious, where mobs with huge amounts of hitpoints and damage output appear. Suddenly, casters aren't wanted because they can't sustain the damage output. CHeal is indirectly responsible for the bulk of the problems that the Mage/Wiz/Necro classes suffer in grouping these days. (People do so love their Warrior/Cleric/Enchanter combo, don't they?)<br>
<br>
Like it or no, though, there's no point in bitching about CHeal. It's here to stay. Chances are quite high that there will be more encounters where CHeal is relatively impractical, but there is no way they're going to remove the spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Incidentally... CHeal is 10,000. Through AA, clerics can get it up to 10,500. (Maybe higher, I don't know the Improved Healing AA that well.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uslassh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slassh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 11:02:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3124.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To clarify,</span><hr size=1> I have always avoided Wizards for XP groups from lvl10+.
