<br>
PRELIMINARY AUTOPSY REPORT<br>
CASE# OU812<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION OF REMAINS:  Visual inspection of the body reveals an intact, well-nourished Wood Elf Male of approximately mid-to late- 60's level with indications of Title-level AA's.  There are no obvious signs of injury which might have caused death, however, the body shows evidence of multiple old healed and partially healed injuries and resurrections.  Of particular note are the eyes, feet,  and hands of the deceased.  The eyes are not within normal limits for Wood Elves, resembling instead those of an Eagle.  The feet show signs consistent with excessive Spirit of Wolf useage.  The hands, meanwhile, show physcial abnormalities consistent with extremely excessive Archery useage.<br>
<br>
FIRST IMPRESSION OF REMAINS: Decedent was virtually certain to have been a Ranger.<br>
<br>
SYNOPSIS OF PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS:  The body was opened utilizing the usual Y-shaped incision.  Interior organs were for the most part within normal limits for the decedent's race and class, with the notable exception of the heart.  The heart showed evidence of massive atrophy, almost certainly making it unlikely to support normal cardiac functions.  Blood work showed elevated Real Life Interferons and Ennui level.  See detailed report for precise measurements and findings.<br>
<br>
CAUSE OF DEATH: Heart failure secondary to excessive Real Life obligations with mitigating Loss of Interest factors. <br>
<br>

<br>
Well guys, I'm out.  After taking some time off, I've decided to stay away from EQ for the moment.  Losing a girlfriend due to my desire to raid over spending time with her got me to look at the fact that I wasn't truly enjoying my time like I used to.  I'd stopped going to websites looking for more game information like I once had.  I'm in a dead end job that I loathe, so I'm headed back to school to hopefully find something better.  I figure if I keep trying stuff, I'll eventually find it...so far Architecture, Computer Engineering, Computer Information Systems, and Nursing are definately Not It.<br>
<br>
Colphax is going to sleep, he will never be played by anyone other than me.  If you see me online, feel free to mock my not being able to stay away.<br>
<br>
Of all the high end guilds I could have been a part of, I'm glad Agony was the one I wound up in.  You guys rock.  Keep impressing the server.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shout outs to those of you whom I've known in my 2 years on Vazaelle who can't see my Agony post:  If I miss ya, I'm sorry.  I never thought I made much of an impression on this server, but I'm amazed at how many people I've run across...<br>
<br>
Oakwood:  Props to the guy who got me into EQ..and the one who I spent the least amount of time with in game.  That's one of my biggest regrets of my EQ career.  Good luck with that spiffy new sheepskin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Mebbe I'll have one too someday...<br>
<br>
Kaereem and Kaereme:  Or Ozzadar and Mellowdey, or whichever alts you are playing now...I've missed you guys a lot since our schedules didn't mesh up for the last few months or so.  You guys put the &quot;friend&quot; in friendship, and I knew I could always rely on you no matter what.  Good luck with school, Mrs K, and Mr K, you take good care of her (like i already know you are).  I'll remember our adventures together always.  Good luck there in FA.<br>
<br>
Steelfyst and Yunk:  Missed you guys tons since our Vox Populi days.  I know Walkers are treating you well.  Good luck in all you do...Yunk, please buy Steel typing lessons =P<br>
<br>
Chillenm:  Damn fine chanter you were, Chill, sorry you felt railroaded into playing your monk...but I'm sure you do just as well on that scaley iksar...or anyone of your Army of characters =).<br>
<br>
Santina:  Missed you a lot since EA and Agony's raiding schedules kept us from hanging out as much as I'd have liked.  You were always good for a laugh, and a damn fine cleric.<br>
<br>
Tauaunt:  How you've kept Soldiers of Steel going amazes me, Tau.  Keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
Freyyah, Korra, Neil, and even Avaa(wherever you are):  My &quot;crew&quot;, LOL, along with the K's.  Some of the best times I had were with you doing whatever.  Pure magic when we worked together.  I will mis those good times.<br>
<br>
Anyone from the guilds Soldiers of Steel(1.0 and 2.0), Kingdom of Dreams, Vox Populi, Lords of Dragons, and Agony:  It was a pleasure.<br>
<br>
Colphax, pushing up daisies under a tree near you...<br>

<br>
This is so sad.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   However, as I think about that statement, I realize I made it from a greedy perspective.  It's sad for us to see you go, but you need to do what's best for you.  Overcoming a job rut and dealing with real issues should always take precident over a game.  We'll always be here for ya - both in game (if you ever decide to come back) and out of game<br>
<br>
Reflecting back, we have so many fond memories of playing together - mostly with Kaereem and Kaereme.  A few favorites... <br>
<br>
Our first outing in Crushbone killing the slaves, when an certain player (who shall remain nameless) drowns in the water hole trying to figure out how to swim upward.  My first CR.<br>
<br>
Coming home from work, logging on the dwarfs, running around Eastern Wastes near the orc fort, to get a message from you saying &quot;Hey, where are you guys&quot; and 5 minutes later you finding us (darn tracking)<br>
<br>
Wiping so many times I can't bear to count in Tower of Frozen Shadows (thanks for holding them off while my warrior made his escape...)<br>
<br>
Training City of Mist when the roof aggroed on us (again thanks for holding them up while I turned tail for the zoneline)<br>
<br>
Getting us into Vox Populi, our first raiding guild.  Also thanks for properly demonstrating why a melee should not continue attacking when a mob enrages <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dragging us into our one and only Naggy pickup raid that worked... and for being kind enough to forget to turn attack on so I could get the kill shot<br>
<br>
and of course, my favorite message... &quot;TRUESHOT ACTIVATED&quot;!<br>
<br>
Also, whenever Kaereem was winking and flirting with ya...  well, the secret is, he really did have a crush on ya (ignore the fact the wife was playing him).<br>
<br>
Kaereem &amp; Kaereme<br>

Colphax, we'll miss seeing you around! You were one of the very first people I ever met on Vazaelle and our crew always had such a great time running around being newbs together! I'll never forget how much fun we had (me, you, Steel, Frey, the K's, Wytherleaf, etc.) growing up in the Faydark and Unrest. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm retired now, too.

Bud sad to see u go, but i do know RL does have to take precident over EQ,, sometimes. lol <br>
I truly do wish the best for you and i hope everything turns out the way you are planning.  Really sucks though cause i can almost hunt with u again,lol. <br>
To let u all no, col was the first uber, think level 30 maybe,lol, to give me any advise and help.  Thing was, he acted like he wanted to.  Bud that has stuck with me since u invited me into sos. You also introduced me to some of the best peeps in vazelle, i know no names are needed, u know who u are. For that i want to ty.<br>
Far as sos, lol, u think i run that. Man that thing has a life of its own. That guilds heart just keeps pumping because of the great people that started it bled over to the people who are in there now. Im sure one day the people that will be there in the future will have the same blood flowing thru them also.<br>
Well buddy, maybe oneday our paths shall cross again, who knows.  But if not take care and ty for all ur help and advise i have gotten from u in the past. good luck my friend.<br>
