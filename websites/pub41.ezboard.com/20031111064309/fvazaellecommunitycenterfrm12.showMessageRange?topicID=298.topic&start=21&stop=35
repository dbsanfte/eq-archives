<br>
This is more a matter of International agreement than anything else.  As far as why we don't attack other countries who have had them the answer is probably a bit too obvious, but I'll use the countries you've provided for specific examples.<br>
<br>
Why not Pakistan and India:<br>
  While both are quite beligerant towards each other revolving around the dispute for Kashmir, these two countries have done nothing more than pretty much any other country in the world in that they provide tacit support for the rebels in the region surreptiously and put their militaries on maneuvers, but both have relatively stable military's which don't have a habit of driving their tanks into other countries.<br>
<br>
Why not China:<br>
  Certainly China has threatened Taiwan extensively about &quot;taking them over&quot;, but considering they've been doing this for the past oh.. 40 years, I think we can assume that they don't intend to militarily take over one of the United States better allies.  China also has a particularly calculating form of leadership (Communism) so is less prone to making decisions to invade neighboring countries on a whim. (See Dictatorship)<br>
<br>
Why Iraq:<br>
  Iraq under it's current leadership hasn't exactly been the posterboy for regional stability, involving themselves in an 8 year war with Iran from 1980-1988, in which they extensively used chemical weaponry (Something they claim they don't have now btw, apparently having given it all to the DAV or some such).  After the Invasion of Kuwait and the buildup of forces on the Saudi Border, the United States took action. <br>
<br>
The key difference here is stability.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that you don't particularly care about the issues, however, you just seem to wish to push your own agenda.  <br>

Tragically so.  Pres. Bush can legally, from the point of view of American politics, engage in conflict with Iraq.<br>

<br>
Well, actually, India is stable and mostly capitalistic democracy, so really our kinda people.  Not to mention the economic ties between the US and the world's second most populous country are extensive.  Really, other than the Kashmir conflict, India's a pretty decent place by American standards.  Of course, they have nukes, and we don't like anyone but us having nukes, but we get along so it's mostly okay.<br>
<br>
Pakistan, on the other hand, is a completely different issue.  They used to be a relatively moderate and democratic Islamic state.  Of course, certain aspects of the government funded the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  Since we couldn't have cared less about Afghanis or Pakistan's ties to their oppression during that period of history, it wasn't an issue.  Then, in a military coup Musharraf ousts the democratic institutions in Pakistan and places the country under his military rule.  Under him, conflicts in Kashmir increase and Pakistan detonates a nuclear weapon.  And his grip on power in tenuous, he, too, could get ousted and possibly replaced by a hard-line fundamentalist.  Let's see... loose cannon military leader known to have nuclear weapons and constantly at odds with a nation we're quite friendly with... who also has nuclear weapons.  You'd think Pakistan... or at least Musharraf, would be at the top of our list of &quot;things to take care of.&quot;  But no, we need to use his soil for our retalitory strike into Afghanistan following 9/11.  So suddenly Musharraf is a good guy.  Gosh... if only Castro had let us put nuclear weapons in Cuba rather than Russia...<br>

<br>
China's brand of Communism is actually not very close to Dictatorship.  It's really more of an Oligarchy with a small amount of Meritocracy supporting a partially Marxist system.  Nonetheless, it is particularly calculating and not prone to making invasion decisions on a whim, but most countries ruled by commitee are that way, the US included (or at least, until Bush got his Carte Blanche).<br>
<br>
But otherwise... hmm... we've gone to war with China in the not too distant past (see: Korea).  They are Communist, and Americans institutionally hate Commies.  We bombed their embassy (accidentally).  They held our planes and air crews hostage.  The threat to Taiwan is real if not entirely probable.  They have nukes.  They're continuously throwing their considerable weight around more in global politics and they're a sleeping bear of economic power which is waking up, and none too slowly.  They're even trying to put someone on the moon!  Really, these guys are huge threat.<br>
<br>
Oh, but we have huge economic ties to them... and they have a huge army.  Sure, if we went to war we could kick their ass at sea and in the air... and their nuke delivery systems aren't the world's greatest.  But if we had to fight China on the ground... in China.  That would be a bloody mess, and any nukeless victory would be very costly in American lives.  And a nuke victory.  Well aside from making us the world's biggest pariahs and killing millions of innocent civilians... well aside from that it wouldn't be too bad... assuming they had trouble getting a nuke to our shores...<br>
<br>
Really, the better investment is to work with 'em.<br>

<br>
Odd that you should mention the Iran-Iraq war.  That was our war.  We used Iraq as a proxy force.  History is pretty clear on that.  The US was concerned about one regional power in that area growing too powerful, so by setting Iran and Iraq at the each other's throats and giving them the materials to make it a long, bloody and ultimately inconclusive war, we could keep things balanced (oh, and our real allies, Israel and Turkey, could get some breathing room).  And yes, they used chemical weapons.  American and Russian ones.<br>
<br>
This was our war.  And, from our point of view, it went splendidly and accomplished all its goals.  It made the region more stable... at least insofar as it led to the type of stability we wanted.  Saddam even led one of the least fundamentalist nations in the area.  Saddam was perfect.<br>
<br>
But Iraq continued to build its military might after the war ended.<br>
<br>
Then came Kuwait.  Iraq had long wanted Kuwait after the Brits (mostly) divided up the Ottoman Empire following the first World War.  Iraq finally had the means to do so decisively.  They put out diplomatic feelers and after not getting a hugely negative response, went for it.  But there was a problem.  Oil was involved.  Other nations started getting pissed off, especially because Iraq doesn't manage its oil fields in the same globalization friendly way that Kuwait did.  Saudi and Iraqi forces simultaneously built up at the border... among other things, the Saudis knew the storm that was coming (pun not intended).<br>
<br>
Remember, the Cold War had just ended and there were a lot of US and NATO forces, formerly tied up in Eastern Europe, which now either had to be used, moved, or decommisioned.  It seemed like an invasion of Iraq would be a reasonable use, so they were committed.  Had the Cold War still been occuring and Saddam not subsequently decided to otherwise flex his military might, he might have gotten away with it.<br>
<br>
So the world got together and kicked Iraq's ass and returned Kuwait to the Kuwaitis.<br>
<br>
Since then, in realm of regional instability Saddam has... well he's pretty much done nothing.  He's kicked some UN inspectors out, but how that ties to regional stability I have no clue.  Iraq's been tied, in very circouitous 7-degrees fashion, to international terrorism.  Maybe.  Saddam put out a hit on former President Bush.  Still, not much threat to regional stability.<br>
<br>
But wait, hold the press...  that was the current President's dad... there's a whole lot of oil involved... Americans still hate Saddam because, hey, he's our traditional enemy now that the USSR is gone... there's a War of Terror which a conflict with Iraq could kinda sorta be tied in to...<br>
<br>
Now, I was obviously making fun in that last paragraph.  There are some reasons to go to war with Iraq.  Some hold more water than others.  However, regional stability is not one of them.  Starting a war, especially with a wholly expeditionary force, is never good for regional stability.  A war there could lead to further splintering of Iraq, renewed Kurdish unrest in Turkey and Iran and the distributing of whatever weapons of mass destruction Saddam's regime has to whomever can find and loot the sites first.<br>
<br>
A war with Iraq would not be about stability.<br>

<br>
yes, let's spend billions of dollars to save a buck a barrel.  Which by the way would not go well with profits from HIS OWN OIL COMPANY!!!!!!!!!  If Saddam would have been assassinated/died on his own...that would have been worse for everyone with the serious freaks that were waiting in the wings.  I'm surprised no one has brought up what Saddam did to his own &quot;friends&quot; when he gained power.<br>
<br>
And what did they ever do?  Fund terrorist actions all over the globe.<br>

<br>
and honest politician....that's an oxymoron (partial pun intended).<br>
<br>
and again the view that Republicans = Democrats.  Not entirely, but they've been at it so long, they've come to so many compromises that neither can get anything done that they really want to do.  Their political philosophy doesn't mean anything anymore.  Politicians and their greed are ruled by the special interest groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
Having been in the first conflict, all I have to say is this.  When at sea, we got a news message on the TV that was the Prime minister of Kuwait during the invasion by Iraq pleading for anyone who could help to assist.  Well being good people we are, could you watch a woman (or a man too I guess) be raped and just stand by and do nothing because it's not your fight?<br>
<br>
Seriously...no blood for oil is such a non-informed, worn out protest cry.  Please use it only when it applies.  Plus, invading Kuwait got rid of a HUGE national debt Iraq owed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not like most who'd rather go to world war than to vote for a &quot;Pussy Democrat&quot;.  If you honestly think that Democrats would have laid down and curled up in the fetal position, you are sadly mistaken.<br>
<br>
Yes, I do believe the 10 year issue with Iraq needed resolution...but doing it against other countries approval much less the ppl who (supposedly) put you in office frankly is ass.<br>
<br>
Let me open up another can of worms here.  Can you name a single conflict where differences in religion didn’t play a critical part?  Religion (organized) is evil. That is all.<br>

<br>
The American Revolution, the Civil War, the War of 1812, the Spanish American War, the French Revolution (a war the French won, but I guess that's cause they were fighting the French), the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and many other wars were fought between groups of people with largely similar religious beliefs.  I'm not saying that religion hasn't caused a substantial number of military conflicts over the years, but I don't think it's the majority.<br>
