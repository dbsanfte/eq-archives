Some of the points I'd like to address based on my experience of the game so far.<br>
<br>
1) the overall challenge.  Lower than EQ?  I highly doubt it.  In EQ the challenge is in over coming Verants Stupidity.  They can't make a decent AI, so they jack the stats of the creatures far beyond reason, which makes the mobs hard yes, but its stupid hard, not fun hard.  Its aggravating that I've reached the pinnacle of my ability as a warrior and yet I am pale and insignificant in the face of the lowliest of Tormax's guards.  Its stupid that I have to bring 30 of my closest friends to beat one DE in Kithicor.  In DAOC though, you are facing the ultimate challenge, a live thinking person on the other end of that character model.  And not just one, but many, whole guilds that will be strategizing and plotting your downfall.  That’s more challenge that Verants &quot;Lets give this mob 1,967,456,399 hit points and an ac of 2349 and resists of 350 who can quad attack for 900 plus a silencing ae that does 1500...  DAOC will have hard mobs too, and in truth their ai ain’t that much better.  But when your facing humans who have characters that are the same or roughly the same as you, well luck and smarts and teamwork will make it a much more fun experience.  <br>
<br>
2) Its much more difficult to die accidentally, you can't mistakenly attack members of your own realm.  Well, in EQ PVE you can't attack Anyone...  But you can go LD, and die to green mobs that shouldn't have a chance of catching you, let alone beating you.  I'm not saying LD isn't something you'll see in DAOC, but when you go LD you disappear off the battlefield so that other players won’t kill you at least.  In EQ they decide to punish you because a few people were exploiting LD, so rather than punish the exploiters they punish everyone.  Mythic has a fundamentally different view of how to deal with their customer base.  A view I favor because its not &quot;guilty till proven not guilty&quot; that Verant uses.<br>
<br>
3)  no such thing as CR...  You like CR?  Oh yea, your a rogue, you can easily hide and sneak your way back to your body, and be the hero of the raid when things go bad.  As a warrior, I get to sit in Thurgadin and play with dwarves till you get my body back.  Personally I'll be very happy to never do a CR again.<br>
<br>
4) &quot;lead to a glut of level 30 players (the maximum PvE attainable level)&quot;  ???  Where did you hear that?  The maximum level attainable is 50, and you can't gain levels in RvR, you still gain levels in PvE, you gain realm points in RvR.  Which leads to another misconception that people who won't actually read or play the game come up with.  You are forced into PvP.  You are not.  It is true that with realm points (gained through RvR) you can enhance your character.  And thus a character who is level 50 with many realm points will be better off than a level 50 with no realm points.  But if your not into PvP you do not have to engage in it, you will have to accept that your not getting some of the advantages that realm points can bring you.  HOWEVER if your truly a passive role-player, those things probably won't interest you all that much anyhow.  If your just a sniveler who won't risk pvp but wants all the advantages, well then get over the fear and go out and have fun.  (note that I am not directing that at Arafain, or anyone in particular, its a general statement.)  Arafain does state however that he sees little to refrain people from exploiting RvR to further their characters.  That is just further proof that he has read very little if anything about the game.  Mythic has a devotion to its customer base, and part of that is providing a game that is solidly built, and provides an equal challenge for everyone.  There are many restrictions and blocks to using RvR exploits to advance your character.  There will be those idiots that find exploits anyhow, but I feel pretty confident that Mythic will not only deal with those people, but they won’t punish the rest of us for the actions of the few.  <br>
<br>
I suggest trying it, playing it.  You will find that there are a LOT of misconceptions floating about.  I’ll probably be playing both EQ and DAOC for awhile, but I can really see me phasing out EQ entirely once I’ve gotten into the swing of DAOC.  Out of the box its already got more appeal for me than EQ has in almost 3 years of production.<br>

That is the question.</span><hr size=1>   I agree with Ailbe. Even though I'm not level 60 and haven't participated in killing 90% of the uber mobs in game, I'm a PvPer at heart. Coming from a warring guild in UO (20 vs. 20 was an almost-every night occurence), PvP is definitely a lot more challenging than PvE could ever be. Once you figure out the AI on a specific encounter in EQ, you can most of the time employ the same tactics with little chance of failure. After enough times, it's almost like second nature.<br>
<br>
  The non-existant death penalty in DAoC is one of the nicest features of the game. No longer will clerics have everyone begging them for resses just so they don't lose DAYS of experience. Sure, they might lose an hour or so running back to their hunting spot, and I think that's penalty enough.<br>

why??  what makes good ai?  smart enemies that try to win fights and run for help when they will lose?<br>

It can't be done.  A good AI monster would be targetting the healers, then the casters, then the warriors.  Remember when CH was a super taunt? you could equate that to being good AI.  the game would be impossible!  2ndly, smart AI mobs running for help?  ya just train train trains.<br>
<br>
There can be no good AI in the game unless all mobs have their hp scaled back to player levels and having all mobs walk in groups. <p><small>"I think it would be a good idea. "

That is the question.</span><hr size=1> Hmm I can clearly remember watching the AI in DAoC.  <br>
<br>
We would pull one and start to battle it,  if we got an add it would head straight for the healer/casters without any encouragement on the part of our party members.  Which usually called for us to have those members under protect.  It was sinister how the AI worked.  They also had mobs that were scouts who would battle with you and if the battle wasn't going well  (not just for the actual NPC involved but the NPCs involved in the battle)  It would call for help.  There AI has some significant advantages over Verants at the moment.  <br>
<br>
One of the better features of the RvR is that you can't communicate between realms and you don't see each others real names.  I have heard numerous complaints about this,  why?  I mean if they aren't in your realm would you know them?  No.  Get over it and realize that one of the only reasons you want that communication ability is to cheat and abuse it.  Ultimately it would take away from the excitement of the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
From a play standpoint I can still remember running out of the gates of my border keep and seeing that we were besieged by Trolls, Kobolds, and Norsemen.  There were more then 100 of them and the gate guards were attempting to keep them at bay.   Even as a spectator it was a fun little event to watch.  Archers on the towers unleashing volleys of arrows, along with Wizards and other casters casting away.  The graphics are unbelievably entertaining and I can only imagine they will improve.<br>

 I also like the fact that you can't tell people apart if they're form another realm. Once I go DAoC, I'm going to revel in the PvP, having seen a couple battles, I'm very pleased with the way it looks and I think I'll enjoy it greatly. <br>
 And no Its not player skill based (Which can be negated by speed of your system). It's similar to EQ combat styles with a greater edge of diversity of action. <p><b>Gilgurth: and you'll die in what?  2 hits?<br>

It would shock me to find out that only &quot;a few people&quot; would do the same thing in EQ to avoid death, had they not taken that option out.  Hell, I know *I* would. <p>Binnen Minder<br>

<br>
1.  The interface isn't as user friendly<br>
2.  The way you loot mobs is GAY GAY GAY GAY<br>
3.  That frigging split Text box is gonna drive me insane.<br>
4.  To slow in action for me<br>
5.  I think its gay that you get all your equipment back when you die, to me that takes alot of difficulty out of      the game.<br>
6.  I am undecided on the Armour/Weapon deterioration, granted with this, they may have made it harder to        twink.<br>

That is the question.</span><hr size=1> People who pull the line to avoid a death is kind of lame, and I am sure they are not many of them left in EQ, or atleast I would hope not.  I guess I am an optimist to think that there are honest, good players in EQ that don't &quot;bend&quot; the system....alas I digress...to DAoC, the loot system is fine, the chat interface takes some getting used too.  After almost 2 years of EQ you get used to 1 system, so I am not going to knock that down.  The armour/weapon grading system is perfect for slowing down twinking, it will not kill it but it will make it more difficult.  <br>
<br>
Action too slow? What are you doing in game?  The no CR thing is kind of nice actually, past level 6 you still have to go back and /pray at your gravestone, and if need be pay the town healer to get your CON points back.<br>
<br>
I can see there are some that will never like DAoC, that is fine, everyone has opinions.  I for one am trying DAoC, did the beta and liked it.  I still play EQ, even though it is slow and more a chore to log in (except that Chardok run a few days ago), so I figure a change of scenery is not a bad thing.<br>
