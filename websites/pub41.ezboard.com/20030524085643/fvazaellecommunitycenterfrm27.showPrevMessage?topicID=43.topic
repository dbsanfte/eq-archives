Fascination clouded her eyes as she watched the ghastly display cause by the long serrated black bladed sword she favoured in battle. Death was her obsession. Death of any kind. She took pleasure when she could inflict it, and delighted in any exploration of it. What made it taste sweet to her was that she could not get into trouble for this, the orc had attacked her, hoping for a few gold pieces, or thought she was a meal or something along the lines.<br>
<br>
Myssa watched Mysse with the same fascination that her sister watched the orc she had just slain. How could she be related to this, this, morbid person? Mysse noticed the wound on her sisters side. Why must she wear such flimsy armor? Not that they could afford new armor for themselves, not yet. Soon though, they had skills that would sell well.<br>
<br>
Myssa walked behind her sister and made a mental prayer to Innoruuk. She closed her eyes as the tiny blue light glowed brighter around her hands. Opening her eyes the light moved to surround Mysse's minor wound and mended it Mysse jerked her head towards her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you expending energy on something so trivial?&quot; Myssa could hear the irritation in her voice and wondered if it was really over her expending her energy, or because she interrupt her revelling in her task.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its easier, and the energy will be replenished soon enough.&quot; Myssa deliberately tried to keep her tone flat so as not to agrivate her more. She'd hoped the theif would have brightened Mysse's mood. Death usually did. <br>
<br>
Mysse's murmurs were not audible as she bent over the dead body again. When she placed her hands first on the wound, Myssa flinched, when she pushed her fingers into it, she nearly threw up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why must you do that? Its disgusting!&quot; Myssa cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you must know...&quot; Mysse's tone clearly indicated she had no need to know. &quot;I think I have a way to steal someone's life energy form them, even after they are dead.&quot; <br>
<br>
Myssa gasped. &quot;You know that's impossible! Life must still be within the body to use it, or steal as the case may be.&quot; Her tone was sour, sounding like she was recounting a lesson from her youth. Knowing Myssa, she probably was.<br>
<br>
Mysse stood up, her hands bloodied, and regarded her sister for a long moment. &quot;You bring life to the dead through ressurection.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But only if the body is relatively in tact, and only if it is done quickly before the life can leave entirely. And at that, the wounds are not healed and require more magic to heal. Mysse, you don'tknow what you are stealing if you're taking life the dead.&quot; She managed to look concered. It must be the cleric in her leaking out. Priest of Hate indeed. <br>
<br>
Myssa seemed to sense her shock, and decided not to goad her any further. <br>
<br>
&quot;There's a stream ahead to wash yourself and hands in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mysse merely nodded and followed Myssa down the path. &quot;We should be in freeport in two days.&quot; Mysse said. &quot; We'll have to stop and rest once we reach the edge of the forest tonight. You're certain the preists of Marr will let you into their temple?&quot; Myssa nodded patiently again. Freeport catered to almost all races on Norrath at least in part, but the northern building of Freeport were ran by the Knights of Truth and Priests of Marr. Neither of which had much tolerance for worshipers of hate. <br>
<br>
Mysse sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have dispensation from the High Priest there, as well as High Priestess Alexandria. You know as well as I do that since the King and Queen's death, Neriak has sought more peaceful relations with norrath. They have little problems with the clerics of Neriak anymore.&quot; Myssa noted the open revulsion on Mysse's face as she thought of peace with the rest of Norrath. Mysse was a firm believer of Dark Elf superiority; an attitude now much in the minority. &quot;There's the river, clean up, and we can be on our way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mysse took off her thin chainmail shirt and knelt at the river. The water was cold, as it always was with no sun in Nektulos Forest to warm it even slightly. As she thought over Myssa's words she realized that travelling with her sister was for the best. Without her, she could not move freely through Freeport, and would have had to work through awkward channels. The best part was, Myssa had legitimate business in Freeport, which would cover Mysse's acitivies. Just a few more days to Freeport, and at least she could begin.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/jodyu/MysseSig.GIF" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
