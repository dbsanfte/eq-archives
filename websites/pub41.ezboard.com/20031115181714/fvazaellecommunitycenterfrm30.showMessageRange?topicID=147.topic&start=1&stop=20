I mean she could be making money all over the place in the media yet she hasn't even given out her name and picture, let alone agree to be interviewed.  Secondly, she comes from a rich family and probably isn't too concerned about money.  <br>
<br>
The jews are really getting off on this whole incident.  larry king had one of kobe's ex-girlfriends in for an interview as a &quot;character witness.&quot;  She only dated him for 2 WEEKS!  How is she supposed to know what he is REALLY like.  If kobe is such a great guy what is he doing having one night stands with teenagers, married at his age.  Then he lies to all of us saying he did nothing until the DNA evidence proved otherwise?  What was that all about?  He even called HER up to his room, and initiated their &quot;get together.&quot;  I'm sorry but at 19 not all girls are mature enough to handle older married men and maybe she was fooling around with him but didn't want to take it to the &quot;level&quot; that she did.  Now the naacp is calling this whole ordeal &quot;racist.&quot;  <br>
<br>
If the tables where turned and she was a 19 year old famous black girl and a married older man came in and raped her instead I know for a fact blacks would be rioting and jews would promote anti-white speach in the front pages and media for weeks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jebnar>Jebnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 454<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/03 10:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=147.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kobe bryant is most likely GUILTY</span><hr size=1> he asked her to his room : she showed up after work<br>

<br>
The problem is that you, in your ignorance, jump to conclusions about Kobe Bryant simply because he is black.  You have no evidence to support your claim that it was rape, to claim you know what happened just makes you look stupid.  Anyone with half a brain who wasn't in the room at the time of the incident will admit that he just doesn't know what happened.<br>
<br>
OJ didn't get off cause he was black.  He got off cause he paid some absolutely outrageous sum of money to his legal team and they created reasonable doubt (and the prosecutors/police fucked up the case horribly).  There are plenty of wealthy white guys that get away with horrible crimes as well.  Unfortunately, having a great deal of money can definitely help your case.<br>

<br>
  There have also been white people who claim the girl is falsifying her charges in order to get fame and notoriety.  Unfortunately this isn't a new thing surrounding professional athletes and it wouldn't be the first time someone has faked a rape in order to improve their lot in life.  It's really sad that people do it because those women who truly are raped then have an even more massive burden of proof in the eyes of many to prove that they were indeed raped.<br>

<br>
  You don't make money by agreeing to interviews with the media or giving out your name and picture.  I can ASSURE you in this day and age if someone accuses a professional player of any crime the media will ruthlessly hunt them down like dogs and post information about them without a word edgewise from them.  As far as making money, assuming she is falsifying for a second and money is her goal, money is mostly made from the movie and book deals after the ordeal, not the interviews in the interim.  I would suspect if she is faking it that it's more of a power issue, but that's clearly a guess based on a hypothetical.  <br>

I'm not sure how you relate Larry King, a media guy, having a ex-gf on his show as, 'Jews are really getting off on the whole incident'.  Basically he like tons of other non-jewish media people have been pulling in every &quot;person&quot; who has remote contact with Kobe to get various viewpoints of the story.  This is nothing dissimilar to the tons of old childhood friends and various crap that got dragged up during the dozens of sensational trials during the 1990's.  <br>

  Perhaps you aren't old enough, but you'll find that a married man having an affair is unfortunately the norm rather than the exception.  And if you think it's unusual for an older man to go after a younger woman, then I really don't know what planet you are on.  The very fact that he denied doing it.. well.. I'm sorry that just makes me laugh, because if you put any man in the situation, the FIRST thing he's going to do is deny it.  (See President Bill Clinton)  <br>

<br>
19 year old women are almost exclusively more mature than 24 year old men.  They tend to grow up faster and take issues alot more seriously than guys do on the average.  I can't speak to this girls level of maturity and honestly I don't think it has any bearing on the case since you can't exactly ask someone if they are mature enough to understand.  Who knows, may she wanted to take it to that level and his wedding band itch kicked in.  I don't know, I wasn't there and neither will you, so how about you let the justice system who's specifically designed for it figure the whole thing out.<br>

This isn't even worth responding to since your scenario is not only obviously racist with a pre-determined hatred towards two races, but also factually incorrect for the incident at hand.  Kobe's is 24 (Far from middle aged), and as I understand the girl in question isn't exactly famous.<br>
<br>
Basically, I can sum up by saying that you are a biggoted ass who's sole intention on coming to our boards is to toss your little white power bullshit around and hope that a fish comes out and bites into your propoganda.  You are no better than the Al Sharpton's of the world who do the same for the Black community by trying to rile up hatred amongst the people to further your single minded goal of racial hatred.  I pity you and hope that you never have children to pass on this pathetic outlook.  If there's a hell, here's to hoping you burn in it.<br>

Just a word of advice from someone who almost got sucked into their bullshit during my angry teen years - CotC is just another crooked non-profit that wants your money just like the rest. Think whatever you want to think inside your own head, just don't buy into their paramilitary ubermensch bullshit.

However, MissCheivious, anyone can say what they will do in a certain situation but you don't know until you are in it.  If you feel physically threatened and fear that fighting back will get your neck broken quicker than a turkey wishbone, maybe you won't be so quick to do so.  When someone is physically intimidating and you are frozen with fear, you have no idea what you will do.  So, if you are saying you can't be raped if you don't fight back, I'll have to call bullshit on that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1542<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/03 12:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=147.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: also..</span><hr size=1> Regardless of what she did, she always maintains her right to refuse sexual intercourse.

<br>
That being said, it was probably a bad judgment call to go up to that room.  You have a right to walk all the back alleys in Harlem at 3 am if you want to, but it's probably not a good idea.<br>
<br>
I do think that if a woman does not want to have sex, she is responsible for forcefully and clearly communicating her desire to not have sex.  At that point, the man is absolutely required to stop, no matter how far they have gone up to that point.  His refusal to do so is rape.<br>
