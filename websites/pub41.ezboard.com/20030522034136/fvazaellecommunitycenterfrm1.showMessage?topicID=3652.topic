They offer a reasonably priced quick alternative to having your own army and many leaders have availed themselves of mercenaries throughout history. Of all the mercenary groups that have come and gone, few are more well known than Silver Creed and the Iron Skull Legion.<br>
<br>
Few Mercenary groups hate each other as much.<br>
<br>
Despite efforts over the years to keep the peace open war has broken between these two armies. Both sides have issued the call for new recruits, and both sides are getting them in droves. Eager to prove themselves both individual and small groups of young mercenaries are joining up in record numbers to take part in an ages old slugmatch. Will you answer the call?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, now for some details. This is going to be an event to take place on the Morell Thule server every Thursday or Wednesday night. If you like RP, or are tired of the end game, or just looking for something a little different in EQ, then please feel free to join us.<br>
<br>
The way it breaks down is this. Once a week on Thursday or Friday the guilds Silver Creed and Iron Skull Legion will have a guild war that will last from 6pm EST to 9pm EST. Longer if participants want to keep going. These two guilds exist specifically for this purpose.<br>
<br>
What is the purose? Why fun of course. A touch of story and RP, mixed together with some danger and some PvP on a relatively even field. Thats all, long and short thats what it breaks down to. Now for the rules.<br>
<br>
All participants must be lvl 15 or lower. The reason for this is for people who play on other servers to be able to level a character up relatively quickly to be able to participate. This will also keep the pvp more balanced and interesting, as at lower levels its hard to insta kill someone and the classes are a touch more balanced.<br>
<br>
Twinking will not be allowed, again, because players from other servers cannot twink themselves and to keep the battle field relatively level. You can equip your character reasonably well certainly, I'll even overlook the occasional piece of Crafted or Yak. But excessive twinking, such as Fungal tunics, or a monk running around with a SoD, would make it a little unfair and therefore will not be allowed.<br>
<br>
You can only accept buffs from others in the war. This is again to keep things balanced, otherwise its no fun for the other side if you have chloroblast and a 48 point DS. <br>
<br>
Finally, no dirty fighting please. Feel free to use any pvp tactic you can muster, but don't go about generating huge trains and pullign them down upon the other team. In short, don't be a fansy the famous bard. Thats fine for pvp servers, but it destroys waht I'm trying to create here. Feel free to kill players with dots so they lose xp or anything else, but no training and no charming low things so that the gaurds attack.<br>
<br>
Joining. If you want to join your character must belong to either of these guilds prior to the start of a war. During a war people cannot be invited into a guild and it would be impossible to constantly stop/restart the guild war. So we ask that everyone be joined prior. In order to join please contact an officer of the Mercenary force you want to join in game.<br>
<br>
The two mercenary guilds will need a bit of help forming first. If you would like to help form them and become an officer then please log into Morrel Thule at 6pm EST on Tuesday. This will give us a rough idea of how many want to participate and how many like the idea.<br>
<br>
Also, if youa re part of a group of people that would like to join this and fight together you may do so. You can join as your own independent group of any size and during the fights you will be assigned orders and given objectives as an independent group.<br>
<br>
The battles themselves will not be simple mad rushes but coordinated things possibly spanning multiple zones. Groups of 4-10 will be assigned a leader and given orders and left to themselves to figure out how to accomplish it. Certain people may carry messages that the other team can intercept. How your side does in a given battle will determine the story line and the situation of the next battle.<br>
<br>
The First battle will be on Wednesday, January 22nd at 6pm EST. More details can be found at the official Message board Located here. pub46.ezboard.com/bmercshaven <br>
