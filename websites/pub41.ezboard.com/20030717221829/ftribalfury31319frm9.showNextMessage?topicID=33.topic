<br>
I like them both, but they fill totally different roles. Great thing is that they are both soloable to 60, maybe even 65. Granted I rather group, but I tend to have problems getting a group with either since neither one of them fill required roles in higher end encounters (tank, cleric, shammy, chanter). they both tend to fall into the DPS category which fill the 5th and 6th spots of your classic group.<br>
<br>
Beastlord - melee class, can take some hits, sow, hp/mana regen, crappy Thurg/Kael/SS/planar armor, can somewhat replace other roles if those classes are not available (some chanter/shammy spells, slow, hp/mana regen, regen, melee debuff)<br>
<br>
Mage - caster class, can't take a hit, nice nukes, good Thurg/Kael/SS/planar armor, crosses fingers while running away from mob after pet dies, vending machine, ds<br>
<br>
The only other thing I considered was what class would be more useful. I think that on a raid, both classes are useful, but not always more than 1 is neeeded. 1 beast can hp/mana regen the groups. 1 mage can ds and play vending machine.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is my perception of the roles of these two classes and how I play them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morgenessofvazaelle>MorgenessOfVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No Rent</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/13/03 2:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BST vs. MAG</span><hr size=1> cool<br>
<br>
what are some of the comparisons when playing them?<br>
which is more fun?<br>
how tough is your pet?<br>
solo tactics? chain pets, pet heal, etc...<br>
spells? mana cost, cast times, etc..<br>
<br>
my comments on the magi...<br>
in a group: <br>
 when being completely efficient now adays in high end pop groups here is what i do:<br>
-once tank engages i slap malo on the mob (depending on if sham is and he is higher lvl than me). <br>
-step 2 i send my pet in... i either have him parked so that he will always be behind the mob after pull or i get behind the mob myself and sick him in (like a bst does). <br>
-step 3 i have been double dotting mobs... lvl 55 dot does 800 dmg total and lvl 44 does 600. <br>
-step 4 i throw two lvl 57 nukes in for around 950 dmg each.<br>
-mob dead.<br>
-i use the lvl 56 DS on the MT as long as he keeps me updated... i always give mods to clerics and then other classes on request.<br>
-then of course i am the vending machine...soooo <br>
<br>
in a group i keep these spells memmed in this order:<br>
1 malise<br>
2 gate (i always keep this memmed no matter what)<br>
3 dot 1<br>
4 dot 2<br>
5 DS<br>
6 BOIII<br>
7 pet (change to earth pet in some groups after i summon my water pet)<br>
8 lvl 57 nuke<br>
* i interchange slot 7 and 3 alot... for random vending and mod rods and such<br>
<br>
SOLO:<br>
-well for me soloing is all about chaining pets... 400 mana for the lvl 57 earth pet = my own personal CH. then i have to waste about another 300 mana on BOIII (pet buff) and DS. then i sit and med... <br>
-if my pet wins a battle with less than 20% health i reclaim the pet and make a new one (get back some mana, this helps in the long run).<br>
-have a mod rod up at all times... 400 mana while ur prepping to solo is nothing cuz u end up getting more of it back in the long run hehe FREE mana!<br>
-i have been using my 630 a wave rain spell on guards in katta to speed things up...<br>
-i could explain my solo tactics but i wont at this time... if u are interested i will )<br>

<br>
Comparisons between the two - <br>
<br>
Mas can take a hit, do decent DPS from his weps, 50% heal the pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   on top of regen 3 gained with my first 3 AA points, 5 and 5 from the Spiritual Radiance, and 10 regen from chloro leads to little down time, espeecially with a KEI.<br>
<br>
Denz casts a DS on pet and then pulls with Cancel Magic or a real low level nuke so as to not gen lots of agro so my pet can easily pull off me. From that point on it is fairly easy, big nuke (can't remem which one), heal pet, big nuke, heal pet, depending on mob, one last big/small nuke.<br>
<br>
I think the beast is more fun overall. I actually have a 31 mage on Vaz as well, but was quickly replaced when beasts were made available.<br>
<br>
My pet kicks ass! Some times my friend Guardrail (56/57 Ranger) and Mortycha (61 druid) will go to PoN and let my pet tank the yard trash. I end up slowing, debuffing and praying my pet will yank the mob off me before I die. Then it is constant casting of my 50% heal until lom. then Mortycha stops nuking and dotting and take over healing while I med or melee the last 20% of the mob health. The fact that I get a new pet spell every other level from 50 to 64 makes my pet more and more powerful.<br>
<br>
Solo tactics are pretty simple for me. I buff myself with everything I got. I buff pet with haste/str/ac pet buff, pet proc, sow, and chloro. Pull with slow, sick kitty on em, melee debuff, dot, nuke, sit. Heal pet as needed depending on difficulty of mob. Reapply dot as it wears off. Renuke once I can cast again, long reuse time. I jump in and do a little melee here and there to keep my skills up on offense/defense/wep skills.<br>
<br>
Hope this is what you were lookin for. Let me know if it was not, and I will get back to ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Now Mages I know, and heres my take on em. First of all a lil rant...Verant I hate you, thanks for nothing nerfing mod rods /rant off. The way I play a mage depends entirely on the group, what we are hunting/types of mob, and wether or not its a raid. Solo is a whole lot more straight forward. When in a group I am primarily a caster hunter. Nothing will tear up a mob wizzy faster than a mage. With air pet for stuns and it being a monk class pet...I rarely get a spell landed on me. If they do land most are resisted. Against a caster first malase, followed by a dot and then a rain spell. If i have to tool you at range if I distance it right I can have three Lavabolt in the air before first one hits ya. At close to a K damage per not many wizzies can take that kinda lovin. Works kinda like a artillery barage...and incidentally works really well when three mages fire up on the giant spearmen in ring war event. If I have tanks to get in casters face I like to keep group DS and some kind of annul/dispel up in case mob has a DS of their own. This is tempered by how fast we kill mob and if the mob is snare pulled ( dont want to dispel the debuffs after all ). One of the things I pay special attention in groups is the clerics mana....Cleric OOM we got trouble...mage OOM I still got my pet in there doing damage.<br>
 Vending duties well thats just part of the job....In a raid I prefer to take care of this before we move out so I try to be early whenever possible. One of the things I dont mind doing is being ML for group, with weightless bags encumbrance is usually not a problem unless mobs drop a ton of cash ( which I find is rare)  Solo well, considering ive solo'd for such a long time I prefer to group. I solo and do it well, but I am having a hard time finding mobs to hunt that give decent exp. Keep in mind folks if mob gets past pet mages last about 20 seconds. Mages as a class really need some fine tuning from game designers. At level 56 I have no snare/slow, no root, no self speed inc ie sow, no mana regen ability, no fear, and no AC. I have about two ways to deal with mobs solo, One : slurp a SOW potion, Nuke Hard at the start and hate kite mob at full speed while pet whacks from behind, and nuke when ever mob turns on pet to regain agro. Or two send in pet to tank, nuke every now and again while pet tanks. Please keep in mind mages pet heal only does a single bub of healing on pet per cast, uses a ton of mana and has a long refresh rate......pet tanking in the planes at this time is just not a option. Now, fun aspects of mage class: Monster summoning, this spell rocks. Hehe OMG theres a sand giant running at me in oasis...flee /snicker look for the mage standing on the other side of that sand dune behind ya. Watching a freeport guard get owned by a armidillo pet is one of the most hilarious things ever. Its like a chiwowa on steroids packing a uzi. Seeing a noobie sk burn his HT on my pet is one of those when they gonna learn to con first moments, I personally feel its my responsibility to teach the younguns.  Down sides to the Mage class: Finding a group, as stated before in other posts we just arnt one of the primary classes. Also the mage class has kinda a bad rep from SOOOOO many peeps not playing the class right or being stupid about it. Not many mages make it past their mid thirties because of this. You have to be either crazy or a glutton for punishment to stick with this class. Case in point the Mage epic: In my opinion one of the hardest to do in the game. And for those who say epic why bother you get a better pet at level 61......well im not level 61 yet and my primary slot item is a sorcerous bowl or a walrus tooth.....this would be a great upgrade. Also gods man its my epic....they call it that for a reason...you do it for the shear fact of having it. In closing I currently have over 97 days and many hours played as Azzenkar, Ive tried many different stratagies to see what works and what doesnt. Ive not power leveled to reach 60 as fast as possible. I HAVE stopped and smelled the roses along the way in this long journey and I play for the enjoyment of the game. If I wanted to be UBER I would camp the bazaar and trade all day...My primary RL job is sales.....Im not gonna PAY every month to do the same thing as work. It is my opinion Mages are a great support class, with tons of things to offer a group. As long as the tank keeps on a taunting, stuff dies fast with a mage in group.<br>
