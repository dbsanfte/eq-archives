Hm. I'm curious what opinions are on this topic, because something happened to me today that made me feel really bad but I don't think I really did anything wrong. I got made out to be a bad and greedy person because of it, which really bugs me a lot because I don't think of myself that way at all. /shrug<br>
<br>
My question is this: On timed spawns , can you claim a camp even if you are not logged into the game ? <br>
<br>
Say a person brings their character to a spot and camps out knowing what time the spawn was last killed and when to log back in for the pop of the next spawn. <br>
<br>
The person logs back into the game at the scheduled time, to find someone else is there camping it and waiting for the spawn (not knowing when it was last killed so waiting it out)...<br>
<br>
Who does the spawn now belong to ?<br>
<br>
I would say the person who was actually sitting there for close to 2 hours waiting for a spawn (in this case, me.)... not knowing anyone else was waiting on it because no one else was around. No one was around to claim a spawn until about 2 minutes before it popped.<br>
<br>
Is it fair for the person who has their character logged out at the spot, to log back in 2 hours later expecting it to be theirs fair and square - reason being that &quot;they were there all day just camped out&quot; ... ?<br>
<br>
Should who NEEDS the item more come into play ?<br>
<br>
If it matters - this was camping chancellor in LOIO. I am dead broke atm and happened to be in the area so I thought I would check it out to loot the prod to try to sell. Does it make me bad for camping something with intention to sell it ? Yes, it is a quest item. But it is also a nice shaman weapon. I do have my HS key. If camping this guy for the item to sell is so bad, I could just as easily say I was camping it for someone else, I have friends who don't have their keys, and other characters that don't have the key. If I couldn't sell it I would have given it to a friend or given to an alt character, that simple. My point is, to me, it shouldn't matter my reason for camping it - I wanted the item just the same.<br>
<br>
Basically what happened was the person logged in and saw me there and started asking me if I have my HS key. I said I did, but want the item anyway and had been there for over an hour with no luck yet and didn't really want to give up now. Then he said he had been there all day and it would pop soon. I asked where he was then, and why he didn't tell me he was camping it so that I didn't waste my time. He said he was logged out. Then explained that he needs it for a guild raid the next day and asked if he could have it.<br>
<br>
I really felt bad and was hard for me to say no, because believe it or not I try to be a nice person. But it just bugs me that I wasted that much time there then to just hand something over to someone who wasn't even there. He made me feel like I was expected to do so. I explained this to him as nicely as I could, saying I hope he understands. His response was basically that he understands that I am greedy.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Anyway, as soon as he said that I sent a tell I got upset (I *hate* being called greedy.) and took a minute not sure how to respond. So then I sent a tell and said &quot;ugh, fine just take it&quot; - but he had logged off and the tell didn't go through.  I am kind of glad it didn't though, and now I am glad that I didn't get suckered into giving it to him when he ended up just acting like such a jerk about the whole situation.<br>
<br>
This just really bugs me, mainly cuz I was made out to be a greedy bad person when I did what seemed fair. /shrug<br>
<br>
Anyway, I would really like to know your opinions , not for the sake of making me feel like I made the right or wrong decision, but for future reference on player etiquette when it comes to a sitaution like this.<br>
<br>
... can you claim a camp even if you are not logged into the game just by having your character camped out there ? <br>

     My opinion is, if he wants the mob then he should physically be there to camp said mob.  Not time it and spend time offline doing other things waiting for that time to pass.  You were totally in the right (in my opinion) by defending your ground.  Now, if the individual went LD and was only gone a few minutes, that is different, but it sounds like this individual was gone for a while.  If the item they needed was so important they should have stayed in zone to camp it.  Just my opinion.<br>

If you want the item, especially that item, be prepared to be sitting there camping it.  There can be no reasoable expectation that anyone would respect your claim if you log off.  Period.<br>

Although the definition of FFA is not the same for all, most people will respect common/well known camps. ie frenzy in Guk, KPC, tower in KC etc etc. But how in God's name can you even consider calling a camp when you're toon isnt even logged on. Clearly this person is one of Wizbang's druggie/stalker friends, who just got his unemployment benefits and got a good deal on half an ounce.<br>

I replied, of course, with &quot;10 mins ago camp check was called and there were no replies and we just did a camp check and there were no replies&quot;. We then get a reply of &quot;Well, there is one of our corpses there so We are camping it&quot;.

In the meantime, the rogue in thier group Hides &amp; Sneaks to the ledge and then says &quot;Ledge is camped&quot;. Then of course We get stuff like &quot;Bye Bye&quot; and &quot;Better luck next time&quot; followed later by &quot;I didn't know your guild harbored just XXXXX pricks&quot; etc etc. Basically, I think it was poor gamesmanship but what are ya gonna do.. Sure, being a monk I could have made their lives hell =) but then why bother... Some people seem to level up but still play like newbies =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 304<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/11/02 3:46:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: item camping but not logged in ?</span><hr size=1> limb .. if it was their camp and they owned all the content, the least you can do is pitch in and help them by rounding up all of 'Their' npcs and delivering the mobs to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 814<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/11/02 3:50:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/flappy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: item camping but not logged in ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Clearly this person is one of Wizbang's druggie/stalker friends, who just got his unemployment benefits and got a good deal on half an ounce.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

And as for the original post, I camped the crap out of Hadden back in the day for my Fishbone Earring. Most of the time when I logged in (had the timer down), it was uncontested and I ganked him. The few times someone else was there, I asked if they were there for him -- most were just newbies wandering around QHills -- and if so, I watched them take him down, wrote down the time, and logged back off with a friendly smile.<br>
