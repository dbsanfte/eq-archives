<br>
Back (way back come to think of it) when I used to play War2, there was a place called case's ladder (the name changed to IGL) where there was a ranking system of War2 players.  When I first found Case's, the situation was that there was a person at the top of the ladder (#1) who basically never accepted a challenge from the second ranked person.  Without getting into the rules of the ladder at the time, it was completely within the rules to decline challenges, yet to continually do so was to remove ANY chance whatsoever of the top ranked person losing his spot even if he didn't win a single game against anyone.<br>
<br>
What I observed is that this person eventually after a very long time stepped down from #1 due to much vocal condemnation of what he was doing and after a few shuffles in rank a new person came to be #1.  This person, as far as I can remember, made every attempt to play #2 (thus putting his position on the line) at least once a week.  This person allowed the challenger to have an equal say in the map and resource selection, most times the match was made into a 2 out of 3.  None of this was required by the rules, but was done in the spirit of fair play and good sportsmanship.  This person didn't stay #1 forever, but those that took the #1 mantle afterwards did a pretty good job of going above and beyond the rules to make their little world a better place.<br>
<br>
Second story is with Ultima Online.  When UO first came out, there was a big clamor about PKs.  UO was a lot more PVP-oriented than EQ is, and PKs played a huge role on most servers.  On the server I happened to play on, Sonoma, things weren't a whole lot different with packs of PKs as well as individuals running around terrorizing the non-PKs.  What I observed here is that a handful of people started fighting back.  They started taking the fight to the PKs, hunting them, chasing them down, tracking them.  This handful of people grew in size and power until I there was a time when PKs were VERY hard to find on that server.  These people that fought back changed the face of the server from a PK haven to a friendly atmosphere.<br>
<br>
The moral of the stories is that in many multiplayer video games the rules plain suck.  In MMORPGs especially, it is up to the players in the community to create the environment they play in.   It may very well be that every single EQ server is in the state that ours is in or worse.  That does NOT, in any way, mean that that is how it MUST be.  The high level community has the power to take this server and create the environment they want. <br>
<br>
Now to be more specific.  Because they are such a dominant force on the server, IV has the most (if not all) power to dictate the course of the server.  It may well be that all of IV WANTS the server to be like every other EQ server out there.  If so, while I disagree with it, I accept that they choose it to be so.  What I do not believe is acceptable, however, is to say that IV does not want this server to be like others, but that it HAS to be that way.  I believe that IV has the power to make this server different from others if they so desire.  <br>
<br>
IV and to a lesser extent the rest of the guilds are what will determine the future of this server.  What happens on other servers, or what rules VI implements,  are a lot less important than what the actual players do.  Before the PnP was a policy a lot of people still played nice.  In fact if IV has a policy of giving other guilds one shot that goes above what is required by the rules in many cases.  <br>
<br>
All I'm saying is that it's a cop out to say this environment sucks but that's how it has to be.  It doesn't have to be this way.  Of course if this IS how you want it to be then what I'm saying here doesn't apply to you.  So the question becomes, is the current situation on Vaz and it's likely future what everybody wants it to be? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uroggelmustaffafez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roggel MustaffaFez</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://members.tripod.co.uk/redhotant/icons/iconoc03.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 3:09:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.austinpowers.com/EVIL/img/die_2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lemmings and Leaders</span><hr size=1> no, of course not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urhyustreetfighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhyu Streetfighter</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 4:00:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lemmings and Leaders</span><hr size=1> The opinion of those without power does not matter.<br>

The strongest guilds will have the people who can play 24/7, period.  Nothing you can do about that.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have fun in EQ without a guild.  PO was a great guild but even in a laid back guild like PO, it was too much time from whats real for me.<br>
<br>
A miller lite, some dance music, a date.  Wouldn't trade it for the world.<br>

Let them have the uber mobs.  If you don't like the way the server is, join them or help the other guilds compete. <p>Herder

Um. So since I've only been playing for a few months, my opinion doesn't matter in the least? Sure, I don't have any clue as to how to kill Cazic Thule, Yelinak, Wuoshi, whatever. How does that relate to my opinion on other subjects?<br>
<br>
Maybe the opinions of newbies like myself doesn't matter to you, or the rest of IV, or Agony, or Sacred Fires, or any of the other uber guilds.<br>

But it matters to me, and I hope that it matters to other lower level players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urhyustreetfighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhyu Streetfighter</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 4:17:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lemmings and Leaders</span><hr size=1> What I said was in reguards to the question that was asked.

You enjoy making paradoxical statements often?  You cannot say you 'always read posts by guildleaders and ignore posts by Pmsly (sic)' while claiming that it was only 'in reguards (sic) to the question that was asked'.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Always</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> only in this thread</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are self-contradictory and no guild leaders nor I had yet posted here.<br>
