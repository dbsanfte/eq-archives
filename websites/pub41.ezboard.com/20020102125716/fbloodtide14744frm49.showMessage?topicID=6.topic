Damage, rogues do damage out the wazoo. No class can outdamage a rogue over time. Sure some casters can nuke for more damage in a short timespan (until mana is gone), and others can do wacky things to a mob like snare, slow, blah, blah, but nothing kills it like a rogue. Rogues by far outdamage all other melee classes 50+ (especially 55+). They have the same weapon skills as a warrior, but instead of kicking every 4-6 seconds for like 30 damage, we backstab every 4-6 damage for 100-500 damage. I parse my logs regularly, and now that I have a ragebringer, I see damage per second levels of 40-80 (spikes over 100 rarely) on mobs in fairly high level zones like seb, and howling stones. Thats 2400-4800 damage per minute, and I'm only level 52 (no double backstab yet)  . Rogue melee skills pretty much all max at the same levels as a warrior, pretty much 250 across the board. <br>
<br>
2. Rogues get insta-invis vs. both living and undead. You all know this by now. We are great at CR in many situations, but sometimes mobs have an innate ability to see us (either they cast see invis on themselves, or they just see us because the programmers wanted them to). In these cases a monk (sk/necro) is probably better suited for the deed. Rogue invis does not work through zones, but I find that I can always sneak/hide fast enough upon entering a new zone to avoid any mobs right at the zone from aggroing in on me. I remember zoning into a train in Lguk when I went down to get my mask of deception at level 17 or so, and not getting tagged by any of the frogs. I have often zoned into trains, and never once have I been aggroed. Its a very handy skill. When I solo I can go off and leave my char sitting on the ground in DL indefinately to regen hp while I go wash dishes or something.<br>
<br>
3. Rogues can pick locks, detect traps, and disarm said traps. This used to suck, and nobody every used the skills, but with the addition of Kunark and Velious, rogues are now necessary to advance to many areas of high-end dungeons. Bards can pick locks as well, but their skill caps at 75 I believe. Most high level locks require 201+ skill which only a rogue can achieve. <br>
<br>
4. Rogues can pick pockets. This isn't all that great, but its fun to use on occasion. We can steal any non-magical items and cash from any living mob under level 48. Can't steal from undead, and can't steal magic items. I've stolen heads (stole head off an ogre in BB once), runes, words, gems (yes, we can steal even high-end gems like diamonds if we were insanely lucky, Ive never stolen anything bigger than a ruby or so). I do NOT steal while grouped unless I am the master looter, and even then only to practice my skill if I am bored. This is a useful skill if you are travelling, one can run by a mob and pick it while you keep going. Sand Giants and Hill Giants work especially well  .<br>
<br>
5. Rogues can make poison. This is a situationally useful skill. We can replecate almost any utility spell effect through the right poison. Its a difficult skill to master, but very useful to one who takes the time to do so. Rogue poisons can DoT, snare, root, debuff, drain mana, slow, stun, and DD mobs ( I might have forgotten some effects). This skill is expensive and difficult to train to high levels. My own skill is only around 75, and I have not used it much at all recently. I intend to get back into it and train it higher one of these days. <br>
<br>
6. Rogues can fear mobs with the instill doubt skill, which they share with monks. Once you max your skill in this skill, it is actually fairly useful. I have a 30-50% success rate using ID on blue mobs, and it is the sole reason I am able to solo for xp. (yes rogues can solo). Very good skill when solo, and only rarely useful in groups. Can save a group if they need to make a run for a zone, fear the critter and everyone run away. Caster fear is FAR more reliable.<br>
<br>
7. Rogues get critical hits and deadly strikes with thrown weapons. Not very useful at all, but it can be impressive when I reel of a deadly strike for 200+ damage with a throwing boulder. Just for show mainly. Not many throwing weapons with sufficient range for my tastes. <br>
<br>
8. A skilled rogue can single pull mobs using sneak to manage aggro. The sneak skill significantly lowers the aggro radius of a player, and careful use can lead to single pulling mobs even from large groups. I personally have pulled one frog out of a group of 4-5 in seb using nothing other than sneak. This is very difficult to do however, and I'm not personally good enough at it yet to do it regularly. Something I need to re-learn after my long hiatus.<br>
