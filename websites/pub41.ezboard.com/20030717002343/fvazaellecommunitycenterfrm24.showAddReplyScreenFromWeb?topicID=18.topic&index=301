Plus, I did not say CC killed Dozekar out of spite, I re-iterated what I saw Nehvar say, that if CC did Dozekar, it would be to deny Blight the quest pieces. In a similar fashion, once CC felt they had all the equipment from the Warders they needed, they released the Sleeper. This limits the available sources of primal weapons to MotG, Prog and FA, which do not consistently drop weapons.<br>
<br>
So indulge me a little bit of your time while I play “conspiracy theorist” and possibly entertain you some at the same time. <br>
<br>
To the best of my knowledge, CC had not displayed an interest in Dozekar since the only drops from him are the quest components and occasional spells. The spells can be gained killing other similar-level spawns and the quest components require alignment with CoV-faction, which would have contradicted CC’s alignment with Kael faction for armor farming in the hub and West Wing and later equipment farming in NToV.<br>
<br>
Enter Blight. Blight leadership chooses to align with CoV-faction. Blight mobilizes quickly to ensure Blight wins the contest for each Dozekar spawn (subject to having sufficient numbers and key classes online). Blight members complete the quests and obtain some very nice items. Maybe this drew the attention of CC members, but not the leadership since doing the quests would mean a substantial amount of time to gain CoV faction. And according to Seraa, Ssra Temple is Baldrik’s favorite zone. (I believe her words spoken as Blight prepared for a THO raid were something like, “if you really wanted to make Baldrik cry like a little baby, just clear Ssra Temple before CC”.) <br>
<br>
For the moment, let’s assume there is a thread on CC’s guild-only board debating doing Dozekar quests. I would theorize that it was the rank-and-file members that wanted to do the quests while Baldrik repeatedly said no… until Blight proved its capabilities by killing Tormax, then the Idol and Aary. Then, Blight took the AoW real low on only it’s second attempt, about comparable to CC’s efforts with better equipment and more prior experience attempting the AoW. Suddenly, Baldrik saw spawns that he may have considered uncontested, become contested.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  That was merely one of the several possible reasons I listed that we were going after Doze, because I didn't know exactly what made our officers finally give in to the requests to do so...but Zlet wanted to know~ Way to take that out of context though. – Nehvar<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The fact that you listed it means it was a potential consideration/private justification for a decision to act. As well, you stated it in a forum you probably thought was only close acquaintances before CC killed Dozekar. Listening in quietly as I was, I would not expect to hear 'spin-doctored' versions among friends.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  For his reasons about leaving us was caused of frustration we have had with the guild, thankfully thats settled now and we're back on track. – Milvas<br>
<br>
Even if you guys would surpass us there would still be very few mobs that you can kill that would upgrade vells equipment (I imagine dozekar being the one). – Milvas<br>
<br>
Wow Miriandar, you sure figured me out there. I joined Blight to use DKP to my advantage so I could whore Boots of the Vindicator and Willsappers. You're so fucking smart. – Vell <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So, what were Vell’s frustrations within CC? Could it have been that Vell strongly advocated doing Dozekar so that he could obtain the quest pieces and was frustrated with the leadership of CC not acquiescing? After Vell deguilded from CC, why did he choose to seek membership with Blight? Why not join PO since they are a capable high-level raiding guild?  Or, could it be that Blight was known to be actively pursuing Dozekar successfully? Finally, why did Vell deguild from Blight within 24 hours of CC killing Dozekar? Was it REALLY because he missed Zamtin who he could have easily chatted with in tells or in a player-made chat channel or because he felt he could now acquire the ToV quest pieces by crawling back to CC with his tail between his legs?<br>
<br>
Coincidences. Possibly.<br>
<br>
To recapitulate, by deciding to engage Dozekar, CC leadership:<br>
<br>
1) Quelled any potential calls from guildmembers to do the ToV quests.<br>
<br>
2) Denied Blight quest pieces that could be immediately used to complete ToV quests (once the appropriate quest-giver was spawned).<br>
<br>
3) Aggrevated the heck out of Blight leadership and some members (only going by the number of posts this thread has drawn).<br>
<br>
Points 2 and 3 could probably be sufficient justification for a guild to kill a MOB of interest when the two guilds are competitors. But if there was disharmony in the CC guild over doing Dozekar, those become added benefits that can be easily glossed over by the first point.<br>
<br>
And finally, stray thoughts…. Grats Ayiar on your purchased SoD from either Jetx or Oxox. I assumed you received your SoD from CC since it's the only guild on the server with any major number of them due to the absence of the Warders.<br>

So much to address on your well writen post. Here goes:<br>
<br>
1. Faction is a non issue with CC. If you get a drop you want, you plow the faction afterwards. I'm on dorf faction because Im too lazy to buy velium bars with a twink. Some are on CoV, some are giant, and the vast majority of the guild is hated by every faction on the planet and the moon.<br>
<br>
2. Dozekar has always been deprioritized because there are just too many things we want elsewhere. Going into NToV where you can kill 10+ easy dragons with 2-4 nice drops each was a better use of our time then slowly farming alot of tears so a very few could get some very nice items. 20-40 drops are better for a guild then a very few. But lately, as someone mentioned, we are handing a good percentage of our ntov loot out to guests. Since the quest items from Dozekar represent a nice upgrade for anyone, and since the people are /telling and posting for dozekar raids it just seemed like the time. Another huge factor is boredom. There is a ungodly amount of kvetching about doing ntov because we've done it 50 times before. Dozekar seemed to me a nice way to simply enjoy something new. I think when I look back on my EQ career, it won't be to think, &quot;It was great plowing ntov 100 times&quot;. I really want to say, &quot;I've killed pretty much everything that spawned&quot;. I've actually had these thoughts for a while, but Dozekar has been spawning on PO/Blight time and is dead everytime I've asked that he be checked..<br>
<br>
3. I'd ask that you refrain from putting Seraa in a position where she may feel she has to defend words that I'm guessing she spoke jokingly. I'm fairly certain that when Baldrik crys it is with huge, manly, wracking sobs and not at all like a baby. I, however, cry like a baby.<br>
<br>
4. There is no need to assume about the existence of the CC board Dozekar thread. Trypt is a member of Blight and a former member of CC. He started a thread asking that we gank Dozekar and that thread, and others like it, is still lively. <br>
<br>
5. I am frankly extrmely impressed with how well you did on the AoW. But IV was always known for their tank switching ability (among other qualities) and it continues to serve you well.<br>
<br>
6. Vell's motives for leaving CC, joining Blight and leaving Blight are his own. You can ask him, but I would caution him  not answer unless he wants a screenshot of that conversation to appear here.<br>
<br>
7. The disharmony in CC wasn't anything specific I think. This is pure specualtion and I think Baldrik has much more of a feel for the mood of the guild then I do. But I'll answer as best I can. <br>
<br>
I think part of it was that so many had NToV or better items in every slot and were losing some motivation to raid. I think part of it was that hardcore EQ takes its toll over time and people wanted breaks, wanted to retire, wanted more time for the real lives etc. Once a few leave, more follow and watching that slide can be hard on peoples mood. I think the pressures of raiding with a guild that has membership from Europe, to US, to Asia takes it toll on peoples sleep schedules. For a very few, I think they were impatient with watching the newest members bring up their raiding abilities to those that had retired. Others felt that the huge time sinks to get into places like Vex Thal made Luclin bad, and with Velious boredom they lost some motivation. I think many burned out a bit by raiding all day, then exping all night to bolster their AAXP abilities. <br>
<br>
What turned this all around? Some people came back from breaks. The new members quickly became skilled at raiding CC style. We had sufficent numbers to test out skills on newer and harder encounters. Verant changed some content in Luclin. Just in general, the mood of the guild improved.<br>
<br>
8. There is a funny sentence in which you stated, &quot;actively pursuing Dozekar successfully&quot;. Personally, I would reserve that phrase for something like AoW or Vulak or the Burrower. To let the secret out of the bag, Dozekar is silly easy. He isnt 'persued successfully' so much as he is rapidly splatted whenever he spawns.<br>
<br>
To answer your final summary.<br>
<br>
1. I, me, Finelen, made the call the previous day to kill Dozekar but he wasn't up. I have listed my reasons why. They are a fact. Do not doubt them. Do not dispute them. The call to kill him the following day was made before I woke up (thanks 9 hour time difference between me and the majority of the guild) but everyone was very aware and eager for that encoutner.<br>
<br>
2. I now prefer to think of Blight as preventing CC from completing some nice quests from some nice tears we have. =)  As Xarr has already pointed out, compettiion is competition. We will both get all the items we could ever want from the Halls of Testing. Just a bit slower for both of us. Or the many of us. PO? EA? FU?<br>
<br>
3. It ~seemed~ like Blight leadership was aggraveted because they had a false impression of our motivation. Aggravation that comes from simply losing a contested spawn is something we all live with everyday. <br>
<br>
Oh, one last point. Verant has stated they will really never make another zone like Sleepers Tomb because removing content from a game just pisses off too many people. CC agonized over the decision to kill the 4th warder. In the end, we felt that denying ourselves the experience of releasing the sleeper was really the same as denying everyone else the possiblilty of some day fighting the warders. He was an exceptionally difficult mob to kill but frankly he was MADE to be killed. So we did. We never wanted to deny anyone esle a sod, we just wanted to see the sleeper script. Verant is well aware of the fact that people don't like that. On a bright note, hategiver and a few other items are very very good at holding taunt as well. The sod is great, but there other things.<br>
<br>
How Ayiar got his sod is his business. You can ask him, but I would caution him not to respond unless he wants to see a screenshot of his conversation on this board.<br>
<br>
Other then the enjoyable time you can spend contemplating conspircay theories, if you ever really just want to know, ask me. I can be a bit busy at times, but I try to be polite to everyone and I'll try to answer anything youd like to know.<br>
