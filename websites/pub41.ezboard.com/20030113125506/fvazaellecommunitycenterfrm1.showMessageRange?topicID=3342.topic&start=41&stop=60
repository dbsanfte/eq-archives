<br>
In no particular order:<br>
<br>
1. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Wasteland</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Game that to me helped define what an RPG should be like and that they can be even better without dorfs and dragons.  It's only because Wasteland is on this list that Fallout is not.<br>
<br>
2. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sid Meier's Civilization II</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Though the first in the series was certainly more influential, I think in the second iteration it was tweaked perfectly.  The most replayable game ever.  Also of note from Sid: Alpha Centauri, Gettysburg, Railroad Tycoon and one to be mentioned below.<br>
<br>
3. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Wing Commander: Privateer</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No one has yet to replicate Chris Roberts' ability to meld storytelling, space simulation and consequence-based, open-ended plots.  Though there is no game in the series which I don't think was excellent (Privateer II wasn't technically a Wing Commander game, thank gawd), Privateer's open-ended nature I don't think has been replicated in any game since.  As much as I like Earth &amp; Beyond, Privateer was a better game.  Obviously, I'm still angry and at Micro$oft for pulling the plug on Freelancer.<br>
<br>
4. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pirates!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I played this on a Commodore 64.  I played this on a PC.  I played it on a Nintendo.  I have C-64 and Nintendo emulators on my computer just so I can still play it.  Infinite replay, minimal plot.  Along with Privateer this is the best, &quot;here's your world--now live in it,&quot; game ever produced.  Pirate and non-single-engagement-based sailing sims still haven't returned to the bar set by this game.  Also has the most playably streamlined yet strategic sailing engine I've seen.<br>
<br>
5. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Doom</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Though I'm not a big RTS-player myself, I was amazed by this game when it came out, and, of course, the RTS and Shareware revolutions really started here.  A great game.  Period.<br>

<br>
1. Space Quest 3.  It was the one that really got me into the series.  Had humor and was a blast to play all the way through.<br>
<br>
2. Jet Grind Radio.  Was something new and innovative, I really appreciated that Sega was doing something different with the market other than just make flashier eye candy.  Was a blast to play unlike many games I am finding today.<br>
<br>
3.  Bubble Bobble.  They have an older arcade games section at the university I went to a little while back.  I played this often between classes.<br>
<br>
4.  Alex Kid.  I got into gaming on this one and I remember it being a lot of fun to play.  Too bad I don't have my master system anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5. Mario Bros.  You have to have respect for a game that has brought as much to the market as mario has.<br>
<br>
I also enjoyed most of the final fantasy series, mind you I have only played up to 7.  The rest of the series hasn't brought much interest to me.  I watched a friend play 10 and all it seemed like was you sit and watch a semi movie. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usilvirthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvir the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1015<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/8/02 10:27:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3342.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> timeless games:<br>

<br>
Fort Apocalypse (Atari 800) - the most fun helicopter/flying shooter game I've ever played.<br>
<br>
Archon and Archon II (Atari 800) - Both of these games were some of Electronic Arts finest work of all time. Archon (the first one) settled many arguments between me and my brother.<br>
<br>
Secret of Monkey Island (PC) - To this day I don't think I've laughed as hard at a computer game as I did when I spent an hour trying to steal the shovel in this game. If you played this, you should know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
Fallout 1 &amp; 2 (PC) - These games have infinite replay value for me. The humor, the pop culture references, the reactions of the npcs, the ability to target people's groins and eyes for hand-to-hand strikes....the fun never stops.<br>
<br>
Civilization: Call To Power (PC) - I just like this one a lot better than Civ 2, or even Civ 3....<br>
<br>
Chrono Trigger (SNES) - When I bought this game on summer break from college, I think I got about 4 hours of sleep per night for 3 solid weeks trying to get every possible ending cinema.<br>

<br>
1.  Hands down final fantasy VII.  I replayed that game so many times, I knew pretty much every little corner of the game.  Death of aeris = first time in a game where you get an emotional shock.  CG cinema's really help with those poignant moments such as her death.  The weapons are to this day my favorite optional bosses, just because they were truly a challenge.  <br>
<br>
2.  Xenogears.  This game rules, nothing else need be said.<br>
<br>
3.  I think it was final fantasy IV, not sure, the one with cecil the dark knight.  I got hooked on finding all the hidden items in that game, i actually kept it 20 days late from a library back when I was like 13.  I kept tryin to get that elusive pink puff tail, never did though.  Plus, its still a game I have np playing today.<br>
<br>
4.  I dont know how many of you are familiar with this game, though maybe somebody is, I didnt read this whole thread, so have no clue.  The game was for the Sega Saturn, called Dragon Force.  It is a highly addictive game, where you have generals who face off against enemy generals one on one on a 3d field of battle.  That may not seem like much, but the generals can have up to 100 soldiers each, and each soldier is there for you to see, and even count.  Each general sends all their soldiers at each other, and you can give general commands, and then watch them go.  The final boss in that game rules to.<br>
<br>
5.  Last, but not least, I would have to rank the Lunar games here, both part one and two.  They have humor, funny anime cinema's, and are just fun.  I own both versions of both Lunar's, the ones on the sega cd, and the ones on the playstation.  If I ever get my sega cd fixxed, I think I would enjoy the originals more than the playstation version, but the playstation versions are still as good as they come. <p><br>
