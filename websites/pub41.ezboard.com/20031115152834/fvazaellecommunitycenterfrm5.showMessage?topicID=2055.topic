A looong time.  The kind of time that means you aren't there for the glory or the lewtz, but because you care about the people and the guild culture and an actual pride in the tag.  People don't belong to OoA for the power and glory (pfft) but more to have some fun, raid some, help each other, tradeskill, and enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
Over my stay in the Order, I have seen a lot of people come and a lot of people go.  When I joined up I think I was level 24 or something (anyone who knows how slowly I level knows that is quite a while ago indeed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    )  It has not been uncommon for this player or that to level beyond the membership and be unchallenged, and seek other guilds to further advance their play to areas we could not support at the time.<br>
<br>
Various people have done so with varying degrees of grace.  I for one am happy to see some of our former members in various guilds up to and including CC.  Some of them went to the FV roleplay server.  But generally, people don't tend to leave hating us.  We're pretty innocuous, it's hard to hate a low-key group like us.  It has been a source of concern to us in the fact that we did actually want to do some more challenging content eventually, and whenever someone would get good and levelled they moved on.  This open wound sapped our ability to move forward for quite some time.  We tried actively recruiting higher level players, but it is my experience that if someone joins your guild because you talked them into it, they have very little reason to stay, and time and again, stay they didn't.  I'd be fine with it if we never recruited anyone ever.  The people who stay, find you.<br>
<br>
Over time, the average level of our membership rose, people were in their 40s, their 50s, and now a few of our members are 60 or so, not a lot but some.  And ya know, an amazing thing happened, we started doing more stuff!  Not huge stuff, but for us it was a breath of fresh air.  We've been raiding in King Tormax' throneroom.  We've been to HoT.  We are raiding in CT to get some Tae Ew stuff.  We've been to Ssra basement and liked it a lot.  And no, we aren't in Vex Thal or Drunder Fortress of Zek or places like that, and that's because we aren't ready, and we know it.  Flagging/keying requirements aside, it is foolish and a disservice to the membership to take raids to places where you will not stand a chance.  No one loves a good wipe more than I do, I think they are a hoot.  But no one goes somewhere new just to wipe.  They go to wipe, maybe repeatedly because there is a chance that enough learning will happen and they will succeed.  Only a fool goes places where there is no chance.<br>
<br>
So yeah, people come and go, people are recruited, and leave, people join expecting their epics to be handed to them and storm out, people have personal differences and slam the door.  We have seen it all, if not all, certainly most.  No one is chained down, anyone wants to leave can do so<br>
<br>
but don't shit on us to make yourself look good.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yes,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Order is not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all that,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> do you think that after 2 and a half years we haven't figured it out?  Do you think if it mattered we might just try and do something about it?  Gasp, we have recently!  Woops, you didn't notice?  Where the FUCK were you? AFfuckingK?<br>
<br>
The guild you are applying to is a good guild, and some of the best people who used to be in the Order are there now, but none of them tried to belittle us to pad their app, you insufferable little cunt!<br>
<br>
&quot;Tired of Kael Arena?&quot;  When the FUCK did we raid Kael Arena, months ago?  It's been KT throneroom, plate house for drops, and half a dozen more challenging places recently.  Did we not take your sorry behind to the Dreadful Plane of Frightening Desolateness?  Maybe that was because none of us are flagged for it yet, you spiteful bitch!  Oh yeah, we did do Arena once recently...Tuvan led an attempt against Vindi.  Did we wipe, yes!  Did we try?  Hell yes!  How many guilds kill him on the first attempt, wonder child?<br>
<br>
Why the hell am I sitting at my desk every Monday and Tuesday morning half asleep because of raids I lead to try to make the Order better equipped and better trained and skilled raiders, is it to help people to see and do more, or is it to give people the boost they need to ditch us like a cheap ho in an alley?<br>
<br>
That raidleader you don't like so much is level 65 and a great raidleader.  She is putting in a lot of time raiding in places <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>she gets no experience in</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and needs no gear from so she can help OoA go places!  If you had half a brain you would get behind her efforts and help push!<br>
<br>
Well looking at the level requirements of your target guild I see why you bought that 63 Pally on EBay, the one that wears the BotB title you didn't earn.  You have embittered our guildchat with your grit and gripes for the last time.  The uncomfortable mix of your real life romances and the stress they create in the game has stirred up its last stink.  As for the Order, it will go on with or without you, me, or anyone.  No one is irreplaceable.  Hope you enjoy being a_rampage_tank_05 with your shiny new purchase. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anikacrystalwind>Anika Crystalwind</A> at: 5/7/03 9:09:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prybutok@vazaellecommunitycenter>Prybutok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1855<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/7/03 3:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2055.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://prybutok.homestead.com/files/djprymini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On the Burning of Bridges</span><hr size=1> wow. one of the better fucking rants this board has seen in awhile and you put it in the section.<br>

She was my first character, my first guild, my first real group of *friends* in EverQuest.<br>
<br>
I loved it.  The Order wasn't a big guild, but I wasn't a big player - we roleplayed, we chatted, we held scavenger hunts, we had fist fights in the arena.  Plenty of people left: to other servers, other guilds, a few quit EQ altogether, and for the most part, there seemed to be no hard feelings.  I saw leaders and officers come and go, I saw &quot;vital&quot; members move on to bigger things.  Yet in spite of the losses, the Order's average level rose gradually.  And over time, the focus shifted from roleplaying to raiding.<br>
<br>
Cut to the present... our raid leader is 65, our MA is 63 / 61, most of our members are in their high 50s.  And just about every Monday night for the past several months, we've been doing Kael.  Sometimes the Arena, sometimes the plate house, sometimes trying to pull King Tormax's room.  Sometimes the raids have gone well, sometimes we've wiped... but as an officer, I ventured the opinion that for 90% of our regular raiders, Kael drops were no longer an upgrade.  And the other officers agreed with me.  But there we were, week after week, watching twinks and lower levels from other Alliance guilds roll on what few drops there were.  And yes, I got sick of it.<br>
<br>
I said I was sick of it in officer chat, and the officers agreed with me.  Our own guild leader said that if he never set foot in Kael again until we were ready for Vindi, he'd be happy.  So, yes, on my application to Fantasy, I said that I was sick of doing Kael.  The Order does other raids, but Kael is still at least 50% of what we do, and it's not even *useful*.  If we were grinding out HoT to get everyone geared up, I'd obediently run that treadmill until it was done, and I wouldn't complain.  But going to the same place every week and shouting at the same people for doing the same things wrong is not my idea of fun.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't understand what your problem is, Sauria.  I did my best to leave the Order on good terms with everyone except the one person I just couldn't get along with.  I didn't like the way she disrespected guild members, and I said so.  Being level 65 doesn't mean you can insult others for dreaming about Xegony loot, or call them clueless because they mentioned the name of Fennin Ro.  So, I logged Thorokin on, said goodbye to those who were online, and deguilded.  No accusatory farewell posts in the member's section of the guild message boards, no attempts to stir up drama or provoke others into leaving... I was in an unpleasant situation, I removed myself from it, end of story as far as I'm concerned.<br>
<br>
As for Steamy... you're right, I'm not the original owner of the account.  But I didn't buy him to be uber, Sauria... I bought him to help the guild.  Do you know how many groups I've taken into the PoI factory for the best pre-PoV exp that *didn't* contain at least one guild member?<br>
<br>
Nada.  Rien.  None.  The last group I took in there was five people from the Order and one pickup enchanter.  I *always* chose people from the guild if they were online, to help them level.  They appreciated it, I enjoyed being with guildies, and that's something I couldn't have done with Thorokin the way she is now.<br>
<br>
I've never denied Steamy's origins - if someone asks me directly, I tell them.  I spent a week reading everything I could find about paladins before I even played him, and I think I play him well now - ask my groups in PoV or BoT, or even the people I take into the factory in PoI.  I've gotten him one level and seven AA points since I bought him, and I have 61 levels of tanking with Thorokin to draw on for knowledge of the game.  eBay?  Yes.  Clueless?  No.<br>
<br>
I'm not quite sure what you hoped to accomplish by coming here and posting this, Sauria... if you were just looking to get a load of bile out of your system, well, I hope you feel better now.  I did my best to leave on good terms... and I wish you had cared enough to do the same.<br>

Great morning already.<br>
<br>
As the Leader of OoA for 15 months nowI feel it is my job to respond to this, but I am fucking pissed off at this moment over the whole situation.<br>
<br>
Sauria, this does not belong here.  OoA does NOT do this.  We do not bring guild business into the open for all to see.  I've had plenty of opportunites in the past, and have refrained on every occasion.  We do not engage in OoC battles with other guilds when on raids either.  <br>
<br>
For the record, OoA is doing three or four raids a week.  One of them has been running a Kael raid for the Alliance that has indeed grown into a faction fest and twink fest.  It has grown to the point of being unmanagable.  It is also NOT going to be an every week thing from now on, you knew this Thoro.  I had thought you, as an officer, were going to help impliment the movement upwards that I said I wanted in the last officers meeting we had.<br>
<br>
One of the things I value most in guildmates is loyalty.  I have put aside my own development as a character for the guild for a long time.  Waiting for them to get the levels and gear to take the next step.  Waiting for the right people to come down the pike.  People who are more interested in raiding for a challenge than loots.  Almost anyone can join one of the Upstart_60+_Raiding guilds that form every week and get phat lewt.  Not everyone has the patience it takes to help a growing guild full of members busting their ass to improve themselves to grow.  I was hoping that there were more people like me in the guild.  <br>
<br>
We are on the verge of doing HoT and Ssra named.  I was hoping that once we started posting Rhag kills and HoT raids on the page that more people would look at us and say &quot;Hey...I'm at that level&quot; and take a second look at us.  Maybe someone who was tired of being Warrior_012 or Rampage_Tank_033, and wanted to test their hand at being the MA for a guild of people who try their best, and achieve more with less.<br>
<br>
I must take this situation on my shoulders.  It is yet another failing as leader.  Maybe that list is too long for me to continue, maybe my failures as Leader will lead to my retirement from EQ.  I don't know that yet.  All I know is that I want The Order of Antondwer to succeed, and continue to grow as it has in the past.<br>
<br>
Anyway....WTB a MA!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Tuvan/fullsize/Tuvanq.jpg><BR><a target="new" href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53973>Veteran Tuvan</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=boppyboppmaster>boppyboppmaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 493<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/7/03 10:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2055.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: =)</span><hr size=1> I thought all warriors were deleted when Pop came out Merr? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aurianne>Aurianne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mana Whore</span><br>  Posts: 1597<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/7/03 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2055.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: =)</span><hr size=1> It was level 22, lizardbreath.

It takes a lot to get Sauria angry. A *lot*.

How do you think uber guilds became uber?  They didnt just all log in form a guild and start being uber, I think anyone in any of vaz's &quot;uber&quot; guilds can attest to the work theyve done to advance themselves and their guild.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but im fairly certain my guild has done just as much work to advance, we just advance forward as opposed to not at all.<br>

There seems to be two different versions on HOW Thorokin chose to leave OoA.

<br>
Thanks for the Magelo background praise - rendering landscapes is something of a hobby of mine.  I use a program called Terragen, which I'm entirely too lazy to link.  Dead easy to use, just takes a bit of practice to get what you want.  The cliff in Thorokin's sig was rendered in Terragen too.<br>
<br>
As for the guild I applied to when I left the Order... I chose Fantasy because I have a couple of very good friends there.  If I hadn't known people in Fantasy, I would have looked into joining another guild I know people in, such as Celestial Navigators or Order of the Open Hand.  So... sorry, Sauria, this isn't about me wanting teh phat lewtz, this is about me wanting to be with friends, because there was one single person in the Order who made me not want to be there anymore.<br>
