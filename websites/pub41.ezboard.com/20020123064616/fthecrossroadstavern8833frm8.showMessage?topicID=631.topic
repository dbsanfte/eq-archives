I had no idea that SoF had killed him earlier (Grats Donals legs, hope they went to someone who actually needed them in the guild) ... nor if he'd be up or not.<br>
<br>
Sure enuf he was.  So i should "Camp Check please". Cappy, moats, 1 court yard.  I wait a min, and shout "VSR Forming at Zoneline".  I wait a min, no answer.  So i do a /who to get a list of everyone in zone when I shouted it (log is always on).  I then go out to my guild and get 3 groups in about 5 minutes.  They're in zone and 100% buffed.  Twice i yell out "VSR buffing at zone line, moving in 5" and then "VSR moving through LCY in 1 min". <br>
<br>
All of a sudden, i get told VSR was camped.  Now, how did that happen.  No force moved passed us... and there was only 1 high level group in zone, in the basement.  So we move anyway.  We get there, and there are 4 people sitting infront of the Spirit.  One of them is level 49, the other level 55 (the druid), the other 2 con blue at 52 but are anon.  Then there's a 60 epic Warrior off to the side that's with them.<br>
<br>
We ask if they're going, and they say not yet, they are waiting for people.  So we say that we've got the force ready, so we're gonna take VSR.  They tell us they're there first and FCFS but we can have the 2nd stone they dont need (Very nice, by the way).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, we have 2 people who got Reavers in COM the night before, so we need em both.  And we're ready.  We start talking about FCFS and what it means (actually ABLE to claim/take the spawn vs hoping you get enuf soon).  About 10 minutes go by.  THen we decide as a guild to give them 10 minutes then engage.<br>
<br>
After about 5 more minutes, they do get a 2nd group in (which in theory is more than enuf for VSR, we did it with a 55 rogue tanking ;p) and tell them it's theirs.  They still offer the 2nd stone to us if we help, so we do.  60 seconds later, we got the exp and i got the stone, then they got the 2nd one.<br>
<br>
Obviously, this worked out somewhat.  I got my stone, tho the other druid in guild didnt.  We didnt "bully" them or "jack their spawn" .. and they were nice enough (i guess) to offer the 2nd stone rather than looting it to MQ for someone else later.<br>
<br>
The question is, doing the "right" thing aside, or being "nice" aside ... what's the deal.  Should we have just engaged, taken the 2 stones, and wish them luck on the next time?  Should we have just left because they were there first, even though they werent capable of taking the spawn.<br>
<br>
Anyone that knows me knows I'm generous, helpful, and unselfish.  I actually piss off other clerics because I share the gems that drop in Sebilis, rather than keeping them all to "cover my costs" :)  But at this juncture, we had 2 people able to get their Elaborates (and actually the other druid just needed Fayd to get the epic, but let me have the stone cause his monk has fists already) ... it was up, and we were ready.<br>
<br>
So .. what would you do? <p><b>...I chose my own fate. Drove by the fork in the road and went straight!<BR></b><body bgcolor="#000000">

That is the type of generosity not only EQ needs more of, but the world as well.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes people not seeing shouts and OOC's can't be explained.  Some people can assume that the other group intentionally got others there to take the spawn, simply because you wanted it.  However, I know that when I am in the middle of combat or guild chat, or AFK, I miss messages.  It happens to everyone.  <br>
<br>
I guess what I am saying is, that you are correct in you must have the ABILITY to take the spawn, not just hope you can, but if another group is there first, but not quite ready, the right thing to do is give them a chance, a certain amount of time, to get their force there.  If they don't meet that alotted time, then so be it.<br>
<br>
Them sharing the drops with you was a great jesture as well.  Kudos to both groups.<br>

If a group/guild can get a representative group there with the promise of more coming soon then it would be &quot;nice&quot; to give them a set amount of time if you obviously have the people.<br>
<br>
As the small group sitting there I can say &quot;Look, we were here first and we see you definitely have the people to take out this MoB.  Give us 10 minutes, we have the people on the way.&quot;  If you can't get your folks there in 10 minutes then you are out of luck.  Stick to your promise.  I remember this same issue with Trak when we would have 80% of the forces needed with the rest within a few minutes of arrival and another guild is there and ready.  I think it happened twice and both times we were given the right at starting on Trak.  In fact, the guild raid leaders FORCED us to keep quiet and focussed so we could honor our promise to get started fast.  It worked out great and everyone was satisfied at the communication.<br>
<br>
I think you did well.  If there was 1 person sitting there saying &quot;My guild is coming&quot;, then that is no good.  They had a few people there and within 5 minutes more came - that is legitimate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugilgurth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilgurth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Meep!

Once the mob spawned, whoever's turn it was had 24 hours to kill it or it would become open game to anyone who could get there with the necessary forces quick enough.<br>
<br>
The way they set it up for guilds to get in the rotation, they had to KS their way into it or socalled it.  Basically, they would have to assemble a force to kill a mob before the assigned group/guild had theirs together.<br>
<br>
Once that guild/group successfully killed socalled mob this way once, they were in the rotation.  This has worked great for Trak, VS, HoT(TOV), Zlandicar, &amp; Klandicar<br>

There was one person on the main EMarr message board who took the responsibility to keep things up to date &amp; notify the next guild in line. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uknorotpumaslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Knorot Pumaslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Walking Vending Machine</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(11/27/01 11:12:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=631.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.attcanada.ca/~reeder/eqpics/knorot.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FCFS and claiming spawns.</span><hr size=1> Oh I think you are saying the banned &quot;C&quot; word on here, or atleast leading up to it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There is a problem with the FCFS thing.  This story spells it out.  Situations like this don't normally end so well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubrierlea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brierlea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ranger of Tunare</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(11/27/01 1:53:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=631.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FCFS and claiming spawns.</span><hr size=1> I don't mind admitting that we were the guild at VSR when Rexronn and his people came in.  I was worried that it was going to get nasty, but luckily enough, Rexronn and his people were willing to talk this through and come to an equitable arrangement. <br>
<br>
The FCFS issue is still vague though.  Rexronn stated to us at the spawn that this was a FCFS server.  My response was that if that is true, and we are here first, doesn't that mean we had the spawn?  So that is a question that I'd like answered or clarified.  Being there first, or being able to actually engage first?  What defines FCFS?<br>
<br>
And, I think we came upon the spawn of VSR as Rexronn did.  Our druid discovered he was up and moved in to hold the camp.  Then he called the rest of us in.  I was the 2nd or 3rd to get there, as I was the closest to begin with.  So, I was *not* there when Rexronn first called out for any camps.  And, as someone mentioned, our druid must have missed the camp call.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was very happy with how things worked out, and that Rexronn and his people were able to fairly negotiate the outcome.  VS died quickly and painlessly.  Grats to Rexronn and Rulahna on their stones. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG SRC="http://members.home.net/lalanu/Brisignature.jpg">

With the porting ability most guilds have, it shouldnt take more than 15 minutes to get to any point in Norrath.<br>
<br>
That is just my opinion, and if you don't get the peops there within the alotted time, your done, no whining.<br>

I have always held him in the highest regard (even when we were shouting at each other).  Secondly, the FCFS system is set up to force groups into killing mobs quickly so they don't stay up unreasonable amounts of time.  Rex and Co. had every right to set a reasonable time limit.  Brierlea and co made the time limit giving them rights to VSR imho.  Kudos to Brierlea and guild for their handling of this issue as well.  When my brother first /movelogged here one of the first things he mentioned was how nice the people on this server were.  Thanks for living up to that reputation. <p>Spookier Slycause <BR>

In many cases i'm left alone to camp a spawn then when he's up it's time to gather the forces.  So FIRST come first served in my opion means that if your the first to be there then your the first to be served, not if your the first one capable of killing him.  First is first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uxymryk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xymryk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(11/27/01 3:40:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=631.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FCFS and claiming spawns.</span><hr size=1> Rexron I believe the donal's legs went to Haletma. (I hope I didn't just give out top secret info). <br>
<br>
Avaran I would agree that the first one there should have the spawn even if he doesn't have the required force to take it out.  However, there has to be a time limit on what a reasonable wait is to assemble the force is.  <br>
<br>
For example, say we have a level 34 druid in Ice clad quad kiting Cougars and Lozidal comes up.  She's using track at the time and see it first.   Since she's the first one there I think it reasonable that she can claim the spawn even though there is no way on Norath that she could ever kill Lozidal, (Or possibly even damage him).  But she can't reasonably hold the spawn point for an hour waiting to assemble a group.  There is no reason your guild couldn't have two full groups to Ice Clad in fifteen minutes.  <br>
<br>
So basically I would say the definition is the first one there has a fifteen minute grace period to get a group assembled to be first come first served.  After that the first group that can be buffed and assmbled should get the spawn.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cp.<br>

I do believe that it is unfair that someone hold a spawn for hours on end (not saying that this was the case above) in an attempt to prevent others from taking it.  Maybe 15 minutes is not enough, maybe its too much. (I doubt it.)  Personally, I belive that 30 minutes should be the maximum time allowed, and if you can't assemble the force you need by then, it may be time to conduct some mobilization drills <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-----------------------------------------------<BR>

Which would have been &quot;polite&quot;, although there was a /tell given to him at the one minute count down.  I find it awesome that you all kept it somewhat &quot;friendly&quot;.<br>
<br>
15- 30 mins is the time limit for enagement of a mob...  How does that factor in FCFS?  Isnt it Verants policy that if you are buffing your group and another group comes in and takes &quot;your mob&quot;, that is not considered kill stealing.<br>
<br>
Example, last night this warrior in Kael runs up and asks if we can kill Gleed?  Then states that Gleed is up and he wants the mob...Now we have been camping the ledge for about an hour now.  This warrior runs up ahead and tries to take Gleed.  Subsquently, the warrior dies and now needs a rez...Bah..We were medding up, being entertained now, and chatting.  2 pulls later Gleed is dead and this warrior is nowhere  in the zone to be offered the bow and its /OOC'd for the rest of zone to come and get...An unfortunate ending, unlike the above post...(all the way up.) <p><h6><p align="center"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40468>Sssive Omphalonosis</A>  Oracle of the 60th Scale<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40448> Juagher</A> Myrmidon of the 55th Scale<br><h6>
