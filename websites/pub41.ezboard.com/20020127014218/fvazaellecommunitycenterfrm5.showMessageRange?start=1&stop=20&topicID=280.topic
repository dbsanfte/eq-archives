You have now admitted it is neither racist nor sexist.. now please describe in what way it offends you.  In my opinion if you cannot describe such a thing clearly then perhaps you do not know why it offends you.  No set of rules will ever satisfy the restrictions you put on it.  Someone somewhere will be offended by damn near anything.  You have to understand that being offended is what a flame board is about.  If you don't want the slightest chance of a single reader being offended then you must immediately delete every post on the entire board.  Since you have not already done so I must conclude that you have no problem with people being offended provided they do not use racial or sexist or adult language/imagery.  Yet Karburan's post was deleted and no such language was used.<br><br>  You refer us to the rules.. and I once again ask for a clear description of exactly what rule was broken and in what way by which words.  If you can't answer that question then likely no rule was broken. <p>Bammbi, the Ranger with the nice ass.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uniliz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>niliz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 4:18:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i think some people should re-read the rules of the boar</span><hr size=1> To me, Karburan's post was way beyond the limit of tastelessness.

Hence why I made moderators. I don't post a lot because I feel that I shouldn't have to hold people's hand through the posting process. I like my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lissez-faire</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> approach,  but when people cross the line you force us to crack down.<br><br>I expect users of this board to be mature enough to write/post without being overly obscene, tasteless, etc. More than a few people (and not just mods/admins) have taken offence to the posts in question, and that means there is a problem. I would have taken the same action as Sotae if I had seen them. Zozz seemed to agree as well. <br><br>The Rants section is for rants. It does not mean you can post whatever obscene images and language you feel like, and if you feel otherwise than I invite you to try posting like that on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse">The Safehouse</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and see how long you last.<br><br>Like it or not, this board represents the Vazaelle community. When you do a search in Google or Yahoo or AltaVista, this board it at the top of the list. And as the OP/creator of this board, I personally wouldn't want someone to come here and see a bunch of rejects using obscene language and posting hentai and stileproject pics in an effort to look cool. Don't give us some BS about how evil and undemocratic we are for censoring (I hate that word). Any self-respecting board would do the same thing (see above link).<br><br>If you have a problem with our rules, then the solution is easy. Find another board.

Just because a few of the most vocal section of the people who read the board come out and complain abut something doesn't really equate to &quot;most of the people here&quot;.  <br><br>2.  I found Karburan's post offensive.  Why?  Because it was beyond mean spirited.  Espousing and/or advocating violence, rape or physical harm that transcends reasonable for an online video game is going to put your post in jeopardy.  Maybe it isn't expressed in the rules, but just because there is a rant forum doesn't mean that &quot;rants&quot; have no limits.<br><br>3.  There seems to be a propensity for grouping &quot;the mods&quot; into a collective for the purpose of argument.  While this is a useful tool for either edifying or creating a scapegoat, I think the assumption that we are all drones of some message board hive mind is probably a misrepresentation.  In the future, I would advise that your points of contention be more specifically directed.<br><br>Now, here's the truth that you don't want to hear.  I am a mod on this board.  Why?  I dunno.  Plumpkin says it is only to make friends here, but that seems an unlikely argument given the nature of most of the posts regarding &quot;the mods&quot;.  Typically, I let people do whatever they want here because my role has never been expressly defined by Narya outside of what is stated in the rules (which is, do whatever I feel like). For the most part, our posting community tends to maintain some semblance of decorum and police itself as far as those who don't.  I really would prefer it that way.  There has been a lot of leeway given in the past as far as the kinds of things allowed to be said on the Rants forum.  They do not constitute legal precedents.  The verbiage of each new post is not defensible under some grandfather clause because something similar was said previously.  In short, if some moderator feels like removing it, it's removed.  You can argue about it, stomp your feet, call amnesty international...  whatever you want.  If you don't want your posts removed, try not to offend a moderator I guess.  I think you'll find intelligent arguments that are made in good taste rarely the victims of unfair censorship.<br><br>Everyone is not always going to agree on what is best for the board and the community.  And if you feel like this one is way too stringent because Karburan's post was removed...  well, shucks.<br><br>Zozz<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 11:35:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i think some people should re-read the rules of the boar</span><hr size=1> /cheer zozz <p>ProcaxPhantasmistIn VirtueVazaelle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umeiren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meiren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 12:08:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> So...</span><hr size=1> Disclaimer:  Personally I could care less how the moderators run this board, but being a social science major I can never pass up and arguement like this one.  <br><br>That being said.<br><br>Ok...  Sotae, in your opinion, insulting a person is wrong and a post can be editted for it.  But if you insult a race its ok?  This one sort of boggles me.  Tri-negro is an organization, so therefore, it isnt insulting.  And you use Erudites as an example of why those of african heritage should accept this.  Yet, in most posts by those associated with the tri-negro I see ebonics(?) used, often involving slurs against those of Euro descent (expample: kill whitey in one post).  And inherently, Tri-Negro refers to others.  Its an organization involving those of a specific race (negro being the term that indicates this as you so cleverly pointed out).<br><br>Oh and Sotae, walk into downtown anywhere in the US and start calling the people there &quot;negro&quot; and see how far you get my friend =)<br><br>Im still not seeing consistency here.<br><br>It seems to me that Tri-Negro is a popular theme here, that many of your &quot;friends&quot; are involved in.  So you defend its right to be despite the fact that its insulting as hell to a whole cultural group.  But if you get vulgar insulting one person, there goes the edit button.<br><br>By the way, had a friend read your post on how african community should be pround of erudites.  Im afraid I cant type what he had to say about that oh so passive racism you elicited with that one simple statement.  Cause Im positive you would edit it.

If you remove a post for some racist slur, then you have to remove all similiar posts.<br><br>Now lets go back to the point Ahliana brought up.  What about all these ghey comments.  Try to tell me those arent insulting to the gay community.  So shouldnt all comments about the gay community or veiled references to them be removed?
