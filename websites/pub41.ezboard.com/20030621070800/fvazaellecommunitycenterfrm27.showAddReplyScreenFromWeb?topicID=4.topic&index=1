<br>
...a sleeping soul...<br>
<br>
...inhale...<br>
<br>
For three days, Riverdane Wyldechylde sat, unmoving, staring at the ghost of his wife, Camille, laying in the oversized bed of Innoruuk, a soul without a living body, perpetually locked in unnatural slumber...for three days he had received no audience, eaten no food, sipped from no cup....nor did he need to. After the defeat of his father Innoruuk, River had achieved godhood. He, by bastard bloodrite, was the new Prince of Hate.<br>
<br>
Outside the chamber doors, what passed as life in Hate went on. Often there was a quiet knock on his door, but River ignored these. Until today. This knocking was more like pounding, with a frantic urgency to it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in.&quot; River said, eyes not leaving Camille on the bed.<br>
<br>
The door opened, and the voice of one of Hate's Elite, the damned dark elven souls who had served Innoruuk, cut through the once silent chamber.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your wickedness, Hate is under siege.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who has come?&quot; River asked. Hate was ALWAYS under siege.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Walkers, sire.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahhh, Walkers. Must be Elyohim again. He was always coming up here in search of his last piece of his epic. Or maybe Mildane. Both rangers had been haunted by that rare gem since they had begun their epics. Both were friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find me the Master of Spite and the Mistress of Scorn please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Elite stood there blinking in surprise at him. It truly looked lost.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's the matter?&quot; River asked, when it became apparent the Elite didn't know how to proceed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sire,&quot; the Elite stammered. &quot;The Master and Mistress are both in, but I didn't understand 'please'.&quot; He took a cautionary step forward. &quot;Are you ill, my Lord?&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane sighed. &quot;Get them now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that the Elite was gone.<br>
<br>
Several moments later, another knock, to be ushered in by River. The Elite opened the door and stepped to the side. Through the door first came a woman with a body that would make a grown man cry, and a face that would make a grown man scream. Maggots wriggled in and out of the decomposing skin on the zombie woman's face. Her breath was a hiss of leaking gassing. The Mistress of Scorn.<br>
<br>
Behind her, pushing his bulk through the doorway, came the Master of Spite. A huge black obsidian juggurnaut, his features seemed cut into the black living stone he was created from. With two thunderous footsteps he took his place in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two.&quot; River addressed them, trying to look at Spite rather than become ill looking at the Mistress. &quot;Do you have your Shattered Emeralds of Corruption?&quot;<br>
<br>
Spite nodded silently at him. &quot;Yesssss, my Lord.&quot; Scorn hissed quietly.<br>
<br>
River turned his attention to the Elite. &quot;Where are Walkers now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are travelling across the north wall, sire. I believe they are headed to our southwest corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; He turned his attention back to the two he summoned. &quot;That gives you two time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What would you have us do, my Lord?&quot; Spite asked, his voice a deep echoing bass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I want you both to get to southwest corner as quickly as you can, cutting through the city and....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesssssss.&quot; Scorn said happily, eyesockets lighting with fire dancing in empty holes.<br>
<br>
&quot;....and take your emeralds and leave them in a neat little pile and then return to me.&quot; River finished.<br>
<br>
If the Mistress could blink with no eyes, she would have.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you mean surprise them and rip them apart, sire?&quot; Spite asked, nodding his head as if to encourage River to agree.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I mean as I said.&quot; River replied, shooing them away. &quot;Now go, and if you disobey a word I've said, I'll put you in a small locked room with the Evangelist for three days until you lose what passes for your mind with his chatter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, yes sire.&quot; Spite said, pulling a dumbfounded Mistress out of the room with him.<br>
<br>
River turned back to Camille, the problem with how to wake her replacing the thoughts of Walkers in his new home. <br>
<br>
The Elite stood staring at River's back. &quot;You know,&quot; the Elite said. &quot;You're supposed to be one of the BAD guys.&quot; And with that, the Elite turned rather indignantly and left the room.<br>
<br>
River stubbed out the cigarette, eyes on his sleeping wife. He had to find a way to wake her, and to escape his new job.<br>
<br>
Eternity could be a long long time.<br>

Gah, the entire book is permeated with it. The denizens of evil, birthed in sulphurous fumes, are inured to the smoke, but however did Camille stand it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Lyri&quot;, the door opens quickly and her youngest brother tumbles onto her bed, wetting her cheek with his tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi is dead again!&quot; Still sobbing he presses the still warm, limp body of a small hamster against her shoulder.<br>
<br>
Lyriele represses her aversion to rodents and takes the small body from her brother. She kisses him softly and gently carries Vindi to the simple altar in the corner of her room.<br>
<br>
Although not part of her formal training, she knew of Tunare's love of all nature and so through trial and error, had perfected the mini-mammal resurrection spell which she now cast.<br>
<br>
No sooner had she begun the incantation, when Vindi's sides began to move in and out and the pink colour rushed back into his muzzle. <br>
<br>
&quot;Vindi, Vindi&quot;, squealed her brother as he scooped the reborn troublemaker into the palms of his hand. He ambled toward the door with his small prize, but Lyriele put her hand on his shoulder and stopped him a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;No parachuting him from rooftops, or whatever it was that killed him this time&quot;. Lyriele tried to fix a stern expression on her face. Kev bobbed his head in agreement and ran down the hallway. &quot;No more radio control hamster&quot;, she heard him exclaim to his friends as she closed the door.<br>
<br>
She crossed the room again and returned to the altar. She grabbed a handful of rose petals and scattered them there, uttering a quick prayer of thanks to Tunare, before collapsing back onto her bed.<br>
<br>
She held the Book of Riverdane absently in her hand and wondered how he would obtain new life for Camille. Perhaps he might fulfill a quest for Marr and earn her life that way? <br>
<br>
&quot;I bet she's never res'd a hamster&quot;, Lyriele gloats as she begins to read again the story.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;You will not deny me passage!&quot; the new voice said, raising in pitch. &quot;Do you know what I went through to get here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry...&quot; the elite replied. &quot;I have tried to tell you over and over, the Dark Prince is seeing no visitors....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am no mere visitor!&quot; the stranger said in indignation. &quot; I have served Innoruuk faithfully for 22 years! I was his champion in life, striving to bring the word and will of Hate to all corners of Norrath! NO one could hate better than me, no one!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, you don't seem to under...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Hells I don't! I was this close, THIS close to being pulled back by a resurrection! I saw the light, I was lifting up into it. And i FOUGHT it! I fought my way back down into death, just to sit at the right hand of my Father. And now, after permanently succumbing my soul to this accursed place, you are telling me he is BUSY?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; the elite responded, resignedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then enough...of YOU!&quot; the stranger cried, and the sound of magical energy building filled the room. The sound of something being mesmerized. And then another sound.<br>
<br>
The sound of River's door being flung open.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Dark Prince, I have served you humbly for 22 years, and have delivered my soul to you across the boundary of death! Use me to serve your dark purpose, oh Lord!&quot;<br>
<br>
River turned in his chair to find a robed dark elf kneeling before him, head low to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up Vven.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
The dark elf looked up and blinked.<br>
<br>
&quot;River?? What the hells are you doing here?&quot; Vven got up and brushed dust off his robes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well....&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no.....nonono.&quot; Vven replied. &quot;Don't tell me Razor's Edge came up here and booted Inny for a few days, not after all I went through to get here and...&quot; The enchanter was obviously distraught.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, no....&quot; River interjected.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, cause, well, I refused to be resurrected after a bad turn in The Deep, and am sort of committed to Innoruuk now. How long ago did you lay siege?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord, this enchanter mesmerized me outside.&quot; the elite said, coming in, still blinking off the fog of his magical daze. &quot;Shall I have the invader's skin flayed off?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, no.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord.&quot; Vven repeated slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;MILORD???&quot; Vven cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, milord.&quot; the elite said, shooting Vven a dirty look and exiting the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen Vven...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;After all this, my body permanently down there, my soul permanently up here, you mean to tell me somehow you not only defeated Innoruuk, but are now the new God of Hate? You? A......HUMAN?&quot; If Vven could foam at the mouth, he would be at this point.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been a long week.&quot; River said softly, sinking back into his chair. It was at this point Vven saw Camille on the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and...oh.&quot; For once Vven looked speechless. &quot;What happened here? Why isn't she...breathing or anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk trapped me into trading Camille's soul for my own life, Vven. I came back here to get her back, but all I have done is trapped myself as the new prince of Hate and locked camille in stasis. I need to discover what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven let this all sink in. &quot;So you killed Innoruuk, for good, no coming back after a little while?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. Innoruuk is dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven let out a long sigh. &quot;Then I have sacrificed myself for nothing. I'm sorry River, but I wouldn't follow you on Norrath, I'm CERTAINLY not going to follow you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We need to find out where to begin. I need to find how to wake Camille. Who knows, if I can find a way to wake her from her slumber, maybe I can find a way to return you to your body. I am supposedly a god now. That must count for something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, then let's move. The longer I am up here the longer my body rots down there.&quot; Vven hitched up his robe from dragging on the ground and started to march out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold on, I don't have a clue where to begin.&quot; River said, grabbing hold of the enchanter's sleeve.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was never into lore, or mythology, other than Innoruuk's teachings.&quot; Vven replied. &quot;You need someone with a little more history under his belt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone very smart...&quot; River said, stroking his chin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone with all the answers...&quot; Vven chimed in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone that knows Norrathian history backwards and forward...&quot; River added.<br>
<br>
Vven nodded. &quot;Someone short.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang.&quot; they said together.<br>
