This is high level EQ.  This is how it is on every server who I have friends that I speak with on.  This is normal.  This is what you should expect.<br>

If you want to play EQ at high level, it's not all going to be nice, and there's going to be competition with other guilds.<br>

<br>
*******************************<br>
If you are playing basketball, do you just start missing jumpshots in sympathy for the very real people on the opposing team? <br>
*******************************<br>
<br>
Of course you do not start throwing the game and missing jumpshits.<br>
<br>
However, you do let the other team have the basketball from time to time and use the practice court. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Even in real sports there is a sense of good competition and sportsmanship.<br>
<br>
However, as an avid sports player, I find there is very little satisfaction in defeating a weak opponent.  I loath the early rounds of tennis tournaments as I am just going through the motions.  I want my competitors to get better.  I *want* to barely pull out that last set.<br>
<br>
I want match point to be tension filled.  I want to have to dig deep and truly win the match.<br>
<br>
That is the sport of it.<br>
<br>
Winning, in and of itself, does not constitute sport.  I would even imagine that it much produce a somewhat hollow feeling.  Perhaps that leads to the compulsive behavior to keep doing it.<br>

Then practice itself would become competitive rather quickly, wouldnt it?  Enspecially as the number of teams in the league increased.  In fact Im sure that rather quickly there wouldnt be practice at all, as people would rather be using that court to hold real games, and after all one can learn during a game as well as during practice.  Im sorry that there isnt an eq emulator out there that allows people to go practice spawns until they get them right.  I think you will find that there are underlying strategys that apply broadly to a variety of large scale encounters in everquest.  Things like organization, effiecent healing, following directions, can be learned in all kinds of encounters.  Those are what you can practice, and the time to hold such a practice would not be at center court of madison square garden (or at cazic thule in fear).   <p>Procax

If the joint effort had dropped Cazic Thule on the first attempt they would have justified themselves by not being rewarded for their actions but I would have made the post all the same.<br>
<br>
Procax, you're on the list you took the time to write extensively but you never said why you zoned into Fear.  I assume the answer is because nothing else matters to you but those precious lewts and god you can only wonder about that earring.  So say it, admit who you are, take this forum to tell Vaz about what matters to you.<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about is right or wrong, might makes right so IV is right because they way they choose to handle uber spawns will determine how those spawns are handled on Vazaelle.  I'm asking for honesty, hey Cassiana, Zhraath, Xarr, Berran, Igrum, Menexia, Aegir, Sulanja and the rest from the list; don't hide in silence, don't hide behind the guild tag, you were at the controls tell Vaz that what is important to you is not risking your standing in IV and that the more ubers IV kills the better chance at loot you have.<br>
<br>
You can't have your CAKE and eat it too although mages may dispute this.  You want to take a bullish attitude step up and take the consequences don't hide in the crowd and say I'm real nice, but I rushed past 63 people cause I wanted phat lewts because I had to.  You zoned to Ferroot and the Fear because you wanted to, now be honest about it.<br>
<br>
None of this is new my last Slivers Fear raid 5 months ago IV zoned up after the raid and killed Dracoliche, Berran's master plan to kite the non-sumoning Draco with pets failed.  That was fine, Slivers gone from Fear, Draco up can even get to him without killing a mob, IV kills him.  Then my next Slivers raid Ryell and Chug insisting there is no way Endless is going to push them around, Chug scribbled on the calendar and we are doing Fear when we said we were. /guildremove Cure, ah the memories. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 11:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Who is IV?</span><hr size=1> Disclaimer: speaking for myself again, I'm a member of IV, but don't play EQ anymore.<br>
<br>
EQ is a game that people play for a *lot* of different reasons.<br>
<br>
I know people who have 100+ days /played and are just hitting level 52.  Meanwhile, Ceros hit 44 with something like 8 days /played -- and then I left for a while, and other people messed up my /played time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There are people who truly roleplay, people who play to be with their friends, people who play to kill big monsters, people who play for trading, people who play for status, people who play for wealth, people who play to chat, people who play to waste time.  Some people are 60 in under 3 months, some people have owned the game since it was released and still haven't gotten a character past 25.<br>
<br>
The list goes beyond this, way beyond this.<br>
<br>
This goes for IV as well.  A lot of IV members play for different reasons, but many of us have something in common.  We're competitive.  It's not as simple as competing with other guilds, we're competing with ourselves.  We always want to kill a bigger mob, we want to kill that mob faster and with fewer people.  We're competing with other servers, trying to make a name for ourselves.<br>
<br>
More than anything, we play for each other.  You would not believe how close IV is.  We want to see each other in the best items, we want to see all of our members in epics, we want them to feel good about their characters.<br>
<br>
IV plays for different reasons than some of the other guilds on Vazaelle.  These guilds have different motivations.  Despite the contradicting motivations, the path to acheiving those goals crosses, and  when it does, there will be conflict.<br>
<br>
We play for each other first, and if that means a player in another guild does without -- without whatever it is they play for -- we can live with that.<br>
<br>
IV is a motivated group of people who will do everything in our power and within the rules of the game to accomplish our goals.<br>
<br>
That's not to say that we're entirely heartless.  We've given many nice items away, and at times have gone out of our way to give non-IV nodrop items -- cohing, etc.  But, make no mistake, our goals and our friends come first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uthumpslots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thumpslots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 12:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> I have the utmost respect for IV.

And the people in the guild have more than once come to the aide of us lessers.<br>
However I do not put them on a pedestal.<br>
There are many things they do because they can.<br>
Not because they are right, at least unless you say that might makes right.<br>
They do it because they can and there are no rules against it.<br>
<br>
To use the earlier analogy, about the practice gym, the more proper scenario would be that when IV sees someone else going to the gym, they simply hurry and get there ahead of them, empty the gym of all the balls and then run to the next gym and repeat until there are no gyms left for the others to play in. The rest of us not being strong enough to do anything about it are helpless as they just get stronger and stronger by their very actions.<br>
Do I wish we were strong enough to compete with them, sure.<br>
Will we some day, maybe.<br>
Are we now, no.<br>
Would I change the rules so that we could?<br>
No.<br>
Do I think it right that they would charge in after Fear was cleared and kill CT?<br>
No.<br>
It is an embarrassment to me to hear that they did that and it sure makes them smaller in most peoples eyes that they would play that way.<br>
But is it wrong, by the rules of the game?<br>
No it is not.<br>
Are we supposed to be in competition with each other?<br>
No. That is saved for PvP servers, here we all need to find a way to live together.<br>

The reason most people don't like IV is because a small vocal minority of your members come here and ridicule the rest of us.  It's one thing to be the most powerfull guild on the server.. it's another thing to rub everyone else noses in it.<br>
<br>
And for those of you that grouped with me this morning in Velks who said &quot;you're right, they shouldn't say that kind of stuff, but there's nothing I can do about it&quot; that's pure 100% bull shit.  There's plenty you can do about it but damn it's hard to speak out against it when doing so means getting slammed by that small vocal minority. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uslyvarius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slyvarius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 1:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/slyvarius?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> Couldn't have said it better Supa.

I'm not a baby. I don't want mobs 'given to me' or guilds 'allowing' me to try a mob.  I want to compete.  It makes the eventual victory all the more sweet.<br>
<br>
If you want to go unchallenged on mobs. Pay your 50 bucks and move to a server where there is no predefined uber guild and go own it.<br>
<br>
Soon there will be 4 or 5 VERY capable guilds on Vaz. And with an added expansion, there will be more than enough mobs to race after.  <br>
<br>
But when we guilds get to the mob, have their attempt.  Weather victory or defeat, handle the situation with class. (that goes for everyone)<br>

<br>
The catch is with IV, it's kind of a one-way street.  When IV first trying to kill CT, they died.  They called in help, and died.  Over and over, IV lost until they finally got it right, and killed him.  Then, on further attempts, you'd wipe out, call in help from IV or other guilds, try again, and you'd kill him a bit faster.  Eventually you didn't need to call in other guilds.  Then, you could do him on the first shot.  Then you could do him with fewer groups, and now you're a pro at it.<br>
<br>
The cycle continued with other mobs - The Dain, Yen, Velk, etc...  I think the gripe from what I'm reading is this:  When you have multiple wipeouts trying to kill a mob, there's no one there to run and and steal the mob from you.  No one is gonna bum-rush Yen, or Tala, or the other mobs that IV has a pretty exclusive lock on at the moment.   Because of that, people feel a bit slighted when IV does it to them, because there's really nothing they can do about it.  They do the hard work (the break and clear), you give them one shot, they fail, and then you gank it and run.  They never get the opportunity to go through the same learning process you did, never get the chance to fiddle with tactics lke you did, never have the chance to call out for reinforcements like you did, etc., meaning they will have problems the next time around, and you'll probably run in and do the same again.<br>
<br>
Competition?  Perhaps.  Bullying?  Perhaps.  But, since IV doesn't have to worry about anyone stealing anything from them, you guys don't have to think about it.<br>
<br>
Still, it's certianly less deceitful than what some other guilds have been doing (as I hinted at in my earlier post), but ask yourself this question:<br>
<br>
If you knew nothing about Vazaelle, and the only thing you had to go off of are the comments you can read on this forum, what would you think?  Forget all the accusations and inferences - just look at how people come across in their own posts, in their own words.  What would you think?  How would you perceive people to be?  Are those perceptions correct?  What you you then infer about the guilds they are in? Can Anika stop asking so many annoying questions?  Heh...  <br>

IV earned the right to have the first shot and multiple tries at a mob.  IV earned that right via extreme dedication and hard work.<br>
<br>
Don't fool yourselves into thinking it would be any different if IV didn't exist.  There would be another guild with policies just as ours -- slower perhaps, but the policies would be the same.<br>
<br>
What is happening on Vaz is not new, it is not different than what happens on other servers.  If it's not one guild like IV, it's multiple guilds with smaller guilds not even getting a first chance.<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, people play EQ for different reasons.  Guilds who don't play for the same reasons as IV need to stop trying to force their notions down IV's throat.  You don't have the right to tell IV how to play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukrimziniv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KrimzinIV</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 2:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pactum.homestead.com/files/krimzin.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> lol Supac u dont know how many times I said that shit to Paden back when he was crying to me a month or so ago about loseing to VS then us getting him he didnt like the &quot;so win&quot; comments I made either. =P<br>
<br>
Ive seen alot of whineing from alot of ppl here so I'll respond to a few of the things.<br>
<br>
Kaminya: No way would I have given u a BP that we needed I gave u the BP we didnt need because we wernt there to pilestock our bank with Trakanon breastplates we were there for Trak's teeth which was to much for u to let us have had u taken out Trak. Im sure we will see TE in VP in the next few months so I understand your motives. *cough*<br>
<br>
Cure: Why did 36 IV members go to Ferrott and wait to see if the 2 guilds in there lost? Because we want CT loot and the sooner we get more of it the sooner we will be done with him. Haveing someone in the zone or not makes no difference to me other than added to the lag take your 1 shot if u lose sorry we takeing a shot. As far as Shadye useing any program's /shrug if he did would I care? or anyone else in my guild? nope, Welcome to high lvl Everquest.<br>
<br>
Random Whiners and Player Haters: IV has been doing this stuff b4 u got around, the amount of time u will conflict with us is very small, in another few months when we are done with CT and other things others have yet to kill or *barely* kill we will move on and I doubt u will see much of us at all other than when we zone into ToV to go past u into North Wing. <p><BR>

There is no real cazic thule, and the only law of the land for eq is the pnp which clearly states that if a mob is not aggrod, it's up for kill. i don't care if you say oh i was going to kill that, IF IT'S NOT AGGROD IT'S FUCKING KILLABLE BY SADDAM HUSSEIM AND SOME RUSSIANS ON AMD PROCESSOR COMPS PLAYING HUMAN WIZARDS BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO NUKE... seriously stop getting so pissy about it =P.

I'm not getting pissed i just love saying the word fuck =D. ok so i'm a little pissed, but it's not like i'm going to mention this shit to people i know irl, or even in game if i see em. This whole bitching about mobs and IV seriously should stop. Kaeawhateverthefuckhisnameis Songborne is right, it's not jealousy, but it's not IV being dicks either... it's that no one cares when someone else is bitching about "oh that guy just let me die and took my decaying skeleton", but when it happens to them it's bitch mode.  Instead of pissing off IV you fuckers should be asking them for pointers, last i heard every other guild has been sucking supremely. I know by saying this i've pissed off 50 people (at least) and probably going to get a response out of it, but read between the fine lines... just learn to lose, or learn to win, don't bitch about it, cuz your not gunna accomplish much.<br>

Anyway, you're right Ceros.  All things considered, Vaz is still a decent joint, and god only know it's a thousand times better than The Nameless.  IV worked hard to get where they are, and I certianly won't discount that, I'm just saying that some people don't care, they just work off a 'look what they did to soandso, they must suck' mentality.  Lots of people on Vaz couldn't care less who's in PoG or what dragon dropped where, they are focused on their own guild and their own fun, and so it's easy to get blindsided by the 18-wheel semi that is IV when you're in an Escort.
