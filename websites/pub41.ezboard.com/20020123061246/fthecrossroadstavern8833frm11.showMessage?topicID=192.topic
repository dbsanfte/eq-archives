Sometimes just something to get you going when you and your friends first start playing.<br><br>2-There are &quot;casual&quot; guilds.  I find these guilds to have the majority of the people not leveling past level 50.  They pride themselves on their &quot;family&quot; atmosphere and how much everyone loves each other.  Most of these people have no desire to let this game take over all of their personal time, they don't have HUGE goals in this game, they come to the came to hang out and talk to their friends and to have fun without having to put in a lot of hard work.<br><br>3-There are the &quot;uber&quot; guilds.  These people consist mostly of power gamers who play a LOT of hours and wanna kill the biggest baddest shit in the game.<br><br>Sometimes when people start to play they start off casually joining either type 1 or type 2 guilds.  Even though they love the people in their guild, their goals change and they want to kill the big bad shit, their goals are no longer the same of their guilds goals, so they move on.  This doesn't mean they don't like you, this means they want something different.  It doesn't mean they &quot;used&quot; you to get shit and then &quot;abandoned&quot; you.  <br><br>Yes, there are people that jump from guild to guild looking for who knows what.  I'm not talking about these people, I'm talking about the &quot;majority&quot; of people. (I think)<br><br>Let me tell you about my guild experience.  When I first started playing, I started playing with a large group of RL friends.  There were about 15 of us.  We all played at different times mostly and didn't play a lot of hours.  We formed our little guild so we wouldn't fill up each others friends lists but could see when we were on.  There were usually not more than 2 or 3 people on at once unless we had it scheduled, and on those times half of us were in one house, the other half were on a conference call with us.  This of course didn't last too long as some of us still only played a couple hours a week, and others played 30+ hours a week.<br><br>I then moved on to Knights of Phoenix.  While in KoP, I began to play more and more, leveling myself up.  But then the more I played and the higher I got, the more I wanted out of the game.  KoP  was not doing the high level game that I wanted to do, so I joined Crusaders of Plilo.  <br><br>COP will be my last guild I am in.  I don't play the game much anymore, but when I do, they are doing the things I want to do.  This has nothing to do with items or equipment, this has more to do with the level of game I choose to play.<br><br>This is my long winded post of the year, I hope this gives some insight into what you were looking for, if not, sorry for the wasted space. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Honestly though Manas, I don't think there should be so much hurt feelings when someone decides the guild they are in is not for them anymore. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><strong><b><BR>Mystykal Forse<BR>Cleric Of Zeb<BR>Crusaders of Plilo</b></strong><BR><end><end></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uscytheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScytheEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(10/6/01 12:59:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> &quot;to have fun without having to put in a lot of hard work&quot;<br><br>A common misconception <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Many smaller guilds just don't consider raids to be rewarding.  Boring/tedious != hard work.

Everyone knows the loot tables on NToV dragons, and everyone wants to raid and slay them.  It's hard for the casual guilds to become big raiders, because of reputations on the servers.  guild B wants to do more raids but can never get more members and loses members to guild A.  Guild A raids frequently and can suck in more members regularly because there is a huge demand to join.  potential members for B try to get into A, and current members of B want to get to A.  <br><br>Most people are in EQ for 2 years and then quit due to burn out.  i think its fairly safe to assume most people experience all 3 guild types.  beginning of EQ, Join family/casual guilds.  half way through the desire to see the big mega mobs gnaws away at you, and your somewhat forced to join a semi-casual/raid type guild.   <p><small>you either talk in black or speak in red.<br>BlackGuards of Zebuxoruk</small><br><font size=1><a href="http://www.mojo640.com" target="web"><b>Mojo 640</b><i>Toronto's best</a> </a><br>The Acts 26:14, Jesus says "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."</font></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uarafain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arafain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#333333>(10/6/01 2:06:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://wootage1.homestead.com/files/aoshi2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> Even so, it's very hard not to feel betrayed when 50% of your epics/ToV Breastplates leave the guild within 4 weeks of being obtained.

It was nowhere near an easy thing to do, and you can ask anyone, it was not for loot or more raids that I left.  It was because of other reasons, I need not repeat here.  Loyalties?  They go both ways.  I was loyal until it was proven to me that the favor was not being returned.  Regardless of loyalty, I can't imagine anyone playing a GAME holding onto loyalties when it is no longer fun to play.  I have no epic nor do I have an ToV stuff, hehe, hell they had to force me to take loot most of the time.  What was RoS to me was no longer, and when the catalyst that proved my theory, came forward, I guildremoved and haven't looked back.  Loyalties, shmoyalties...if they aren't going both ways then perhaps that really isn't the issue.  With what happened 9/11, with  the impending war, with DAOC coming out and the other MMORG games, it's not surprising that people are fading away.  Bah!  I am rambling, I know what I want to say, just not sure how to right now.  I will come back to this.  I am still guildless, and don't know if I will join any guild soon or ever. <p><center><B>Ciffu Longwinded</b><br><I>The Token Monkey</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umystykal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mystykal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Never Asks Nicely :)</span><br>  Posts: 688<br> <font color=#333333>(10/6/01 5:35:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> &lt;---can't understand anyone beaing mean to Ciffu.<br><br>/hugs <p><BR><strong><b><BR>Mystykal Forse<BR>Cleric Of Zeb<BR>Crusaders of Plilo</b></strong><BR><end><end></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umarethcryoslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mareth Cryoslinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silkenpantz Tool</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#333333>(10/6/01 6:55:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> I'm mean to Ciffu!

I can't imagine leaving a guild just for loot, but I have never been much for power gaming. /shrug <p><center><B>Ciffu Longwinded</b><br><I>The Token Monkey</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utokenmonkey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TokenMonkey</A> at: 10/7/01 5:20:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uverbalsabre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Verbalsabre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://verbalsabre.50megs.com/images/lsabre.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(10/7/01 9:41:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> I was a guild leader of Mirth and Mayhem on the Rathe for almost two years. Lot's of people know the guild name because they have been around so long but they are never thought of as &quot;uber&quot; because they cant even go to the Planes alone. <br><br>Over the course of the two years I had many post 50 players leave and it was always the same reasoning &quot;I want to take on the high end challenges.&quot; It wasn't totally about loot, just about doing Planes and Dragons and seeing all of the world. I always wished them the best of luck and usually kept in touch. <br><br>The ironic thing is that if ALL of those members had remained &quot;loyal&quot; as Manas brought up then they would probably have 40+ Planable members and would be capable of doing many things that they can not do now, so from that aspect I see his point. The trouble in trying to build that up is that someone has to make the sacrifice of staying and waiting for others to catch up. When you really want to raid on a regular basis that is a lot to ask of someone. <br><br>When the server split I was torn over my decision to move. I felt the loyalty that Manas spoke of and felt obligated to stay because of that loyalty. Ultimately though I had to ask myself what was going to be &quot;fun&quot;. It is a game and I want to be entertained. Although I miss the people of M&amp;M very much I do not regret for one second the choice I made, does that make me unloyal? Now I am in a raiding guild. I am raiding places that on the Rathe I would probably still not be able to go, at least not with my guild. <br><br>My point is this: It's not a matter of loyalties, it is a matter of having fun. Even if it means saying goodbye. <br> <p><center><font size="-1"><p><i><b><a href="http://verbalsabre.50megs.com">Sabre</b></i></a></font><br>54 Channeler<br><a href="http://www.phoenixhorizon.com">Phoenix Horizon</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umogglenottewbrite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moggle Nottewbrite</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master of Darkness </span><br>  Posts: 407<br> <font color=#333333>(10/7/01 9:55:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> Eriic, are you the same Eriic in the game that I've been trying to track down? if so..Dude yer harder to catch than a greased ethiopian chicken. <br> if not, sorry to bother ya. <p><b>Gilgurth: and you'll die in what?  2 hits?<br>Onker: 3 if I'm lucky<br>Onker: I plan on being really lucky</b><br><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 45 Mojo Troll<br><center><fontcolor=orange><b> Master Of <br><center><a href="http://home.dencity.com/DescendingDarkness/"> <img src="http://home.dencity.com/DescendingDarkness/images/postlogo1.gif" width="316" height="44" alt="Descending Darkness"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueriic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eriic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Prozac Junkie of Zeb</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#333333>(10/7/01 10:24:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> I am he, he is me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubinnenminder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnen Minder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnome God</span><br>  Posts: 442<br> <font color=#333333>(10/8/01 8:44:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> Onker, a net or shotgun work pretty well.... <p>Binnen Minder<br>Gnome God & Elder<br>Lodestar<br><br>Zebuxoruk Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubburlydorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BBurlydorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(10/8/01 9:29:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=192.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Serious discussion (can that happen here?)</span><hr size=1> Verbalsabre sprach:<br><br>&quot;The trouble in trying to build that up is that someone has to make the sacrifice of staying and waiting for others to catch up.&quot;<br><br>If a guild wants to do mid-level challanges (WW, ToV, Woushi, Talendar, etc.) it must maintain minimum staffing. Once this level has been reached, its very difficult to watch a guild disintegrate. Overnight a guild can go from planning to kill Dain and going to VP to suddenly having members talk about raiding PoF and PoH.<br><br>Sacrifice and wait? Aye, noble sentiments. But many of us have been level 60 for six months or more. There are plenty of good players out there. Wait?? No RECRUIT!!<br><br>If you want challanges and adventures there's a simple test:<br><br>/who all guildname Cleric 56 60<br>/who all guildname Wizard 56 60<br>/who all guildname Enchanter 56 60<br><br>etc.<br><br>If your guild can't field a 36+ well-balanced raid regularly then they might RECRUIT or start talking about making an ORC1 group instead of a NToV raid.<br><br>Battleblade
