I've banned hmm one person from KB boards. there's still a thread about it on the forums. And i've banned him for hacking our guild forums and cutpasting stuff on KB forums that was coming from our guild forums.<br>

<br>
That's the usual old discussion between dkp and awarding. However the reality is that both systems work. Oh and as far as lootwhoring goes, take a moment and look at my magelo, then compare to the other rogues.<br>
<br>
If you take a look at some topguild dkp systems, some of the more complicated ones, you will realize that their intent is not to share loot evenly, but rather to MAKE SURE that the oldtime clique of players that stayed active till the start has NO competition whatsoever for the stuff they might want.<br>

I disagree completely.  The turnover you have because people are upset they have no say in their own destiny more than outweighs the advantages of being able to gear up a MT or other needed personnel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>rewarding members not only for presence<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In theory this could be true, but the fact is that it's more about mood than anything else.  There are so many variables to consider that no human being, no matter how hard he tries, can come close to being fair in taking all these variables into account.  I know, I tried, and I realized it was impossible.<br>

A good DKP system allows this too.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>avoiding loot whoring<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Loot whoring is infinitely more of a problem in God loot guilds than in DKP guilds.  In DKP you can only buy what you have points for (assuming the system doesn't suck).  At least all people would be on the same footing and there wouldn't be a few elite who have the right to do whatever they want.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>avoiding hate between members based on loot<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is also a much, much greater problem in God loot guilds.  People in DKP guilds just recognize that people get loot because they earned it and got points.  There is tremendous tension in every single God loot guild I have ever heard of.  Lots of people like to deny it, but behind the scenes there are constant murmurs and questioning of every single call.<br>

<br>
This is actually very true with some systems.  Afterlife is an example of such a system.  I don't know if it was designed with this intent in mind, I think rather that it was not, but it does have this effect.  This happens in any DKP system without good inflation adjustment.  Essentially, some members accumulate so many points that they can buy everything they want for the next 10 years and never run out of DKP.  I know the system in PO doesn't have this AT ALL.  There is no benefit in the system for being an older member.  In flawed DKP systems it's a problem, in good ones, it's not.  Personally, I'd rather be in a DKP system either way.  At least in a bad DKP system, I'd know that several years down the line, I'd stand a chance of getting good stuff.  It's better than being in a God loot system where you know that no matter how much you play, and no matter how long you are there, you may never have a chance at being treated fairly.<br>

You don't think it's a bit egocentric that you and you alone know better than the rest of the guild?  That's just so arrogant I can hardly comprehend it.  I was suggesting a council of people that would rotate, and which you would not be a permanent member of.  i.e. Every member would have an equal role in deciding loot.<br>
<br>
Oh, and you mentioned your rogue, but do you have any other characters that can get loot on raids over other players?  I've even heard rumors that officers in TCR played multiple characters as mains in the guild without telling the guild they were 2 boxing.<br>

Why was the point not clarified by a member of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>your</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> guild, perhaps an officer or maybe just a regular member would be suffice. However my point was referring to the way that your officer/GL merely avoided direct confrontation to that comment, arousing suspicions in the minds of some who pay attention to what they read. <br>

but just a reminder this is your recruitment thread, and Hiding behind the minor faults of IV is not gonna help your guild recover from the shit it's doomed to suffer from being on KB.<br>

<br>
Well, actually, none of the rumors that I heard were from ex-IV people.  Most of the people I've heard from are ex-CR people.  Finally, you didn't exactly conquer IV any more than CC or PO did on Vazaelle.  IV has a built in self destruct mechanism, it's a sort of planned obsolescence like light bulbs.<br>

POP is more a fight against burnout than an expansion based around skill.  I have more respect for people who have stuck with it since the beginning for their endurance than their skill at this point.<br>
<br>
&quot;....mostly spread from former members of In Virtue, who we have vanquished from Kane Bayle, therefore, we are the top guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Few things make me giggle. This did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Personally, I just movelogged myself, but as a previous guildmate of mine has stated, we were tagged the instant we got there and I even got a Shining Crimson Shawl on my first ever raid, it is an upgrade to my previous Coldain Shawl, which is one of the hardest quest in the game to complete, it's one of the prize possesions I left behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, and based on your incredibly brief guild-membership and this upgrade you clearly have the authority to comment on the loot distribution of this guild, as well as any SHADY AND BEHIND THE SCENE doings that may or may not be going on. Frankly, I doubt they are, but you're still a tool.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is my only post on this because my guildleader says he does'nt want to continue the posting and possibly ruin our reputation as one of the top guilds in EQ.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you believe you have a reputation as one of the top guilds in everquest then are dellusional.   <br>
<br>
Furthermore, the only reason you are the &quot;top&quot; guild on the server (and I use the term very loosely) is because the population is 300 people, half of which are botting. On any other server in everquest you would be, at best, one of the 2-6 second rate guilds firmly behind the lead guild. <br>

lol, shadowbane did more vanquishing of IV than you did, for at least a month or 2 it was less boring than farming pofire once a day.  Thanks for the laugh though heh.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the recruitment stuff....I have to agree with shwa here, the KB server hardware is a peice of crap.  IIRC, pofire crashed somthing like 30 times in  roughly a month period.  Shining Crimson Shawl's every day baby!  sometimes TWO!<br>
<br>
anyway, been there, done that, vazaelle's population level is far preferable.<br>

<br>
as for this high turnover you seem to know alot about, in the time ive been in the guild we have had two people removed (one is currently re apping and guild voting on retagging) for appauling behaviour, we have had a couple retire and i cant think of anyone that has actually left. we have also alot of people on holidays due to being summer time. we spent alot of time gearing the guild for the next phase of planes of power and have decided haveing 10 or so more would make it a little more easier and less time consuming. last night after our i think 4th or 5th day doing xegony we got her down to 30% the best we had got her before was 86% that was a massive achievment for us with 60 people. if we had 10 or so more she would have been killed already, although we will kill her with the people we have, rathe and time will be hard so we want to recruite more to make it easier. <br>
<br>
now this is talking from my own experiance since im able to think for myself and not make judgements on things &quot;rumours&quot; cause i really have no idea what im talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yesodgnomemaster>YesodGnomeMaster</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kane-bayle.com/kb/html/avatars/c3e5f1e93e57d4520822e.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/03 6:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2125.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hi</span><hr size=1> Hi Ame,<br>

So, you only know the so called 'rumours' about TCR from the so called 'ex-guildies' we had. Please, name us some of these people who gave you the impression that we are the devil of KB, and Greldon is a dominating bastard that likes to kick people around left right and center and hog loots so he can ebay.<br>

Clearly, you are easily influenced by what you hear and what people tell you, I mean with all the knowledge and experience you have (as you clearly show it), I was hoping you'd know better than listening to 'rumours', aka, trash talking, thus called rumours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=audacitybarebottom>Audacity Barebottom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 828<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/03 8:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2125.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hi</span><hr size=1> Hi Yesod!
