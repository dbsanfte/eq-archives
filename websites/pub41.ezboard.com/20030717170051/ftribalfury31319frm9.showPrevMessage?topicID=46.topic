Since I see no officers that are Paladins, I will post a Pally view here based on my experiences. (Officer additions welcome.)<br>
<br>
First of all, a Paladin is a hybrid. We are not usually meant to be the primary tank, nor are we meant to be a primary healer. We are, however, a good secondary for these. Paladins, while a plate class, don't have the hit points or ac to be a full blown tank. Our heals, while better since LoY in the 39-55 gap, are not as adequate as a cleric. Even Druids get complete heal eventually, while Paladins do not. If there is a cleric (Rodcet Nife be with you if there isn't), then your buffs aren't going to be needed with the exception of Valor/Brell's, which I reccomend casting on all groups. (Use /targetgroupbuffs on to be able to hit each group entirely with one cast.)<br>
<br>
As always, you must listen to the Raid Leader. While you should do research on the raid objective, the RL is the one person that should know how to tackle the task. Ask the RL well before the raid (before he has to start organizing) what he would like you do. He will tell you if you are to be a secondary assist, spot healer, tank mezzer... etc. Keep chatter in the raid channel to business only. Use an alternate channel or tells for the weather report or bragging about your girlfriends measurements. Live or die in a noble fashion, for it is better than dying a daft mongrel that didn't take advise.<br>
<br>
SPOT HEALER<br>
Rarely are we asked to do this, but since we have Lay Hands, and some smaller heals, we have occasions where we are asked to do this. If a raid force is balanced well, then you probably will not be placed in this role. Usually, you will be asked to do this within your group, which can allow you to slash at the mobs back some. Sometimes, you are asked to watch the Main Tank outside your group. If you are asked to watch him, and you're not in his group, keep him targeted and watch those hp's! Typically, spot healing won't begin until a main healer calls LoM (Low on Mana.) <br>
<br>
CHAIN STUNNER<br>
This is used on dragons and other high level casters, as well as mobs that Complete Heal themselves, or tend to Gate away just before death. In this role, you load up as many stuns as necessary, and might even consider going 1 hand weapon with a shield for bashing. (If you have DW bracers, include those in your hotkeys for easy clicks.) Even mobs that resist the stun portion of these spells can be interrupted by the spell. This is especially true of Force, Holy Might, .. etc, which cause knockback damage.<br>
Remember to listen to the RL. He will tell you at what point he wants chain stuns to commence. This will vary from mob to mob. Once stunning starts, it does not end until the mob is down, as you can ill afford to allow it to CH or gate. Also remember that stunning can cause aggro, so never stun early in a battle, or risk taking aggro from the MT!!!<br>
Look at the cast times of your stuns, and form a chain that will always have a stun ready for casting without a recast wait time. <br>
You can simplify the process with one hotkey as well. Try this once outside of a raid... Place a stun in spell slots 1-4, and equip a 1 hand weapon and shield. Then make a hotkey Called STUNS as follows:<br>
<br>
/doability 1 (where your first hotkey is BASH)<br>
/cast 1<br>
/cast 2<br>
/cast 3<br>
/cast 4<br>
<br>
Have a battle spam window for this! When you hit the hotkey, you will bash, then cast. If a bash or the first stun is not available yet, the next command works. If a stun is being cast, all other commands will get a &quot; You have not recovered yet.&quot; response. So the order goes like this:<br>
<br>
1st time : Bash + stun 1 (3 not recovered msgs)<br>
2nd time : (2 not recovered) stun #2 cast (2 more not recovered)<br>
3rd time : ( 3 not recovered) stun #3 cast (1 not recovered)<br>
4th time : Bash (3 not recovered) stun #4<br>
etc...etc...<br>
<br>
SECONDARY ASSIST<br>
Slightly different for a pally, this simply means that if the tank goes down, you step up and gain aggro. You are now the man/woman that stands between the mob and the casters/healers. It is up to you to gain the aggro, and call assist again once you know you have it. Making hotkeys that tell the party/raid what you are doing is reccommended here, as you have to solo it for a minute to gain aggro. <br>
<br>
When gaining aggro, use all the tools. Have your Taunt maxed for your level, and use stuns if need be. The object is to piss that mob off, and do sufficient damage to hold the aggro once you call assist. Root sometimes is an option as well, but ask the RL if this is a bad idea before you do this.<br>
<br>
TANK MEZZER<br>
<br>
On occasions when a bard or chanter are not available, you will be pulled for this duty. This simply is where you watch for adds. When an add happens, you attack the mob NOT engaged by the MT. The object is to gain aggro, split the mobs, and keep the foul beast occupied until help arrives. You are soloing at this time, while the raid force takes out the primary pull. Don't worry about killing it per se, just keep aggro and stay alive. Even if you lose aggro to the MT once he comes over, it matters not so long as the casters are safe. A good tank mezzer can really cut down on combat rezzes on a raid.<br>
<br>
DPS DPS DPS<br>
<br>
This is the easiest role you will play. Simply put, you wait for the assist, and then carve away. Use your 2 hand weapon, and have your haste, proc, and nuke up. The object is to simply do as much damage as you can. If the MT did his job, you won't take aggro. Spells to avoid include roots and stuns (unless you are also asked to chain stun.) Another important note... if there is a rogue in the party, take the mob's flank. Leave that vunerable backside to the backstabbers!<br>
<br>
GEAR SELECTION<br>
<br>
Finally, the one mistake I made in my travels was not getting adequate resist gear. Be sure to keep gear with good resists in the bank for those casting mobs. Ask the RL what your role is, and if resist gear is needed. (He may tell you before you ask.) Be sure to cater your gear to the occasion. If you are spot healing or casting nukes, wear WIS gear. If you have a caster to hit, resist gear may be in order. If you're TMing or just a DPS dealer, then stick with your AC gear (maybe with some dex mods to hit and proc more.)<br>
<br>
Remember.... This is a guide. Always remember to reseach the target and get final assignment from the raid leader. Ultimately, it's his call what role you play in the battle, and if he's/she's wrong it's on him/her. Good listening skills are the most impotant stat for a Paladin! <p>Prallic Pureedge<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
       The reason I stayed hardline on that is because a druid heals better than a pally in most cases as well. Rampaging mobs are a different scenario then most raid targets. The main topic of the post was to get instructions from the Raid Leader as to what your role will be. I've been on many raids, and a individual pally's role will change according to target, raid force balance, number of pallies (having 3 pallies stunning at once is usually a waste), and length of heal chain. <br>
<br>
        Edited my post a bit. I'll review it a few more times to make sure I'm satisfied with the content.<br>

<br>
      The only thing I differ with is the stun comments. When a pally is instructed to stun, it's usually well after the MT has aggro, and even after the nukage has begun. Before that, the group is usualy relying on MR to resist any spells. Stunning role (in raids, which is our topic) usually starts when the mob is in the 20-30% health area. The primary purpose is most likely to prevent the mob from Complete Healing itself, or gating out.<br>
      If we were talking about the pally in a group situation, then yeah, stun is going to be used earlier, and aggro is likely. In those situations, I use lower level stuns, but before I even cast the first stun, I use shield bashes. This lowers my DPS, but is an aggro free stun. Meanwhile, the tank gains more aggro before I start a stun chain.<br>
       As far as RL's telling us what to do, I've actually seen very little of that except when I went on lots of Naggy &amp; Vox Raids. In most cases, I've had to ask. Part of me feels bad for bothering the RL with questions, but then my common sense kicks in. Asking the questions could mean the difference between owning the mob, or causing a wipe. <br>
       As for spot healing, I'm always ready. I make sure LoH is up, and always have my best heals up. (At my current level, that's Etherial Cleansing and Light of Life. Both are LoY spells.) Even if my role is not spot healing, if the plan goes awry, and things get real bad, my quick heal could make a difference. I've saved an MT a couple times with a 3 sec cast, 410pt heal, cast while CH was still being cast, that barely kept him up until the CH went off. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mosquitonet.com/~jlanam/PrallicSignature.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravinred>ravinred</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/24/03 10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The raiding Pally</span><hr size=1> If you're drawing too much agro either a) you're stunning too soon or b) your tank isn't doing his/her job.<br>
<br>
As for dying...  lets see, we were on Plane of Sky when SOMEONE'S (loveya!) AOE made me dead.  I said &quot;?????&quot;, and was rez'd quickly.  While looting my corpse (didn't even manage to get dressed!) I died again.  Someone said &quot;Sorry, Cal, we're used to Ari!!&quot;.  I said, &quot;I don't mind dying, but I like to loot my corpse first!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dying happens, and is part of raiding.  The pally's ability to chain stun is invaluable against olde-worlde dragons who CH or summon like Naggy and Vox.  I know a guild that won't do Naggy/Vox without a bard [resists] and a pally [stuns] in every group.<br>
<br>
Pallys...  the holy knights....  always ready to sacrifice for a cause!  (and bards, who are best used as BAIT!)<br>
<br>
/agree on questions.  I've felt downright stupid a couple of raids since joiing TF.  I don't get around much since Drake was born, and there's lots of places I've never been.  Yet my group will always hear: &quot;I've got x, y, and z, memmed - any requests?&quot;  or &quot;testing melee twist, please comment!&quot;  And if no one else has been there I'll ask the RL for requests.<br>
<br>
So if your RL asks you to chain stun, WAIT FOR THE CALL and be prepared to die anyway.  Thanks to rezzies and our perpetual EQ lives, the goal is MAKING THE BEYATCH DEAD, not living through it!<br>
<br>
