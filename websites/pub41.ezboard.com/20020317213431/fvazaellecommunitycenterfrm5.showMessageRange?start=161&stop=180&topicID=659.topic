I've seen it happen (not really that often, but a few times).  Not saying point systems are perfect, but sometimes they are better.  When 1 person leaves a guild and publicly flames them, it could just be a whiner.  When it happens a lot, there is a good chance there is something going on internally.  Im not gonna claim to know what goes on inside of PO, cause i dont know, and i honestly dont care.  Loot is always a touchy subjet, especially in a guild as large as PO.  /shrug, its not really my business, but it makes good reading when its aired for the public ^^<br>
  And btw Baldrik, why would Afterlife farm ST or ToV? They did that for prolly 6 months straight?  If theres a drop they still need (besides possibly Vulak loot, which might not be as good as some SoL stuff) I would be extremely shocked.  And i know they have released the sleeper, meaning they no longer need SoD's, and if you dont need SoD's you dont need primal =p <p>Xarr TRULL

<br>
well barsh, I think 90% of the people that left PO back in the days joined IV.  So there's our guild.  And as to why people get angry when they leave PO... <br>
<br>
- When jetx left, he says alyen and kead talked about him behind his back from his incoherant initial post. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
- When I left, rumors were spreading around in PO by an officer about why I such as I dumped my boyfriend cuz I was in love with ghol or something so I joined IV to be with ghol /boggle does that even make sense??<br>
- When Samir left rumors about why he left was posted on the board by kead himself, saying something about samir being in love with me and he was following me around ROFL thx for the laugh kead.  <br>
- When zozz, ghol, kazi, etc left, I was guilded for not even a month.  They were talked about behind their backs and they were officers.  It was if they were the traitors and the general feeling that was being dished out by the officers were that these people are not worth consorting with.  I bought into it, I didn't really talk to anybody that left with the exception of zozzie.  Like ghol said, if you saw the officers board it was disgusting. (everybody had the password to it too lol - and the incident where kead acused lillya of giving it out when she swore she didn't and she quit because of it... that was probably one of the lowest moments of PO's existance) <br>
- When malathor, kyrana, vehnn, silvir etc left, (the so called mass exodus) they were labeled as traitors who abandoned the guild when it got rough.  I was guilded for maybe 2-3 months, these people who left joined mostly after I did, I bought into the BS I missed the infamous &quot;guild meeting&quot; and also labeled these people as quitters because it was told to me by my officers.  <br>
- When Raiya/Ayiar left it was basically a conspiracy within the officers to make them quit the guild.  I assume this is true because none of the officers deny this.  And it's stated that anika himself told raiya that they key was going to bagen and not her.  That's fucking low.  If you don't have the balls to kick somebody out of guild don't go resorting to denying them something they deserve.<br>
- When Gomes left (looking at his post) sounds like rumors about why he left the guild were spreading around too.  <br>
<br>
Usually when you think you leave a guild on good terms, then come around and see posts or hear people say that the officers are spreading rumors and talking about you behind your back, it doesn't really make them happy.  So let me give you PO folks some advice.  Don't buy into everything that you hear.  And don't leave the guild if you don't want rumors to be spread about you behind the shed with a 3 legged donkey.   <p>Evye -In Virtue-

<br>
My whole point of this thread was because I was pissed about how a lot of you talk shit behind other peoples back and then dont say anything to them straight up. When someone said shit about me in EC did you ever even try to confront me about it? NO you didnt, hell even when I sent you a tell asking about it I got NO reply it took me a couple days just to even talk with you. And no my father wasnt even the one who told me about the incident, it was discussed in an open IRC channel with everyone there. <br>
<br>
I also had a thread posted on the PO boards, deleted, then you talked shit about me to someone else about the thread, thanks to them I knew you saw it and deleted it.<br>
<br>
Now you can usually tell when someone talks shit about you by listening to the shit they say behind other people's backs. I brought up a few other people because I KNEW you talked shit about them behind their back. Obviously from that moment on I should have known you would have done the same about me.<br>
<br>
The whole thread was changed to Loot thanks to your buddy Alyen. He brought it up and it carried on from there. But of course I guess you didnt read that part, I guess you cant read the big words so you just skim through a post.<br>
<br>
Its not my fault that you get bashed by other people who share a similar opinion and knows whats going on. I mean can you seriously deny that your not an asshole, can you seriously deny the shit that they have claimed? Nah its better for you just to look the other way and notice someone else you can screw.<br>
<br>
Notice how many times you said WTF are you talking about in your little summary there. Im not surised though I am sure thats your response to anyone who fights back.<br>
<br>
RandomPO1: I think it was unfair that you looted the CoF.<br>
Keadaian: WTF are you talking about?<br>
RandomPO2: Hey bro that wasnt very nice what you about Raiya.<br>
Keadaian: WTF are you talking about?<br>
RandomPO3: Hey man how come you get upset when I raid with another guild when we arent doing anything but your not mad at RandomPO5 when they went too?<br>
Keadaian: WTF are you talking about?<br>
Jetx: Hey bro, I heard someone was saying that I said something in EC???<br>
Keadaian: No response for 3 Days.<br>
RandomPO8: How come when I discontinued my $500 check to you, you disbanded me from the guild?<br>
Keadaian: WTF are you talking about?<br>
RandomPO10: Hey dude I thought you said you wanted me in your group, but now RandomPO11 is on you stop responding to my tells?<br>
Keadaian: WTF are you talking about?<br>
Keadaian: WTF are you talking about?<br>

and on that note Keadaian:<br>
<br>
I beleive in this thread you said you and Krimzin were more alike than dissimilar, though perhaps that was another thread-- your benevolance is involved in so many my fair lord and with my limited intellect compared to your great expanse i do so lose track so forgive me if i call falsely. <br>
<br>
  having served in and out of favor with both yourself mighty keadaian and krimzin i must say..... you two really are nothing alike-- Krimzin is actually impressive at times and has a certain amount of charisma about him, as well as being a very adept raid leader and motivator, i could list the things hes done and it would be at good length... hmmm whats kead done whats kead done.... first things coming to mind ARE :  shouting disc fearless with talendor - sending female members in PO pornographic material - and when someone infers that perhaps leadership would be best handled by someone else questioning them with, ready for a quote?... and survey says :  &quot;who are you to DARE question me?!&quot;... wait no great accomplishements yet let me think further... hmm the sands of time do wear away at my fevered brain so. i am quite lacking of the mental faculties as compared to you kead please bare with me... wait... you did make the monk puller main assist at a kedge raid and often did brag about your great abilities as a guild leader to conduct a flawless phinigel autropos slaying (never mind the fact that you did have to evac when the monk MA puller died and everyone was lost and confused). shit.. no accomplishements there... keep thinking.. SHIT! WHY AM I SO DUMB I CANT FUCKING STAND IT...... THINK THINK THINK DAMNIT......WORK BRAIN......nnnnngh- oh i know!! you did come to this server to escape your old reputation on your last one right? what happend...? you trained a guild during an EL raid because they wouldnt respect your leadership? you trained and killed YOUR own guild then disbanded and fled to a new server thats right. well.... i guess that is a certain amount of ...intelligence to survive, maybe some survival instinct.... you did realize they probably wouldnt look too favorably on you after that... and you did realize your reputation could.. maybe  possibly go down for something like intentionally training your entire guild during a raid  ( why did you call EL camp a raid anyway? because you had 3 groups there you said? at efreeti lord? ). i mean, that takes a certain amount of intelligence right? to understand when others get pissed off due to your basic malicious actions? hey no worries my good man, at least this time it wasnt basic ineptitude that killed you. <br>
<br>
 someone let me know when my faction roll over happens.<br>
<br>
think this threads about gone the way of the horse. tell you what though kead, drop me a nice counter thread and we can dance a bit. i do so enjoy the attention, though you do tend to step on my feet a bit.. maybe you just need practice? dont worry dear, ill save my dance for you alone, and ignore anyone elses attempts for my attention save you alone magnificient keadaian.<br>
 <br>
and to all those who i know i amuse-- you are ever so welcome.<br>

I am glad you place some weight on Evie's assessment of the thread, I believe incoherent was the word she used when describing your original post and I would agree that is fairly accurate.<br>
<br>
 It seems that you believe someone or some people are talking about you behind your back, though you have never been specific as to who has told you who has been speaking about you nor what they said.If that was presented then maybe people would be able to address that specifically rather than the pot shots being fired by you at random targets. Strange that you seem to have been listening to and placing some credence in what they say to someone who is doing exactly what you are ranting against i.e. speaking about someone behind thier back,can you say hypocrite?!<br>
<br>
 As for being &quot;one of Keads favorites&quot; how strange you should link that to loot,and loot to kissing ass. I do not have full ToV,nor one drop from CT,Vindi,Statue,or any named Dragon.Maybe you can show me that loot button attached to Kead ass which you say you kissed once?! If Kead has any consideration for me as an officer of PO then maybe its drawn more out of respect than ass kissing. I did at the time and continue to support Raiya and Ayiar over the incidents that lead to them leaving PO yet this does not make me an outcast from my guild,why do you seem to think that people are not allowed thier own opinions? As for the Ninla incident, well if you had read what was a very long post you will have noticed that I invited anyone who was not happy with my explanations or reasoning to speak to me about it,and you chose not to. Then why bring that up here? I am sure that if you had a problem that you would have spoken to me about it rather than others as I can see the stand you have taken over how much you hate people speaking behind others' backs .....right?<br>
<br>
 Ask a question state your case and maybe you will find an answer pointless ranting and swearing with no salient facts make you look a fool.I am happier to speak to you in game if you need that, and though I understand eloquence deserting people when they have lost control, I will ignore any tells that are written with the same foul mouth that makes most of what you say unintelligable.<br>
<br>
 Over 400 posts and finally your 15 mins of fame you must feel very proud. By being a jerk to the people who have done you no wrong I will have to agree with the opinion of those that see you as a selfish attention seeking individual.Here's a newsflash noone really cares. Sometimes it is better to remain silent and have people think you a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.<br>
