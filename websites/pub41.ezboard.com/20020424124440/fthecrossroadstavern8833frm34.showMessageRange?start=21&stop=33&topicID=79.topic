Point was; it's all in the Eye of the Beholder. Warning people about others is pointless because most of the time:<br>
<br>
a) The person or people involved are perfectly nice well rounded individual(s) and just offended you.<br>
b) If they've really done something bad then tell a GM, let the GM deal with it and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
If I believed every warning I heard, then I'd be believing Dark Horizon were the most evil Guild to ever exist and must be destroyed!<br>
<br>
(Along with Crusaders of Plilo, Clan Icewind, Lumiere Divine and every single individual that ever put a foot wrong)<br>
<br>
We all make mistakes. It's unfair to label people because of the mistakes they make and, more often than not, the mistakes we make.<br>
<br>
You seem to have this funny idea that people are &quot;mostly good&quot;, unles they've burnt you personally in which case they become BAD BAD BAD!!! It doesn't work like that.<br>
<br>
You can teach and preach whatever you like, but the only way people learn is through experience. <p><DIV align=center>

I know I would though and I also know that I appreciate the fact that when this happens to someone, that I know who the person is so I don't have the same thing happen to me.  It may have been a simple mistake where their ISP dropped or some such thing and when they get back on they return the money or the item in question and then you correct the post and that is an end to it.  If other people come on and say yeah this guy did the same to me then I don't believe that they are &quot;perfectly nice well rounded individual(s) and just offended you&quot;.

<br>
Somebody chucks accusations at someone else with no evidence to back it up other than their word. That person's reputation usually gets screwed based on what gets said here unless there are people that know the person here ready to defend.<br>
<br>
This forum, and the flame forum to some extent, is about playing judge, jury and executioner to somebody that offended you. It's just a place for people to unload their vendettas against others, be they justified or not. What we have here is an Inquisition for all intents and purposes. No jury, just people making accusations against others and in most cases passing judgement.<br>
<br>
Most people that get scammed are letting themselves get scammed, the system is entirely fair, you are *letting* someone walk away with your 4k, or whatever it may be, because they talked you into it. As Rex pointed out, if a man comes to your door, tells you that he will pay you 1 million dollars for your TV, but he has to get the money after he gets the TV, what would you say? &quot;Here! Have my TV! I'll see you in 10 minutes ok! Thanks!&quot;<br>
<br>
That's all I see when people post here: &quot;Hey! I was stupid! This guy was smarter than me! I was gullible and he played me like a cheap piano!!!&quot;. These people deserve a Darwin Award rather than sympathy. The stupid get poorer, the clever get richer. That's life pretty much. :P<br>
<br>
If you have a problem with someone, if you do manage to get scammed then /petition and contact a GM, that's what they're there for.<br>
<br>
Don't let yourself get ripped off. Take screenshots. Contact a GM. Prevention then cure.<br>

This is Atilian.  I've spoken with Palmyra/Ammonn and explained to them the situation.  Atilian has no affiliation with this incident.  Orwynn is in fact my brother's character.  Thaniel on the other hand, is not.  Possibly he's one of my brother's friends.  But also, Cuppin is my alt.  I used my brother's character for a transfer in EC because all my toons weren't in the zone.  But I am deeply sorry for this, and have apologized for my brother's actions.  I tried logging into his characters to retrieve the 4k, but was only able to scrounge 100-200pp and some items with low to no value.  He has been up at college, so he hasn't been playing EQ.  My guess is that he lent his stuff to one of his friends.  But I just want to point out the fact that unfortunately, yes, Orwynn is on the same account, but is in no way involved with Atilian or Cuppin.  I know it may seem hard to believe, but honestly, I have been working with Ammonn to work out the situation.  And next time I talk to him, I will ask him about it and post up his reply to let all you guys know.  Thanks for your time and again, I'm sorry for my brother's actions.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1C1658><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uthothamen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thothamen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnome from Hell</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#A098F2>(3/12/02 12:18:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SCAMMERS:  ORWYNN &amp; THANIEL</span><hr size=1> NOOO!!!

It is sooo easy to screw someone's rep (good or bad) over stuff people say which is why I never give names when I complain in case I am wrong.  Once there is enough evidence and I have tried every method to resolve the issue, I then submit my report here.

Atilian either ignored us or claimed he didn't know Orwynn.  <br>
<br>
After finally coming clean about knowing Orwynn in his post, we were still skeptical as no one belives the &quot;it was my brother&quot; cop-out story.<br>
<br>
It just so happened that last night I ended up in the same group as Atilian's RL best friend. After his name came up randomly I chatted with him for over an hour from a third-person's point of view on the situation.  He noted that Atilian perhaps didn't handle it the best way by denying knowing Orwynn for so long, but that he was just trying to protect himself.  <br>
<br>
I just wanted to post to let you know it has now been worked out (isn't that the protocol on this forum?)  Maybe the extra pressure of being posted helped him to admit the facts so the issue could be resolved. <br>

I know you and Karloth both got scammed by Thaniel with the hand wraps bait-and-switch thing.  Send me a tell in game and I will split with you and Karloth the items and pp that I got from Atilian (about 2500 in total value).  Sure it's not much but it is nice to feel some closure on the deal.  Thanks for your post Yuri. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.showMessageRange?topicID=79.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.showPrevMessage?topicID=79.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.showNextMessage?topicID=79.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=33><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.emailToFriend?topicID=79.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.threadControl?topicID=79.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=79.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=79.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm39">GUILDS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">Flame Forum<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm34">Bottom Feeders<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm40">Crafter's Corner<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm35">Camelot Connections<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm37">Beastlord's Scratching Post<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm36">Moderators/Admins<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Admins Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm41">Testing....1, 2, 3...Testing</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A098F2>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#A098F2> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm34>Bottom Feeders</a> <font color=#A098F2> - </font><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/">Zebu's Zanadu!</a><font color=#A098F2> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
