<br>
It would seem to me that someone with such extensive knowledge of the monk class would be aware that the str and dex afforded by a cougar claw earring are negligible at your level (this isnt a new occurance).<br>
<br>
However, i apologize for assuming that your claims were bullshit, but realize please that someone anonymously claiming things like that on a messageboard, while spouting a magelo like yours is slightly askew of logic. <br>
<br>
As for Saalron's claims that respect is gone from eq... /shrug.  He's right about one thing, there is no skill left in pulling.  There is no skill left in anything.  Monks (if that is who pulls) do nothing but train the guild, and the chanters/rooters/snarers/tankmezzers contain the train long enough to kill everything before it kills you, rinse, repeat.  But just becaue EQ has gotten lazy doesnt mean that you have to be.  If you care to play your class as best you can, then you can, and regardless of past accomplishments there are some easy upgrades available to your magelo that just look ridiculous to not have been upgraded.<br>
<br>
As for Saalron's respect for you, good.  Glad you earned his respect (not an easy feat either if i might add), however no i wont say that because you have his respect i should respect you.  Not that I dont respect you, i am honestly indifferent at this point, but I think if you are going to continue playing your class you should do it well.<br>
<br>
As for Saalron's lumping me in with Krialis, i think that's quite an unfair comparison, and was thrown in merely to raise my ire~ and i'd be lying if i said it didnt.  But regardless of where I learned what i know (most of which i learned on my own through trial and error and not through the all-encompassing-tutelage of Saalron), I would consider myself a good monk now.  One of the better ones on Vazaelle I would hope, and though i have the same game knowledge concerning older content, if you want to move into the current game, you adjust.  So yes, the stroll down memory lane is nice, and I can see where you're coming from, but look at where EQ is today (though i cant see why a monk ever would have worn that CC earring over an orc fang kk).<br>

Yes, it's easier to level, easier to get nice gear, easier to contain trains, more predictable encounters, etc etc.  But new expansions have also given the fringe classes more power, and even I would say responsibility.<br>
<br>
I remember my first days when I hit my 40s, going on raids with Sacred Fires.  My job was woo!  singing group manasong.  Admittedly, I was young, but for high level bards, there were no ae songs, limited stacking haste options, and it was nearly impossible for bards to convince raid leaders that dmg from ds shields on ma was more important than singing mana for the clerics (even with mod rods, yes).<br>
<br>
Those halcyon days of ntov ~ I remember Herder making a sarcastic post to the effect of how chanters just buffed a raid and then afk'd till buffs were needed again.<br>
<br>
Many mobs used to require a warrior in disc defensive to tank.  Now sk and pally tanks are not uncommon on several fights.<br>
<br>
Mages now get to do more than cast mod rod after mod rod!<br>
<br>
All things being equal, I have no doubts that older EQ was a more challenging game overall.  But I find the newer abilities/mobs a lot more versatile.<br>
<br>
I also find it hard to believe that Vox was a harder mob than say, Rydda is.  Last summer when I was on Kane I raided those old world dragons for the first time as a bard (mine was 45 at the time), and even with shitty resists and most of the raid being around mid to late 40s/early 50s with poor gear (a pretty fair reenactment of early eq raids I'm guessing?),  I resisted a lot of the dragon aes.<br>
<br>
There are still old Everquest zones that make a huge impression on me.  I remember the first time I stepped in Chardok before they changed it...I was around 40 and was promptly raped by the roaming mobs at the zone-in.  It took like 5 lvl 60s to get me out  ;p  Everyone's first fear raid (well, mine was pretty uneventful till CT popped and then repopped the entire plane on the raid) is always an experience.  PoG clearings were a test of true dedication.  Camping the Naggy room for Ragefire was even worse...I still recall when Naggy spawned just as SF was about to kill Ragefire for Aegion.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I remember wiping to Severilous and In Virtue came sweeping in, rezzed everyone, and killed him very quickly.<br>
<br>
I'm obviously fairly new to the game...  I don't know what it was like before Kunark came out or before Velious came out, and I wasn't even 60 when Luclin came out.  So much of what I said can probably be easily dismissed.  But this game is a work in progress.  Many classes used to have crushing limitations--this has probably hurt the game some (the ease of being able to do more with fewer people/the right classes), but has also added some much-needed versatility.  And I like how the encounters in PoP center around add control.  The bosses in early luclin with the major hp and the stupid ae slows/curses/attack debuffs were just boring as hell.  And there's only so many &quot;massive damage so everyone needs to time their tank switches and cheal chains and aggro control correctly&quot; encounters you can do...<br>
<br>
I am a girl of limited imagination so I will be interested in what the newer mmorpgs throw at people in terms of boss encounters.  Most of the games I've played are like, Zelda...<br>
<br>
Talking out of my ass as usual!  feel free to flame<br>

<br>
Doing fear raids back in the day with multiple wipes per day even for the best guilds were just part of the flow.  5 or 6 enchanters per fear/hate raid, mes'ing the same targets because even with tash the resists at level 50 were insane.  Fear/hate raids would take 8-10 hours minimum, if you had 45-50 people.  2 spite golems in Hate at once would equal death for your raid of 45.  <br>
<br>
Move on to the days of Kunark.  Melees use /counterattack versus VS, wizards nuke after a few seconds.  Many guilds do Trakanon in waves, while the really uber guilds across the servers do Trak with group cheal because they have 7 level 60 clerics.  Level 59 takes 10 hours just to get a yellow bubble.  Queen in Chardok is insane, she does a 1500 AE, while the average caster with heroism and symbol is often at 2500 hit points, if not lower.  In the midst of this, you're dealing with all of her guards.  <br>
<br>
I could go on with Velious but I won't.  EQ difficulty is relative.  Sure, nowadays you have to be perfect over a longer amount of time, but the majority of people who claim the old days were easy are the people who weren't in an endgame guild back then and they're trying to further justify the uberness of their guild/character now.  Everything done in EQ now was built on a foundation from earlier expansions.  Original EQ was about crowd control, kunark was about massive AEs, velious was about a combination of massive AEs, beginning of split tanking, and the beginning of the CH rotation, luclin was about the ch rotation, crowd control, and split tanking to the extreme.<br>
<br>
PoP puts everything together into one, but you're only successful in PoP because others before you have put in the time to learn the game mechanics which you pick up on so easily when you join your endgame guild, or when someone tells you.<br>
<br>
I do see a lack of respect in the same way Saalron does.  People nowadays claim that old content was easy and state that a person who holds old content as their credentials is claiming nothing are fucking morons and would be nothing today without the earlier pioneers.<br>
<br>
To the monk, maybe I was wrong in stating you weren't an endgame player, although I thought you were referring to more recently.  I can't see anyone who's played much over the last 2 years using a cougar claw earring.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stakkavaz>StakkaVaz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.rogers.com/scarboar/images/ospace.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/18/03 5:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.rogers.com/scarboar/images/ospace.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: laf</span><hr size=1> trinity = wycca in game.<br>

When chanters were mes'ing Fear/Hate pre-kunark it was nothing even close to what it is today.  Also keep in mind that a chanter back then had around 1600-1800 hps with resolution and symbol so they'd die VERY quickly on a resisted mes.  <br>

I find that awfully hard to believe.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trinityfirestrike>Trinity Firestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/18/03 11:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> Saalron, thanks for the comments, I for one enjoyed our conversations back then.  And yes it was kindle....5k gloves (impskin) at the time!<br>
<br>
Katarin whats up!!  Long time, miss those HS days.<br>
<br>
Ake and Banderas, I can understand both criticisms.  I am aware of my gear, most of it is left over from server-up when SF was lvling upwards (i started my break in april/may 01).  I can also understand obvious doubt when a no-name comes and says they have serverwide 1sts, and endgame experience.  So I posted the list, and can even give contacts to verify the info, well known monks like Lenardo and Arlos were like Saalron at one time asking me about the class and pulling, I miss classic EQ/kunark, the class was so much closer, I knew every monk above level 25 on my server in classic EQ.<br>
<br>
But that's memory lane, the fact is, I might still have skills left (im honestly not sure), the game has changed a buttload since I seriously played, and my gear sucks.  I could do something about it, but, I do fine in exp grps, and on raids (as i only pull when zakik/blade arnt there or dont want to, or when they die and I want things to keep moving).  So I guess it's lazieness, on the earring/headband (i have the bds, and the headband via a guildie trade) as I just havnt bothered to pick them up.  <br>
<br>
Btw I know nothing about Luclin (except the minor stuff I've done in EoTD), and almost nothing about PoP (minus what's been done in exp grps)...I still keep up on the boards tho, but I don't consider that working knowledge.  And Velious has changed enough to render my dated knowledge useless on most mobs.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rambling btw~<br>
<br>
Katarin, heres some info on how classic EQ raids on nag/vox worked.  Everyone on the raid HAD to be 49/50.  Melees 50 in fact, and casters 49 (for their upgraded spells).  Under that, and no matter your resists, you would be nearly worthless due to fear mainly (ae too, but fear mattered most).  The BEST raid that I recall on nag/vox was with 24 ppl, in the top gear at the time (hate/fear, the best resist pieces).  To give you an idea of the best resist pieces, I could sell gnomish enviro suits for 15k, and every equippable class would wear it into battle.  Resists buffed were....around 120-160 FR/CR, and 100-120 MR (for a monk anyways).  I managed to hit the top end, which was rare and involved some rare piece farming (mamoth cloak, firewalker boots, drake belt, stuff like that).  I would get feared every other wave long enough to run to the 1st bend from nag's room, other fears landed about 1/4th the time and lasted longer/shorter, another 1/4th the time i resisted.  The problem was debuffs back then, the fight was long with the BEST melee weapons being monk fists (14 36) and yaks/assorted bloodfire, etc, and the best nuke being ice comet.  Nag/Vox's regen was buffed several times, its nothing now, but at lvl 50, with around 1500-1600hp tops (as a monk) unbuffed, and 900ac (breaking that was incredibly hard, no other class could even come close), and your buffs being removed....it was a bear.  250 hits on an 750ac lvl 50 war, with no disc, and healer's being constantly interrupted....plus the agro shifts...and the AEs.<br>
<br>
I won't even talk about vox and her bitch cheals.  Anything over 36 on the raid was trouble, and going lower than 30 was approaching FoH/AL territory.  I de-lvled (along with most of my guild) several times our 1st few attempts.  Tactics like MTing, ducking ae's, waves, etc, didnt even exist back then.  I might also add that finding 30-36 lvl 50's in your guild back then, of the right classes, was something only 2-3 guilds could muster until near kunark's release.  Fear back then was a nightmare, the best guilds would whipe 3-5 times a clearing easily, and even the best pullers would die a few times to cazic agro (DTs).  Breaking fear was something most guilds couldnt do until mid kunark.  Hate with spite golem pets was a nightmare, the pet wouldnt be around the master, and when you agroed a golem (as they were wanderers as well as statics), meant the pet pathing through half the zone and bringing massive trains.  Talking about the Plane of Sky is another story in itself, quite amusing, no other zone has been as hyped as it was IMO, and I dont really think any other zone was un-completable like it was in classic EQ.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, just worked from 6am-10pm, tired as hell...but I hope that helped clear up why nag/vox were rough back then kat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trinityfirestrike>Trinity Firestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/03 12:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=113>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> Bleh, post sounded like shit, oh well....and I realize I said BD when talking about earrings...I obviously meant black saph.<br>
<br>
Hp buffs back then, Resolution, Symbol of Naltron, Talisman of Altuna, Stamina.  Haste was SLTW (higher haste rate back then, they decreased it to include new haste spells).  I'm not sure my attack broke much past 900 (950 sounds awfully familiar), but it's been a while and I might be off on that one.<br>
<br>
Ake- Yah I'm aware of the whole hp/sta vs ac/agi/dex/str thing.  I have talked to monks as well who still were wearing black pearl stuff, and agi focused as recently as last week (57mnk) however, so in truth, thanks for trying to help another monk out.  I've spent too much time camping mosquito leg earrings, I will eventually get them as replacements....<br>
<br>
Btw, I'm semi-glad monks arnt REQUIRED to pull anymore, in all seriousness, it looses its fun after say, a year, another year and its turned into a task, and by now, its something I try to avoid when others can (and usually want to) do it.  New areas are still fun to learn, but often take 1 raid or 1 night of exp to figure out.  In most exp groups anymore, I think monks pull simply because others don't realize they can do it.  All it takes is some GOOD observation skills (less now, you don't have to watch pathing as much with the changes), timing, and not being a total retard....anyone has the gear now to (or just maybe monks don't have the defensive skills/gear advantage they previously had).<br>
<br>
Anyways, time for serious sleep~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbanderas>Mr Banderas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 388<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/03 12:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2013.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> As a monk you shoulda had a bit better than 1600, Trinity.<br>
<br>
An enc had 700-750+ unbuffed, add in naltron ( 525 ) and resolution ( 250 ) and arch shielding (150) and that's already 1600.  <br>
<br>
You probably had 1700-1800, although I couldn't see it being any more than that.<br>
<br>
During kunark, the highest I ever got my enchanter was 3050 fully buffed, which was with just about the highest possible HP gear available ( neglecting INT/CHA ).  Consider though, that Trak's AE did 1200 initially and 150 per tick.  3050 = dead pretty goddamn fast.  Those who got agro had it worse, with double 650s and his 1500 dmg lifetap.<br>
<br>
People who knock earlier expansions and claim they were easy are seriously clueless.  <br>

<br>
Diamondine/Elec Black earring x2 (i switched em around)<br>
Runed Lava Pendant<br>
Tranix Crown or Frog Crown (depending on rseists, tranix mainly tho)<br>
know I had a Mempto, but cant recall if i wore anything else<br>
plat fire wedding ring x2<br>
air quest wrist-mystical black straps<br>
forget other wrist, will think on it<br>
gloves-guantlets of fiery might<br>
arms-azure sleeves<br>
shoulders-sode of empowerment<br>
back- cloak of flames<br>
chest- sythrik (sp) hide vest or shiverback<br>
waist- RBB or the 8ac 15str one from lguk or draco belt<br>
legs- gator scale or shiver or golden efreeti<br>
boots- shiver<br>
ranged- kerran toy<br>
weapons-fists or whitened treant fists x2<br>
bags- karvul's mystical pouch and treasurehunters<br>
<br>
It varied on time frame during classic EQ, and on wt. and on what I was aiming for....AC was more my focus back then when not in resist gear.<br>
<br>
Will hop on magelo sometime tomorrow if I can to try and figure out my stats.

just fyi the WTFs were 1hb at the time instead of hth (hth caps at 225, 1hb at like 240), switching in a 1hb item in magelos shows 1017atk.....seems higher than I remember...but thats 3+yrs ago.<br>
<br>
hp fully buffed-<br>
1575hp+reso (250)+ symbol of naltron (525) + talisman of altuna (250) +stamina (+40sta or around 125hp)= 2725hp<br>
<br>
Air wasn't open until (feb?) early '00 before that I ran a granite bracer, gator legs, and fists in those spots.  I didn't include my Robe of the Lost Circle, it doesn't exsist in magelo's with its old stats (around 12ac 5str 5sta 5agi 25hp 5MR/CR/FR i think).  I used it as a chest when I had to (raids)....I considered it VERY unfashionable (hah).<br>
