A zone full of undead there as a halloween special.<br>

There are people behind those characters.  People want to see things they never have before, see new drops they never seen before.  EK was not the only place they had new mobs dropping different things.  Rathe Mountains and West Commons were 2 as well.  I know there were more because of the different zones that were in the patch.<br>
<br>
From what I seen no one was really hunting for exp in any of these zones, they were all hunting for some loot.  And from what I could tell since all the items I seen drop throughout the zones everything was no drop and when the item was unusable by one person they shouted the loc and what class it was for.<br>
<br>
I went to all 3 zones that I mentioned.  I also found some items to be better than what I actually had.  Yes they may have dropped from a lvl 10-20 mob but I also seen the exact same items several times and so it was not like these items were so rare that everyone else would not have a chance to get them.<br>
<br>
I don't know if each of these zones could really be considered GM events unless there was a mob or mobs roaming around under GM control.  I think all they did was add candy to the mobs so we could ALL go out trick or treating.<br>

Are you an alt of Xonic, the bard who was bleating about this every 30 seconds in EK last night?<br>
<br>
Either way, he, and you, seemed to miss that:<br>
<br>
a) The 50+ crowd wasn't looting 99 percent of the bodies, but calling out LOCs and protecting people as they looted. (As opposed to the 20somethings that asked my guildmate how much he'd pay for the LOC of caster drops.) I myself killed one of those necro spectres that wiped out a small group then locked the corpse so that group could come and get the drops. (Pally neck and some shield.)<br>
<br>
b) We were the ones rezzing you, dragging your corpses, healing you, buffing you and pulling stuff off you when you were overmatched.<br>
<br>
c) We were also the group that was NOT KSing. Although, frankly, it was sort of cute to see the high 20s group follow me around, trying to KS me. Sorry, but I'm a level 51 wizard. Better luck next KS.<br>
<br>
d) We also were the ones who were talking people OUT of ending the events in EK and NRo. Said people tended to be -- /gasp -- well below 50, but seemingly not as interested as everyone having a good time as most of us were.<br>
<br>
VI clearly thought there were plenty of spawns and drops for everyone (about 1:5 for drops, from what I could see). They have the power to make stuff trivial loot coded and other options. They chose not to exercise those options for a reason. Complain to them. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-banner-long.gif" height=60 width=468 alt="Whizbang Dustyboots" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucyanravyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyanravyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/1/01 4:39:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=530.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halloween Events Last Night</span><hr size=1> You GO Whiz /WOOT!<br>

The first thing I do is con it and see that it is green so I nuke it.  It didn't stand a chance.  I then spin around to see where the dead body is and I get cursed at by a 21 cleric stating that I KSed it.<br>
I probably did KS it because it smacked me and I nuked.  kinda hard for a 21 cleric to outdmg a 53 wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway the werewolf didnt drop anything so I started running around nuking any werewolf that was not engaged.  Only one drop and it was for SK.  Location was yelled and I continued.<br>
<br>
I ended up going LD when WC crashed.  It corrupted my WC zone files so I couldnt play my main until I replaced those files.<br>
<br>
Did I have fun? Yes.  Was I upset that the zone crashed and took my main character off line? Yes.  Would I do it again? you betcha.<br>
<br>
I later heard that a 4int 10mana bracer dropped in EK.  2 weeks ago that would have been an upgrade to my current bracer.  Now I have better equipment.  So just because the mob is green doesn't mean that it isnt dropping loot that level 50+ cant use.  But the majority of the higher level people will let someone else come loot it if we can't use it.<br>

<br>
I just logged on for a CR to witness the 6pm (central time) event in NK. After I got my corpse, I decided to kill a couple graveyard knights and get some exp and loot. Out of the 5 fear kitings, I got one kill that gave me exp; the other 4 went down as other level 40's and 50's smacked and nuked a bit... and then they went ahead and looted right the way.<br>
<br>
It's very nice of you, Whizbang to help out others. But not everyone is there to help, expecially those high levels in groups killing everything they see. I don't see how that can be helpful to the event. Yes, a lot of shouts on what items is at what location, but is that really helping the lower levels? Maybe they get some nice items (again, they don't deserve them), but what's the fun for low levels to race to a loc whenever a shout comes? Some may find it fun, but not for me.<br>

You're free to turn off /ooc. And don't presume to decide what other people want. I was getting constant tells from paladins, shamans and clerics who wanted me to tell them (and ONLY them) where loot was dropping. I still put it out in /ooc ...<br>

Become a GM or, better yet, a game designer. In the meantime, you don't get to control who gets what item.<br>

So what? The other 140+ people in EK seemed to be having a blast. You were the ONLY person complaining, if you noticed. If you don't like playing a game with other people, there are many, many RPGs that can be played solo on your computer. I suggest you either realize you're not in control of reality, or buy a solo game and be happy with that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ueqjetx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ JetX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/1/01 10:19:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=530.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halloween Events Last Night</span><hr size=1> Well guess its time for me to delevel so I can have fun in this game again.

then there were some people who were just being really lame. i was just wandering around, looking for a wolfie to kill (OMG i'm level 53...wtf am i doing....hey guess what? i like to just *see* loot...if anything i killed had something on it, i'd shout it to the zone or try to catch someone running by). well, i saw this one lil werewolf...only thing i saw near it was a fully clothed corpse, and the wolf was at half health...i figured the guy had just died to it. so, i go kill it, for the hell of it. when it's dead i get the &quot;you can't loot&quot; message...and soon get a tell from a druid accusing me of ks'ing, saying i'm rude, disrespectful, and a newbie...errm oke, didn't see anyone there...oh you were kiting it? k...level 34 druid kiting level what, 15 werewolf? k then...and i didn't even get the kill..../boggle.<br>

anyway. kinda reminds me of preschool when the teacher brought out plates of ants on a log, and everyone was trying to get the one with the most raisins...but some people were waiting their turn...<br>

Did I deserve the loot I got?  you betcha - I died 4 times, Twice becasue I was summoned to the Vargon (or whatever his name is).  One of those times my corpse could not be dragged (dang bug) so I had to loot it with about 3 specs hitting me, then fire up selos and haul tail.<br>

Probally 90% of the itmes dropped would have rotted if people that didn't &quot;deserve&quot; them hadn't looted.<br>

Overall I spent 4 hours dying 4 times. losing over 3 yellow bubs of exp, but I got some very nice items, including that sweet bard mace - drool.  The best GM event I have ever been a part of, and player cooperation was at a all time high. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usailor4.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sailor4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/2/01 3:16:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=530.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> GM events</span><hr size=1> humph, well after i got my runedbladed sword of night, which normaly is droped of the Kit forrest gereral level 63, that i  would never have the chance of killing, and this 1hs was a great upgrade to what i was using, its stats 12/26 3str 3sta effect a 176dd magic based , woot<br>

In fact, had the high level folks not been there, vast amounts of XP would have been lost.  On top of that, a lot of higher level folks were also wondering around the zone, finding people wo died in god-forsaken places they they would never be able to get back to, and ressing/buffing/helping them to safety.  Since you can't find the @#$@#)$ blood to end the Rathe event, some folks might have ended up losing their corpses in there if not for those high level folks you so dislike.<br>
<br>
Fact is, Verant has been going out of their way to keep the high level folks occupied with things you're probably not aware of.  Incredibly fast respawn on Kunark and Velious dragons, tons of GM events catered to high level folks like Cazic Thule in CT and the Baby Dragon event in ToV.  They are a lot fewer high levels running around then you think, but if you lost your corpse, or you're looking for drops, that may not be a good thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uqxired.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Q Xired</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 522<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/2/01 12:23:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=530.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://quarken2012.homestead.com/files/m-venom.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM events</span><hr size=1> Anika dear you must have misunderstood him, he means he didnt want the high levels there EXCEPT the ones who rez, and drag bodies, and help him from getting killed, those high levels are OK.

KS and leave the loot for someone who could use it=BAD<br>
<br>
Kill things 40 levels lower than you and leave the loot=BAD<br>
<br>
Let some low level die trying to get the loot him/herself while watching=BAD(you must help, but beware of the &quot;DONT KS ME&quot;)<br>
<br>
You should realize that everything that was changed was not just changed for specific people.  It was changed because of Halloween and to give EVERYONE the chance to go Trick or Treating.  You talk about having your fun spoiled and that lvl 50+ killing lvl 20 mobs is &quot;a little ridicules?&quot; but then you also state that there were low levels there looting items that they didn't deserve. insert quote here:<br>
&quot;most other lower level players were too busy running to pick up phat loot that they didn't deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
So then who was this &quot;Event&quot; for...if the low levels didn't deserve the loot and the high level people shouldn't be there killing low level mobs then who in the bloody hell was all this geared for?<br>
<br>
I think you fail to realize that this was all done for EVERYONE.  EVERYONE meaning you, me, Joeblow, and Quarken.  Yes some things got ruined but hey chalk that one up to people.  You have asses and you have asses and if you are an ass, may someone kick you!<br>
