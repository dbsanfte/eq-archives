This is gonna hurt</span><hr size=1> Falgoth Bloodreign here, Ok, First off, I still consider Lala a very good friend of mine, despite this, But, I must defend my fiancee..  what this all amounted to was a HUGE misunderstanding...  and normally as to be fair and keep away from vauge heresay I would not use real names but you did have to post her Toon name in the flame..<br>
and if this is goin to be aired in PUBLIC, let them hear the other side of this and have a little more to judge from than just what you've heard (I do trust what Lala has heard.. just not the source)<br>
First off let me say.. this is a GAME.. I just wanted to have fun, but we all did make real life friends, and for some reason, real life .. dare i say.. drama.. resulted.<br>
Ok, here goes...  Guild started by Windjammer (great guy).. left for guardian alliance (awsome guild).   No prob so far..<br>
Lala takes over (dragoon warrirors)  with his fiancee Sweetpeaches..  They share same computer so they are never on at same time.. but no problems.<br>
Lala does an awsome job with guild.. very friendly and works very hard on web site..   About two weeks latter.. He tells Scaeth and I that he no longer wants to be guild leader.. so he hands it to Scaeth (who only NORMALLY wouldnt play EQ.. )  It was right AFTER he gave guild to Scaeth that Sweetpeaches thru a HUGE fit.. She wanted control of the guild and because Lala didnt give it to her.. she quit the guild and her character (quitting the character might have been for a diff reason..)  She created a new bard called Windhammer and joined Fae Vicus (something) Everything goes fine for a while.. then one day he says in guild chat.. &quot;hey has anyone seen Guardian Alliance's web site?&quot;     .. that got me curious..  I send him a tell asking him if he was interested on leaving the guild?  His response was &quot;No way.. i'm a Goon for life bro..&quot;    My response &quot;I was just wondering .. because so many people here really like you and if you just up and left moral would really suffer..  and if you would want to join a bigger guild give us a good warning about it..&quot;   Lala said &quot; I'm not leaving&quot;     ... Next day he had Guardian Alliance tags on..   Does it matter.. not at all.. I still grouped with him.. and we still had tons of fun ...  <br>
Ok.. now on this end of the game.. Scaeth and I play on computers right next to each other.. 99.9% of the time we look at each other's screens.. mainly so i can keep track of her manna... I pretty much know everything that someone tells her or that she sees..   It starts with Windhammer (Lala's fiancee aka Sweetpeaches) sending tells for us to powerlevel her..  then its tells on how $*%*#@  Fae Vicus (her guild at time)  is...  because they are always talking about their personal lives..     THEN.. oh and i love this....  She tells Scaeth how HAPPY her and Lala are in real life and that how she wishes that  Scaeth and Falgoth can someday be as happy...                  <br>
 uhhh... ok?   wtf is that about?<br>
So then.. Yesterday I log in and talk to Lala, He tells me someone said that I was leaving the guild for some other guild.. heh i wasnt aware of that..<br>
then he tells me some.. (hint) told him that Scaeth and I were fighting in RL  ..   hummm we werent happy??    OMG if that that ever happened.. if we ever had a hint of arguement on EQ... its EQ OFF BABY!!!!<br>
So now.. lets play connect the dots and where do you all think these things are being generated?   Love is blind bro.. but never underestimate the power of a PO'd woman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I NEVER SAW scaeth type anything of the sort of what you've seen.. it is so FAR out of her character its not even funny..<br>
<br>
could she have... sure..  but i would really recommend checking your sources (COUGH windhammer/sweetpeaches)before posting on a public board and throwing names around  <br>
Lala I trust what you've heard.. but not where you've heard it...<br>
<br>
Sorry.. I have to stick up for my woman, She's a wonderful person for putting up with me playing EQ .. shes awsome for playing along side me.. I dont want her to leave the game for some misunderstanding..<br>
<br>
Added note: Lala is still a good friend.. even if i'm now on his /ignore list..<br>

<br>
I would like to take a moment to apologize to all who have become entangled in this situation via these message boards. Honestly, this appears to be a small personal grudge between a few people, that became inflamed and grossly exaggeratted by too many open mouths and not enough open ears. <br>
As guild leader, I take full responsibility for this mess, and it is my deepest hope that no other dragoon warriors reputation should take the fall, for all who carry our guild tag are worthy of it, and worthy of knowing. I have some really wonderful guild members, and they dont deserve their reputation to be marred by something like this, especially over a messy grudge. <br>
For the record, since reign has been passed to me ( something I didnt just jump at mind you, I took 2 weeks to decide, Lalalron knows that is 100 percent true.) I have worked harder than ever to keep the guild going, to keep what members we had at that point still together. And since then, I have increased our number by at least 10, I learned HTML just so I could enhance our website, and as far as I have seen, have earned respect and wonderful new friendships both within and outside of the guild. I took the promotion to guild leader, only because I would not see the guild disperse for lack of morale after two leaders had passed ( and I dont hold it against them, its a game guys) I would n ot see these good people guildless, so I took on the job. And I was completely scared. I still am, because I know I dont know everything, I havent been playing for 4 years, I'm not &quot;uber&quot; like some. But in being guild leader, I have learned the most important lesson in leadership - I am nothing, if not for my guild members. And if that means going halfway across norrath for a corpse run/rezz, or taking the brunt of a misunderstanding so that my guild members can play in peace, so be it.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, I hope that all of this can be cleared up in personal chat and email, instead of multiple public postings, for really it is between only a few people. Again I apoligize for this drama, and I hope whenever you see a Dragoon OR a Guardian Alliance member, you take a moment to say hi , for both are honorable and worthy of mention. <br>
Thank you very much for your time,<br>
<br>
Scaeth Bloodreign - Leader of the Dragoon Warriors<br>

Not gonna take sides on this, but the matter seems pretty much an inside matter, and it should have been handled as such.  I just hope all sides can come clean on this and repair whatever damage was done to the friendship.  It is only a game, and a friendship should always supercede that.<br>

No offense man, but GA doesn't like public flamings &amp; such.  It kinda gives us a bad taste.  From reading all this so far, it does sound like an inside matter &amp; should be handled in that fashion.  I would respectfully request that you do not reply to this issue publically no more &amp; take it to a private chat, email, or whichever. <p><center><b><i><Font Color="0000CC"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137767>Ogkrum Slimfatty</a><BR>Lv 57 Ogre Myrmidon<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127626>Saavak</a><br>Lv 6 Dark Elf Cleric<P></i></Font><Font Color="009966">"Beefcake!!!"<BR>Zebuxuruk<BR>Proud Officer<BR><a href=http://www.guardianalliance.org>Guardian Alliance</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umystykal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mystykal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Never Asks Nicely :)</span><br>  Posts: 1567<br> <font color=#333333>(3/26/02 1:26:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Message From Scaeth, Leader of the Dragoon Warriors</span><hr size=1> MNV or paragraphs please <p><BR>
