By the way--I think you are mistaking trolling for bitchslapping.  It seems like every single post I toss out your way now-a-days is jus' a big ol' slap across your deer in the headlights face.

Using the word fucktard or calling a person a tard has never struck me as something immoral for some reason.<br>
<br>
The thing that bugs me and worries me about the picture is those are real people that were used to cut down the MB members. The people on this message board of course are unscathed and they can laugh it off since they are not actually those people and dont have to deal with the issues those people face. In that picture you have something that was meant to be a moment of joy in some people who have had a very hard lot in life. Someone took that picture though and posted it on the net in order to make fun of those people and the fact they are different (not you Goanad, I assume you just searched Google or something of that sort to get the pic). Now what if one of those kids/people were to see their picture on the internet, how would they feel? I imagine those people are pretty sensitive to their situation, they likely know they are different from the norm and I am sure they try not to think to much about that. Seeing their picture on the net if they ever stumbled across it would likely cause some seriously harsh feelings, alot of pain and sadness. The same goes for anyone who loves those people if they saw their son/daughter/sister/brother on the net being used as a joke.<br>
<br>
It is not totally disimilar to the site Uglypeople.com. That site has always struck me as cruel. Afew of the pictures on that site are doctored and quite harmless jokes. Many of the pictures on that site are real people though that likely would be crushed at seeing their picture on a site such as that. People dont need to be reminded about such things as being unattractive. Most people who would be on that site already have extremely low self confidence and have likely spent a life of being picked on and ignored, they dont need to be the joke of the week on a internet site seen by thousands of people. <br>
<br>
I am sure all of you have seen the movies where the sorority guys get a competition going to bring the most homely looking girl to the party. Each guy goes out and finds as ugly a girl he can find and attempts to bring her to the party. Most of these girls of course have little self confidence and many are tricked into thinking that one time in their life someone actually sees something in them. So the girl gets done up as pretty as she can, she tells her few friends, she tells her parents who are so happy for her, then she goes to the party and is utterly humiliated and her heart is crushed as she finds out she was all part of a sick competition and joke. The embaresment of the whole thing would I imagine be horrible. What does she tell her friends and family who were so happy for her? Does she put on her best happy face and try to lie her way out of hurting them and keep them from worrying about her?<br>
<br>
Such things as the above party really happen. Before they were ever in movies this kind of thing would often take place (the movies themselves have actually made it harder for the real thing to happen now as it acts as a warning). The parties that really happend caused gret pain. The Uglypeople.com site I am sure has caused great pain to those people that have seen themselves or loved ones on it. The pictures of mentally handicapped people on the net used as jokes are no different in my mind, it is the same joke on a different and equally defenseless group of people.<br>
<br>
People can come onto this thread and say that I am oversensitive all they want. It is actually not true in the slightest. I dont know anyone in that picture, I dont know anyone on Uglypeople.com, and I dont know anyone that has any such thing as that party happen to them nor have I seen one of those parties first hand. Nothing has touched home because I have been lucky enough not to have any problems in my family or friends that might lead to those types of things happening. If there ever came a day when someone I did know and love was used as a joke by anyone on the net or in any other way I do know it would hit home and I do know I would be quite choked at seeing it. If it was one of the few people I am closest to I would likely end up in jail for mutilating some joking boy cyber geek who posted the pic and posting his picture on skinlesspeople.com. I am sure anyone else on this board would feel little different if the joke hit home and was not some nameless face they did not know but someone they knew and loved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggelmustaffafez>Roggel MustaffaFez</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.tripod.co.uk/redhotant/icons/iconoc03.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1564<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/6/03 4:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2107.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> so not funny, you are.</span><hr size=1> Goanad proves himself to be a really intelligent and wise man once again.<br>

<br>
In this case you are suggestion that others are handicapped, and placing a picture, most likely taken of a school group, and posted with the handicapped's school web page(most likely) as evidence.  Which to me seems like a pretty clear cut case of discrimination.<br>
<br>
I mean sure, Blacks have suffered MUCH at the hands white men, and deserve our respect, and the apologies of our ancestry.  They should not be discriminated based on color.<br>
<br>
However, Mentally Handicapped have suffered far more, for far longer at the hands of there own ppl, including in cases there own families.<br>
<br>
In places in Africa, MH ppl are treated as demon possesion, then taken out a chained to a tree. No shit.  Chained to a fucking tree and fed, occasionally.  Yet to have some ass who lacks the abilities to come up with anything better then posting a picture of those less fortunate then us for the sake of humor is immoral.  <br>
<br>
I am not saying i have no sense of humor, or that i take the Moral high ground.  I just don't think its very kosher to laugh out those who are incapable of defending themselves.  I mean i can laugh at the idiots at www.darwinawards.com<br>
I get a chuckle out of some of the things at freakhole.com  I don't think its funny to pic on the defensless, such as the handicap.<br>
<br>
I see it as crass and downright childish.  The last time I made fun of the handicapped i think i was 8, and my dad beat my ass.  <br>

I certainly can see levels of difference between racial attacks and a chuckle at the expense of some goofy looking people, and indeed the intent was &quot;look at these goofy people, bet y'all look like em cuz yer stoopid!&quot; so fairly harmless.  People take a chuckle at me sometimes, but you learn to deal with it.<br>

I would imagine we all have things we just have to have a sense of humor about or else we would just grab an AK and go postal.  This country could do with more humor, some humility, and less &quot;political correctness.&quot;  Ah, yes, the PC movement...gotta love it (or else) gosh knows I got it browbeaten into me to not call my female friends &quot;girls.&quot;  (despite the fact it was ok for them to call us &quot;guys&quot; and boys.&quot;)  Our African-American countrymen call each other things I would get shot for saying (even if I was inclined to) and no small number of them have called me &quot;cracker&quot; but gosh knows no African-American can be racist, racism is only practiced upon them, it is a one-way affliction.<br>

WHOA. Slow down a second, please. For the record, I'm not the least bit racist, as a matter of fact there isn't much I consider intolerable, but racism, in it's definition form. I'm also a big advocate for equal opportunity as in, everyone should have the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>equal</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>opportunity</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to achieve. I'm a single white man living in middle class greater Boston area. With that said: I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have never opressed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> any black men or women. None have suffered at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>my</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hands. And nobody <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>deserves</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my respect without putting a reason forward. Nobody should ever feel that they have a right to someone's respect strictly based on what group of person they fall into. There are some black people who would spit on you if they read that quote. Let us not forget there were many, many black families selling their own children to slavery.<br>
<br>
Why should I apologize for what my ancestors have done? Do you think my black neighbors give a shit if my 4-generations-ago-uncle had a slave, when I invite them over for a beer and a burger? Do I feel like I should apologize to their entire family for possibly some great, great, great, great, aunt of mine had a black slave churning butter? Hell no. And it's probably for the same reason why I don't optomistically check my mail box everyday for 'Thank You' letters from blacks within my community thanking my ancestors for setting their ancestors free from the bounds of slavery long ago in the Civil War. The reason? That was then, this is now.<br>
<br>
As a society and a world we understand mistakes in history are made, we evolve. Looking back on the slavery and opression of blacks in America instead of moving past it is only detrimental to our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>equal progression</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as a functioning society. As a society in this day and age, there is enough, if not too much, opportunity given to the 'minority' races. We all know the type of shit I'm refering too. I know for a fact I'm not the only person in this forum who's had trouble with school and job placement because of some racial quota that has to be met. I can tell you right now there's been issues with my financial aid for college that some people, minorities, don't have to worry about. That is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>equal</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->? Not in my Webster. <br>
<br>
Hypothetical (but I'm sure it is reality somewhere) situation: 5 slots need to be filled at my local Fire Station. My city has this racial quota that needs to be met, they are 4 minorities too short. This isn't a tele-marketing job or some office building. This is a job where peoples lives are at stake. Do I give a fuck if the guy who's using the Jaws Of Life on my mangled car is black, white or latino? No as long as the motherfucker knows his job, doesn't cut my ass in half, and makes sure everyone is alive and well, I'm satisfied. So, whatever you think blacks are owed because of the suffering I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>haven't</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> put them through, it would be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ridiculous</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to say it hasn't been met. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5389"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/gastrolicious/qx-Quarkensig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13186" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/gastrolicious/qx-Tecknoesig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tropicsdelight>TropicsDelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1105<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/6/03 10:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2107.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: exactly</span><hr size=1> Totally agree with everything Q just said.<br>

Funny thing when we start feeling so sorry for a group of people and feeling that we owe them so much. Groups of people have had hardships placed on them since the beginning of time. Humanity and the places people are is all based on survival of the fittest. When I see governments bending over backwards to help out the First Nations people it makes me sick. They are given land, they are given more social programs then anyone else, they are given rights beyond anything that any of the rest of us can do (hello casino, I am sure you are making many natives rich). Guess what, yeah we took their land, they lost the fucking war, thats what happens. I am Irish, my ancestors lost land to the British, do you see me expecting the British to kiss my ass now?<br>
<br>
Slavery was horrible for the black people I am sure. They should not piss and moan too much about us mean white people though because we did not invent it. Slavery has been around since the beginning of civilization. Mesopotamia, Egypt, find all the early areas of civilization and you will find slavery. The laws of Hammurabi (sp?) that were found from Babylonian times has many laws releating to slavery. The people of Africa themselves were great fans of slavery long before the white people came along. Tribal warfare was quite common in Africa and the taking of slaves from the losing tribe was done constantly. Many of the slaves that were taken to the new world were actually captured by tribes in Africa and then sold to the slave ships, black people sold out their own people.<br>
<br>
Life sucks at times. If someone can take something from you they probably will. Everyone in this world can look back in history and find many instances of slaughter, stolen land, and other nasty stuff done against their ancestors. Get over it. And if you did lose a battle and lost all your stuff then you should feel lucky as hell if the victors gave you land and put up with all your fucking whining for the last 300 years. The white man has treated you a hell of alot better then you should have hoped for. Had Russia taken the new world instead you would not be around today to whine about it, you would all be dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crazylowfyrwildforge>Crazy Lowfyr Wildforge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx?path=/dood9000/fullsize/Lowfyr.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 446<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/7/03 5:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2107.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You need to be more tolerant of my intolerance...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Blacks have suffered MUCH at the hands white men, and deserve our respect, and the apologies of our ancestry.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You sound like every dumbass knee-jerk liberal mother fucker in my Freshman English class.  You're not writing a fucking report for extra credit, you're trying to argue your fucking point.<br>
<br>
Here's a little something to think about before the next class period:  If you start treating a group of people differently just because of their race, then you're a racist, dumbshit.<br>
<br>
Skin color is meaningless.  I prefer to save my hate for the throngs of stupid people who make decisions based on impulse, and then try rationalize their way back to them.<br>

It's not intellectual capacity, either, so everyone in the &quot;Department of Retard Love&quot; can suck a dick.  Don't get me wrong, genetic prediliction does tend to help.  There are, however, hordes of people who could be intelligent, but never take the initiative to think rationally.<br>

I must be reading your posts entirely wrong because I thought you said, &quot;Blacks have suffered MUCH at the hands white men, and deserve our respect, and the apologies of our ancestry&quot;. Regardless, why should I apologize to the black community for something: <br>
<br>
1.) I never supported.<br>
2.) I wasn't alive while it was taking place.<br>
3.) Personally, my ancestors were living it up in Rome and Ireland while the plantation owners of our young country did their thing with slavery. So I don't think I have to apologize for that.<br>
<br>
Oh but that's the thing, I have to apologize because I'm white. And just like not every white person had a slave owner in their family tree, not every black family has a slave in theirs. I think it's about time as a civilization we move on and work toward <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>equal</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->ity.<br>
