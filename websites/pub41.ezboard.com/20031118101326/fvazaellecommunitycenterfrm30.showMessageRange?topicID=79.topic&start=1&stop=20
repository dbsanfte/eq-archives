It basically states that they focused on the WMD as the primary reason to persuade the public that war was necessary.  I've been saying all along that this war has been necessary because of a large number of reasons that all came together.<br>
<br>
Bush became convinced for a variety of reasons that war with Iraq was necessary and in the best interests of the United States.  (These reasons include enforcement of UN resolutions, freeing the Iraqis, WMD's, sending a strong message to terrorists, etc)  Bush began the process of convincing the public the war was necessary using the various reasons for it to different degrees.  He didn't lie about anything, but of course he put emphasis in certain areas.  I still believe that Bush has a clean conscience and that he really believed and still believes that the war was necessary and just.<br>
<br>
I mean, really... If Paul Wolfowitz is the evil imperialist conspirator that you've all made him out to be, why would he say something to undermine the Bush administration in a magazine interview?  Do you think he's a moron?  You may not agree with his views, but he's not that stupid.<br>
<br>
On another note, did you notice how the US will be withdraing its forces from Saudi Arabia now and that that was a major reason for the war according to Wolfowitz?  How does this fit in with your beliefs that the whole war was part of an imperialistic conpsiracy to set up more bases and add more force to the region so we could take over more countries?  Looks like the opposite to me, I see us moving our forces out of the region as soon as they are no longer necessary.<br>

<br>
 &quot;Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.&quot;<br>
- Dick Cheney, August 26 2002<br>
<br>
&quot;If he declares he has none, then we will know that Saddam Hussein is once again misleading the world.&quot;<br>
- Ari Fleischer, December 2 2002<br>
<br>
&quot;We know for a fact that there are weapons there.&quot;<br>
- Ari Fleischer, January 9 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more.&quot;<br>
- Colin Powell, February 5 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, there is no question that we have evidence and information that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical particularly . . . all this will be made clear in the course of the operation, for whatever duration it takes.&quot;<br>
- Ari Fleischer, March 21 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no doubt that the regime of Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. As this operation continues, those weapons will be identified, found, along with the people who have produced them and who guard them.&quot;<br>
- Gen. Tommy Franks, March 22 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;We know where they are. They are in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad.&quot;<br>
- Donald Rumsfeld, March 30 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you have always heard, and you continue to hear from officials, a measure of high confidence that, indeed, the weapons of mass destruction will be found.&quot;<br>
- Ari Fleischer, April 10 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;There are people who in large measure have information that we need . . . so that we can track down the weapons of mass destruction in that country.&quot;<br>
- Donald Rumsfeld, April 25 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;I am confident that we will find evidence that makes it clear he had weapons of mass destruction.&quot;<br>
- Colin Powell, May 4 2003 <br>
<br>
 &quot;Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons.&quot;<br>
- George W. Bush, September 12 2002<br>
<br>
&quot;Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent.&quot;<br>
- George W. Bush, State of the Union address, January 28 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons -- the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not have.&quot;<br>
- George Bush, February 8 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.&quot;<br>
- George Bush, March 17 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;We are learning more as we interrogate or have discussions with Iraqi scientists and people within the Iraqi structure, that perhaps he destroyed some, perhaps he dispersed some. And so we will find them.&quot;<br>
- George Bush, April 24 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;We´ll find them. It´ll be a matter of time to do so.&quot;<br>
- George Bush, May 3 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;I´m not surprised if we begin to uncover the weapons program of Saddam Hussein -- because he had a weapons program.&quot;<br>

No, WMD haven't been found.  But I have to ask, what were the mobile labs for?  You don't need mobile labs to make fertilizer.  I personally think they're either hidden very well, or they're now residing in another country.<br>

You have yet to convince me that such lies occurred, for their own corporate/personal gain or otherwise.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how any reasonable person could see it as anything more than their honest belief that this war was needed for the good of the country.<br>
<br>
I have already seen enough evidence to be 100 percent convinced that Saddam had WMD program.  I don't need to see the weapon itself.  I've always believed that they are too well hidden to find.  If I thought they were easy to find, I'd have advocated an inspections program before going to war.<br>
<br>
I find Tony Blair's argument extremely compelling.  Why would Saddam have endured 12 years of sanctions and all the trouble he got from the international community to hide something that didn't exist and obstruct an inspections program from which he had nothing to hide.  It just makes no sense.<br>

<br>
A) We went to war with Iraq, killing 8000 iraqi civilians and 250 coalition troops, spent 100 billion and mortgaged the goodwill and financial future of the United States, increased Terrorism Worldwide and decreased Worldwide public opinion over 2 trucks that have no traces of Chem or Bio weapons? <br>
<br>
B) As far as tyrants and torture, where is this administrations stance on Zimbabwe, the Congo, Rwanda, North Korea, Pakistan, China etc?<br>
<br>
C) If our goal was humanitarian, then why did we secure the oil fields and oil infrastructure while letting power, water and medical facilities be looted and destroyed?<br>
<br>
And yes, in a way, its the way I feel.

I think it will decrease terrorism, especially in the long term.<br>
<br>
It's not about those 2 trucks.  It's the fact that we know Iraq had WMD's.  Anyone with half a brain can see it's obvious... why else would Saddam have fucked with weapons inspectors for 12 yrs denying them access if he didn't have anything to hide?  Why else would there be documents on preparation of wmd's found as well as mobile labs to prepare them in?  What's another use for a mobile lab?  Why wouldn't he have let us watch when he destroyed all the WMD's we required him to destroy?  It just doesn't add up Herder.<br>

<br>
We have been illegally bombing the north and south of Iraq for the past decade (look in the UN resolutions for a &quot;no fly zone&quot;, you won't find it.)<br>
<br>
We have also had every piece of Intel hardware and software pointed at Iraq for the past 5 years.<br>
<br>
You would think we would KNOW for sure, where they are and where they went.<br>
<br>
So instead of the logical conclusion that the threat was overhyped and used to galvanize public support for the war on Iraq, the white house has been floating possible conspiracy theories.  What a laugh.<br>
<br>
It makes me fucking laugh so hard to see them twist and turn right now.<br>
<br>
Unless you forget, UN weapon inspectors were there for 8 long years.  Saddam didn't kick them out, they left over some administrative argument.<br>
<br>
Who's to say where those trucks came from?  I wonder what the fuck we would find if we did the same thing to our government?<br>
<br>
I think its very bad of the US not to let International Weapon Inspectors come in and look for WMD.  It would lend a lot of credibility to any find as well as HELPING them find them..<br>
<br>
You would think they would welcome any help they can get with respect to locating these so-called weapons.<br>
<br>

There are some things I'm sure our govt. does that I don't want to know about.  I like being able to sleep at night.  But I can guarantee you it's a far cry better that what many other govts have done in the past.  <br>
<br>
As to why we don't intervene in other areas?  I've touched on this before.  We can't be everywhere at once, just not possible.  Why not pick and choose where to intervene.  last I checked, Zimbabwe wasn't a threat to the US.<br>
<br>
As to the oil fields?  That's the lifeblood of the Iraqi people.  If they were to lose that, it would have cost us and the rest of the world billions of dollars more to get Iraq back on it's feet.  At least they have their on source of income.  Oh wait, but we wanted the oil for ourselves right?

We are enforcing UN Resolution 688.  It did not specifically mention no fly zones, they are a creation of the US and its allies to prevent Saddam from causing further injury to his own people (kurds and shiite minorities).<br>

Saddam kicked them out on more than one occasion.  He continually obstructed them and prevented them access to cerrtain sites (whenever they got close to finding anything).  He'd then move stuff out of those sites and then allow them back in later.  Bush got tired of the cat and mouse game and decided to act.<br>

You make it sound like tracking one person is trivial, it's harder than taking over a country.<br>

This is not really the case.<br>
It's much simpler than that.<br>
Every time Saddam kicked out the inspectors<br>
he did so simply to give the finger to the USA<br>
and its allies. Remember, this was the man that defied<br>
the mighty USA, was still in power after the Gulf War<br>
and was seen as an Arab hero because of this.<br>
He simply took great pleasure in tugging the USA's tiny cock<br>
for all those years. It was funny that they just didn't get it.<br>

<br>
Either way, the fact that he kicked out the inspectors and made it impossible to gather the only possible evidence that could have exonerated him, despite our best attempts to get it, makes me entirely unsympathetic.  If he really was clean, and prevented the gathering of the evidence that would have proved it, he shot himself in the foot.  In that case, it's his own doing that got him booted out of power.<br>
<br>
It would be like if a man were on trial for murder.  DNA testing was done that could conclusively convict or exonerate him.  He steals the test results and destroys them before they can be read.  They he claims it's not fair to convict him because of the absence of DNA evidence.  How much sympathy would you have for the guy, and what conclusion would you draw?<br>

Nothing is wrong with that at all.. what many people might think is that it is the double standard that the western nations have regarding 'good murdering villains' and 'evil murdering villains'.

He gave the US the finger for years and got away with it.<br>
He miscalculated the US/UK response in the end.<br>
This was his biggest blunder. He essentially had a veto<br>
in the UN (ie France) and didn't think that the US/UK would <br>
ignore the UN and go it alone.<br>

He had to destroy those WMD's which he admitted to having in the presence of the UN inspectors as mandated by UN resolutions concerning the terms of surrender after the first gulf war.  This was to prove his innocence.<br>
<br>
He kicked out the only people that could have proven compliance, thereby effectively removing the possibility of proving compliance and making it impossible for the US to know conclusively that he had destroyed the WMD's.<br>
<br>
It's his own fault.  He was given a means of showing compliance, he agreed to it, then he failed to live up to it.<br>
