Hey Cure you dumbass sure we were there to kill Cazic Thule dont post shit and try to make us come up with excuses. Like I said in the other post we orginaly planned on doing CT the day before well SF did too they got there first. At the beginning it was told from SF members they were there to clear the plane kill the golems and draco. Later we found out that them and the Endless were going to team up to try CT. Ok so we move on and kill Yelinak.<br>
<br>
your bullshit post about us going to cobalt scar or great divide. Guess what dain wasnt up, klandicar wasnt up, keldorek wasnt up, zlandicar wasnt up sontalak wasnt up, No one had any epic mobs that really needed to die yet. So bascially what was left CT or TOV well everyone wanted CT cause that was the orginal plan and that is what we like doing is killing him. So you damn right we were there waiting. If they would of won who cares we would of logged and been here the next day saying grats guys on ct kill. <br>
<br>
NOW could we of zoned and started spamming shit and putting people down over OOC or Shout sure we could of but we didnt we wanted them to do it and not have it blamed on us in anyway why they failed. You act like sitting in feerott fear portal is a big thing. Who cares we could of been sitting in southro waiting to port over to feerott to run to fear how is this any different well at fear portal fully buffed zone in and kill cazic. Not port over or run over zone in there is a big time difference. And please stop with all your can we all hold hands and sing &quot;We are the World&quot; bs philosophy I mean listen you dont like it hey get off this server pay your 50 dollars and leave man.<br>

On 90% of servers that would never have happened, they would have buffed up otw to fear and rushed in before you guys got to him.  But out of pity we usually give people a first shot.<br>
<br>
So then since we give you one shot you then want more.  But but but one shot isn't enough we deserve one more pleeease or maybe even two more pleeeeease waaa waaa my cazic thule is gone it has been ganked and my phat lewts are now their phat lewts waaa waaa waaa...and it goes on.<br>
<br>
The only servers where this doesn't happen on are ones with a rotation...haha yeah like that'll happen here... =)  I think not...<br>
<br>
Maybe our problem is that we have been too nice, we give a little and you want more.<br>
<br>
And I really like how this flame was posted by cure, and talked about our raids.  We raid everyday of every week and you have been to *two* raids (not counting hate raids, I'm fairly sure the only reason you were invited was they needed a cleric and none of ours were on).  You ever wonder why only two raids?  Because in each of those raids you just openly let a tank die, sometimes you claimed lag, sometimes you just sat there like it didn't happen.  We don't allow clerics who prove themself to have the healing power of a paladin on our raids.  So don't act like we begged you to come, but your morals held you back from coming.  The only thing that held you out of our raids was lack of skill, you'd fit well as a zerg.<br>
<br>
Do you guys not realize these flames do the opposite of what you want?  By flaming us it brings IV closer together and makes us stronger, it gives us a reason to gank that mob.  Oh, wait, you guys think that you're going to suddenly change our veiw on things by flaming?  All of us come from servers where this is done constantly, so save your breathe, nothing is going to change. <p><br><font color=orange><font type=bold>Rhyu</></>

---  In what way were the motives for playing this game in general and for killing Cazic Thule in particular different between in virtue members and sacred fires/endless members who were there?

Very impressive, without the IV site up I wasn't aware you had already killed Klandicar, Zlandicar, Sontalak and Dain, congrats.<br>
<br>
Rhyu, I was on early IV Trak raids, long enough ago I beleive Whisperly is the person that got me invited, I was never grouped with tanks, although Krimzin tried to be one on some Juggs and died in my group, /shrug.  I was there because this is still the first toon I have over 22, it was fun once, got some screenshots, highlight was having my pet live through an entire broken golem fight, Shadye tried to haste the pet too, although seeing as I can't buff it I doubt he can either.<br>
<br>
I'm not into Uber guilds, not my idea of fun, the pinnacle of EQ isn't killing Vulak every 3 days and pondering the Avatar of War on the days in between to my way of thinking.  Seeing as I'm not going to be in IV, I would have accepted Caziel's invitation to join CC as the best I can do if that's what I wanted but it isn't, my tag is EMR.<br>
<br>
Yes I went up on the Hate Raid, invited by Igrum because of a lack of IV Clerics. So? I had fun, that's why I went, that's why I play, Hate is more challenging than VL or Seb, but being a group class I have to go where the groups are.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to tear IV apart, I'm trying to make it clear to the rest of the server to realize they are out for themselves and doing it very well.  It's not a few bad attitudes that get splashed on the boards a lot, it's an entire guild that each and every person values their position in IV and the lewts and trophy kills that can bring above all else.  IV has made the decision to turn inwards and is quite capable of doing so, but if an IV member gets turned down for a group, port, rez or trade it's not because of their tag, it's because of their own actions.  Yet again I don't care, I doubt I will be grouped with IV again and if that means I missed out on a Dragon Necropolis group, such is life; I really don't care what people think of me, if you need a cleric for some fun let me know, cause that's why I play the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucassianadastarte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CassianaDAstarte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 6:23:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> Cure, if you were not involved in the raid in any way... then why does anyone have to answer to you?  *laugh*  Even if you were in the raid, I would never answer to you.<br>

So I'm gonna pharm an extra post.<br>
<br>
First come, first serve.  SF and The Endless are in Fear before you, EMR's patch day action is limited to Hadden so I wasn't on to know the full sequence, I haven't seen anything posted in a thread that would do much to dispute this series of events.<br>
<br>
Sacred Fires goes in Fear, it's their plane, for the first 18 months of EQ quite possibly the hardest zone in the game, it doesn't require port stones, although is a little tricky to leave.  They call in The Endless to assist their raid now setting their sites on Cazic Thule.  They have commited all this time and effort into achieving all they can in Fear, my view which isn't supported by the EULA is that they can stay as long as they want, make as many corpses as they want, invite as many more people as they want until they are done with Fear.  The commitment they have already made in time and manpower entitles them to this, if Eternal Advocates had zoned in first and started killing even slower my opinion is that's the way it's going to be in Fear today.<br>
<br>
Hey if you don't think the Alliance can kill him, log, wake up tomorrow and kill Cazic, you lost 12 to 24h on Cazic assuming no server interupption, /shrug.  But you decided to kill him, or attempt him after the Alliance's first attempt, these actions are legitimate and will strengthen IV, but as much as these policies benefit you to kill more mobs faster understand they won't help you outside of raids; but you shouldn't need help so it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
The point of this rant is that all 33 people made the decision, all 33 people condone these policies, don't blame these policies on a few they are supported by every one of them in their quest for their enjoyment of the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usupacheal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Supacheal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 7:10:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> Wow this thread is getting good, will it pass Befb's?  I THINK NAWT.  But, still good.  <br>
<br>
Here is some philosophy.  <br>
<br>
I believe too many guilds out there aren't sure of what the purpose of their guild is on this server.  On Vazaelle it appears to me that guilds are composed of two feelings.  One being competition with other guilds to be one of the best guilds on the server, second being a friendly guild that enjoys everquest and cares about people's characters and their feelings.  The problem lies within.  <br>
<br>
As a CC member, we do like some competition here and there however many of our guild members work full time jobs or have other interests.  If our spawn gets ganked sometimes we just say, &quot;oh well I gotta get up for work anyways, who cares&quot;  <br>
<br>
I guess what i'm trying to say is, if you wanna bitch about spawns you might wanna re-evaluate what you want as a guild.  If it's being one of the best guilds on the server and being first to an uber mob, your gonna have to step on some toes to do it because IV isn't going to lie down and let anyone have the spawn.  They play strictly on competition and you are going to have to either play on the same level or &quot;get off the court.&quot;  Whether you like them or not, I doubt IV will back down to a mob they want.  I would think some of the other guilds won't either.  <br>

In virtue has always been a free for all guild supporting the one try policy, its fairly obvious if people didnt agree with this policy they wouldnt be in the guild.  Your other point appears to be some sort of half-assed black-balling threat that even you admit has little meaning given that we are mostly 60 and in any case can and have gained xp self-sufficently.  And its good to see you still cant answer a simple question.<br>
<br>
Herder:  I see his point, at least I think I do.  I simply dont agree with it, at all.  I dont see anything wrong with killing a mob that someone else failed to.  And I dont see any difference in the motivations of the people failing vs the people succeeding.  Again I point out, if the fun of a big fight was the only, motivation, there were tons of big fights around that were not contested on the night in question.  If both people want an item_, say cazic loot, competition is the method I endorse to determine who should have it.  Thats all.  <p>Procax

<br>
My question is why not combine these two ideas into one.  They can easily mesh with each other.  Theres nothing wrong or hard in my opinion in being not only the best guild on server but also caring about other peoples feelings.  You can be the dominant guild and yet have everyone like you because you are cool with everyone else.  That would be the ideal situation.  <br>

My answer was first come, first serve, not saying you can't have loot on the server, saying the people that commit to it first should be entitled even it takes them longer than another force would, no this isn't supported by the EULA, Saalron explained about holding aggro kiting to make this confirm with the EULA but I don't think that's the solution.<br>
<br>
No the black-ball comment is from another thread, IV members felt they were black-balled by Endless.  Any people who did participate in this from the Endless or not, didn't black-ball those people because of what IV did, they did based on what that person did.  I'm not one of them if there are any, the posts seemed to be sure such a policy was in place.  My two most recent contacts with IV, perhaps my last now, /shrug was a group with Supaa in DN where he got a Mask of War and turning down rezzing Vulp in Unrest because my group was porting to Skyfire for an HS group.<br>
<br>
Most people view IV as focused, driven, goal-oriented, sometimes use other words; but from conversations with people on Vaz I have found that many isolate the leadership and the vocal members of VCC in one group and the remainder of the guild in another.  No they are not, whether you were the person, I'm assuming Krimzin that called for the ports to CT and Ferroot or the last person to zone over your focus in the game is clear to me, I hope it is more so to others now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ughol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/01 8:05:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real People</span><hr size=1> -----------------------------<br>
Fact.<br>
1). 90% of the people who enjoy slamming us so badly would join us in a second.<br>
2). Life has consequences. Don't ecpect to be treated with courtesy from those that you crucify.<br>
3). IV has done the nice thing. Many of you have stated how we have changed and you are right. Look back on these boards to the days when we were all lovey dovey and you see the same assholes ripping on us. <br>
----------------<br>
<br>
I think Kaziqueal hit the nail on the head with that...... the guys who rip into us we used to help or theyve tried to join us, they used to ask us constantly for information and help and its like.... why bother? so you can nail us to the cross? feh.<br>
<br>
want me to be an asshole? great i care. im an asshole :P i can also be nice, just like everyone here. this conversation like so many others isnt right vs wrong but right vs left, with infinitely many perspectives and people arguring what shade of blue the sky really is it doesnt matter anymore. we will never see eye to eye. everyone who argues is wrong as much as they are right. <br>
<br>
we took cazic, we had been planning to do it all day, and if SF wasnt there we wouldve clearled fear and done it (it takes us 2 hours or less to clear fear, waiting for SF/TE took longer than it wouldve been for us to do it ourself, but we waited). if you dont like that or how we do things thats really too bad but we arent going anywhere and we arent doing things any differant just because some guild is crying over it. this is In Virtue and we arent changing, so deal with it. <br>
<br>
what you see is what you get.<br>
<br>
as for Cazic and us taking him, had Cazic been trak or VS do you think endless wouldve given agony so many chances to try either? yeah i can hear kaminya telling agony oh, go ahead... you beat us to him but we want you to learn so take as many tries as you want trying to kill him. <br>
<br>
it wouldnt happen. not because endless is trying to buttfuck agony, but because they want the mob. we wanted cazic. if you dont like that im really sorry, i dont care enough about your fun to get off by ruining it. im doing my own thing just as every other guild and player is, and its really disgustingly conceited to think we actually go around just trying to ruin your fun. grow up. <br>
<br>
what you see is what you get, if you dont like it then learn to live with it or learn to ignore it.<br>
<br>
 IV isnt going anywhere.<br>

You may not like the way IV plays but they do play within the rules of the game.  What's that saying?  &quot;Don't hate the playah, hate the game.&quot;  <br>

Crying and bitching will get you nowhere.  It appears to feed egos and make people more hungry and malicious (sp?).  <br>
<br>
...BUT!  It sometimes feels good to get things off your back.  This is a rant &amp; flame board...  no?  <br>
<br>
Anyway...  After stepping away from things--the view gets a lot clearer.  As many have said, it's not about right or wrong--good or bad...  it's about playing a game.  People play the game in different styles, times and for different reasons.  We all play to have fun...  I just hope that you all work together and communicate more and be civil.  <br>

Take care all!  Bes' wishes...  <br>

Yes I do know we would have waited to be quite honest Ghol.  In fact if they were there at the mob we most likely wouldnt go at all and if we did it would be to wait until they were done with their attempts.  How do I back up what I just said.  Ask PO if they felt we were waiting for them to fail VS.  Ask them why we were rezzing them.  Let me tell you it was so they could have a second shot.  You are not stating fact you are stating what ifs.  Like I said before, we have never waited on someone to fail a try so we could move in.  Rather then saying would we have done something, state where we have done it.<br>
<br>

<br>
I have no problem at all with competition.  I suppose my view of it is just different.  I believe you can have competiton and still be honorable about things.  For example football.  I might be able to lay a dirty hit and take out their Quaterback (cough that defensive linemen who laid that hit on Gannon in the playoffs) to win, but is that really a cool thing to do?  I suppose I just dont want to win that bad.  <br>
<br>
Games have rules I agree, but its what we do with those rules.  That responsibilty falls on the players.  We choose how we want to apply those rules.  We make the decisions.  Like I said I still feel it is very possible to play the game and maintain both a comepetitive and uber guild while being respectful of others.  I think its not done because its the harder rode to travel.  <br>

<br>
IV wants to kill Vulak or wherever the bar is set with the new expansion, in fact they want to do both.  They want to do it as fast as possible and the rest of Vaz is with them or in the way.<br>
<br>
Now read Ghol's post again, now Ghol sends you a tell in game, can you help me kill the dorf hairdresser for my curlers of doom quest.  Not saying you can't help him, not saying Ghol can't be a nice guy but you're investing time in helping someone who will kill a mob to get some toy that to your guild is a huge 15h challenge.  I can get Hadden under half in one second, gonna have trouble ganking the EMR raids, but I'm the exception, why I made the post, I don't like raids, I'm here because there isn't a new server for me to do 1 to 60 again with no twinks and first yaks get shouted across zones.<br>
<br>
Serial is gone, Majin is back in IV, Rakot found a home in Agony, Paden in CC, even Gaeelae is guilded.  I'm back with what works for me only unguilded player who leveled to 60 on this server (EMR has 1 active player).<br>
<br>
I have no problem with the stance, EULA has no problem with the stance, I do have a problem if you aren't honest about it, shout it from the rooftops we are In Virtue and we only care about us, enjoy the benefits and face the consequences of this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessageRange?topicID=11.topic&start=161&stop=178>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showPrevMessage?topicID=11.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showNextMessage?topicID=11.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.threadControl?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24>VCC Archives</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
