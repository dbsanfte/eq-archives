<br>
Is it more fun being 60 or getting to 60?  Is it more fun having an item or working to get it?<br>
<br>
For me it is the journey and not the destination.  If the journey is not fun, I will not take the first steps.  I pretty much have stopped doing quests and camping rare spawns.  (My last quested item was the Paw of Opolla - quite some time ago.)  Now that I am reaching a level where I should be starting my epic, I have found that I have lost all interest in doing so.  Perhaps this will change in a while, but right now I am more interested in trying new tactics and seeing new places.<br>
<br>
So, for the rest of you, is it the journey or the destination?<br>

<br>
The journey also determine where the destination will be ,  the journey itself will affect the destination you will reach .  The more you try to skip on the journey the more the destination will suck in my opinion. <p>-------------------------- <BR>

If you are going to the bathroom or to a late night booty call: definitely the destination.<br>
<br>
However, if you are going to the electric chair, its the journey. <p>Herder

<br>
You have to enjoy logging in and dealing with friends you have online.  XP is a grind, if you aren't enjoying it it becomes as bad as another job.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of things that happen in the endgame that are just a rush.  Killing a big mob the first time is awesome, the teamwork and execution give you a total rush that you can't get in the early game.<br>
<br>
The first true 'epic' encounter in this game is Lord Nagafen.  24 - 4x people get together and do something major together, and for a lot of people, it just fuels them onward.<br>
<br>
As with everything in life, I think its a balance between the journey and the destination.<br>
<br>
Then again, some of the happiest EQ players I know are still in their 30's a year after this server went up.  They RP and just do certain things with friends.  For them the journey is the destination.<br>

But definately must have the journey first.  I am a fairly new player and am really enjoying earning my levels, exploring, etc.  A friend of mine, on the other hand, is really in being power leveled and is desperate for a high level character.  In my opinion, however, you lose out on a lot of experiences that you need to go through to understand how to play your character correctly, let alone develop your character's own individuality.  For example, my ranger has a curse regarding water.  I have more problems around water than most people ever will and a lot of it has been through learning experiences and just really funny happenstance.  It has now become an ongoing joke among the people that I play with regularly.  This little bit of fun would never have happened if I had gone through power-leveling.<br>
<br>
Learning the ropes has also helped me in learning my ranger's limitations.  What is and is not effective given a certain circumstance.  Although it has been offered to me, I have decided that power leveling is just not for me.  Getting to that destination of earning a new skill or spell is just that much sweeter by taking the journey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utreeslover.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 663<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/02 3:58:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1747.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it the Journey or the Destination?</span><hr size=1> For me it's definitely both.  <br>

I love my druid and she's 60.  There was depress time from 52-60 since that's the first time I realized that I can't always group with ayiar or duo wit him anymore.  He was far more popular than me since he's a warrior.  <br>
<br>
Now, we are both 60 and we do aa xp, raiding together.  Our lvls, new aa skills, and tov armors does help to make the destination more fun though.<br>
<br>
I love to lvl up my mage too.  What makes a journey good?  It's definitely the xp group or mobs you are fighting.  There are classes that you can solo so if you really can't find a group, then go solo.  For the ones who can't solo.  Find a popular zone and try to find a group there.  If everything fails, play an alt or just go out and have a drink/movie something like that.  A night away from EQ isn't a bad thing.  Unless you are like me, away from EQ 5 days a week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Raiya -- the Treeslover of Vazaelle

I played a halfling druid on the 7th hammer server. He was fun, but being around twinks all the time got old quickly. I only made 1 friend in 22 levels due to he started the game the same time I did and was not twinked. I was given a SSB, SSoY, etc at level 18 for healing a level 50 sk while he was fighting a SG. Shortly after obtaining better gear then PW and leather, it got boring cause I did not do itmyself. I quit him and sold his gear to get a erudite mage some gear. He was fun to play till like 19 but around about that time, the first epic I ever saw was just obtained(Cleric epic) and started thinking that being a twink was not really worth it, and I got bored quickly after that. I started a woodelf warrior and got him to 14, and then twinked him and got bored again.....then Vazalle came out.<br>
<br>
I decided I wanted to do what people first did when the game first got out. I started a Woodelf Bard, but he was not my cup of tea, so I started Teapoo. I found it alot more fun playing as a newbie and working for my gear. I remember getting my Bullsmasher(server first?) like 2 days after the server came up. I spent all my money on smithing, and finnaly got a full suit of banded around 20ish. I felt so proud the first time I was able to hunt Highpass and kill orcs for phat lewts. I kept on doing tradeskills and roleplaying and found that was much more fun then leveling. As I got on in levels (I was about ready to quit Teapoo at 28 since I COULD NOT get past that goddang level.) but finnaly obtained 29. I got my first peice of crafted (got it with a few friends, go crafted bracers) around 26, and a almost full suit around 33(with help of my old guild Enlighted Darkness) and a crafted BP around 45. After that it got kind of slow, I really hate exping nonstop for 6 hours so it took me like 3 months to get to 54, when I quit. I really never reached the &quot;destination&quot; but it is much more fun to be low level newbie instead of doing the exp grind. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=blue strength=5);font-family:arial;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'11pt'">
