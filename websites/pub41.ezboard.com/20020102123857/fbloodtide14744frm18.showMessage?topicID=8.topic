The great glassed dome high above let in the last wan rays of the sun as the land prepared for night. The hallway echoed hollowly as someone approached, boots clicking on the cold marble floor. He paused at the entrance leaning on the rich burnished oaken doors, his robes rustling and settling about him. An amused grin played across his face as his green flecked eyes took in the rows upon rows of benches. Some worn almost through, and other still coated in their original veneer. The dark cherrywood benches had seen many of the most important events in the Blood Tide. The forming of the guild. The admittance of members both new and old. The bestowing of gifts, and many, many, planning sessions for the raids and events that had helped carve the name of the Blood Tide into the memory of the peoples of Norrath.<br>
<br>
He moved forward slowly, his golden boots clicking on the polished marble, and striding to the center where he gazed down at the tiles he himself had placed there with the original members. He smiled inwardly to himself, remembering the sweating and effort it had taken, but finally the engraving had been done. He dropped to one knee and ran his hands over the red stone words.<br>
<br>
“Veritas Oportet Paro Te Libertas “<br>
<br>
The truth shall set you free.<br>
<br>
What dreams he’d had so long ago. From a small gathering of friends, to the mighty host that now stretched from the frigid planes of Everfrost, to the simmering depths of the emerald jungle. Much had been accomplished in it’s time on Norrath. They had done many things, laughed and celebrated their numerous victories, and wept at their losses. Some had found comfort and warmth in each others arms, others stood as solitary guardians of the guild. So many people, so many good times.<br>
<br>
He raised up slowly from the floor, and continued his slow stride to the head of the chamber. His chair looked the same, a high backed stiff affair with rich black leather coverings. Small etchings adorned the top, and ruled along the sides telling the tale of the formation of the Blood Tide. Red tassles, bound in gold thred hung from the ends of the arms. Though uncomfortable he had managed to bear up with the addition of some cushions. He fondly recalled the many cups of ale drunk over tales told of far off lands and of valorous deeds done in the name of the Blood Tide. He would sit here in this very chair as, Sigarr more often than not, recounted some farcical adventure or teased the ladies with naughty stories of maids and knight errants. His hand came up to stroke the arm of the chair. His fingers lingered over the gems encrusted along the sides, their sparkle seeming to have died in the gloom of twilight.<br>
<br>
His mouth twitched into an even greater grin as his eyes took in his staff. It was leaning against the right side of the throne almost casually. He had almost not noticed it, so commonplace was it. Many trials it had seen, and he had carried it through both fire and frost. It had stood the test of time again and again. He took it in his hands, and swung it a few times, feeling somewhat comforted by it’s assuring and familiar feel in his hands. So many, many, good times…<br>
<br>
Sighing to himself, he placed it back, the tip resting in it’s accustomed spot, the polished worn through to the original wood from so many years of leaning there, taken up only when he had to leave on business, or to lead at the front lines. It was here that it belonged. It was even more a part of this place than he was. Something just didn’t feel right taking it with him. It was as if he would be parting two old friends from each other. Along those same lines of thought, he took off his purple robes and carefully folded them. With a final pat, and a flick of a finger to remove a mote of dust, he placed it down on the seat of his throne. Yes, this was much better.<br>
<br>
He raised his arms, luxuriating in the freedom the robe confined, and turned in a slow circle, taking a last long look at the carvings, tapestries, and statues that adorned the upper walls. Then he strode from the chamber. The doors clicked shut behind him as the full dark of night cloaked the chamber in blackness.<br>
<br>
Speeding along the hall, he began to run for the entryhall. His boots stuttered an uneven rhythm, and he whooped for glee. Now was not a time for sadness but for joy. Free at last. In a daring move, he even did a couple of cartwheels along the way. He jumped out the doors at the front of the hall, and then turned, gasping at the effort his run had cost him but grinning foolishly nonetheless. From a pouch at his belt, the withdrew a platinum key and slowly shut the great bronze doors. They closed with a merry clang, and he inserted the key in the lock and turned it once. The lock snapped into place with a soft snikt, and he withdrew the key. Patting the door gently, he ran a hand over the carved surface still warm from the rays of the sun.<br>
<br>
Good times, so many good times.<br>
<br>
He sank down and sat with his back resting comfortably against the grand doors and thought of the people that had started all this. Running the length and breadth of Antonica with Walador and Kelick. The tiny Phebos, and the mighty Sigarr. Sinorf and Magyar, that inseperable couple from the chilly environs of Halas. Spioctor, Harcon and Radcliffe, stout men with even stouter hearts. The wily Kaldow, and Skywise the gentle druid.  Sabretooth, another one whom was true to the cause, and Borak. Dear, dear, Borak who had more heart than his gruff demeanor ever expressed. So many people, so many good times. Remember…remember…<br>
<br>
He pulled out a wineskin, unstoppering it he took a long swallow and listened to the crickets beginning their orchestra in the surrounding grass. Remember Leviath, and chasing frogs in lower Guk, or the Minotaurs of the gorge. Vanquishing the vile Seafury Cyclops with Coakhan pulling the great beasts to us on the islands in the Ocean of Tears, and the many disastrous trips to Perma….<br>
<br>
Remember…remember…<br>
<br>
Slaying our first hill giant. Gods, but we were so excited. That great beast had fallen to us, and the surge of joy could be clearly seen on the faces of everyone. Then on to the firegiants and Tianna ducking and weaving as her bladed poked and pierced the great beasts flesh. The times spent in quiet talk over cups of wine, and the few weddings that he had been privileged to attend.<br>
<br>
Remember…remember…<br>
<br>
Memories flashed in his mind, the entire history of the Blood Tide passing before his eyes as he sat there, the stones of the steps growing cold in the evening night. It wasn’t cold, and he smiled softly to himself thinking of all the people he had known here in Norrath.<br>
<br>
So many good time, so many good memories…<br>
<br>
Getting up from the stone floor, he shook the last drops of wine into his mouth and blinked a few times to adjust his eyes to the night. He let the wineskin drop to the ground and then hopped around while he pulled off his boots. There, much better. He wiggled his toes, and then hopped down onto the grass feeling a refreshing surge course through him and the blades cooled his feet. Ah he had almost forgotten.<br>
<br>
Taking the key to the front door from it’s well worn place at his side, he remounted the steps and then placed it slowly into the lock. Once that had been accomplished, he took a scroll from his hip sack and then hung it from the key with a small cord he had attached to it earlier in the day. Then whistling to himself he strode off down the path, his bare feet making no sound at all and disappeared into the surrounding forest.<br>
<br>
A slight breeze was all it took, and the scroll wavering to and fro unfurled to flap in the breeze. The words set to parchment were of the costliest gold ink. It was a good thing that there were not so many words as to have bankrupted the author. They read:<br>
<br>
“So many good times, so many good memories. Remember….remember me…”<br>

The stories come when I get an idea in my head. They started out really badly (Tide I), but got progressively better.<br>
<br>
I think the one that I enjoyed writing the most was Totemic Spirits. Tide IV I was in a bit of a rut, so the whole combat sequence really needs a rewrite. I guess on the whole, I'm not DISpleased with the stories, but there's a whole lot that could be added to them, or even rewritten completely.<br>
<br>
Glad someone enjoys them =) <p>Zalbar The Mad
