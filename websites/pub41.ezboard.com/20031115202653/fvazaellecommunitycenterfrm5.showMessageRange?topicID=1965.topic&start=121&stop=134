<br>
Thankfully, Rasc, I find myself unable to sleep at 10:30pm central time and you have become the focal point of all my days stress. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your life's story on Vazaelle.<br>
<br>
First, You were a sub par shaman when I first met you about 2 years ago on Vaz, and you are a sub par shaman now. I can see how Some view your skills as solid, as nowadays any idiot can play a shaman decently well in an exp group. With the addition of new spells, and not to mention mana pool, regen rate, and hp/ac garnered from AA and your gear, the difficulty of playing a shaman today PALES in comparison to playing one in pre PoP. (Friendly neighborhood shaman plz chime in if you disagree with this statement) I am ,however, a perfectionist. I don't pass out comments to people about their class often. I think the majority of shaman on this server fall under the level of sub par - par.<br>
<br>
Second, you have always been an individual that has placed himself before his guild. There is nothing wrong with that, persay, but when you attempt to pass yourself off as something else, then you are being a hypocrit. Y<br>
<br>
ou were never very suppotive on raids in EA, always waiting for another shaman to get there so you could slack off. This is not only an insult to your guild, but also to the other shaman in guild who take some sense of pride in what they do, and enjoy being part of the team.<br>
<br>
You are a self claimed individualist. Which is fine. However I urge you to carefully consider the path you have chosen. You can choose to be alone in the world, ' bleeding hate ' and keeping everyone at bay. Living an exisistence like that will bring you neither happiness nor contentment but despair, agony, and a tarring of your soul, weighing you down to the earth only to be consumed by the great mother, and recycled into the universe. OR you can embrace the fact that you, as are all of us, are fallable and can make mistakes. We are emotional creatures that swing from left to right wildly as we pick our way through this world. you have so much hate inside of you and yet you continue to attract more to you. Dont you see that you aren't rising higher, you are just creating a perspective that is solely your own, one of everyone peing pushed down. In reality Rasc, that isn't happening. You are just pushing yourself back back back back away from everyone.<br>
<br>
One day you will hit a wall, and there won't be anywhere else to go but forward. You'll be forced to take a different approach with people. I honestly hope you don't reach that point. And I forgive you for bringing this hate on yourself.<br>

Dear Camp Counselor Bozz,<br>
I am happy to write that I have one never been in groups with you luckily.   I would like to thank you for the many tells asking for buffs.   You didn't get the way shaman buff group leaders and not individual fucktards that send tells.   Clearly you were pissed I ignored your tells.  You are very nice to point out the shaman class is so easy to play now probably the reason you wanted to buy Wovoka's account.   <br>
<br>
You almost didn't get guilded because of your asshole reputation.   Ask all people that were guilded in FU if you need examples.   Were you pissed because I offered you shaman advice when you were trying to level your pathetic alt shaman?

I wasn't going to dignify this with a response; but decided a rebuttle was needed. She is actively trying in a market significantly more difficult than yours/mine at this moment. She has above-par skills in web design. That is a TOUGH market here in Denver, &amp; her market is significantly worse.<br>

I appreciate you adding your two cents as it always broken down like this is an advise column.   Good ole Sly the nice guy.    I admire someone that sticks up for thier guild and shows commitment.   Does this win you something?   Not sure anything you added really effects anything here do you?   I just respond to posts guess that makes me an attention whore.   Clearly you have all the facts and know what I am about  Don't think so... you really are just echoing shit that has already been covered like everyone else.   Thanks for the late reply of what everyone else has already covered.   I would recommend a leadership role rather than a follower role.  It confuses me that you actually come here and add two cents when you don't even have one.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slyorion>Slyorion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 6:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1965.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Does this win you something?

<br>
Of course life isn't rainbows and roses for everyone all the time, so perceptions of myself, or anyone for that matter are going to drastically differ based on the current circumstance, state of the individual being observed, as well as teh state of the observer.  there are countless variables one could go into but, alas, it seems that you are getting exactly what you want.  <br>
<br>
You have put the focus on someone else, instead of on yourself where it needs to be.  <br>
<br>
I 'll sum up your assesment of me, however, before I adress the other aspects of your post.<br>
<br>
I would rather be someone who is loved + hated, than someone with no spine, unwilling to back up their words and take responsibility for their actions.<br>
<br>
If I recall correctly, the only advice you offered me about my twink shaman was the selling of some shaman items.  Were you upset that I didn't buy them from you?  Why does this fact sting you so much?  It seems to be a sore spot in you and I urge you to ask ' why do I care if Bozzhawg buys my items or not?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't need to ask you about playing a shaman.  I play with the best all the time.   From Nuthin and Thynn when server frist opened, to Krol, Adnaphel, Liltonto, Kaysha, Mukkrakk, Darkoth, Loonix, and Tumtum.  Not to mention Mudcrush on Nameless. I'm sure there are others but I choose to put only names of Shaman that I have grouped with extensively, those that have show remarkable resillence in teh face of overwhelming odds.  Those that I have seen grow and truly explore the intricacies of their class, as well as how to adapt to different group dynamics.  Those willing to take risks.<br>
<br>
These qualaties I have never seen in you, nor have they been seen by anyone who is willing to speak about them.  That dosen't deny their existence, perhaps they are still lieing dorment, a small spark of brilliance that you continue to snuff out.  <br>
<br>
Take a breath and remeber that you only have one life.  Keep working at it and good things will come to you. <p>Magelo: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=219676">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=219676 </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=topstermindflex>TopsterMindflex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://forums.darkenbane.com/avatar.php?userid=36&dateline=1029667290" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 7:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1965.topic&index=126>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forums.darkenbane.com/avatar.php?userid=36&dateline=1029667290 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Why don't you just fucking write the name of the person you're replying to instead of pasting his entire 3 page post above your one paragraph reply.<br>

<br>
loyalty, caring, a good listener, and compassion<br>
<br>
to the person who has barked out anything but meaningful, inciteful or compassionate posts toward those whom he played alongside, died and triumphed beside, for so many months. The person who ditched his guild in a fit of cursing and temper because a small guild pickup hit on a Kunark dragon decided to wait for another member one zone away to come join the raid. <br>
<br>
Perhaps it was simply an abrasion of two very different personalities, and yet rather than simply ignore or try to avoid her, he constantly and viciously jabs at her real life struggles and bares them tauntingly to the public on VCC. How can you call such a person compassionate and a good listener? Perhaps he is if you are in his good graces, but I implore you to believe me when I say, the moment he perceives you of having insulted or gone against him, he will just as viciously stab your back without a second of remorse.<br>

I had never once exchanged bad words of any kind with Rascalan while he was guilded, or afterwards, and yet because of a statement in a post I made that he found disagreeable, I am immediately a 'dumb fuck' and whatever else he came up with. Should you get on his bad side for one reason or another, do not delude yourself into thinking he will not just as quickly attribute those names to you as well. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18980"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.doordolt.com/~jfrank/images/glittersig2.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Ralandar I respect your opinion.  I don't have a problem with ya bro.  Great that you feel that way there are only certain people that tick me off.   If you are one of those people you can go to hell.  Hell we can carpool I will drive you personally.   For those I give a shit about it is differant.  The people that know me don't have issues with me.  I am not here to win a popularity contest so really it is irrelavent to me what others think.   I do take people's opinions here seriously such as Sly and yourself.   Hell even Bozz posted sincere thoughts and I really can't argue with that.  I don't really fued with the people that make this game fun and can actually function as real people.  Thanks for the feedback.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prybutok@vazaellecommunitycenter>Prybutok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1745<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 12:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1965.topic&index=133>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://prybutok.homestead.com/files/djprymini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: aye</span><hr size=1> I admit that reading Rascalan's posts here is kinda weird for me because I've never known him to talk like this in game or in private guild message boards.<br>

That is not to say if you get on their bad side, they cant be complete annoying assholes to you.  I mean if you waste you time posting pages on pages here in rebuttal, they have gotten what they want.<br>
<br>
And why its not funny that board stuff is not being posted here, that movie clip was a hell of a laugh.  My guess on the whole sal issue is that hes probally in the damn guild, really did we notice it last time....is he a good roleplayer....yeah he fucking is......just get used to the posts....ignore it...other guilds have the same shit on their boards, they are just a lil bit more lucky when it comes to it being posted everywhere.  The fun part is wondering wtf it might be.<br>
