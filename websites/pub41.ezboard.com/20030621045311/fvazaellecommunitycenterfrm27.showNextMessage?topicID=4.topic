But day-by-day Vindayyan managed deftly slipping through life’s sudden and unpredictable hardships with a thin smile on his face, all the while the hate and contempt within him stormed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If only his mother could know his thoughts he mused. She would kill him for sure with out warning or so much as a second thought. And that suited him just fine, her world was drawing ever closer to an inexorable end and she didn’t even know it. The shear deliciousness of that thought rolled through his mind and brought him endless pleasure. All the years of being slighted by his younger and supposedly more gifted brother were nearly over. His foolish matriarch didn’t even know he could now wield magic as well as any of his siblings. Granted it wasn’t the wizardry of his brother or the clerical arts of his sisters but it was a powerful magic all the same. This magic did not flow from their frail goddess whim, no this magic came crashing down on him from He who would soon replace the spider queen. There were no fiery blasts in this magic or smiting blows; no this was a magic of pure base purpose. A magic of corruption decay and malignancy and he would use it to destroy them all; they would never understand what had come to be.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Vindayyan” his mother hissed in his mind to let him know she was once again displeased with his service. No doubt his sisters had already gathered in her sanctum to watch her daily berating of the weaker male child. The though made what was to come even more unpleasant and he bit down into his tongue to stifle his growing ire. Best to be on his way he thought as his emotions cooled to an icy glaze. Time was growing short and he could endure his torment a little longer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother how have I failed you” Vindayyan gushed with absolute sincerity and a slight shimmer of fear as he fell to one knee before his mothers throne. The trepidation in his voice so believable that it gave rise to suspicion. All the eyes in the room fell on him at once like circling vultures they eagerly awaited the chance to tear into him but none dared move till their mother had her say. The silence was long and impenetrable. He shifted his weight slightly and began to lift his eyes from the floor when a blow fell. A swift sharp smack ripped into his face sending him sprawling to the left. “Vindayyan my foolish son how many times will you fail me before I have had enough of you” his mother yelled. “Do I need to break you yet again for you to remember to perform your duties correctly?” “But I..” he began but was silenced by a crushing blow from his eldest sister Zarena’s foot to the back of his head. “NO excuses” his mother yelled “Ill hear no more of your whiny lies about your sisters, do you think your worthy to even look upon them” “No mother” he whispered through the pain holding back his hate. I will tear you apart bit by bit when your day comes mother he thought, oh yes you will die helpless and screaming. “I don’t like the look in his eyes” Zarena scoffed “ perhaps it is finally time for Kilvdayyen to become firstborn mother” Vindayyan braced for the worst knowing his life could end at any second. Zarena had a special distain for him he knew thought the others cared for him little more. To quell his growing anguish, he pictured his sister’s fate. I will cut out their eyes then sever their hands and feet and sell them as common whores he thought and nearly smiled. The thought enabled him to remain calm on the surface but the length of his mothers pause had him deeply troubled. “No my daughter not today, we have many enemies and there is something afoot that I have not yet discovered” “We have need of your brother for now, discarding our best blade before a fight is foolish thing we will not do” his mother instructed. “No take him and teach him to be more repentant, do whatever you wish but don’t break anything that you cant fix and make him whole when you are thru we may have need of him shortly”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was the middle of what passed for night when Vindayyan made his way back to his spartan quarters. His wounds had been healed by their clerical skills yet they still burned with unnatural warmth. It had been a living hell but he had endured. Fueled on by rigid memories of the voice that had come to him in the night and told him there was another way, the voice of the one who had given him magic. Zarena had taken such pleasure with her whips chains and hammers and when she had brought out the hooks he had almost begged to die. But she had failed, while she tried to crush his spirit he had been far away in a place she couldn’t touch. The voice of his new father had told him that two dark princes were coming and after them nothing would ever be the same again. One prince would release the father’s hatred upon this world the other would bring chaos for those that did not know his face or hear his word. They were the thing that was amiss that his mother searched for but could not divine. They were close and their hour nearly at hand; this abomination of a world was finished. Thus he knew what he must now do and quickly. It was time to join his lot with theirs. However they would not readily accept him coming from whence he did, so a fitting offering was needed. There would be no sleep for Vindayyan tonight; he smiled. There was much to do and little time, he was going to be a very busy bee.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kilvdayyen’s study was in the far corner of the family compound not far from his sister’s retreat. It was modest sized structure, which his mother felt befit the worth of her magically talented son. Here Kilvdayyen would disappear for days sometimes weeks on end to study and practice his art and sharpen his skills. He was rumored to be a wizard of considerable power and that alone kept the small houses in line. A powerful wizard could be a terrible thing to face in battle. But Vindayyan secretly questioned his worth. Kilvdayyen had never faced any real challenge in his life. He was the pampered son who had been frugally rolled out to put down minor uprisings from time to time. He could never comprehend the wet work that Vindayyan had done over his many years of service. He would never feel the warmth of a victim’s blood or see their eyes roll back into their head as they slipped from this life. Their screams would never reach his ears, nor their begging for mercy or endless sobbing. No in Vindayyan’s eyes his was a far to pampered and sterile life. It was time for a change he thought.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The warmth of Vindayyan’s healed wounds gave him new life as he slipped through the shadows around the clerics retreat. The torture had been bad but it had served its purpose. Did his mother and sisters really think he was daft enough to have not completed his evening rounds? Plans within plans he thought; and the smile slipped onto his lips. He had begun to let his duties slip months ago and endured the beatings and torture that he received to convince them of his ineptness. The beatings would make destroying his own ilk easier in the end. He felt little loyalty to them to begin with and this world frowned on any emotional attachments but still he felt it would make the end feel more rewarding if he was passionate about it.  His perceived ineptness had removed him from suspicion of sedition in his mothers eyes although she sensed betrayal at ever turn now. But most importantly, tonight his work had come to term; it had allowed him the chance to get close to his brother without being noticed. His sisters had beaten and tortured him worse than ever before. They had all taken part in it and reveled in it for hours. Now their seemingly insatiable blood lust filled they had retired early for the night exhausted.  Tired from the beatings and glowing with the lust of pains inflicted they slept. Now there would be no chance that one of them was about to see what was to befall the second born male.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kilvdayyen was alone which didn’t surprise his brother as he slipped into the study and drew near. “Vindayyan why have you disturbed me” he angrily spat the words out barley glancing up at his brother or bothering to take notice. Vindayyan felt he had been correct in his assessment of his brother. His poor antiseptic world would never allow him to anticipate what was about to happen. Still glancing down at the arcane book before him he continued to hiss “leave now and I’ll not tell mother that you have trespassed where you know better ..” His words fell silent and his eyes turned up at the sound of Vindayyan’s deep full laughter and the drawing of a blade. “What….. What’s this…”? Kilvdayyen stammered caught off guard by unexpected events. Vindayyan knew his brother was not stupid nor did he expect him to dally long. He clenched his free hand into a claw and began to recite the cryptic chant words his unseen father had taught him.  Kilvdayyen waited only a second longer, through growing confusion he began to cast a spell to cut down his brother and end this impossible thing that was occurring before him. <br>
But his casting was sluggish, his mind elsewhere, where, why, how could his dullard brother be casting a spell? It had taken him years of training to be able to cast the smallest of them his brother had not been trained. He had never gone to the academy so how could be doing this? The answers eluded Kilvdayyen yet he was sure of what his brother was doing. He could feel the magic flowing about him powerful but different than his own. It was not the brilliant electric pulse of a wizard’s magic he felt but something cold, wet, foul and ungainly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slowed by Kilvdayyen’s confusion Vindayyan finished first. Shadows leapt from the floor and corners howling as they bit into his brother’s form and began to tether him down. His motions slowed to an unperceivable crawl as amorphous blobs of shadowy darkness twisted around him, latched on and spit out tendrils to bind him to his surroundings. Quickly, Kilvdayyen lost all mobility, even the soft tissue of his lips and the tip of his tongue were bound by the iron strands of shadow. “Surprised” Vindayyan asked as he closed on his helpless sibling. ”Don’t worry” he said “Your not half as surprised as mothers going to be.” “Now I need your heart” Vindayyan stated emphatically to his helpless brother” there’s world of change coming and you’re the price of my admission” Things had gone fast Vindayyan thought and a open mouth grin spread across his face for he first time in his life. He would make this last a while he thought looking at his blade; he had the time. Helpless Kilvdayyen began to moan, but this did not surprise or alarm Vindayyan. He’d seen all this before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vindayyan>Vindayyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 528<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/03 11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> nice $$</span><hr size=1> Dude!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pakman420>pakman420</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Shady</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/19/03 2:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nice $$</span><hr size=1> very nice.<br>
