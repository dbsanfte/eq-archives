It seems there are no guilds that kill these dragons when they spawn and this must change (if there is they sure aren't killing them very quickly)!  Like I said this group would not recognize guild tags, any and all are welcome.  <br>
<br>
I basically want to form a network of friends who would like to do some raids with people from other guilds and meet people on your server.  Maybe your current guild is too high to kill the dragons but your not, maybe you have a fetish with killing dragons, and maybe you would just like to do a raid while your guild is in exp. mode.  Whatever your motivation is, remember we are doing it to have fun, meet your fellow player and get some nice gear.<br>
<br>
Right now I am just trying to see what the interest level would be for this.  I have spoke to about 10 people who would be interested in doing this.  I still need to get at least 50 myself before I would want to comitt to this so it is not going to happen for another week or so.  Please post or contact me in game with questions or suggestions please.  <br>

Depending on the times of these raids, a cleric from Caer Cadrn could probably assist in buffs and resses. Killing Naggy and Vox are classic fights that all people should experience, at least once or twice.<br>

I play CST from the hours of 5pm-2am my time and pretty much any time on the weekend.  I will base the raid times EST though for those on the east coast so they can make it to the raid(s).  So far I have about 15 on my list.  Once i get up to 25 I will set a time as I am sure word is going to get around and people will ask to be invited along as we assemble in lava storm.  I would really like to shoot for a raid this Friday night but nothing is set in stone yet.  Or it can be on the weekend if more people express that time works better.<br>
<br>
If we can get some higher lvl people who want to help buff from your guild that would really be great as well.  So tell your friends, as long as they are over 47, to give me a tell and to start collecting fire resist gear primary and MR gear secondary, that is ULTRA important to have high unbuffed FR to resist that damn fire AE.  FR gear is very very cheap as well.  I will also buy peridots and jaspers to give to the clerics and enchanters to help pay for the buffs.  All I ask is any cash and gems looted off of FGs be given to me to help fund this.<br>
<br>
On a side note I plan on doing loot as such: I will have a designated loot list keeper who is going to take a list down of everyone on the raid with what 1 piece of dragon loot that their class can wear/use they wish to roll for.  If the item drops, you roll for it, if it doesn't, better luck next time.  The list will be compiled and set in stone once we pass fire pots.  If you have not told the loot list keeper what your choice is by this time, your out of luck.  (and no harassing the loot list keeper on how many are rolling for a particular item, they are only taking names down, thats it).<br>
<br>
The pally book will be rolled for before hand by all the present pallys at fire pots.  The 2 winning pallys will also give his name for 1 piece of loot other then the book incase it does not drop (the highest and second highest will get the books if 2 happen to drop, yea right hehe).  <br>
<br>
In the case of the red scale however it will be rolled on by any melee who chose it as their loot roll.  I know this may piss off some bards/warriors since this is for your epic but remember this is a open dragon raid, we are not here for your epic.  The pallys get the option mentioned above merely because the book is no drop.<br>
<br>
Why do I want to do it this way?  Well on open raids the award system obviously doesn't work so that's out.  This also keeps the people who &quot;magically&quot; show up (which has happend believe it or not) right after the dragon is killed and try to roll on loot when they were not part of the raid.  This also gives the people who really want a item a better shot at it.  <br>
<br>
A lot of people may try to roll on the CoF for example, so maybe you want to pick the GoFM or something else to increase your chance at winning a piece of dragon loot.  There is a little strategy as far as your loot choice goes here.<br>
<br>
This loot system for open raids is the most fair that I have seen on my old servers.  If you have a problem with the loot system, I am sorry but this is how it will be done.  IMO this is fair and rewards people who return to try again for that item they want badly.<br>
<br>
Also on the off chance that a item drops that no one picked to roll on then anyone who did not win a piece of dragon loot may roll.  Also FG loot is not included as your loot roll so any class that can use the item off of Magus Roykl for example may roll for it and it does not count as a loot item, its just gravey.<br>
<br>
Above all I want to do this to bring people together to kill dragons and have fun!  Not everyone is in a guild capable of doing this so I want to facilitate this as best and as fairly as I know how so people can experience a very fun and rewarding part of the game.  <br>
<br>
If everything goes well and people express a interest in future raids I will set up something on a more permanent basis to kill dragons when they pop.  For right now lets see how it goes!<br>

The raid got off to a rocky start but once we got the first taste of FG blood our make shift raid ran very smoothly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Just want to say thanks to everyone who came and actually stayed.  Now we all realize how important resists are!  <br>
