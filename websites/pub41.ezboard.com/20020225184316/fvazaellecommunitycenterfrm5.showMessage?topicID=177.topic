For openers, Procax P Dohnutpuncher's whitewash of the issue offers no real analysis of the situation that resulted in his fickle grievances in the first place. Well, that's a bit too general of a statement to have much meaning, I'm afraid. So let me instead explain my point as follows: The next time Procax decides to bring this battle to a fever pitch, he should think to himself, cui bono? -- who benefits? He has been trying for some time to convince people that mediocrity and normalcy are ideal virtues. Don't believe his hype! Procax has just been offering that line as a means to turn eq  into a heinous cesspool overrun with scum, disease, and crime. Even though he has let his lofty-yet-grumpy views cloud his sense of taste and reality, this does not negate the fact that if he thinks his assertions represent progress, Procax should rethink his definition of progress. He is as hideous as he is destructive. Let me rephrase that. To oppose unilateralism, we must oppose commercialism. To oppose gnosticism, we must oppose conformism. And to oppose Procax, we must oppose what I call wild bitchy types. <br>
<br>
<br>
I suppose it's predictable, though terribly sad, that hidebound dirtbags with stronger voices than minds would revert to offensive behavior. But once people obtain the critical skills that enable them to think and reflect and speculate independently, they'll realize that I'm sticking out my neck a bit in talking about Procax's modes of thought. It's quite likely he will try to retaliate against me for my telling you that I want to thank him for his tracts. They give me an excellent opportunity to illustrate just how blockish Procax can be. I had a conversation recently with some bleeding-heart prophets of voyeurism who were trying to annihilate a person's personality, individuality, will, and character. That conversation convinced me that Procax's method goes by the name of &quot;Procax-ism&quot;. It is an evil and avowedly deranged philosophy that aims to block streets and traffic to the extent that ambulances can't get through. His remarks have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together -- life! Even by Procax's own account, I know that double standards are always unrealistic. You know that. But does he know we know that? I would venture the answer has something to do with gangsterism. To elaborate, he has been deluding people into believing that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, and ambiguity are marks of depth and brilliance. Don't let him delude you, too. <br>

The scary thing is the people that somehow harbor the suspicion that a letter of this type is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> possible via the use of some stupid generator program.  <br>
Guess what?<br>
There are people out in society that actually can write letters like that (all by themselves).  Shocking, huh?<br>
<br>
There isn't an undo amount of motivation to do such in this kind of environment because intricate speech is likely to be ignored, misunderstood, or maligned.  This forum tends to favor a posts consisting of a staccato, singularly syllabled, commonplace verbiage interspersed with a smattering of profanity.  In some cases, exclusive profanity can supplant the need for any other subset of the language entirely.  <br>
<br>
It is, for all intents and purposes, a literary setting that caters to the least common denominator of the visiting populace.   <br>
<br>
So, whatever...  It's a fact.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My point</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
-Let's give the complaint letter generator posts a rest, thanks.-<br>
 <br>
In other words, if you *really* feel the need to use a term like lugubrious, fenestrated, or nihilism, at least look it up and try to work it into a sentence of your own design. <br>

Oh, I agree with that to an extent. <br>
<br>
I am not advocating the usage of intimidating vernacular in spurious contextual arrangement simply for the purpose of waxing elitism.  I am saying that the ability to construct a letter of that type is probably not beyond the capabilities of some folks on the board.  <br>
<br>
In my post, I am simply intimating that the reason no one does it, is because it would be such a monumental waste of time and breath in this kind of environment.   Heh, you're right... probably any environment not full of the intellectually self important.<br>

And don't you remember those teachers that would spend ALL of their class for like months going off topic only to half assedly cram most of the year into the last 2 months so they don't get fired? muahahaha, we had 20 chapters in total for russia in grade 9. Our social teacher only got to chapter 11, 3 weeks before the end of the year. We basically got to the point of ONE chapter a day.

I, too, am a product of the public education system.  You will learn in college that curriculum and course work is there to provide a framework for your education.  It will never be enough to completely educate you.   Your education is your responsibility.<br>
<br>
Does it matter that your textbook was printed in 1987?  Not really.  Most of the works that I read for my degrees in college were written in the between the years 100 AD and 1965 AD.  The assertions of philosophers long past are still the same.  The meaning of poets and authors remains the same.  I can understand your point more in subjects that have an ever-expanding body of knowledge, such as Biology.  However…You are being taught the basic core of knowledge from those books.   Later, should you decide to further pursue those fields you will gain understanding of more up-to-date information that you can apply.  You must learn to walk before you run.  That being said, if you feel you have mastered the basic understanding of these disciplines, there are many places you can learn more.  These sources include everything from trade journals to your local college library.<br>
<br>
The point I am trying to make is that anyone with a desire to learn may do so.  It is the fool that chooses to blame others for their failure to learn.  It seems that we would rather be the victims of our environment rather than exert any effort to rise above it.<br>
<br>
Education is a life-long process.<br>

Of course you will come across teachers of… shall we say non-existent motivation?  I’ve seen that, too.  What I was writing to you was my remedy to the situation that I imagine we have (had) in common.  Where I felt I was “slighted” by the system, I more than made up for with my own tenacity and drive.  You will do the same thing.  I didn’t mean to come across sounding like an ass.  I re-read my own post and thought that is what I sounded like.  If anything, I wanted to remind you that you have all you need to do well inside of you already.  You just can’t let anyone extinguish the fire inside.<br>

School is evil!<br>
School was implemented and meant for one thing... to pump out &quot;drones&quot; to work in factories. Listen, obey, do what you're told. That is what school is about.<br>
I didn't learn jack in school. To me, it was a HUGE waste of fucking time. Sit down and take it up the ass. Do what the dumbfuck teacher tells you to do, it doesn't prep you for anything but work. Listen to your dumb fatass boss tell you to keep busy. If you don't, youre fired! (unless you know the advanced techniques of slacking! booyah!) Talk about my idea of fun!<br>
I myself have only had a couple good teachers in my time in school. The others were obviously rejects, who didn't know what to do with their life, so they became a teacher. And they liked school, so they willing take it up the ass from the administration, who tells them what to do, and whoever (the school district and so on) tells them what to do etc etc.... Funny thing, a couple great teachers I had in public school were scowled upon for their open ideas, and were eventually dismissed from teaching. They just didn't follow the orders, they wanted the kids to think for themselves, which is not the correct attitude!<br>
99% of what I have learned was on my own. School stunted my learning growth, made me hate certain topics (like English), tried to make me obey which didn't work too well, made me hate life for awhile, and a bunch of other crap.<br>
Basically, I see school as a drone pumping factory, and for the students its only a social hangout prison.<br>
Bah, I could go on and on about school, I really fuckin dislike it. Well hey, at least they don't preach the bible in schools! (Yet, who knows what George W. Chimp will do next! mwaaa)<br>
As for CCC, @@, sow thx plz la~~, thats more like Taiwanspeak, from my previous exp, and its just online slang.<br>
gann~~<br>
Anyways Im off, and have a good happy day everyone! Mwaaahaahaaa! <p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2" color="DCDCDC">Look out and shout, OW!</font><br /><font face="arial,helvetica" size="3" color="#D7D7D7">Ryonea Gravespawn, Mistress of Death</font><br />

Some say the world will end in fire;
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To know that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
