(really long)</span><hr size=1> Hello Vazaelle,<br>
<br>
I wanted to go over a few things from my experiences from playing on this server and the people I have met and encountered in it. First I would like to say that this server as a whole is great and has a much better general community than any other server I played on. Anywayz I just wanted to pass on a few things to guild leaders or people in general to think about or ponder or learn from my mistakes.<br>
<br>
Hardcore players are good, they are your bread n butter... but all that matters in the end is your friends. People for the most part will forget the good, but remember the bad. I've lost about 95 percent of my friends on Vaz server for trying to do things to make things better for the hardcores. HUGE mistake on my part, well the way I did it at least. When it came down to it even in the end tho even the hardcore's who i was friends with have gone on to bigger and better things. Friends above all nothing is more important. Holding grudges is bad, let me give u an example. From about lvl 50-60 I hated Carrais, thought he was a total @#%$, he turns out to be one of the nicest guys u could ever meet and his decisions are based upon his FRIENDS and he dosent forget that. Carrais I commend you for makeing your decision to join Fira in DaoC sticking by friends is the way to go, and Firanel is one person u want to stay around she's awsome. I'm not here looking for redemption, my days of playing EQ are over. Although I do belive I owe an apology to alot of players and to them I am deeply sorry.<br>
<br>
To In Virtue players,<br>
<br>
Sorry guys that I messed things up, I can only hope that when you look back on the times we had together you are able to bring a smile to your face about all the good times we had. I want to go over some ppl in general to say a few things to so here is a long list sorry for taking up the space.<br>
<br>
Zozz..  Boy if there is one person I could learn a lesson from its you. I look back now and say If I really wanted to be uber I should have tried to be more like you and do something different and try to get people to work together instead of in competition. Your compassion for friends and general players is unmatched. Good luck to you sir.<br>
<br>
Vehnn..  Man where to start.. You are an @#%$ basically.. on the outside, on the inside this guy is the one of the nicest people you could have on your side. Beyond being a great enchanter you are lucky enough to have a girlfriend who REALLY cares about you. Marry her sir she loves video games and has a great sense of humor. I made a bad decision when I didnt ask you to come along. I dont expect you ever to forgive me for that nor would I expect it. For what it is worth im sorry. Good luck in Daoc or with Arise as well as in real life.<br>
<br>
Kyrana..  Nothing I can really even begin to say.. sorry. When I had our conversation and you were more concerned about Vehnn than yourself I should have known I messed up. People change. I realize now that you are the kind of player most vital to a team. You may not have been on the most but you kept alot of ppl happy and were alot of times the voice of the guild chat. Have fun sucking on Toes hon and I hope all things go well for you. <br>
<br>
Cowcrust..  Whoa man, the bronze karnors castle 14 year old turned superstar. It was an Honor playing along side someone like you. Never once did I hear a negative thing come out of your mouth toward someone. They say nobody is perfect, if thats true then you gotta be close. MoOoo!<br>
<br>
Plumpkin..   I hate the way things ended the last time we talked. Your definetly one of my closest friends and one of the few I ever met irl. Your awsome man I wish nothing but the best for you and your family. Maybe someday our paths will cross again, and we can own SW and Nikaya in UT again.<br>
<br>
Aegir..  Aeg nothing more that I can say to you. I wish I could have helped gotten you to be the best equiped warrior in game. You damn well deserved it. Have fun in whatever you do man. You are a true friend bro.<br>
<br>
Soliid..  Hardcore half elf.. I know what I did was a mistake and it cost me our friendship. Your a great guy and you stick with your friends, there is nothing more u can ask for than that. Good luck to you sir.<br>
<br>
Procax..  Hands down one of the best enchanters to ever play the game. The title above your head is well spoken for. Your a very smart guy and I have learned a few lessons from you. Im sorry for hurting you and alot of others. Good luck to you with school and real life.<br>
<br>
Ghol..  I should have talked with you alot more than I did in game. You are here for friends and nothing more. I will always respect you and your thoughts. I hope that when you look back at me you dont think of me like Keadiain.<br>
<br>
Krass..  I doubt you will read this. You are the roll model for all Main tanks and hardcore players. If I was given 10 wishes in EQ, one of them would have been for you to be there when we cleared north ToV. I miss you and will always remember you sir.<br>
<br>
Reks..  You remind me alot of Cowcrust. Everything to you is about friends. Good luck to you in Daoc and everything else you do. I'm glad to have the time we did together on Vazaelle and the short time on Morell. If you ever talk to Flaan again please tell him hello for me.<br>
<br>
Flaan..  I doubt you will read this as well. But nothing tops the Original Bighouse. I'm sad that you had to go when things were just starting to spice up. I hope your brother isnt working you to hard. Have fun bud.<br>
<br>
Befb..   Man and to think you *almost* didnt come to Vaz. I'll miss you alot. Even when things were going shitty you had alot of faith in me sir. I'm sorry for letting you down and I hope all goes well for you.<br>
<br>
Malathor..  Your a great guy Mala, good luck to you and all you do. I'm sorry for letting you down and hurting your friends.<br>
<br>
Rokko..  DORF sir, we didnt talk much but I had alot of respect for you and your views. Good luck in daoc.<br>
<br>
Rhyu..  First off your a bitch you know why too. Beyond that you were my right hand man, and I couldnt have asked for a better one. Its an honor to played with you and had you as a puller. Good luck in NY with school.<br>
<br>
Igrum..  Malloy.. Gnome.. sir.. I'm sorry. Your a great person and I LOVED being around you. I hope all goes well for you in your life. Tell Faran and Sarku I say hello and wish them well.<br>
<br>
Zhraath..  Im sure I'll see you around between Nikaya and all. It was a pleasure being guilded with you. Your good heart and nature should be a lesson to everyone.<br>
<br>
Evie..  Maybe if I would have spent more time trying to cyber you than trying to be uber, I would have been better off. Good luck with everything your a great girl and I hope you find a guy who treats you like it. (maybe baz? =)  )<br>
<br>
Kelnok..  Man Kelnok dorf you were one of the most hardcore players I had. I was wrong when I talked to you and what you did was a normal reaction. Good luck in Daoc or Arise.<br>
<br>
Sulanja..  Hardcore, period. Your a great person and I wish u luck with your business and that girlfriend of yours. Thanks for being a great friend.<br>
<br>
Shadye.. GNOME!!!!!<br>
<br>
Endren/Mimix..   I shouldnt have booted you from the guild. I hope you and Mimix are doing well. You are the best enchanter I have ever played EQ with. Its a shame that the game dosent alow you to really show how good you are. Mimix you have great chocolate love and good luck irl.<br>
<br>
Kubli..  I know how u felt about things. I only wish I could have spent more time letting you know how important you are and what a cool guy you are. Good luck with your job and Arise.<br>
<br>
Maggye..  Prolly the most innocent person I met in game. Good luck cheri  &lt;--  weak attempt at french. I'm sorry for hurting you and I wish you luck in Arise.<br>
<br>
Xarr..  Man we go way back.. what is it about EQ that just puts us at each others throats I'll never know. Good luck with your guild and I hope that you learned from what you saw from me on what to do and what not to do. Later Bro.<br>
<br>
Zerric..   Man If I ever see you, you will get hit... after that I'd prolly give ya a hug. =)  You annoyed the hell out of me sometimes man, but when @#%$ hit the fan I could count on you. Good luck to you and dont let your brother pick on you to much.<br>
<br>
Thynn..  Lizzy sir, good luck to you your a killer shaman and a great friend. Have fun in Arise and everything else u do in life.<br>
<br>
Connar.. Good luck to you man. I hope everything goes well for you in Daoc as well as future games.<br>
<br>
Quarken..  Man what a great guy. You made me laugh my ass off so many times... Mofia is strong within me sir and I will not forget that.<br>
<br>
Nukuki.. Your awsome man. You are a true hardcore gamer. EQ holds you back of really showing how good you are at things. You gonna be a successful person in life, enjoy it.<br>
<br>
Moodi..  Was a pleasure playing with you. I think you still owe me a lunch as well.. =P<br>

<br>
Menexia..  Prolly one of the best pickup's ever. I'll be honest with you.. but I think you know already. You were picked up cuz we needed more druids and u were always eagar to port, but it backfired on me.. you turned into one of the best druids to ever play the game and a GODLY back up healer. Good luck to you mene.<br>
<br>
Transer..   Your a great guy man. Nice to everyone and your all about friends. I look forward to seeing you at fan fair. Good luck.<br>

<br>
Vulp..   Your a great hearted person. When you look back on EQ please think of yourself as the best.. it might have been dieing while afk but you are the best sir. =)<br>
<br>
Toguruk..  Your heart is as big as your Ogre's ass. It was a pleasure playing along side you. I'm glad you came back to EQ and I got the chance to meet you.<br>
<br>
Wayne..  I'll miss playing with you. Your a great monk and puller with a great sense of humor. GL in everything you do and I hope all is well for you irl.<br>
<br>
Zaral.. The short time we got to play together was fun sir. I'm glad I met you and I wish you luck in Daoc.<br>
<br>
Majin(real one)..  Doubt you will read this.. even tho you backstabbed me I will never forget some of the times we had together. Your one funny guy and I have tons of screenshots of us to look back on. Good luck to you  =)<br>
<br>
Halagram.. Hala your a cool guy I'm sorry things worked out the way they did for you. I wish I could change it. Good luck to you in real life. <br>
<br>
Berran..  Halfer sir, your a great friend I wish I could have spent more time with you. You are such a nice guy. Good luck in daoc my friend.<br>
<br>
Raif..  We had our good and our bad times. I'll look back on our good ones with smiles. Good luck with the guild in Daoc.<br>
<br>
Riaa..  I'm sorry things turned out the way they did for you. I think your one of the most hardcore players I met in EQ. Good luck to you.<br>
<br>
Ammelen..  You know I look back on you and I used to hate how much you would cry about certain things. I now understand why and I'm sorry I judge'd you the way I did. Good luck to you sir.<br>
<br>
Tassador..  Tass bro, Its been a hella long time and I really hope things go well for you. You gave me unlimited amounts of laughter on EQ and I will never forget the grape smuggler.<br>
<br>
Snug..  I'm sorry I was such an ass to you. I should have been nicer. Good luck to you.<br>
<br>
Larsun..  I havent talked with you for a long long time. Im sorry for letting you down and I hope you had as much fun as I did in EQ together.<br>
<br>
Enormus.. You know when I look back and remember you I pretty much feel like you were untrue. I dont really think it would have mattered to you which guild you joined as long as they were the best guild on the server. I thought u were an ok guy to be honest with ya. I guess all along it was just you hateing me? Good luck in Daoc and I hope you accomplished what you wanted.<br>
<br>
Cassias..   Calm down, Treat your wife like the godess she is, and learn to take a joke. I always respected you *VERY* much and even looked up to you. Your an extremly smart player in game and out. Good luck in Daoc and with your wife I hope you guys have a good future.<br>
<br>
Cassiana..   To be honest I dont know what to say about you. You were the best cleric I have ever seen. More hardcore than anyone when you needed to be. Yet you were also extremly nice. I have alot of mixed feelings toward you. I'm going to guess your between a rock and a hard place or however the saying goes. If I had to know one thing it would to be to know weather or not you even cared about the way things went down on Palo. Either way my times with you will never be forgetten and I will never forget ya.<br>
<br>
Skirmish..  All around nicest guy to play EQ. Everyone's best friend and always try'd to smooth out ruff things. Good luck to you with school and daoc. <br>
<br>
Nik/SW..  Heh you guys always be my dogs. I'm gonna throw you in here because it would be wrong if i didnt. You guys own thanks for being like brothers to me.<br>
<br>
If I forgot anyone im sorry, to everyone I hurt I am deeply sorry. I was wrong about breaking up the guild. Although in doing so I met alot of really great people from SF.. Ekko.. Chuuch.. Math.. Medoc.. to name a few. I wish you all GL in whatever you do.<br>
<br>
If your wondering whats going down with me, I'm not really sure at the moment. After playing on Daoc and being rejected by Cassiana Cassias and Enormus, I might just chill out some. I will tell you that I cannot stress that all that matters in the end is friendship. Good luck to everyone on Vazaelle and I hope you guys have a great time. <br>
<br>
Ill leave ya with a quote..<br>
<br>
Love me, Hate me, You'll never forget me.  -ddp<br>

Good luck to you Krimzin in whatever you do, both online and IRL. You put IV and Vazaelle on the EQ map forever, and I think most Vazaelliens are proud of that, even if many won't admit it.<br>

(really long)</span><hr size=1> Looks like I get to be the first to post on this thread Brian.  Sortof fitting, seeing as I've known you longer than anybody, with the exception of your RL friends.  Man you are right.  We go a long ways back.  We were so tight back in starcraft, and when EQ came out, it was just awesome.  I still remember you calling me for like 2 weeks in a row in my dormroom at like 5am going 'dude, get on and level with me.'  My roommate hated you haha, but i remember it, and it makes me smile.  I dont know what happened man, but when i quit..we didnt really like each other that much.  <br>
  So we met back up and played Diablo2 some when you were going through some tough times together, and i was still dubious about you...cause i remembered just being so mad at me.  And then it finally happened a few months later.  You finally convinced me to come back to EQ...after trying for like 6 months or so hehe.  And man..what can i say.<br>
  I think I know why you knew you could trust me...you know i dont settle for 2nd best, i never have...and neither have you.  Maybe thats why we clash sometimes.  I wouldnt be where i am without you, you have taught me a lot.  I still remember asking you when you'd let me into the guild, and you just said 'keep levelin'.  And i did, and then you let me in.  You just dont know how happy and proud I was to wear the IV tag bro.  I wouldve walked through fire for you.  You just dont know how bad i felt when I didnt win the botb, i felt like i let everybody down.  And i tried to make it up to you, by being the most hardcore motherf-ucker you had....and of all the classes i picked, i had to be a SK..lol.  No regrets tho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
  Honestly man, you are awesome at this game.  No doubt that you are a great leader.  Some people might not have liked you for whatever reason, but nobody doubted your skill and dedication to IV.  It was such a family, i knew everybody and loved them all in their own way...some more than others tho :P  But you held it together, I'll never forget the Costner speeches after a big fight..god man, those were good times.  <br>
  As for the breakup...honestly man i think we both just needed a break from the stress.  We constantly bitched at each other, and we shouldve just backed off for awhile.  I think you made a mistake, and i think you know you made it.  We couldve done things completely differently, and still be absolutely crushing everything.  I really hope you dont feel that i backstabbed you by not joining PA.  It was not an easy decision, and you just dont know how much it hurt to do a /who all primal and see the majority of my friends there.  I even told you I would join...and i really think it hurt you when i didnt.  You just dont know how much i appreciate everything youve done for me in this game, you gave me something so special at a time when i really need it, and i will always owe you for that.  <br>
  Last thing i want you to know is this.  You will ALWAYS be my boy.  We have gone thru too much s-hit to not be.  And i dont know what kind of firestorm this will cause, or what repercussions this will have but...<br>
  If you EVER decide to come back to EQ, you know who to find pimp.  Like you said, you always need hardcore motherf-uckers in your guild...and youre as hardcore as they come man.<br>
I wish you the best<br>
And just remember...WE run it, we always did<br>

<br>
Was wierd to see you break IV but being leader of a european guild I know the fustration when you always are 5 to 10 people short of doing what you want and should be able to do. This server has driven me nuts from time to time.<br>
<br>
IV was respected and hated at the same time. Not all shared your way of playing but in the end, the people who ranted about you on VCC always joined you.<br>
<br>
I dont remember the exact words but once a cleric asked about IV on your forum, and Shadye tfOjE (gnome in gnomish to someone who cant speak gnomish) replied that no matter how people thought IV was, IV always had fun. Those of you who know Shadye will know that if IV didnt have fun, he wouldnt have been there.<br>
<br>
Good luck to all the members of IV and PA. I never got to kick Krimzin and Xarr in Starcraft over that Ragefire spawn so we must save that for a loot settlement in World of Warcraft.<br>

One of the things EQ does is rob us of our sleep, and that can make life crazy at times.  Everyone says and does things they regret because of that, I'm sure -- except Reks, Holyspirit, etc...<br>

I don't know what exactly happened that made you disband IV but when I saw PA I thought it would die fast or be the most ubershit in EQ (and I mean all Servers). /sigh... would have preferred to see PA as most uber in EQ but well...<br>

<br>
Well, we made #2 &amp; 3, so something we said to you musta stuck^^  I will gladly admit that you were right when you said I don't &quot;take the game seriously&quot;, however there are a few caveats to that.  The main one is that EQ (and ubergaming, or whatever you want to call it) were nothing new to us when we started on Vaz.  Sure, when we were uber, 50 was the cutoff, but between us we had just about every high level item our toons could use.  I took the game seriously then - and I lost a job because of it.  Vehnn wanted to start playing again when Vaz came up, my only condition was that we stuck together, and that my rules (so that I wouldn't loose my new job) were respected.  One of those was always logging by 9 on weeknights so that I could wake up the next morning.  I honestly never had the drive to play EQ - the best I would have ever done without Vehnn would have been a mid-30's char with every tradeskill maxed and every quest I could possibly do, done.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is just that I never was trying to give you a headache with my wacky hours (or my sick, yet playful, emotes).  When I could play, I did my best to be at the keyboard pulling my weight for every second I was on.  To be honest, I haven't personally heard Kyrana ding since the low 50's - Vehnn and Baz did a lot of work to try to get me to end game while I kept up with my real life commitments.  The best thing that came out of playing Vaz for me was meeting people - whether new virtual friends (hi guys), out-of-towners lured here by Evie's THX @$$ (hi you know who you are!), or really meeting people, like Evie and Baz, who I now consider to be very close friends.  It's a damn shame that the guild ended when it did, because the emotes were only going to get even wackier as time passed!<br>
<br>
Anyway Krim, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm willing to forgive a lot for the sake of the person who led the group that reintroduced me to real life (as ironic as that is).  I'm a little disappointed at the way things turned out - not that they ended, but that they ended badly.  You were right that I never took the game seriously - all I wanted was to log on, have some fun with friends (greatly prefering competent friends, as a holdover from my serious uber days), and kill some time between work and sleep.  I'm greatful that IV took me in and provided for my wants and needs - and I wish everything could have worked out in the end.  Good luck in DAoC, you won't be seeing me there =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uskirm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skirm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/15/01 8:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In My Darkest Hours..

  I want to beleive that people deep down are good, im sure everyone does, we all want something bigger and more noble lofty, the big picture, whatever... great. but i dont beleive this from you.<br>
<br>
  i think, you are apologizing with the motivations of a child who got caught stealing cookies and now his parents wont feed him dinner. you @#%$ up the best guild in EQ ( yes, it was ) and you @#%$ over some of the best people ive met online and now you are sorry because you dont have your empire to rule from and the cool people to surround you.  <br>
 <br>
 - i think you are sorry due to selfish motivations, because this is now taken from you and its beyond your control. not because you feel remorse for anything youve done against anyone else. - <br>
<br>
  i could be wrong, im wrong alot. but that krimzin i met and grew to knew rarely based anything outside of his own existance, even this is written with an egocentric view/spin on it, and thats what i think this is. Krim sorry because this went bad for him. more selfishness.  <br>
<br>
  if im wrong then suck it up and lesson well learned to you. but, i personally see nothing but crocodile tears - good life to you, i do wish you the best. <br>

 &lt; and no krim, i wouldnt ever compare you to kead. you have many skills and are very good leader when you want to be, i had a good deal of admiration for you for the longest time. you know why its left me and you know why i took my final break that ended in quitting eq... and unlike kead, all your faults are strictly a lack of consideration of others. its a sign of immaturity, like a fault of a grape for not being a raisen. &gt;<br>

 I've been reading vaz/IV boards and still have ever since i left IV to start work . As u already know Krim =) . It's a huge loss to EQ to see you quit and as you know SoL is coming out soon &quot;hint hint&quot; .<br>
 <br>
 I was shocked to discover IV disbanded when i logged on one night and saw no guildtag above my head . Ppl should know it's a really tough job being a guildleader . You can't please everyone so you cant be faulted when certain things go wrong in game. <br>
 <br>
 You will always be the good guildleader and compassionate friend and totally hardcore player in EQ that i know of . Here's hoping you come back when SoL is out =) . Same goes for all IV old school peebs like Reklats,Igrum,Skirmish assling! etc etc (cant remember off hand the rest )<br>

(really long)</span><hr size=1> I didn't know you at all Krim but your accomplishments were something to take note of.  I quit EQ a long time ago (October of 2000) to begin testing DAOC (which has turned out to be quite a game indeeed).  It must have been hard writing this letter to the community.  The nice thing I see is that you really did have a heart.  Perhaps you will learn from the mistakes you mentioned and your next guild will be even better.  One thing that I have always said, and the people who game with me all feel this way, is that friends come before anything else - and in these games you do have REAL friends - they aren't just toons.  It is always important to treat people as you would like to be treated - especially your friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck to you.<br>

How many chanters can be THE BEST in the game anyways, and was that a quote from Diamond Dallas Page?  there was this retarded guy in my home town that loved wrestling and ddp, when I read that quote I pictured him threatening me with the diamond cutter and spitting all over the place.  anyways, pretty funny nonetheless, and let's see if we can get more people to play daoc, to me less is better.<br>
