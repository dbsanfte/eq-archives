Damn You!<br>
<br>
Now to address the part about why we didn't oust Sadam already if he had as much power as we claim he has now.  In the world of politics (yes even the world has politics.. its called the United Nations), you can not just go do things with out proof, and it had better be extremely substantial proof.  Why?  Because you have the same kind of blind morons all over the world like we have here in this message thread who stand in the face of sure destruction and deny it exists.  Those are the same kind of people that kept us out of North Vietnam and got thousands of American Soldiers butchered because they just didn't see a reason to declare WAR on North Vietnam... they just wanted to police the situation.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the point is you have to have substantial incriminating evidence to prove to the United Nations that the bad guys ARE the bad guys.  Nobody had that evidence until after the 9/11 attacks.  The reason we have that evidence now is because a butt load of nations worked together after 9/11 to pull their information technologies together and colaborate on what they new.  It was only then that the picture became truely clear and it is now a *FACT* that there are a number of nations around the world working *TOGETHER* to fight and destroy the free world.  They want to take freedom away in the name of their God and have the whole world either answer to their God or die.<br>
<br>
It amazes me that you people can't see that this is Hitler all over again except this time it is not a spin off of Christianity, but instead it is a spin off of the Muslems(sp?).  They are openly preaching that Allah(sp?) has told them to kill all those who opose him.<br>
<br>
And if you believe that they are not working on creating devices of mass destruction, then you obviously have not heard of the latest tapes that have been discovered from the Al Quada network.  They have tapes demonstrating the techniques of using a chemical agent to kill.  They tested it on dogs.  There intent is to create an easy to deploy chemical bomb that can kill humans.  Does that sound like the workings of someone who cares about feeding his people?<br>

One thing Hitler was very good at was brainwashing his people. (There was lots of Nazi propaganda stating that the Jews had a secret worldwide plot to  - yep youre right, take over the world and enslave all non-jews. Seems kinda familiar to what is said above...)<br>
<br>
Bush is quite good at it as well. The post above mine illustrates that pretty well IMO. Someone's been watching CNN too much. <br>
(Im not saying Bush is as Evil as Hitler but i dont think hes santa clause either) <p><br>

Are you just stupid or are you purposely trying to create propoganda?<br>
<br>
Your comparison does not even come close, and it is a slap in the face of Jewish people everywhere to make such a blatantly incorrect comparison.<br>
<br>
The jewish people didn't attack the Nazis.  For your comparison to be even remotely close, the Jewish people would have had an underground network of conspirators planning (and accomplishing in some cases) terrorist attacks on the non-jewish populace of Germany.  This did not happen and did not exist you moron!<br>
<br>
There is hard factual evidence that the Al Quada network along with Iraq, North Korea, and some other countries plotted and successfully have attacked innocent civilians in a number of countries... not just America.  The only reason that it LOOKS like this is directed at America is because the Al Quada network realised that attacking America would get them quicker results.  Hence forth the 9/11 attacks.<br>
<br>
For the love of god you are the stupidest person I have ever had the missfortune of communicating with.<br>

god fucking damn, what would your response be if someone walked up to you, hit you right in the throat as hard as they can, and while your sitting there gasping tells you &quot;hey motherfucker, next time I will kill you, and if i don't then one of my 5 millions zealot friends will.  I have to do this cause my God and leaders have told me to.&quot; <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure a lot of you pussies would do just what you want the US to do.  Pretend it didn't happen, maybe get a permit to carry a gun, but down deep you know that you couldn't use it anyway cause the thought of violence makes piss trickle down your leg.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the people that we elect to protect and defend our country, despite being a dumbass good ole boy from Texas, are doing just that.  The way I look at it, MY freedon is more important to me than some dumbass, uneducated, misguided fool with a bomb strapped to his chest. <p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=green strength=5);font-family:papyrus;font-weight: BOLD;font-size:'10pt'">

<br>
I guess I was also trying to insinuate that many of the reasons terrorists are attacking us are because of what we have done to them personally and helped other people do with funding and training. <br>
<br>
Terrorism isn't right, its fucked up and I hate it. But blindly going around killing people isn't going to stop anything. Really we're losing this war on two fronts now. Externally, we are just making more people hate us and willing to give up their lives to destroy us and internally we are losing cherished freedoms that many many many Americans fought and died to protect.<br>
<br>
Am I suggesting letting people push us around? Fuck no! But lets not be blindly patriotic here. There has to be a solution that doesn't involve genocide. <p>Prybutok Agonista<br>

<br>
9/11 wasn't media hype but you have to wonder about who caused it. Every time something big happens, tons of terrorists claim they did it. Hopefully there is more proof that Osama did it then him saying he did it. Then comes who funded him and all that. As the general public, we have to trust in what the government says cause I'm sure most of you aren't gonna head over and conduct your own investigations, but it also means, how much of what your government says is true? Thats a question only each person can answer individually. By watching Bush on TV I have no trust for the guy. Since my chances of actually meeting him is about slim to none, I'm going to have to base it off that. You know when you watch a presentation by someone and that person knows what they are talking about versus someone who has no fucking idea? When I watch Bush go on I am reminded of the latter. My personal opinion, just means I take everything he comes out and says with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
I don't expect him to know everything, but I expect him to know enought to be able to start a war about it. He is the final decision so its great that XYZ in his administration knows, but they better lay the whole fucking thing out for him so he knows as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umysselyss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MysseLyss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/20/02 10:08:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3150.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /sigh people</span><hr size=1> I want bignose to come back and actually defend his ridiculous statement of Germany's sole reason for WWII being the extinction of the jewish people.  And yes bud that's what you implied, and its simply not true.<br>
<br>
The motivations for the USA doing this are irrelevant above and beyond the defense of their own.  If its not in defense they can't do it.  You can't really buy the &quot;proof&quot; the government gives the general population.  Its when other nations start backing them up that you know they have proof I'd think.  <br>
<br>
No one denies the USA deserves its defense.  But if you boil it down to the root of it, couldn't you argue that any muslim nation is a threat?  But can we justify toppling every muslim government for this reason alone?  *shrug* I say do it, simply because Iraq has a government that does not represent iraq.  That's reason enough for me.  Now add in every other problem Iraq has with the rest of the world, how the hell else can you punish them?<br>
