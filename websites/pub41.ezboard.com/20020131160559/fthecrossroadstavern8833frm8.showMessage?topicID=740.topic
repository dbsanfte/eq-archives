<br>
I'm a huge LOTR fan, always have been, even something of a fanatic though I don't bother sharing the mania with non fans <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For those who have been listening to me go on about it in /gu for the last couple of weeks waiting for it, I expressed one hope - that they just told the bloody story.<br>
<br>
Well the short review is that they did just that. I seriously doubt LOTR fans are going to be disappointed by the movie.<br>
<br>
Now for the longer review <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sorry, I don't believe it's possible to spoil a movie adapted from a book thats been around longer than I've been alive, but this is fair warning, if you don't want to know anything else, don't read any further... I'm not going to go into any scene details, so I doubt I'll spoil it all that much.<br>
<br>
I pull out my copies of LOTR at and read at least once a year. I always dread rereading Fellowship of the Ring at times because there are parts of it that are bloody well boring. I guess it's necessary since it was Tolkien laying out the situation in an uncharted fantasy world, but there are times in the book when it drags to hell and I put the book down and go do something else. I don't have that problem with The Two Towers or Return of the King....<br>
<br>
The movie skipped all the boring shit. For example, in the book, Frodo takes his time about leavign the Shire, moves and assumes a new name, etc etc etc..... Peter Jackson ripped that annoying crap out, they just went straight to Bree, which IMHO was great.<br>
<br>
The movie begins by recounting the history of the ring. I thought they made a huge mistake because Sauron actually makes an appearance on the field of battle, and one of the things I love about LOTR is that the ultimate bad guy never comes on stage himself, he's always there as a menacign and vague worry, never truly defined in his power. You get a sense of how horrifying and overwhelming he is from the fear of the other characters..... so yeah, seeing Sauron on the field sorta worried me.. OTOH they can hardly show Isildur cutting the Ring from his finger without showing Sauron <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have 2 complaints with the movie - 1. They skipped Tom Bombadil entirely. I kinda figured that was gonna be the case since I didn't see a listing for him in the cast list, but I held out hope they'd sneak him in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  All in all not that big of a bitch, just one of the episodes from the book I would have liked left in.<br>
<br>
My second complaint is that they left out Gandalf's letter to Frodo revealing who Strider was. I felt that should have been included, but the movie did fine without it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Other than that, the LOTR symbolism is there for the old school fans, if you know what to look for, you'll appreciate it, but they didn't waste alot of time filling in the background information that the book had. This, IMHO, is a good move, because it leaves the focus on the current story, and it's incentive for all you lazy bastards to sit down and read the books <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . This is mostly shown by the scenes in Rivendell and Lothlorien, their histories aren't gone into detail like they are in the book. <br>
<br>
One thing I absolutely love was that Saruman had a much bigger role than the first book gave him. They don't feature any new info, but there's some stuff in Fellowship that the books didn't explain until Two Towers.<br>
<br>
Now, my opinions on the cast....<br>
<br>
Elijah Wood was a perfect choice for Frodo. I mean honestly, I can't think of anyone who could have done it better. Sean Astin is likewise a perfect choice for Samwise Gamgee, and I sincerely look forward to seeing how well he plays the role in Return of the King. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd did well enough as Merry and Pippin that I'm not going to bitch about how they played their roles, but they're mostly there as comic relief for this film. The unfortunate side effect of lifting alot of the background material is that Merry and Pippin's characters don't get the same attention in the movie that they get in the book. I look forward to seeing how well they do in The Two Towers and Return of the King, as they perform their roles of servign Denethor and Theoden. That is when my true judgement of how well they were cast will coem into play. <br>
<br>
Gandalf - Ian McKellan was great, simply put, he played the role to perfection. Once again they made the perfect choice. To go along with that, Gandalf's arch nemesis Saruman is played by Christopher Lee. If you don't know who Christopher Lee is, I'd love to know how you manage to pay attention to anything, seeing as how he's sorta in the Guiness Book of World Records as the actor with the most screen credits to his name. I am SO looking forward to seeing the scene with Gandalf and Saruman near the end of the Two Towers with these two playing the roles.<br>
<br>
Bilbo is played by Ian Holm, who again, does a wonderful job. Unfortunetly I can't really say he brings the role to life, but that's because alot of Bilbo's screentime is cut since so much of the background info is gone. He does bring to life Bilbo's struggle to let go of the Ring, and does it admirably.<br>
<br>
Boromir is played by Sean Bean, whom I absolutely loved in Patriot Games. He brings a real intensity to the character, and a human element, and makes you understand that while Boromir gives into his flaw of being a tad bit narrow sighted, as well as lacking a proper respect for the evil of the Ring, he does so with the best of intentions.. that behind the swagger and arrogance is an honorable man who's simply trying to do the best he can, under alot of pressure.<br>
<br>
Elrond was played by Hugo Weaving. This is the one casting choice I do not like. Most of you will probably recognize him as one of the agents from The Matrix. In my opinion, he portrays Elrond as entirely too cynical (which I can understand, since Elrond led Isildur into Mount Doom and bid him throw the Ring into the fires, but Isildur did not... the current crisis could have been avoided entirely, but for the failing courage of one man.... yeah I guess after a few thousand years I'd be pretty cynical too, but that's just not the way I see Elrond), but I just can't shake the feeling that this dude should be one of the bad guys. <br>
<br>
Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) do a pretty good job of portraying their characters... that is to say, they look good in the costume <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is another case where their real character developement won't come until the next movie, so I'll be interested in seeing how they play the character, but for this movie they do just fine as the Fellowship's token elf and dwarf.<br>
<br>
The final casting choice I'm going to comment on is Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen. I felt that this wasn't such a good choice, but after seeing the movie, boy did I make a mistake. Viggo brings an intensity and more importantly, sincerity to the role of Aragorn. He really makes the burden placed on Aragorn come across, and makes you admire the kind of character that Aragorn is. He makes the role, and I have a feeling that he'll make the transformation from scruffy ranger to noble king with very little problem.<br>
<br>
The theatre I went to had 3 screens showing LOTR and all of them were sold out. This was a midnight showing, so you KNOW they're hardcore fans. The guy next to me remarked that this was the kind of crowd that would have critiquing pads out. Tolkien fans have long been disappointed by the translations of the books into screen format, and so I tried not to let my expectations get the best of me, though it was very very hard. <br>
<br>
When the movie was over, the entire theatre erupted into applause. I can't think of any better endorsement for the movie than that..... a theatre full of jaded cynical people who were hoping for the best but prepared for another dismal failure... and we applauded.<br>
<br>
The visual effects were wonderful as well. My two favorites scenes in the books are the Battle of Helm's Deep and the Battle of the Pellenor Fields. I absolutely cannot WAIT to see the next two movies in the theatres, and I thank whatever gods might be listening that Peter Jackson convinced New Line to let him shoot all three movies at once instead of waiting and seeing how Fellowship did.. that gives me every reason to believe that the other two movies will be worthy of the fans money, but more importantly, worthy of our time.<br>
<br>

 I didn't like the choice for Aragorn, mostly because my mental image of him was as a much more imposing figure. A kinda Liam Neeson/Rob Roy kinda figure. (I know I spelled his name wrong, not enough coffee in me to jar those memory circuits to life though.<br>
 As to Hugo....I agree entirely. I can't help but picture him as a bad guy, though I think he did a pretty good job with the part. Cynical? Aye, that he is. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
As far as FOTR being boring in parts in the book. Yes, I second that. Of course, considering the age of the book, it's not surprising.<br>
<br>
They were times when I got so sick of reading a paragraph about every single step taken that I just wanted to throw the book against the wall and go play Whack-A-Mole at Chuck E. Cheese's for a few hours. However, eventually you realize by reading all of this, it builds a wonderful world for you and really pays off when you get to the Two Towers and Mt. Doom.<br>
