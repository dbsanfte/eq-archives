<br>
A tiny rivulet of sweat wound its way down his forehead before finding a home in his right eye, temporarily blurring his vision with stinging ferocity. Steeling his resolve, he vowed that he would not allow his concentration to waver too far from task – he would complete this if for no other reason than to show his ‘tutor’ that he could. <br>
<br>
Slowly he closed his eyes, allowing his mind to form an image within, and if doing so happened to give his eyes a chance to recover… all the better.<br>
<br>
“And so.... ends the… ninth… tale of Ar’nath Tien”. He had spoken the words haltingly, though there could be no doubting the conviction in his voice. He had nailed it! He knew it beyond the merest shadow. He opened his eyes quickly, glancing up at his tutor and the certain look of approval he would find. For what seemed the hundredth time, for it quite possibly was, he met only cold reserve.<br>
<br>
“Much better, Robb”, stated Loendar calmly. “Technically, ‘ends’ would be have been better translated in Common as ‘concludes’ – and you managed to reverse ‘ninth’ with ‘seventh’ once more. I swear, I will never understand what block you have formed regarding basic numbering….but all in all, much improved.”<br>
<br>
Robb growled. Putting aside for the moment that HE had been the one to suggest that High Elvish would be an interesting language to learn, he had never expected that Loendar would offer to teach him. He also hadn’t expected that his friend would be such a harsh, and dare he say, annoying taskmaster.<br>
<br>
“Don’t despair Loremaster Robb”, Loendar stated matter-of-factly. “There are many of my brethren who are convinced that it is impossible for a human mind to ever grasp the complexities of our spoken language.. let alone the written one.”<br>
<br>
That was another thing. Loendar had taken to calling him ‘Loremaster’ in what seemed to be a haughty mocking of his attempts to learn. Sure, he insisted that it wasn’t mocking at all – but a term of respect reserved for those that had taken such an earnest interest in subjects ‘beyond their standard abilities’, but Robb wasn’t so sure.<br>
<br>
“Once again, I thank you for your… patience, Loendar. As for the numbers.. I am still somewhat lost in how the words placement in sentence structure can change its context.”, offered Robb. “But I suppose that is what I get for choosing a ‘dead’….I’m sorry, Ancient… language to study.”<br>
<br>
Loendar’s response was lost beneath a sudden upwelling of sound… sounds of warning claxons, steel on steel, and explosions. To reach this far into the city with such force could mean only one thing… Felwithe was under attack.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>---------------------------oo-----------------------------</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The squeals of laughter were welcome. A cluster of children formed a rough semi-circle before her with many more arriving to witness the spectacle while their parents shopped in the open air market of Freeport. Entertainment was becoming a rare thing in the port city as times grew harsher and the people prepared for what was expected to be a long winter – free entertainment was unheard of. <br>
<br>
Xeatau smiled inwardly while she quietly urged her tiny charges to take up a dance. The two mice which composed the entirety of her show appeared unconcerned by the throng of onlookers as they wheeled about with one another – perfectly imitating the motions of a pair of dancers Xea had once watched at the Autumn festival in Qeynos. The children giggled at the sight.<br>
<br>
There had been less and less time as of late to enjoy such things and she reveled in the feeling of control – even if it was of such simple creatures. One can never practice their ‘charms’ enough, her old mentor had once told her and in truth every time was new, an adventure unto itself. Having such complete insight into the mind of another was something Xea could never explain to another, at least one that did not share the same gift.<br>
<br>
Xea glanced up from her performance briefly and flashed an amused smile at Lonain, as he lounged against a nearby wall idly fletching his latest creation. Swiftly he placed the completed arrow in his quiver and began fluidly creating another, the tasks needed to make them seemingly second nature. Where Xea enjoyed the down time, Lonain did not. He didn’t care much for cities, preferring instead to be out in the open – even the cold and distant Eastern Wastes of Velious would be better by comparison. <br>
<br>
Lonain casually scanned the marketplace looking for anyone or anything that might appear out of place. If someone here intended ill to another he would gladly step in to aid the victim – at least it would give him SOMETHING to do. Argak had gone to check on the departure time for the next ship to Butcherblock and should be returning soon. They were due to meet Robb by days end in Felwithe and Xeatau had somehow managed to convince them both that taking a ship was preferable to ‘Traveling’ through the magic or blessings of another. In truth she just wanted to entertain, he figured.<br>
<br>
At that moment Argak appeared from the entrance closest to the dockside and strode into the market with an odd look of determination of his face, rapidly side-stepping shoppers and children as he hastened toward Xea. Placing a half-finished arrow in his kit, Lonain pushed off from the wall and matched Argaks speed towards Xea. <br>
<br>
Xeatau glanced up into the anxious face of Argak and the reserved one of Lonain. <br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?” she asked, keenly aware that there was definitely something.<br>
<br>
“We will not have time to wait for the boat, I fear.” whispered Argak just loud enough for the two of them to hear. “I received word from Faydwer while waiting for the dock master to return. The orcs of Crushbone have invaded Greater Faydark and even now lay siege to Felwithe. It would appear that their negotiations with the Dark elves have been completed – as there are a host of them, both magic wielders and fighters joined with the orcs. If the rumors are true – it is expected that Felwithe will fall within the hour.”<br>
<br>
Lonain stiffened at the news as Xeatau merely remained seated, giving Argak an incredulous look. Felwithe was her home… <br>
<br>
None of them noticed the groans of disappointment from the children as the tiny dancers fell back to all fours and quickly scurried away for safer territory. By the time the onlookers had begun to disperse the three companions were already well on their way to the Spires.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>---------------------------oo-----------------------------</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There was much about the home city of the gnomes that amused him besides the stature of the residents themselves. Their fascination with surrounding themselves with equally diminutive mechanical creations, the fact that many of their larger contraptions were powered by little more than ‘hot air’, even the name – Ak’anon – brought a derisive chuckle. Above all these things, however, two others he found to be far more ‘amusing’… how remarkably easy it was for a dark elf to sneak into the confines of their mechanical haven undetected time and time again and how rapidly scores of their race had succumbed to the teachings of Innoruk and joined him as a knight of shadow.<br>
<br>
True, there was little question in Zachel’s mind of the power offered by allegiance to the Lord of Hate – but even he was surprised at how quickly the Shadow Knights had insinuated themselves within the inner workings of the gnome city. Even now members of the order were quietly ascending in the ranks of what passed for nobility here, often using ‘questionable’ means. It was so unlike Neriak – there every citizen was born into their proper place with little hope of bettering their lot, even the untimely death of ones rival did not guarantee to bear fruit. Perhaps that is why he found himself drawn here time and again – in this place Zachel could set plans in motion without raising a hand… here he had pawns. Here he could draw in power for himself while furthering the goals of his Lord… it was almost perfect.<br>
<br>
His musings were cut short as activity within the guild hall pulled him from his revere. Something was happening…<br>
<br>
Zachel stepped from the dark corner he had been observing from and grabbed the shoulder of a young gnome who had scurried too close, spinning him about.<br>
<br>
“What is all of this about, little one!” Zachel demanded, gesturing at the chaos slowly building around them.<br>
<br>
The young one blanched slightly as he recognized the speaker. “War, m’lord! The orcs of Crushbone have finally begun their assault on the High Elves!”<br>
<br>
War, is it? thought Zachel. Well now, that was unexpected… perhaps that idiot D’vinn had finally managed to get his whining heard within the confines of Neriak. This is something he would very much like to see for himself, he decided – as he slowly faded back into the darkness….<br>
