  Miscommunication leads to alot of problems in this game,  yes he could have moved to another zone and did it another way,  so could have you,  but no one wanted work it out and let others get exp from the mobs in the zone,  its kind of like watching a high lvl zone prepare for Coldain War and some guy who is farming the orc camp in EW gets upset cause fort becomes a battle zone and you have to wait,  tough SHIT !  its a game, grow the fuck up or get the fuck out!  I have never had a problem with Shadowkin, and never thought he was any of the things you called him,  so take your sorry back to the mirror pop some more pimples and find some pubic hairs,  maybe some peach fuzz you can be happy about and play the fucking game for what it is!<br>

First off don't even attempt to assume how old I am fella.  I don't think I came on here being as rude as you have.  Your comments about me needing to pop zits or peach fuzz or whatever the fuck you just said leads me to believe that you assume I'm young.  Not the case.  I'm not going to get in a debate with you about this or throw insults back and forth because that will go nowhere and only lead to frustration on my part not being able to strangle you.  <br>
<br>
So, I'm a grown man who pays his own bills yada yada and when I get online to play this game that I enjoy I don't need some guy(whether older or younger) TELLING me where I should be hunting!!!!  The first line in the chat log sums it all up basically.  Perhaps I shouldve just posted that.  Someone stated that Shadowkin's responses seemed reasonable as I agree but to me there is a definite passive agressive tone if not smugness to him.  Almost like he's baiting me to really go over the line with non overly avert proddings.  It's not going to happen though.  <br>
<br>
As far as the analogy of the coldain war, I just don't see it.  I was minding my own business, getting experience, loot, not stealing pulls, etc etc.  I'm thinking this guy did a /who in zone and saw my name and saw a golden opportunity to piss me off given our past history.  That's fucking petty.  Now if you are not Shadowkin, you  need to direct all that immature bullshit towards him.  Is it silly for me to post all this here?  Yeah probably but I'm fed up with this guy trying to ruin my gaming experience and there is no other avenue for this that I know of.  <br>
<br>
And as for you ignoring me or whatever, fine.  I don't need your help in ANYTHING in this game.  I've never heard of you even so whatever.  And if you're in some major guild and wanna try to blacklist me go ahead because I get most of my enjoyment out of tradeskills and I don't need anyone for that so piss off.  I'll just keep to myself and go on farming hg's being completely respectful of others in game.  As for you, I hope you do the same.<br>

  As for you Binnen, keep your mouth shut,  I didnt direct anything to you and in fact reading your post you said the thing I said about the log of who was being the ass in the situation.  Read my post again for reference in the facts I see from the log,  unless it was altered then that just makes the post unjustified and so on!<br>
  As for college, I already have my degree in engineering and have a great job. I just dont like to see peoples opinions and disagreements spread here unless its a serious enough case to where the other player actually causes you chain deaths,  took your items, stole your camp, blah blah blah,  did that happen?  NO,  at least from what I see, yes Shadowwhatever should have just buttoned his lips and got what we can get. <br>
<br>
 I have played this damn game too long and seen more horrible things in nature, but this is something more along the lines of 2 people who just plainly dont get along, and bringing your personal hatred towards someone here to call them a bottom feeder follows what guidelines????  none,  so get over yourself and play the fuckin game,  stop crying,  add shadowskins to ignor and play happy!  do you really need to see him sending you a tell just so you can do this over again?  I think not,  stop wasting your energy and time on someone that doesnt deserve it.  Let society and fate take care of those idiots who play!

Referring to Samadhi? That guy has some serious issues. And somehow he thinks he is funny. Well, maybe he was the first or second time, but after using the same homosexual references over and over and over, I can only think he is projecting. <p><center>

Actually, it kind of does sound like Shadowkin is trying to be nice in the post. (I went back twice and just read his replies).<br>
<br>
however, he's way off base for trying to tell someone where and how to play the game. He also appears to be patronizing and a little full of himself. Believe me, I can't stand people who threaten to tell the teacher cause someone did something trivial like saying &quot;bitch.&quot;<br>
<br>
I only wish we had the entire log. It's obvious there's more to this exchange and the previous one in EC. Parker isn't the kind of guy that would spit finely-tuned sarcasm to just anyone.<br>
