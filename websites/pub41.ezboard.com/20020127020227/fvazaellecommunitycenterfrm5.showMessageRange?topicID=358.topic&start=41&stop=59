<br>
Yes, he stated in guildchat something like &quot;I hear the Dain can drop up to 80 items now&quot; or something along that lines before we prodded into him. More than likely he was bored, and started seeing how many summoned things he could hand the Dain... notice how some specific items that could cause an annoyance were not present on the corpse(an example being Sword of Runes, in the rare chance of mage pets being involved in the kill[And pity the guild that needs mage pets to assist on the kill anyhow]).. <br>
<br>
Now you might still say he was being malicious, and finding humor at his own joke, but if you rewind /gu a few min backwards he asked the guild 'Pet Haste Mask only works on pets right?'... with a long pause before anyone gave a positive answer.<br>
<br>
Was his impishness in bad taste perhaps? Sure very well might be, was it detrimental to a kill of him? Hell no, unless the booze made him path so bass-ackwards for Sotae. Has Kemko made direct attacks against your guild or anyone in the past? Nope. Did Kemko know you were planning on doing Dain for the first time vs. another more experienced guild(read IV, since they're the only Dain killers I know of)? Nope.<br>
<br>
Trust me, there's a direct line between someone being an asshole and someone just being annoying. I could give some rather dated examples of what being an asshole is, and it requires intent to screw someone over honestly. You being pissed off because you failed due to a nonexistant buff is as ridiculous as a chain smoker blaming their lung cancer on asbestos. If someone annoyed you, sure, more power to you tell them they annoyed you, but with no pattern or proven maliciousness, it's hard to see you as anything more than a junkyard dog snapping at whomever comes near.<br>
<br>
And for an example of this.... the night following their failed Dain, after our pullers gave up on that nights learning of how to pull Dain<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Times below are hypothetical to give an indication of times, I hate using /log because it lowers the framerate on my normal comp - 450 mhz btw - feel free to pity me):<br>
<br>
8:50  --  Dain is officially given up, leadership pitches the idea of killing Wuoshi since we had heard he was up earlier.<br>
8:55  --  Getting bored of sitting around as pullers continue to make 'one more try' on Dain, I /who all the major guilds and notice Agony clustered in SRo obviously getting ready to go somewhere.<br>
9:00  --  Another /who Agony, still in SRo... pullers still screwing around.<br>
9:05  --  I invite a porter into my group and tell him to port to WL so we can start setting up shop at/around Wuoshi.<br>
9:07  --  I zone into WL, /who immediately notice that Agony is in force in the zone and /gu to not bother coming to WL since they were there, and I would watch and report results.<br>
9:10  --  Wakening Lands crashes<br>
9:15  --  I log back in to SF being accused of 'Port Bombing' Agony, with my entire group of 6 people from SF in the zone.(apparently 1 normal XP group could've 'port bomb'-ed them) (And note, that some people did say it was just bad luck, but the majority, including some of their leadership preferred the idea I stated).<br>
9:20  --  Agony loses faction with me instead of CoV...<br>
<br>
Add to this the KNOWN BUG this patch that ANY(or at least most) outdoor dragons have been occasionally crashing their zones, and you have another case of them likely pointing a finger incorrectly.(Examples I've heard for fact: Klandicar, Gorenaire, Talendor, Severilious) I'll link posts on safehouse about the phenemenon if you'd like.<br>
<br>
Trust me, there are reasons to hate people, and there are reasons not to. Krimzin and Xarr have a reason to hate me, and I accept that. I do not accept that you have any reason, other than a wounded ego to hate Kemko. <p><H2><B>--Vaclav Romanov--</H2></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 597<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/01 9:19:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whoever gave dain that haste mask</span><hr size=1> its still dumb to give a mob items unless you know more than anyone else about how mobs are itemized. <p>Procax

<br>
Your comments about the Wuoshi thing are out of place and misconstrued.  I was there.  I remember the zone crashing.  I remember logging back in and seeing you by the portal.  I remember doing a /w and seeing only a few of yer guild in zone.  I remember /gu comments such as &quot;WTF&quot; and &quot;eh?&quot;.  And most importantly I recall Serafina's /gu that sounded something like &quot;this is in NO WAY relative to the fact that SF has some peeps in zone.  This is a KNOWN bug.. blah blah&quot;.  In short Vaclav, the majority of us DO NOT blame you or yours for the zone crashing.  We know its a bug, and dont point any fingers whatsoever.  So dont go dragging our name through the mud because one of your members is getting looked down on due to a poorly timed practical joke.<br>
<br>
I remember you giving me a rez in Skyfire a few months ago.  Thx again for that (dont remember how many zones you had to go through to get me).  Very cool of you.<br>

I came home from pub about 2am being camped in icewell keep. Ran up to Dain and saw him wielding 2 hammers, I knew that they had changed the way you can effect mobs by giving them items and I knew Agony were about to attempt killing him, so I thought I should mess around abit with them in case they got him and gave him a mask and ale (since dwarvs love ale :P ) <br>
<br>
And then I dont remember any more since I had one of those very liked blackouts and woke up next day....<br>
<br>
