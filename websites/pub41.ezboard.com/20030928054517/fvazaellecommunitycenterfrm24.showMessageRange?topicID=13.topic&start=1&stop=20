The first time we were camping the Ziglark area and chef area, and the second time we were doing the Guardians in pool room and upper levels.  At the same time, IV decided to do Yelinak.  The strategy they use to get everyone to Yelinak is to have one group fight to the buff point and then CoH everyone to that point.  Unfortunately this leaves approximately 30 odd bored IV people at the zone.  At some point after they get bored of randomly duelling each other, they start to pull the entire first, second and third levels of Skyshrine to the zone.  At no point in this did they ever do a camp check to see who else in the zone might be killing anything.  This most recent event, Soliid walked right past us to pull 2 guardians and a gargoyle guard past us as we were fighting the drakes in the pool room.  The entire left side of the pool room was cleared as we were finishing the pool room spawn cycle.  After checking the zone list and seeing approximately 12 IV people, we kinda figured what was going on as we had seen it before when Riaa was pulling.  I would like to say that I respect Riaa because when informed that we were camping specific spawn points she did not pull those, but soliid on the other had continued to pull the spawns as he saw fit.  At no point did he ask who might be camping anything in the zone.  <br>
<br>
My question is basically this.  What differentiates Skyshrine from any other zone in the game?  Are we to the point now when you are raiding that if you are bored it's ok to pull someone elses camp?  Do we not respect camps anymore?  I'm a little confused as I seriously doubt we would have seen this sort of action had we been in Sebilis or in Karnors or some other highly populated zone.<br>
<br>
What disturbs me most is that when we became upset that they were pulling our camp, we received multiple responses such as:  I didn't know you owned the mobs in the pool room, etc..   When my partner spoke with Krimzin to try to possibly get the bored people under control, the response, what I caught of it before Vaz server decided to crash was basically a sarcastic, let him have it.  I apologize sir that I do not have your levels, skill and/or expertise, but I do know that walking on everyone else around you isn't the way to gain respect.<br>

I applaud you on making it become so.  In the past eight months the few times I have been there it is usualy one group at most. <br>
<br>
  As to raids I do apoligize for me and the guild.  Blame Verant's design, yes it is hard to control everyone before the raid, this happens to us in the planes also, IV has had wipeouts in the past from our own guild members horsing around.  Its not just skyshrine its every single zone Verant has put a big mob in its been going on in Sol B since Nag was a regular kill, its Seb with trak, velks with Velktor. It's not going to stop and it's not going to be just IV. <br>
<br>
 You need to consider two things, first we aren't going to be there long we try to do theese things as quickly as possible. Second we need to &quot;whip em into a frenzy&quot; everyone needs to get siked up to be on the edge. If you played any kind of sports or saw any on TV there is always the big speech by the coach designed to work everyone up. We don't have that pleasure of speech to use, so IV likes to train themselves before raids, I don't know why but it gets us going, sometimes there is some miscommunication about avoiding certain spots or some get to the verge they don't care about others this is why at the begining of a raid is not a good time to judge any guild. <br>
<br>
  In the future try speaking with the officers of the guild they tend to have a little more control. I'm not saying we were right in anyway and again I do appologize sincerly. <br>
<br>
I hope I do speak for the guild in this issue, but I'm not an officer and theese are my feelings.  I've been on the bad end of alot of Nag raid rushes destroying a good BnB group, so I know how you feel. <br>

We did statue, so I am dubious to the zek.  We zone in I do pull some stuff around the zone line.<br>
<br>
I pulled all I could find.  So I went to do more.  I walked into the pool room, there are 2 anon people in wolf form in a corner, with well over half the pool room up.  So I pulled some.  To pull from behind the pool room, I had to clear it.  <br>
<br>
First thing this guy does is make a really rude /ooc about it.  No tell saying hey, could you leave some from us.  Just goes into bash mode.  So whatever.  If he can't ask nice, he has to talk shit, then I'll do what I do to most people who talk shit.  Ignore them.  So I ignored him, and went on my way.<br>
To expect respect without giving any is just kinda humorous.<br>
<br>
You can't camp the only room that leads to more mobs, and be surprised when people pull past you.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, I am an asshole, but this guy had it coming.<br>

  We were not anonymous, nor have we ever been anonymous, which is saying alot considering I am a druid and am continually hounded for requests for SoW and TP.  When you walked into the room, we were currently engaged with a Drake in the corner which I am quite aware you saw and proceeded past us to pull the guardians on the wall (which you could have quite easily skipped and pulled the sentries at the door or 3 drakes in the far corner which we were not pulling.  The issue is quite simply, why did you not ask?  You knew we were in the process of clearing (and in actuality re-clearing for the third time) the pool room, yet you didn't ask, you just pulled.  Respect was not ours to give you in the first place, you destroyed all chance of respect when you disrespected us by pulling what we were quite obviously camping.  &gt;&gt;  with well over half the pool room up &lt;&lt; Your words sir.  This implies that some had already been killed does it not?  <br>

The left side was entirely clear up to the triple drakes which he could quite easily have pulled.  In fact, due to his level he could have easily single pulled the sentries from the door and pulled beyond, but he specifically chose to hit each of the guardians on the right wall as well as the gargoyle guard in the corner.  Anyways, gratz on your Yelinak kill.<br>

people were clearly in an area, to kill the mobs in that area.  thus, you leave those mobs for the people that have taken the time to kill in that area.  your BS excuses for needing faction blah blah blah completely avoid the topic of respect.<br>
<br>
respect would have been to communicate with these people to begin with, to ask them if they were planning on killing the remaining mobs in the room when they were done with what they were engaged with.  respect, let alone COMMON FUCKING SENSE, would have told you YES, and respect should have told you to leave them alone.  however, you did not respect them, and this does not at all surprise me.<br>

Its very clear from multiple precidents that if a mob isn't actively being killed its fair game on this server.  Why, just ask Agony about trak last night, or sev the night before!  Or how about us pulling VS's guards, and getting VS pulled out from under us.  WOW we killed a MASSIVE 20 or so of &quot;their&quot; mobs in the half hour it took for us to get coh'ed up there, BFD.  Personally I'd rather see people killing guardians for much needed faction than being afk when its go time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 9:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> Herder,<br>
<br>
This is a grey area, in my uninformed opinion.<br>
<br>
Like you, I wasn't there, so all I know is what I read <br>
<br>
First of, SS isn't a common exp zone.  that means that camp spots aren't easily defined as such.  If this were a Trak run, we wouldn't have been killing everything in sight of course.<br>
<br>
From the sounds of things, the exp group had the zone to themselves, so were perhaps in a location that wasn't ideal with interacting with others.<br>
<br>
This is a common problem with EQ in general.  Very rarely is there 30+ player raid that doesn't interfere with people exping close by.  It's unfortunate, but a reality in the game.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying IV was in the right here.  We may have been inconsiderate.  However, I know for certain that had the exp group politely mentioned that they were exping, that IV would have relented.<br>
<br>
You're not going to get anywhere being rude to people, even if they're in the wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usolidsnakeiv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SolidSnakeIV </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 9:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> Lame-inar please.  My first and only experiance with you ever, was when I called sage/sav/cav/exe, and you decided to move your group into the sage room, because I was pulling to the cav room, not camping in the room.<br>
<br>
And Herder, so in KC, if you're doing left moat, and a bridge dog spawns, and you've been camping that, you can flame the zone group for pulling that dog?<br>
<br>
And was I totally right in this situation, probably not.  Was /ooc'ing shit about me the right way to handle it, probably not.<br>

<br>
Soliid tells the guild, &quot;WTF, there's someone else here? Let's find out where they're at.&quot;<br>
Soliid says out of character, &quot;Camp check.&quot;<br>
Raiya says out of character, &quot;Pool room.&quot;<br>
<br>
/shrug <br>
<br>
Common sense is an uncommon virtue, and maybe not 'in virtue'.<br>
<br>
As for Vehnn, neither The Endless nor Agony was near the Trak spawn to &quot;claim it&quot; initially. It was a race, plain and simple. From what I could see doing a /who on Sebilis, it appeared Agony tried to rush through the spawns breaking down to Trak and ended up on a CR. Concerning Severilous, I was not there, so I'm not going to comment on that issue since I don't have the details. As for VS, Promethian was first on site and pulled VS unsuccessfully. To my understanding, The Endless people there were assisting with CR when IV started pulling guards. Guards do not equal VS himself. IV was beat at their own game of going in and taking a spawn someone else had engaged unsuccessfully already (a la Sacred Fires doing Severilous and The Endless doing VS at an earlier time).<br>
<br>
Don't come off as having righteous indignation, Vehnn. When other activities are brought to light, you look like a fool. Take a page from CC, shut up and play the game.<br>

I have a seriously hard time believing you mean that.  So since IV was just pulling VS's guards and hadn't engaged VS himself, he's up for grabs?  Does this mean we can bring 18 people down along side your trak raid, and while you pull and are fighting the prot we can rush trak and you'll have no problem with that?  BULLSHIT and you know it.<br>
<br>
Yes I CLEARLY look like a fool, what was I thinking that when a fucking guild pulls a raid mob's guards that they have a claim to it, god how fucking dumb of me.<br>
<br>
You leapfrogged us at VS.  You leapfrogged agony at trak - yes, they were fighting down while you had a coh mage in the safe spot, I call that leapfrogging.<br>
<br>
Now here's what I think is ironic.  The endless gets mad at us for &quot;stealing&quot; their VS a couple weeks ago - a VS they had failed on twice.  Yesterday hopeless order fails on VS and the endless kills it immediately.  Where's the difference exactly?  And you're accusing ME of &quot;righteous indignation&quot;?  Fuck you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usolidsnakeiv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SolidSnakeIV </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 11:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> How did I handle it?

/ooc Would you mind leaving our pulls alone?<br>

Rhyu tells the guild, &quot;Guys, stop pulling their mobs =)&quot;<br>

Like Soliid said, neither party handled it well.<br>

Still, I say, if 30+ people are taking my pulls, I'm definitely not going to be rude to them, because I know they're not going to respond well to that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubigfatbelly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bigfatbelly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/01 11:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is a little respect too much to ask?</span><hr size=1> whoa wats mir and flaming like mad, almost like shes taking this personally.<br>
