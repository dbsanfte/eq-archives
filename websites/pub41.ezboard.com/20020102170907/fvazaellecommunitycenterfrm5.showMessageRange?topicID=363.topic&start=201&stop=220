You're intentionally putting IV between a rock and a hard place to make yourself look good. How does refusing to even deal with us for the purpose of removing that clutter of people at the zoneline make you noble? How does snapping out demands and ultimatims make you just and right and moral in your stand? There are 2 people in PO I don't like... You and Alyen. You I don't like because you are a really mean man. Alyen I don't like because his rants are weak and even though he has to apologize every third post he keeps right at it. <br>
<br>
It doesn't Kead, and of the people that used to be original PO, how many are left? How many left because you play favorites and will assasinate a persons character simply because you took the whim to dislike them? How many officers do you go through in a 8 month period? So keep doing us the favour of weeding out the quality players so that we may recruit them after they get sick of you.<br>

I've stayed away from this thread,well, cuz it's just a joke. I'm sorry that peeps turned it into this Krimzin.  But since alot of the comments are off track, let me clear one thing up.  I didn't cry over you guys poking fun at me. Go ahead..have a blast..especially the ones I don't know and are just complete idiots in my eyes /cheer Bazuzu..whoever you are.....act like you know me so well, so much more..pls!!  I do ignore you, and very well thx.<br>
<br>
Thanks Cassiana. Yes as women we're a little more heartfelt at things then 15-20 year old boys are. To the rest...Sorry if I don't react to friends shitting on you the same way you would.  I *was* upset at the Al'Kabor event when the lame, and yes I said LAME, crap was spewed and I smack myself for even replying to it.  Enormous had been harassing me through tells about how much PO sux and that we'll never kill CT blah blah (hey Enormous, I take great pleasure in knowing that I dragged your corpse back to camp away from CT once. You're welcome), Thynn tried a comment at me, Krimzin even threw in something, and a few others...Anyways, it just got to me and I was more upset at the fact that I had ex guild members there that acted like they didn't know me and that it was *so funny.*  It had gotten to me  and I was frustrated and teary eyed cuz all I really wanted to do was enjoy the GM event with my friends.  This wasn't done in a joking manner either, from the tells I received from Enormous and the /says from him at the Velks zone line, it was just to be pure mean.  Now if the first comment had been Krimzin saying &quot;wtb a ct robe,&quot; I prolly would have just laughed it off and sent him &quot;hey wanna come over and let me stick this gerbil up your ass like old times?&quot; But since I had received multiple ill intentioned tells from Enormous, I was pissy about it. That's prolly the reaction he wanted outta me /shrug...oh goody for you you. you win!<br>
<br>
Ammelen, you're a cool guy.  You've apologized a few times and I give ya props for that. I don't mind my friends joking around w/ me at all..hell if you know me, you know thats all I do.  I don't want any of us not to get along. I liked most of you and I hung out when I could, but now I just get rude remarks from some of you when we're around each other and 99% of them are peeps I don't even know in IV.  /shrug Ok that's how its gonna be I guess. <br>
<br>
I'm far from a pushover. I'm more of hardass than anything.  And yes, whoever made the boss comment.  If someone that worked for me pulled a belittling act...they get the biggest workload for the next week, then at the end of the week: a pink slip and a paycheck at minimum wage. $5.15 sux at 60 hrs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It was IV that put PO between a rock and a hard place.  Krim fights for In Virtue, I respect that.  I do the same for PO.  We've crossed paths in ToV twice now.  The first time IV told our monk if he didn't move you were going to train and kill him.  Why don't you ask a GM about THAT if you're so sure you're acting within the lines?  I know I know.. you don't want someone fd'ing somewhere to watch your leet strats... tough shit, get over it.  The second time you zoned in 40 people and sat at the zone line for over an hour, creating lag so bad that not even Jaydrox could move.  We asked if at least the casters could gate out, assuming that they had bound at the zone, and were told sorry, no.  Then you wanted to pull wurms (big aoe mobs for those who don't know) on top of us when our clerics were so lagged they could barely cast?  No thanks.  Tell me... easier for IV to rush the hall and move on through or for PO to handle ToV zone at your pace?  We all know the answer, you're a bigger stronger guild.  Rock and a hard place?  No, you guys got what you wanted, we got what we wanted, 'nuff said.<br>
<br>
Yup, we've lost a lot of members, many have gone on to IV.  Some went to CC, some to Endless, a few to SF and hell.. one even went to Storm Legion.  A bunch more left the game or the server entirely.  IV has lost their fair share as well.  Of course, every large guild has lost more members to IV than to any other source... and IV doesn't lose members to other guilds.  Benefits of being top dog, enjoy it, love it, whatever.  I guess Kaminya, Firanel, Baldrik, Serafina, Eeepers and all the other guild leaders out there are just mean too...<br>

Anyways bascially your right sorry we can not pull an aoe mob into the tov enterance if a guild is already there. They then have grounds to petition. BUT, guess what ass next time we will just move into hall so then you can pull shit past us or THAT will be training. Then it turns into a gay hop each guild fest. Problem there is who will be able to handle what. So next time when we zone in we will just move into hall and set up camp ok? That way you guys get no mobs and cant pull anything past us otherwise that is training I mean since you want to involve gm's on everything right? Cause 9 out of 10 mobs there aoe something.<br>

DAOC is pretty damn fun.  We have Furrios, Nazrash, Theraxx, Scryris, Gard and many other old Celestae with us.  Right now we are playing both Hibernia and Midgard realms.  We were given 14 beta slots for the guild beta which recently started.  Anyhow glad to see you doing well.  It is sad to see the arguments in this thread.  Vazaelle sounds much like the old servers now.  I know players from both sides and there are some good people here.  I know you have heard this before but &quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You have a group of folks fighting at the zone-in in ToV.  People unrelated to the current raid zone in, sit down, and idle or go AFK while waiting for a raid to assemble.  They add lag, take damage, and there's nothing either side can do about it.  Work up some common sense, and like other guilds, assemble outside ToV in force until you're ready to go in.<br>
<br>
Conversely, if you are a lower-powered guild, and a more powerful guild needs to move ahead, understand that that's just a fact-of-live in ToV.  To move forward, they have to clear the way.  Ideally you work together and/or split the pulls to make it that much faster, and try not to pull wurms or other higher-AE mobs without folks having mana for heals, but time is critical, and it's gonna happen - just make it as painless as possible and move in as soon as you can, becasue the lag from having 60 people in one room sucks.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Understand that having 2-3 guilds running multigroup raids in one zone is going to be confusing.  Someone is going to miscall on a mana check, people are going to forget to change all their macros to /say or /gu, confusion is gonna happen.  Correct the source of the confusion, apologize, and move on.  There's no reason for any of us to resort to school-yard name-calling and bullying - most of us are adults, would never dream of being that rude to people face-to-face, and should extend that courtesy to the other real life people that play EQ.<br>
<br>
They are more than one high level guild on Vaz.  Sure, IV is ahead of everyone, sure people have hard feelings for this, or that, or because so-and-so KS'd their bloddy orc cent in EC 7 months ago, whatever.  High-end EQ is populated by people that obviously have a lot of time and emotional attachment in their characters, and with that comes ego, pride, and jealousy.  People and guilds *are* going to bump heads.  People are gonna get pissed, angry, upset, and feel as though some grand injustice has been done to them.  Get over it.  Realize that while EQ is competitive, it is stressful, it is boring...  It's also just a game.  I know, that's a cliche anymore, but realize that while high-end EQ is rough, that's no reason to not show a little consideration and at least *try* to work together, even for a brief moment, before the cussing, /petitioning, and posting on VCC occurs.<br>
<br>
...and for the record, I'm not talking about just one guild, or one incident.  I'm talking about everyone - IV, PO, Agony, SF, CC, whoever.  We're all guilty of being assholes at one time or another, and I get just as mad when it's someone in my own guild that's acting like an idiot as when it's someone in another guild.  <br>
<br>
*steps off her soapbox*<br>
<br>
Just grow up, and realize we're all screwed by the way Verant runs the high-end game in EQ. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/01 2:16:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Hey Shastis, <br>
<br>
Good to hear from you.  Glad to hear things are going well in DAoC.<br>
<br>
Anika,<br>
<br>
Personally, I think guilds should just avoid zone-in camps in TOV.<br>
<br>
Instances like this will be more and more common.  Soon it will be another guild camping the zone in, and IV, SF, Agony, and PO will all need to get through to do other things.<br>
<br>
Guilds need to use the zone-in as a gather point.  The point where you zone into TOV in WW is not a safe place to go afk, as it's often trained.  Guilds will go inside to wait, causing lag and danger for everyone involved.<br>
<br>
Camping zone-ins is for ghetto exp groups, not guild raids, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
If guilds want to camp the zone-in, they have to do so knowing that they *will* be inconvienced by another guild that needs to get by..  just as those seb/guk/solb/etc zone-in exp duos will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 697<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/01 2:17:04 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Krimzin, changed the title that Rhyu put up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  darn<br>

Anika, don't you have some people to repress?  hehe.<br>

<br>
Arthur: Then who is your lord?<br>
<br>
Woman: We don't have a lord!<br>
<br>
Arthur: (spurised) What??<br>
<br>
Man:        I *told* you! We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune! We're taking turns to act as a sort of executive-officer-for-the-week--<br>
<br>
Arthur: (uninterested) Yes...<br>
<br>
Man:        But all the decisions *of* that officer 'ave to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting--<br>
<br>
Arthur: (perturbed) Yes I see!<br>
<br>
Man:        By a simple majority, in the case of purely internal affairs--<br>
<br>
Arthur: (mad) Be quiet!<br>
<br>
Man:        But by a two-thirds majority, in the case of more major--<br>
<br>
Arthur: (very angry) BE QUIET! I *order* you to be quiet!<br>
<br>
Woman:        &quot;Order&quot;, eh, 'oo does 'e think 'e is?<br>
<br>
Arthur: I am your king!<br>
<br>
Woman:        Well I didn't vote for you!<br>
<br>
Arthur: You don't vote for kings!<br>
<br>
Woman:        Well 'ow'd you become king then?<br>
<br>
(holy music up)<br>
<br>
Arthur: The Lady of the Lake-- her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,        held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I am your king!<br>
<br>
Man:        (laughingly) Listen: Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords        is no basis for a system of government! Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some... farcical aquatic ceremony!<br>
<br>
Arthur: (yelling) BE QUIET!<br>
<br>
Man:        You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!!<br>
<br>
Arthur: (coming forward and grabbing the man) Shut *UP*!<br>
<br>
Man:        I mean, if I went 'round, saying I was an emperor, just because some        moistened bink had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!<br>
<br>
Arthur: (throwing the man around) Shut up, will you, SHUT UP!<br>
<br>
Man:        Aha! Now we see the violence inherent in the system!<br>
<br>
Arthur: SHUT UP!<br>
<br>
Man:        (yelling to all the other workers) Come and see the violence inherent in the system! HELP, HELP, I'M BEING REPRESSED!<br>
<br>
Arthur: (letting go and walking away) Bloody PEASANT!<br>

Man: Oh, what a giveaway! Did'j'hear that, did'j'hear that, eh? That's what I'm all about! Did you see 'im repressing me? You saw it, didn't you?! <br>
