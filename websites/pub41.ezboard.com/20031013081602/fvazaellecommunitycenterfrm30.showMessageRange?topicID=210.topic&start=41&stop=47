<br>
It shouldn't as a general rule.  Not because it wouldn't be the right thing to do, but because it would be far to costly for even the US to change every government.  We can only deal the the nations that pose a big threat to US interests.  In this case, we are talking the possiblity of terrorists aquiring WMD which is something important enough for us to spend a crap load of money on.<br>

Iraq wasn't even where we were half a century ago.  Hell, they were't even where we were in 1776.  Part of the reason it was possible for us to have the women's movement, the civil rights movement, and the sexual revelation is that we had a free society.  Maybe not as free as it is today but it was free enough for people to protest and to be heard and reported about in the news.  That's probably one of the reason's why were aren't as agressive toward Iran.  Many of their youth actually want freedom and, to a certain extent, they've been able to voice what they want in the streets and to the rest of the world (don't know about their news though).  Iraq didn't have that.  Those protests you see in the street now could not have taken place a few months ago.  There was not fertile ground for which the seed of democracy could grow.  Maybe 50 or 100 years from now the Iraqi people would have risen up but why would you want to them to wait that long?  Anyway, that's not why we went into Iraq but I am very pleased it happened for them non-the-less.  Freedom was a great side effect for our purpose in Iraq.<br>

If we left it would be anarcy and the Iraqis would be left without any kind of power.  Either Saddam would come back or some other undemocratic form of government might take over.  Certainly it's in the interests of the US to see that Saddam does not return to power, but it's also in the interests of the people of Iraq.<br>
<br>
It just so happens that the interests of America and Iraq coincide here.<br>

<br>
I don't think so personally.  It makes no sence to go to all that trouble when you could drill domestically for oil and make more money by cutting the middle man.  The idea that we attacked Iraq for thier oil is a conspiricy theory.<br>
<br>
I might be willing to agree with this.  We handle nations that our big suppliers of oil to the US with kid gloves.  It's no wonder that some of these nations feel they can get away with anything if they think we will do nothing about it (which so far we haven't).<br>

<br>
It was more about a free society wanting to prevent proliferation of totalitarian regimes.  You cannot realistically say that the only difference between the USSR and the USA was economic.<br>
<br>
If the USSR had just wanted to be communist and mind its own business, we wouldn't really have cared.  It was their imperialism we feared, as we feared eventually they might declare war on us and our freedom would be threatened.  We feared the &quot;domino effect,&quot; even though it never happened really.<br>

<br>
War should imo be used as a truly last option.  N Korea became very scared when Bush gave his famous &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech then invaded Iraq.  They became under the impression that they may be next when Bush started his war rhetoric vis-a-vis Iraq.  They then pushed the UN nuclear oversight personnel out, and immediately launched into a program of developing nuclear weapons as rapidly as possible.  Concurrent to this, they have repeatedly asked the US to sit down with them and officially sign non-aggression treaty.  The US has strongly opposed this, which has further increased the paranoia of an already dangerously paranoid country.<br>
<br>
The leadership of NK feels increasingly pushed into a corner and is striking out.  Again, as per the Iranian discussion with nuclear weapons, they understand that if they come into (many believe they already have at least 2) nuclear weapons the US will give them breathing room.  In other words will think long and hard before attacking them.<br>
<br>
Along the DMZ stands approximately 1,000,000+ troops (that's 9 times the force in Iraq atm).  Seoul is just 60 miles south of the DMZ.  Launching even a limited strike against NK at this time when they are already pushed into a corner would be absolutely disasterous.  For I am certain that the smallest of strikes would send NK into an absolute frenzy of all out war.  Resulting in 100,000s of deaths, economic destruction of South Korea and likely Japan (NK medium range weapons can easily reach Tokyo).  <br>
<br>
One should try the diplomatic approach more before playing the war cards with NK imo.<br>
