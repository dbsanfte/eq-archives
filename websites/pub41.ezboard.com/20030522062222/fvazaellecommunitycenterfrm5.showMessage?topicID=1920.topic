<br>
I posted this earlier but never got my message across because I unfortunately got the losers (aka fuckmitten, *added for those who don't consider it a rant unless it's in there*) name wrong.  Apologies to those who like fresher material and my bad for being a terrible ranter lol.<br>
<br>
I am not normally the type to flame or rant and I can't believe I am doing it now as this kid wants all the attention he can get. <br>
<br>
You win Flob, here is your attention sweety, now maybe you can relax. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I appreciate that you are taking great lengths to try and demoralize and stalk members of my guild as a way to spend your time without reason or provocation.  I also found out that you still have alts (Dowler) in our guild that you can log on when the leader is not there to boot your sorry ass as you spam the chat with your negative crap (I am getting screenshots emailed every day of your childish garbage, in spite of begging my guildies to use /log...).  You are really not making a dent though because our members are good people who follow &quot;play nice&quot; guidelines and help others when they can and most people know this.  There is no way you are going to spread your hate through friends who know and love each other.  Most everyone has you on ignore at this point but it still irks me to have people I know and trust slandered and I would like to give you a chance to get whatever has crawled up your ass out in the open. I'm sure we somehow deserve whatever you think we have coming to us in your pathetic little world but frankly, we have lost sight of the message.<br>
<br>
We offered you a home for a while, you learned a few skills, took advanage of us, and left us in a huff because we had the gall to ask you to not dive on NO DROP items without consulting the raid leader first and to please assist our MA as our enchanters were getting upset. Then you left the event without splitting (way to ML!). You insulted our event coordinators and support and ended an event that was supposed to be fun with a childish tantrum. The only thing I can possibly respect you for was removing yourself from our ranks. The fit was apparently not good.<br>
<br>
I noticed since that time you have been in perhaps 5 other guilds in the past 2 months. Why are you still slandering our members in /ooc and /shout and making a point of calling our administrators &quot;total assholes&quot; whenever you get a chance. You must have a pretty sorry life to spend effort making up reasons to spread hate like a disease.  Feel free to post some kind of explanation because I am really curious how we and others who come in contact with you could have possibly injured you to this extent. Are we the only ones you have problems with?<br>
<br>
Flob, since you are unapproachable in game without releasing a torrent of hate, a little advice: breathe a little man. No one meant to hurt your ego.  Lets try and have a little fun mmmkay.  No one who takes initiative to run a guild event for your enjoyment deserves to be treated this poorly.  Do you really think the coordinators held an event to piss you off?  Why come if you are going to bring that chip you shoulder?  Moreso, why would you and people like Drakis spend so much efort being complete jerks?  I can't believe you find joy in playing because you are probably one of the most bitter and miserable punks to ever grace the server.  ... what have you done for your guild lately and wtf are you looking for?  And if you tell me or anyone in my guild to &quot;grow up&quot; again I'm calling your daddy and telling him to not let you play on his computer anymore and to take away your allowance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warm Regards,<br>

I hope that what my guild has experienced with this kid is isolated and maybe there is a decent person behind this toon somewhere. If he decides to relax a little I will give him credit where due, otherwise, beware.  If he is in your guild now please take his alts too.  Also, I have overheard complaints in the nexus of him scamming people who are dumb (or trusting) enough to ask him to help with transfers.  <br>

<br>
Thank you for creating an ID just to post to this string =)  or could you be Flob himself?<br>
<br>
Please feel free to post your motivation oh how this individual has touched your heart and is completely misunderstood.<br>
<br>
I am not going to try and prove to the rest of the server that Flob and Dowler is the same person, or was that night he was scamming the bazaar etc.  I only know of one individual possible of a tantrum using the language in the text I saw.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, even if you remove the Dowler factor completely; Flob is still a bitter, juvanile who is a very poor sport and a horrible addition to any community ihmo and I want him to stop harrassing my friends.<br>
<br>
All I want from him is to post his aggressions here on why we are such horrible people so we can perhaps come to some kind of agreement.  So far, all I get is childish rants and I thought that would be perfect for him to realease that steam here =)  So far though...yawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flob@vazaellecommunitycenter>Flob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/5/03 8:29:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1920.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Starcrystal</span><hr size=1> You sure think I am alot of people.  its getting old give it up. just becuase people don't agree with you doesn't mean they are me <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raming1>raming1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/5/03 10:45:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1920.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flob ~ breathe man, it's a game ~ Vazaelle BEWARE!</span><hr size=1> christ its tofs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Got Plow?<br>
