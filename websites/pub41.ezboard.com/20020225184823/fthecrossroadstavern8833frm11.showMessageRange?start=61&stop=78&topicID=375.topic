I apologized to him but was shout flamed for it. I'm sure you'd /rude him too. Yes..I did call them treehuggerish...I didn't lie. I wish I had the email Kudain sent me still I would quote it. In the email it stated that he did not care if me and Tlueni slept in the same crib or even shared the same bottle. Don't call her by her name in guild chat. Thats a bit too strict for me. <br>
    And as for Khyron, he talked shit about wars in ooc so I said I'd take him down. Nattaly was watching us duel and I smoked his pet and was going for him, he ran off and invis'd..Nattaly healed me and he came back fully med w/a new pet and yelled at me for cheating..this repeated itself 3 times, As for training specs I was in the zone getting rdy to go kill some Anchient croc for a lower lvl friend. I'm sure it would make a good impression to train all those guildies who are waiting for the rest of the people to show up. He also decided to msg my current guild, along with any guild I join w/this flame of me cheating in a duel and training people. Whatever?....<br>
      So I made it on BadGamers.com, I am truely honored that Blackpaw mustered up some people I didn't get along with and had them put me on there *bows* along with having them post on this board. Well, As I said before, don't believe all that you hear. I am mean to people who deserve it. Give me shit I'll throw it back in ur face. Be a wiseass I'll be one back. Difference is I don't get bitter. I'm out. <p>51 Champion - Meridean

<br>
you say that i am lieing that you never called my wife names yet the entire FoN heard everything you said to her and atsoom and i went after your arse. i never left KoW on my own nor did i ever say that i didnt like your guild at all i took 1 toon out to help the crusaders of the night guild that was it. my monk sswift and my mage delkrick were still a part of your guild untill the night you called me names and told me that i was not allowed to be in your guild any longer and neither was my &quot;bitch&quot; as you so lovely put it. if it was just my story or just me complaining about you, and then seeing your defense i could see people not believeing me. However i never even got you put on www.badgamers.com nor had i ever heard of the site till i saw the underworld knights post about it thats where i found out about it. it wasnt me that put it there it wasnt any of my friends nor someone i paid to do it so dont spread lies specially when you have no fact.  as to the other guilds that have blacklisted you  isnt it funny how you said it was the chaos dragons that had a vendita against you and now it is me. what about triad of harmony or the scars of veeshawn or the underworld knights or any of the other guilds that have blacklisted you isnt it funny that poor little old meridean that NEVER did anything wrong that would NEVER think of insulting a woman or someone that came to help you  is all of the sudden completely hated by most people blacklisted from most guilds and highly unrespected accross the server. if you think i did this all myself think again.<br>
<br>
you know what you did wrong meridean you know the horrible names that you called my wife you know you were reported for it you know that you got a raid destroyed with your childish actions you know what you said that night and why you were kicked out of the FoN.  you know your past and the posts that are here are true. when you grow enough hair between your legs to stand up like a man admit your wrong and appologize for your misdeads i will gladly ask for this post to be removed untill that time consider yourself a bottem feeder and a worthless individule of the zeb server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/unatalywouldd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nataly Wouldd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(2/4/02 9:43:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Meridean didn't mean anything...</span><hr size=1> (this is Nattaly Wouldd speaking),everybody knows Meridean didn't mean anything.Sometime in your life you have done things like he has done before.The bad language,the names,etc.I think he is a nice person.At times I know when he gets angry and starts saying things.Does anyone know what's his personallity?Well I do know you seen half of his personallity,but you have never seen his other half.Meet a person for example,lot of people made comments with this person.You decided to investigate with this person.You soon figure out what people say is not true.You discover that this person is nice.Mean at times.<br>
See what I mean? It's the same with Meridean.No matter what.Don't you know how much Meridean's feelings are hurt in some way? What if this has been done with you having comments saying you are this and that when you don't.If you recognize Meridean more better,you will soon see he's a good person and not a bad one.Stick with me (that's if you got the idea) and you will see Meridean is a good guy.I am not trying to save Meridean or anything,but these comments,I've seen before.But I know he won't do it all the time.So give him a chance to show who he really is.Thanks.<br>

It just came to me!<br>
<br>
I remember when playing my alt warrior (was 38 at the time) in OT, teaming with a shammie and a cleric, Meridean comes up and asks if he can join the group. He was lvl 38 at the time as well. The shammie asked us not to let him join, saying she's had bad experiences with him before, and we didn't let him in.<br>
<br>
Meridean waits for me to bring in a mob, then tries to KS it from me, seeing as I was the only one doing dmg in our little group. I just stopped taunting and let him keep agro while I beat the mob's backside.<br>
<br>
Now, my warrior isn't too badly twinked, but apparently Meridean can't KS a lammy/jarsath trident/fbss combo with his 2 centi long swords when I'm buffed &amp; hasted by the shammie. He could, however, hold agro just fine for that mob and the next one while we got the exp. Too bad he left after the second mob to spout obscene drivel over /ooc and /shout, our cleric said she loved having the spare mana from me not taking damage to nuke/stun.<br>
<br>
However, from that one experience with Meridean, whatever he might have done that was wrong - I have no trouble whatsoever believing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uakiros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akiros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/02 12:36:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The name sounded familiar</span><hr size=1> Damn I've pissed off alotta people lol=( Perhaps I shouldn't have played this game as I had done d2...Prettymuch the reason I left d2 for EQ.

<br>
nattaly i have nothing against you  and i have seen both personalities of meridean the nice meridean that i met that got me join his guild the meridean that believed in me the meridean i grouped with in OT hunting the mudhole, yes the nice meridean i liked him i had no problems with him.......BUT<br>
<br>
but i have also met the mean meridean the horrible meridean the ruthless meridean the uncareing meridean the lieing meridean the name calling child meridean as well. sure i have had my blow up yeah i have called people names yeah i have treated people like shit as well we all do at one time or another, however i also know when to say i am sorry that i had a moment of anger and didnt mean the things i said. meridean doesnt have that part  meridean comes here defends himself saying he never did anything wrong that he never called my wife names that he never kicked me out of his guild that he never trained the raid party, that all 50 people here representing many different guilds here are all liars making up fictous storys to degrade and ruin him.<br>
<br>
nattaly all i wanted meridean to do was appologize to my wife for the nasty horrible things he said to her, all i wanted from him was a simple appology and to have him leave us alone. instead i get called yet again a liar by him and have him degrade me for my job. BTW i am a pizza driver thats my job i also build computers and own my own buisness doing that (its more of a hobby then a buisness). what is so hard to understand that i drive pizzas i happen to have a high respect for the company i work for and hope to move into it further (management or higher) but because i deliver pizzas to people so they can enjoy a good dinner with their families my wife should leave me????? wtf is that all about... so if my wife should leave me cause i drive pizzas all you worthless SOBs out there that work at McDonalds burger king taco bell wendys KFC or any other fast food place should also be batchelors/etts you should never have love or have a family or have any sort of happyness go get real.<br>
<br>
if meridean wants to appologize to me and my wife for what he has done and act like an adult and a human being then as i said before i will be glad to ask this thread gets removed  but untill he does that i will continue with a hatred for him and do everything i can to make CERTAIN that ever guild he goes to on every character he has is aware of WHO he is and WHAT he does to people and HOW he treats people so they are aware of his history. and if you cant figure out why or if you cant understand that then you need to get a better understand of what it means to be a human with feelings yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uakiros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akiros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/02 1:33:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The name sounded familiar</span><hr size=1>      I did not act as if I had done nothing, I have alot of wrongs, but there are some stories that have gotten a little streched out.

<br>
i repsect that desire to change oneself in the light of their wrongs i really do. i hope that this thread has been a part of that inspiration and also hope that you will one day change enough that you will appologize to my wife.<br>
<br>
untill that time though i shall not want anything to do with you but i will stop haunting you on your guild travels  good luck to you and your new found changes i hope they are all for the better and none for the worst good luck to you in EQ.<br>

a man that seeks not to hide his past but dare fight his past with a raised sword  and a strong will is a man that will have good luck in his future is all i can say<br>

good luck to you meridean  hopefully one day our history with each other can be forever forgetten and we can hunt together again like that day with iala in OT atthe mudhole  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ugihmlegearbungler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gihmle Gearbungler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/02 3:27:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0NgBzAAgUPSe0W6vD1GR6YcXekF!SG2N1raM372zT1veTiLv9flPVCZnpGu1Jz3Pw5iDOp7HSzG7efyWTijEvNg/kirbys width=50 height=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The name sounded familiar</span><hr size=1> This bottom feeder thread if leading to a happy ending.

Besides,you could've taken this situation in EQ and you ask him to apologize.If it that wouldn't work,I most certainly could help both of you with that.No reason to make a post saying Meridean is a bad person.You know he is a good person.But he does get angry.Meridean,please apologize to Blackpaw,Blackpaw apologize to Meridean to do this situation in the first place.This settles it! If this doesn't do it,than this forum can go on. If you want this to stop Meridean,simply just apologize to every person that thinks you are...a person you couldn't be with.Blackpaw,just becuase he did stuff to you he didn't do it on pupose.If he did,he'd be saying sorry or just kidding.But accidently say something because someone got angry,it's hard for you to forgive him now.A moderator must close this forum so someone can make a new one.This is getting pathetic.<br>

And after I started to defend you in the zone did I start to get MANY tells on how you trained the spectre on the Lowbies. Then even after I contuined to defend, you start to slam me..Sorry not going to happen if I can help it. So then I challanged you. Um hello Im a necro Im not a tank Im not going to stand there and let a warrior who at the time was two levels higher then me.. never did I invis even though it is one of *my* spells. Yes i did run form you so I could cast on you with out being inturpted. So when I ran you ran back to your cleric to get healed. Then start shouting that Im cheating by running..ROFL..<br>
<br>
So yes if I every see a tag over your head I will let your guild know what a loving and caring person you are. If you ever need your body summonsed dont call me. If you are healing and you are the only one by zone that I am bring a train to...you cant count on my not shouting train.. You can add me to your hate list cuz you are an I-dot and will never hear the end of it from me til you say sorry IN ZONE and this board..  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

That one line above has probably been uttered by every mob that's ever been kited or quad kited by a wiz or a druid.<br>
<br>
And the mob died anyway.<br>
<br>
You duel a caster with a warrior, don't complain that he won't tank you. Heck I dueled a shammie with my warrior once. You know what he did? He rooted me, blinded me, stuck 3 dots on me and when I was near death, nuked me so I wouldn't lose exp from a dot. I never even got a chance to see him, or even move towards him or away.<br>
<br>
And at the end I thanked him for nuking me since I didn't feel like losing exp that day... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=375.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=375.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=375.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=375.topic&start=81&stop=82>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=375.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showNextMessage?topicID=375.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=78><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.emailToFriend?topicID=375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.threadControl?topicID=375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=375.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=375.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm39">GUILDS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">Flame Forum<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm34">Bottom Feeders<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm35">Camelot Connections<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm37">Beastlord's Scratching Post<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm36">Moderators/Admins<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Admins Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#333333> -
