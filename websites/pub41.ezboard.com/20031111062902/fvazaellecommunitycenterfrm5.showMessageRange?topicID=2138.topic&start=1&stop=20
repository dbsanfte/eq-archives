My tanks are taunting, my clerics are healing (except heallun.. he's talking), and my damage classes are doing damage.  Our goal?  The demise of another EQ deity! No wait... phat lewtz!! No wait... it's 7 flags that we need so that people can get into elemental planes without a raid.  And as I've sat here night after night this week, tearing into reflagging's like a bag of Doritos, I've had a lot of time to think about stuff (I recently moved into a new apartment and until Thursday, i was on dialup, which gives me 5 minutes to think about stuff everytime i hit a key, as i wait for the server to recieve my directions and return them to my screen).<br>
<br>
Everquest at one point was a game, all-be-it that it was more than your average game.  But it was a source of enjoyment, of excitement.  A few months ago there was a great quote on the frontpage of magister's site about why everquest, and specifically endgame everquest was so unique.. so enchanting ... so worth it.  It used to be that your raidguild would get together, and you would decide what you were killing that night, based on what was up and your own priorities, how you wanted to play the game.  There were choices.  Velious, the greatest of all EQ expansions presented guilds with so many options... 3 factions to choose from, be daring and go factionless (which was a bigger deal back before luclin than it is now in the world of 8k tanks in newb guilds), Sleeper's Tomb was the ultimate goal, and there were different ways to get there.  5 mobs dropped sleeper's keys, and you always had a choice of what you were going to kill.  A guild could advance to ST without ever killing Klandi, Zlandi, Yelinak, etc etc, as long as they killed some of the other key droppers.  When you raided, it was your time, and you.. or the officers you entrusted to make the decisions, got to decide which loot was best for your people, and which mobs you would go after (of course based on what was up).<br>
<br>
This changed somewhat in Luclin, but not until the very end.  You had to kill Emperor if you wanted in Vex Thal.  There were no 5 mobs to choose from, if you wanted to raid the land of the undead Akhevan Rock Robe Hell, you had to kill Emperor and advance that way.  No big deal, the rest of the expansion was open to interpretation.<br>
<br>
Now?  We sit here in the Plane of Torment not out of our own choice, not because I as a leader decided that Saryrn was hooray for my guild, but because I as a leader had no choice.  You raid linearly, progressively.  Every guild has to raid the same content.   If someone is missing a flag, and another guild has someone missing that same flag... only one of you is going to get it, PoP has encouraged cockblockage and inter-guild rivalry (not the point of racing to mobs, but the point of &quot;I hate those faggots that always kill Saryrn&quot;).<br>
<br>
Night after night i deal with 2 kinds of tells, depending on what we're doing.  Either &quot;Why do we have to reflag, we were here for the flags, we arent the slackasses that missed them.  we deserve loot mobs&quot; if we are doing reflaggings.... or &quot;I am sick of not being able to get into zones because of a missing flag, /bitch /moan /pissyourself&quot; because we are killing loot mobs.  Leaders of guilds that are not entirely hardcore (and i believe i'm safe in saying no hardcore guilds exist on vazaelle.  Even when Caer Cadarn was one of the top guilds in Everquest, it did so with a very laid back attitude) are constantly put in this situation.  Then we're put in the position of deciding whether we help flag our competition.<br>
<br>
Never before would another guild have had any reason to ask to raid with their competition except perhaps emp power sources.  There was no motivation for it.  Now, we have to firmly label who is our enemies and who are our friends.  Who do we cockblock, who do we assist in catching up or even possibly passing us?   Fuck this situation.  <br>
<br>
/bitching on.<br>
<br>
Promethian Order, prior to the release of Planes of Power, was 8 months ahead of its nearest competitor.  Caer Cadarn was 6 months ahead of us.  There was no question about who was numbre 1, and who was number 2.  We had followed Caer Cadarn through most of Luclin (because of a slow start because of Ammelen Le Velious =P /hug amm) and even at some points nipped at their heels (Hi serverfirst Shei Vinitras =D), but CC pulled far ahead after they locked Emp down.  And i mean locked it the fuck down.  Not that I can say i wouldnt have done the same thing in Baldrik's place, and we've talked about the situation afterwards.  It angered me, but was not something i couldnt understand.  At this point we had killed everything in luclin except emp, VT, Seru (but we were hacking at him, had him to 32 a week before pop release, and had emp to 60'ish before pop release on one of the 2 attempts we had at him).  Enter PoP.  EA had not even killed AoW at this point, and we were knocking on the door of the next expansion.   PoP adds 5 new levels, and erases fucking years of competitive edge in a matter of a month.<br>
<br>
It trivialized everything, including it's own early content, to the point that even a guild that had never touched Ssra temple could waltz in and knock on the doors of Elemental Planes.  But you had to do it in the order they prescribed.  Why was there such horrible itemization in PoP?  YOU HAD NO CHOICE.  You couldnt NOT kill the mob, they could have put cloth sandals on the mobs and you still would have had to go in and kill the mob, not once.. but over and over till you flag every last app on the last day before you enter plane of time.<br>
<br>
They finally made some encounters worth fighting, but then made them such horrible rvr that even intrepid adventurers and eq fans get sick of doing them over and over.  People ask me if leading raids for an endgame guild is like a job.  yes it is.  But being in the guild at all now is a job.  We have no options.  We kill what we HAVE to kill to progress.  No choices, no favorite encounters that we can do over and over.<br>
<br>
Elemental Planes are a joke.  And they're made that way on purpose because people spent the first 3 tiers bitching about itemization.  So hi overitemization.<br>
<br>
I'm depressed, I'm pissed.  I'm whining/ranting whatever.  But fuck this, I hate this shit.<br>
<br>
and fuck you Shadowpaa, you fucking loser.<br>
<br>
Ake<br>
<br>
PS - Saryrn without sorrowsong is fucking retarded too.  make him a pet spawn that spawns everytime she does.  The encounter's ghey and easy enough without this bullshit piece of shit broken crap happening so that even Eye of the Deciever could waltz in and kill her with no foreknowledge of the script. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1657<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/03 9:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2138.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everquest =(</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Night after night i deal with 2 kinds of tells, depending on what we're doing.

Yup, this is why I avoid leadership with a 10 foot pole.  It's like a job you don't get paid for.  Never, ever again.<br>

At least Velious was fun! =p<br>
<br>
Overall, I can't even put my finger on why PoP sucks, but it does.  My interest in EQ waned tremendously with the coming of PoP.  Let's all just go back to Velious and fuck the rest of this shit.<br>

<br>
Fun to raid.<br>
<br>
Luclin had some ok places to exp that were kinda fun, in a way, and PoP had some places that were fun to exp(at least when I last played). But man, Velious had it all.<br>
<br>
There were some great places to group that noone was ever in, like SG, kobolds in velks before it got changed and DN. Those places would always, always be empty. That was one of my favorite things about Kead as a GL in PO way back when, he'd grab a group and go to all those empty zones to exp.<br>
<br>
And, I can't fault raidleaders who were reluctant to leave Velious as a raid target. Raiding in Ssra was ghastly after the fun that was ToV. Those small, narrow hall. The stupid, stupid traps that did shit like take all your mana for something like 2 hours before it wore off. Mobs that only spawn after after killing several mobs you aren't interested in killing. Falling thru walls. Traps that gave entire raids fake dots.<br>
<br>
I mean, some of that stuff happened in ToV too, but not every 30 seconds. Man, did I hate Ssra. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravendawn>RavenDawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/03 9:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2138.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> Nice food for thought.

Raiding in this game has become a herculean task of enduring the (repeated) encounters for the sake of friendship and teamwork.<br>

The dungeons and lands really had a certain feel to them no expansion has been able to recreate.<br>
<br>
Velious was the best raiding zone in the game for sure. The triple choice of Tormax, Yeli, and Dain. Or heck, kill all three. Then you have the Temple of Veeshan, the single most fun raiding zone ever in EQ. Some decent exp zones but nothing like Kunark for pure fun.<br>
<br>
Kunark was the best dungeon expansion for single groups by far. Sebilis rocked. Karnors castle was quite cool if ya got into the zone and did not do the entrance. City of Mist was an awesome premise and a underrated exp zone if you went up into the upper parts. Chardok was also alot of fun when it first opened. Howling stones was cool. Back when this expansion was the newest thing in EQ all the loot that we think sucks now was totally cool and the good stuff was not easy to get. You get a MOSS you had to pay well for it or have a decent raid. You get a Noci Blade and you had to have a great group, good luck affording one. Great items were still a status symbol and something to be proud to have. There were no Windblade's for every newbie to pickup off the ground, no Centi Longswords dropping like flys. I remember how cool Kunark was when it first opened for a single group to explore. It was a decent raiding expansion as well with all the class specific stuff to go after, Trak and his BP's, Undead dood and his legs (been away too long, WTH was his name?), nice rare drops like a JBB, Cobalt bracer, and other nifty items that were a treat, dont forget that Fungi.<br>
<br>
Luclin was not a terrible raiding zone. As you said Ake people had a choice. Ssra gave you many options to kill in a single zone. Hitting up the Arch Lich, High Priest, Cursed, and creator was possible in a single raid and was pretty fun. The Deep gave you two mobs that were decent kills in the THO and Burrower, little too much plowing to get to them maybe but still not bad. Shei and Itraer in Akheva were decent, Shei was a cool encounter. The key quest for the emp and the key quest for Vex Thal were gimp. I spent days camping those bloody uber snakes at the emp zone for those signet things and a huge amount of time more camping shards and crap. Then you have bane weapons? Velious did not need these dumb time sinks, why did Luclin? I never even did get my Vex Thal key so who knows about that zone, I have read it is a hella amount of plowing which sounds pretty consistent for Luclin. Luclin also was the first expansion to really screw up the economy with mudflation of awesome items dropping like crazy and being droppable. Even no drop items were dropping so much people were just looting other peoples kills and getting unreal items.<br>
<br>
Then comes PoP. I quit EQ right about the time this came out because there was no way in hell I was going to go through an even bigger time sink then Luclin. I was just about done the luclin keys and crap and in all of a week I had fallen behind my guild in PoP. If you miss a raid you are teh scrood! Well being softcore at that point I said screw it and quit. After reading all the crap about PoP I cannot say I am sad. I made a post about the planes on the general disscussion. Not only is PoP screwed up by being linear it is also totally a screwy way to implement planes. Clicky entrances all in the same frickin zone? Hello lazy bloody writers and programmers! PoP is like surfing a frickin webpage with certain little tasks before you get into each next nifty page. Planes shoudl have been implemented into existing zones where they would make sense. Plane of underfoot in the Hole behind Yael, Plane of Disease in the hidden catacombs of Unrest under the basement or maybe on an extension of the zone where the spelunker was. Plane of Fire in Sol B in some new secret area. Plane of Ice (is there even one?) In Permafrost somehere. Heck even link Sol B and Permafrost with an underground maze of new content and have the entrances of those two planes somewhere in there, this is not rocket science and is hella more interesting. You get the idea. All the planes neatly packaged as they are is total crap. &quot;Welcome back to the homepage of Tranquility, click *HERE* for the Plane of Earth&quot;<br>

<br>
I always thought it would be nice if they found a way to add expansions but keep them equivalent (i.e. they don't get harder).  Have some insanely difficult mobs in each one, have cool rare toys in each expansion, give people a reason to use all of the content instead of only the tiny bit of content that is the most recent.<br>
<br>
As it is now we're really pigeonholed into a very small set of raid targets, and that gets boring.<br>

Yeah it's too late now, but I think that would have kept the game more interesting.<br>

<br>
In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who enjoy raiding. In addition to the multitude of rewarding single-group adventures, LDoN also includes exciting and challenging events targeted at six groups or less.<br>
<br>
For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period. This allows us to place a heavy emphasis on skill, while remaining in control of the influx of new items into the game.<br>
<br>
While our primary focus for LDoN is the single group experience, we are working diligently to ensure that these new raids are centered around the principles of organizational tactics, individual skill, and most importantly - fun. <br>
<br>
We feel that the core content and rewards in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will entertain and benefit even the most experienced players. We are aware of the desire for high-end raid content and will continue to address and meet those needs over time.<br>
