<br>
Wars get duel weild, while Pallies and SKs don't, but get spells to make up for it.<br>
<br>
Typical dps for some of the 1hs for and wars (ie Lammy, Blade of Tactics, etc) is around 9 - 12, so I would assume duel weilding would put that at 18-24. This does not include procs and other goodies, depending on the weap. (and factoring out haste items and spells).<br>
<br>
Now some of the good 2hs available to pallies and sk on average do a dmg out per sec of around 17 - 18 (ie AP, Exquisite veliums, FD), with Reavers about 21. (others such as Arbitors do 14 and Sog about 16 I think) Good 1hs (like my MDS) do 19 dps (yes a 1hs !). The Dawncaller 1hs does 24 dps.<br>
<br>
So in pure dmg output, it looks like wars do slightly more dps, of course depending on the weap, because the Dawncaller would be right up there even. So over time the dmg output is a little more, but over a minute maybe 60 pts, a hundred pts? Not that much of a difference IMHO if the pally has a good weap.<br>
<br>
Now if you add the pally and SK spells, such as Pally flame of Light  or the 60dd weapon procs spell, other dmg stuns, etc (again, not including any specific weapon procs), then the whatever gap in dmg difference exists is bridged. Of course, if you are low on mana in a long fight, the war will out dmg, but depending on the weap, the gap might not be that much, or minimal.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, conclusions?<br>
<br>
I think that pallies and SK's properly equipped do dmg approaching the other melees, and that the gap is not very significant because they can make up the difference in spells.<br>
<br>
But against undead? My MDS does 19dps, and I proc a 250dd against undead about 2 or 3 times a minute, plus a 150dd undead spell, stacked with my other 60dd proc, and flame of light 150dd, I mean, that is a lot of dmg.<br>
<br>
So, if my dmg output sucks, why as a 50 pally grped with 50+ monks and wars do I draw the aggro a lot without even taunting? And against undead, forget it guys.<br>
<br>
My AC is above average, and my hps are above average for my class. Now, I don't have the hps an ogre war has, but my AC is pretty close or better than wars of my level.<br>
<br>
Bottom line. Pallies are awesome against undead in combat, and slightly below warriors in regular combat. But warriors are the best overall melee and tankers, pallies are pretty good in overall melee with good equipment, but are best at undead combat.<br>
<br>
So, if you want a overall built to kill tank, take a warrior. If you want an undead slayer and general purpose tank, pick a pally. If you want a strick dmg dealer that can't take the hits, but does nice dmg output, pick a rogue or monk.<br>
<br>
Each class has its purpose, and the opinions above are mine, and any errors or mistakes you find are mine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Mnks/rogs can get acceptable hp to tank in normal groups.  A monk can achieve 3khp unbuffed with a moderate amount of high end gear (say 1-3 ntov items).  I am sure a rogue can attain a similar amount.<br>
<br>
Thats more than enough to compete with the un-uber lvl 60 warrior in normal groups.  And quite enough otherwise for exp groups.<br>
<br>
Mnk AC I know can easily hit the soft ac cap, I am betting that rogue can do the same.  Mnk passive defense (avoidance/defense skills) is arguably better than warriors (or rog/sk/pal), while our migitation will be roughly equal at that point with everyone else's (thx soft cap).<br>
<br>
Granted, neither mnk nor rog have taunt, which is a killer (specially to lazy casters), however an aware and knowledgable group can easily deal with such agro.<br>
<br>
When you start getting into raid class mobs (oh 200+ hitters on avg), is when warriors shine.  The extra hps pays off, as does taunt, and defensive.<br>
<br>
So....to say that rogues and monks can't take hits isn't true.  We're by no means warriors, and we sure as hell can't taunt, but we can take dmg at least as well as pal/sk.<br>

Fight time : 16 min Total damage: 63,000 DPS: approx 65<br>
<br>
This is my worst ever with best around 100k, I was guessin around 70k today tho (less nukes and 1 crit total) just happened to log it today. And melees have around 800 atk or less on this fight and pretty much do shit for damage.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, wizards can also be good in normal groups. It really depends who you've grouped with. There is some wiz who will sit around doing shit and stand up and nuke once every now and then and then there is some that actually do considerable damage and pay attention in grind groups, even chain pulling. Granted our damage could use some work pre-60 for grouping, focus items help. It's not just about nuking either. Stuns and roots and rains can be great assets in daily groups, pre-60. Wiz can help park stuff, assist the enchanters if they're havin trouble and stun healers/gaters etc etc etc, but some people are just too lazy to do anything extra. And if you're low enough level that you are in LOIO, I suppose wizards do less damage than all the rogue and monk twinks. Big surprise there. You can't twink casters spell damage, just their mana pool. IMHO on a new server before there is high end weapons or even semi decent ones flowing into the twink economy and everyones on par, wiz is pretty much equal. It just changes over the course of time because you can twink melee so easily.<br>
<br>
Worst class to play high end game period has to be magician. Magician is a HUGE asset to any raid with mod rod 2.0 and focus items and COH and malosini and the more of them the better... But who the hell wants to sit in a corner the entire ( for the most part ) raid chaining rods and summoning shit. I'm sorry but that's not fun for anyone, but props to our mages because they always do it and it helps greatly.<br>

Wizards rock in the endgame, the only thing we dont shine at is regualr xp grind groups, there we are ok but not very good. <br>
But anything else we can do very well, some things better than any other class. <br>
Anyone who has played his wiz up to 60 deserves the power we are granted then.

No double attack so the damage output blows, yea they get some spells but the general feeling i get when i join a group is that people wish i were a shaman. Not a ton of hp on a beastlord so they can't tank much. I could probably pick out many more things, but i'll stop here. Beastlord = no thx.

<br>
As long as they are not asked to tank mobs that really require defensive disc, they make very good back-up tanks.<br>
<br>
They have a ton of spells and skills that are very usefull, not the least of which are: root, stun, rez, LoH, cure(s), removing curses, some good buffs, and on and on.<br>
<br>
At one point VI gave 'em a skill to silence mobs, but that trivialized so many encounters they had to take it away.<br>
<br>
If I could pick a single thing a paly should get to make them even better end game, I would suggest a defensive disc that is either a smaller percentage then the warriors dmg reduction or lasts for a shorter duration.<br>
<br>
I agree in that I feel for mages, but they still get their moments. When a very difficult mob has wiped all your tanks but is still at a few percent health and the order goes out, &quot;Feed it pets&quot; - those epic mage pets are meaty. Leveling with mages was always a blast as their pet dmg added to some very effecient rain spells made them the masters of sustained dmg. <br>
<br>
Perfect pet control would be a great boon for mages. I would also like to see them get a mana sieve.<br>
<br>
Of course, the end game has given melee classes ungodly good ratio weapns which to balance VI will give casters stronger spells and then create tougher mobs. . .ahhh power creep. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/unazarpazar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nazar Pazar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/10/02 1:48:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2285.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: blah blah</span><hr size=1> /agree Zamtin 100%<br>
