<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rogue Epic Step-by-Step</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. Pickpocket Stained Parchment Top from Founy Jestands in North Kaladim outside the bank (+520, +307). Founy despawns every day at 8am game time, and respawns again at 10 am game time. He does NOT always spawn with the &quot;Stained Parchment Top&quot;, so you may have to wait, or come back for another visit later. The simplest way to get the parchment piece from him is to pickpocket it, so you should definitely max your pickpocket skill to 200 before attempting to steal the piece.<br>
<br>
2. Pickpocket Stained Parchment Bottom from Tani N'mar in Neriak Third Gate at the rogue guild (+650, -1300). Use the Mask of Deception to get into the dark elf city. Tani despawns each game night at 8pm, and proceeds to respawn/despawn repeatedly until 10pm, when he respawns and stays up until 8pm the following evening.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*note:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Tani's spawn has reportedly been fixed.  He does not appear to repeatedly respawn between 8 and 10pm.<br>
<br>
3. Sneak/Hide and pick up the Book of souls from Maestro of Rancor's nightstand in Plate of Hate. It is in the SW corner of the second floor on Maestro Rancor's building (-60, +3).<br>
<br>
4. Give Stained Parchment top and bottom to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold (+10, +325) for combined Parchment. Say 'I need to see Stanos' to Anson McBale to get Stanos to spawn. Be sure to stand on the table behind Anson.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*note:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Anson is not always spawned, sometimes he has a PH that cons dk blue to a lvl 50.  Killing PH's will lower your faction with Stanos/Anson.<br>
<br>
5. Give Combined Parchment, two bottles of milk and 100pp to Eldreth in Lake Rathetear for Scribbled Parchment. You can find Eldreth in the tower on the northeast island (+2600, -550) of the lake. Eldreth has an exactly 7.5 hour spawn time. You say:<br>
'Hail, Eldreth'<br>
'That was scary'<br>
'Stanos sent me'<br>
'He wants you to translate this parchment.'<br>
'I will pay you.'<br>
Now give him the Combined Parchment, two bottles of milk and 100pp<br>
<br>
6. Give Scribbled Parchment to Yendar Starpyre who wanders around in Steamfont for Tattered Parchment. If Yendar is not up, you can go to his brother, Tobon Starpyre , who is found in the Library Mechanimagica (the caster guild) in Ak'anon and say to him, &quot;Who is Yendar?&quot; This will cause Yendar to spawn out in Steamfont. You say to Yendar:<br>
'Hail, Yendar Starpyre'<br>
'Can you translate this document?'<br>
Now give him the Scribbled Parchment and he will despawn.<br>
<br>
7. Once he respawns give Tattered Parchment and Book of Souls to Yendar Starpyre in Steamfont. He spawns and Renux Herkanor, a lvl 50 rogue who wields a weapon called Trochilic's Skean which procs Clockwork Poison, a stun/DoT that is very deadly. Kill her and loot Translated Parchment and Jagged Diamond Dagger. The best way to kill her is to have a druid constantly snaring her to get agro while everyone else beats on her, or to have someone snare her and an enchanter contantly tashing her to get agro while everyone beats on her.<br>
<br>
8. Give Translated Parchment to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold for Sealed Box.<br>
<br>
9. Give Sealed Box to any of dark elves in house at (+800, +2400) in Kithicor to cause General V'ghera to spawn. All the dark elves are 55+ and KOS to everyone. General V`ghera is a level 63 shadow knight, casts several dangerous spells, hits for over 200, and has a 500 damage lifetap proc, as well as a huge harmtouch. He also has around 32,000 hit points. First clear out most of the house so that there is only one dark elf left. BE SURE your pullers leave ONE of the dark elves behind, otherwise you will not be able to turn in your Sealed Box to spawn the General! Brigadier G`tav is the best choice to leave. You will need a force of around 30 people to kill the General safely. It should be a good mix of tanks, nukers, healers, etc. This force should begin assembling at the Highpass Hold zone border area (in Kithicor) at around midnight game time. The reason for this is so that by the time it is 8 am in game, all of the wandering undead in Kithicor will have despawned, and your rangers will be able to start individually pulling the dark elves from the house, to your waiting raid party, who will dispatch them. The rangers, if they are high enough level, can actually start doing this before the undead despawn, since they can simply bring the undead with them (none of the wandering undead in Kithicor are particularly powerful, and are no threat to a large party of level 50+ people). Once the DE house is cleared (EXCEPT for Brigadier G`tav, or whichever DE you choose to leave behind), everyone in the party should move to the road north of the DE house, at approximately +1100, +2600. Be sure that they do not run near the DE house on their way there. The party should then buff up and get ready to fight. At this point, only Brigadier G`tav should be inside the house. The rogue who has the Sealed Box should sneak-hide, move into the house, stand BEHIND the Brigadier, unhide and give him the box. Due to the Brigadier's positioning, and where General V`ghera spawns (he always spawns IN the house, regardless of the location of the dark elf you hand the box to), the rogue SHOULD have time to re-hide before the General notices him. At this point, the waiting ranger can solo-pull the General over to the raid party, while the rogue sneaks away from the house, and goes to join the party. Once the General is dead, loot the General's Pouch off his corpse and IF HE DROPS IT, Cazic Quill. A common practice is for several rogues to have a &quot;General party&quot;, which basically means that they all turn in their Sealed Boxes one at a time, causing multiple General V`gheras to spawn. Once the first general is dead, the next rogue moves to the house again, hands in HIS box to Brigadier G`tav, the ranger pulls V`ghera again, and you kill him again. Repeat this process until all rogues present have their Pouches. (Note that if you take a long while, the nightly undead may start spawning, so your group will have to keep an eye on them -- a common practice is to have the enchanters keep the undead mezzed during the General fight, so that the undead can be picked off afterward.) If the Brigadier aggroes on someone, you will not be able to give him the Sealed Box until he loses aggro. The usual method is to have an enchanter charm him so that he is aggroed on nobody except the enchanter, and then to mez and mem blur him over and over until it takes, and he forgets what he's doing. If you kill him, then no other rogues get to turn in their boxes until the dark elves start respawning (8 or 24 hours, depending on who you believe)! However once all the rogues are done with their boxes, you may freely kill him, for there is a chance that the Brigadier will drop the Robe of the Kedge (see the &quot;Cazic Quill&quot; subquest, summarized at top and detailed below)! <br>
<br>
10. Give the General's Pouch, the Cazic Quill, and the Jagged Diamond Dagger to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold for the Ragebringer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*If General V'ghera does not drop Cazic Quill:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. Kill Oracle of K'Arnon in OOT and loot the Robe of the Oracle (or buy)<br>
2. Kill the Ghoul Arch Magus in Lower Guk and loot Shining Metallic Robes (or buy)<br>
3. Kill Ishva Mal in Splitpaw Lair and loot Robe of the Ishva (or buy)<br>
4. Kill Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep and loot Robe of the Kedge or kill Dark Elves in the house in Kithicor<br>
5. Give the four robes to Vilnius the Small in Western Plains of Karana for the Cazic Quill. He can be located in Western Karanas in the bandit camp at location +340, -6700. Making him spawn will take some work. First, be sure all bandits are in the camp. You must kill and continue to kill the bandit which runs from the camp to the top of the hill until the &quot;brigand&quot; spawns. The &quot;brigand&quot; is an ultra-rare spawn. Leave the &quot;brigand&quot; alone, and at 11 p.m. game time Vilinus the Small will spawn in his place.<br>
