But your actions demonstrated that you really didn't care about the feelings of other players, and certainly not about the feelings of your guildmates (allegedly your 'family').<br>
<br>
Nobody in the guild was requiring you to care. But to totally ignore the pain that many of us were/are in, and to make light of it, shows a terrible lack of empathy &amp; compassion. I get the impression you're still young, perhaps age will bring about a little more humanity.<br>

You don't want to care, fine. But go not care around someone else.<br>

<br>
Aremo is auctioning her CoF because she was removed from agony, I'm sure the fungi tunic will go with it.  Hell, the SoM would too if it wasn't No Drop.<br>
<br>
At first the removal was due to be a temporary measure to help folks calm down and not flame each other.<br>
<br>
However, Aremo's steadfast defense of being a worthless piece of shit has turned that removal from temporary to permanent status.<br>
<br>
I honestly didn't believe it was necessary to remove her permanantly from the guild based on just the orginal comments, as everyone was dealing with pain and anguish in their own way.<br>
<br>
I have since revised my opinion.  That young person has as black a soul as anyone I've ever met.  I truely feel badly for her that compassion isn't something she feels.<br>
<br>
What she does with loot she got from our guild, I could give a damn less about.  <br>
<br>
Loot means nothing.  Friends, family and support are what matters.<br>

<br>
Loot means nothing.<br>
<br>
Not something you hear from a guild officer everyday.  I'm glad I found this family in Agony, and a couple of other people around Vaz...<br>
<br>
As for Aremo, I'm sorry you feel that you were wrongly blamed for auctioning a CoF.  Get over it.  Funny that little things like that bother you so much, in light of what does not bother you.<br>
<br>
As for the sisters in general... I won't speak for Agony, only for myself.  I harbor no hatred toward either of you.  What I feel is pity.  There is something so tragic, so horrible at some point in your life, that you still feel you have to lash out at everyone that ever gave a damn about anyone.  It's not about an opinion, it's about an attack on compassion, empathy, sympathy... the things which make us human.<br>
<br>
Your reluctance to drop this issue further exemplifies the reason why you were removed I think.  You see Krialis post as &quot;Attack_on_Aremo_51&quot;, but in reality Krialis was simply stating that in the wake of what has happened, loot has taken a backseat to friendship and compassion, and that there was a weight that was more important to get rid of, in spite of that loot, as it dragged our friends down.<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope that no one ever does to you what you have done to so many, as they struggle through such a mind-numbing, heart-shattering, soul-enveloping experience.  Whether you knew someone there or not, this situation will affect you.  Thousands are dead, hundreds of thousands will wake up, walk through life tomorrow, and be missing something that was so vital before.  I could discuss the economic and political changes that this will bring about (and they ARE numerous), but at this point I am personally more disturbed by the image of _a_mother_01, waking up and reaching for her husband, who is not there.  Or the children who have to find out now what death is (An experience that came too early for me, and that I dread for others to have to endure), and for those groups of friends sitting stupefied as they realize that the lull in their conversation is one that would have been filled by someone who they will never see again.  And these things, these, what might seem to you to be insignificant, changes will affect us all.  And for that reason, even in your inhuman lack of compassion, you should &quot;care.&quot;  Your life has been forever altered.<br>
<br>
To all of those out there that did lose someone, or know someone who did, my sincerest empathy.  This is a trying time for us all.  <br>

Now for my own purposes I will transition this back to something slightly more relevant (imho, at least).<br>

Though I wouldn't say it is responsible for Tuesday's violent acts, people fighting just because they won't back down or because... they've always been fighting, has led to so much unnecessary violence and terrorism over the years.<br>

It's one thing to engage in rants and flames here all in good fun, hell, I do it all the time, strengthens my rhetoric for my coming political career, you know?  But seriously, sometimes you gotta back down, or, at the very least, just let shit slide and move on.<br>

<br>
Requiring someone else to &quot;throw the first punch&quot; doesn't keep you out of fights -- it encourages them.<br>
<br>
Turning the other cheek just presents a new target.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
I started my life as a pure pacifist.  I never picked a fight as a kid.  I was a lot smaller than everyone else around me and became a natural target for agression.  I didn't mouth off to people, I did my chores, I did my homework, I listened to my parents.  I got the shit beat out of me every week because it was known I would not fight back.  Usually this nasty cycle of beatings would begin because we moved a lot (I went to 17 different schools between the 1st and 12th grades).  Kids just want a way to make themselves feel bigger than they actually are and &quot;the new kid&quot; is commonly that outlet.  <br>
<br>
When I began to fight back, I fough back HARD.  I fought with an intensity you don't even see in movies.  I didn't care how many there were, nor how badly I was beaten before it was all over.  If someone pulled a knife on me I did my best to invert it, or better yet take it away and use it against them.  One guy had to get more than 80 stitches to sew up an abdominal wound inflicted with his own knife.<br>
<br>
Word got out that I was no longer an easy target.  New people stopped using me to prove how tough they were, and I only had to deal with those who were already picking on me.  I had stopped the influx of beatings from new people and in no small way began to win this war of my childhood.<br>
<br>
As I got older I grew bigger. People stopped perceiving me as an easy target merely on what they saw.  These bullies moved on to easier targets, which I then moved to defend with the same intensity I had defended myself.<br>
<br>
My lesson learned was &quot;Some people will be violent if they think they can get away with it.  Pacisifm doesnt deter these people.  The threat of intense physical pain seems to work very well.&quot;<br>

<br>
I have a similar history... but ended up incarcerated for it.<br>
<br>
/sigh.<br>
<br>
But even so, I have to agree with Anywon on that point.  Pacifism only provides a target that won't fight back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=406.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=406.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=406.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=406.topic&start=81&stop=83>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=445.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=406.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=406.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=406.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=406.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
