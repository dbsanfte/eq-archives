They made the choice to put themselves in a posistion to pk and be pk'd, I didn't.  I won't make fun of them because they suck at killing big mobs because, hey, their bag is killing other players.

You get out of line on a raid, you'll get left there or denied your corpse if it's a Xteaming guild that your in.<br><br> Genereally Zeks high end guilds have a more pwerful raiding force and a larger number of skilled high end players..why you ask?<br> <br> Well lets just imagine you're taking on The AoW...and you're in Guild A. Guild B zones in with the sole intention of denying you the kill on AoW...how do they do this? Kill your clerics is how. You then have the problem of PvE AND PvP at the same time. Guilds like Pandemonium or Warlords of Zek have no real problem fielding both encounters at once. <br><br> Here's another little tidbit, for all the high end uber guilds that came from E'ci and The Rathe, the Sleeper was awakened on TZ long before Zeb had that problem.<br><br> SK epics are prolific on TZ vs Zeb..why? SK epics are a huge PvP advantage and the high end guilds focus on that. Who do you think guards the guilds when they're doing a PvE encounter? Paladins? Pfft. SK's and Rogues are prolific on the Zeks for a number of reasons.<br><br> Wise players know the golden rule as well. Bank, often as you can, and if you have to quit a camp to bank you'll do it.

The idea that lights and darks cooperate is abhorent to the team zeks. You think we have politics on Zeb? YOu haven't seen anything yet. Our flame board is at best tepid when compared to TZT. They don't even have a flame board, it's their general chat forum.<br><br> They're not all assholes though, or gimps even. They're highly competitive people with a desire to prove themselves in this game. You can rely on your team mates more on TZ than you can on Zeb. Afterall, if you're fighting someone, you never know if that one guy you didn't help could be the one guy that could save your ass when you're heading to the bank with your life savings.<br><br><br> Last note...beware the Gnomes...they are EVIL!! <p><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 51 Mojo Troll<br><center><font color=orange><b> Master Of Descending Darkness(DD)<br><font color=yellow>The Biggest b00bs on Zeb</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucamoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Camoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#333333>(4/7/02 9:50:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=504.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pk gaybies</span><hr size=1> You missed the point Moggle.

If you've never experienced even lower mid level PvP, then you shouldn't pass judgement on those players. They experience PvE just as often as you do up till they decide they've found their niche. At that point they'll turn on their fellow players with a vengence to enjoy the PvP aspect. You'll find that after a couple months at a given level, you level up a bit to have access to the people that hurried past you in level so they wouldn't have to deal with you. Belaggio was a good example on TZ.<br><br> Ryna, PvP is *very* intense, your first couple of fights will have you hooked for a while. The politics and the in-fighting on the Zeks are about the only thing that causes people to leave. Myself for example. I used to get grief for dragging my enemies corpse to a safe spot so they could retrieve their gear and leave. Or I'd even arrange a rez for them if the fight was honorable. Not ruthless enough for most TZ folks though hehe, so I moved on.<br><br> Camo, they don't waste much time thinking about blue servers. Who gives a rats ass what guild looted what on a blue server? FoH and AL are about the only ones they pay attention to and that solely because they want to see what can be found. <br> The point of the original post was Anti-PvP, not PvP brags about being better than us. My comment regarding calling us Carebear servers is the whole hand in hand nature of blue servers. That name came out long ago &lt;shrug&gt; and it's meaningless as anything other than a moniker.  I brought it up more as a manner of saying so what than saying that they have other insults for us. They generally don't think much of us one way or the other. They've got other things to think about.<br> &lt;cackle&gt; and the 133+ over there DO like to brag...ALOT...but mostly it's just fun and games no ones very serious about it, with a couple exceptions.<br> My favorite sig over there is &quot;Porting Lights to bind points for 3 years, now serving 10,357&quot;<br> <br> I think I just wasn't clear enough in my wording, mostly because I was a little irate over the attack.  And yes, wakening the sleeper is a b00bs job, if you can read you can pull it off with ease I suppose. <br> How's this for an everyday example though...<br> SoG is raiding Fear, easy enough pre-revamp, clearing the zone has just begun when 40 people all in skeleton form come around the hill from the other side. Seems Pande has decided they want to pursue thier foes on the Planar level. Imagine fighting all the critters that can add onto you in Fear AND another 40 people who are out to eradicate you, with far more skill than A_Scareling_03. That level of skill indicates both PvE as well as PvP skill. Siyo's post seemed to bash their PvE skills without considering the full picture. MY intent was to try to give a better idea of the Full Picture so that readers would reconsider any assumptions. <br> Frankly I don't give a damn what they call me on TZ/SZ/VZ/RZ they're not on Zeb, so I can't epic dot them for it. I don't care how small their penis is in comparison to mine, nor how big their breasts are if that be the case. Imagine you have my background of PvP, and friends still on that server, now read the title of this post. <br> <br> PvP isn't for everyone, as a matter of fact there are people on those servers that aren't really in it for PvP. Fucking sicko's preach and whine about lets all get along....on the wrong server. It's PvP Teams on TZ, not Lights vs. Darks.

I recommend Tallon as Vallon is pathetic for PvP action in comparison. Once at 30 you should experience alot of action, or you could just hang out in EC...also known as Suicide Commons, Halflings, Humans, and Dark Elves fight for superiority over that zone continuosly, and outside the zone to Nek forest the bodies sometimes numer in the dozens. <p><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 51 Mojo Troll<br><center><font color=orange><b> Master Of Descending Darkness(DD)<br><font color=yellow>The Biggest b00bs on Zeb</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubududan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bududan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#333333>(4/10/02 1:39:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=504.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bah!!</span><hr size=1> Don't bash Vallon.

Look on the story boards for Soulslams stories, He used to have me howling from his bad godzilla movie style stories.<br><br> Those that know him as Burf/Burtal on our server, he used to be Stumpiie on TZ, Halfling druid hated by everyone pretty much. Ruthless slayer of anyone not short, he would haunt zones where crossteamers would play...and kill their tallie members while they watched.<br><br> I as a Troll Warrior had tracked him down to South Karana where he was picking people off as they zoned in on the bridge. Little bugger ran me into the water with 4 of my friends and managed to get us all rooted and KEEP us rooted underwater. Nice of him to stay and chat while we drowned though. Sarky bastard.<br><br> I can't remember the fellas name but he had a series of SS's of him while hunting on the Kelethin Platform, outside the bank. DE rogue, made a fortune there and was able to bank it as well, though he died often after banking to the banker himself. Huge pair on that guy, he musta had trouble sneaking with those creaking in his armor. <p><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 51 Mojo Troll<br><center><font color=orange><b> Master Of Descending Darkness(DD)<br><font color=yellow>The Biggest b00bs on Zeb</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwhizardio.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizardio</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(4/10/02 5:53:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=504.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pk gaybies</span><hr size=1> Can you post a link to that message board? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umogglenottewbrite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moggle Nottewbrite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master of Darkness </span><br>  Posts: 833<br> <font color=#333333>(4/14/02 11:57:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=504.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pk gaybies</span><hr size=1> yeah, it's on my work pc though, I'll get it on here Tuesday. <p><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 51 Mojo Troll<br><center><font color=orange><b> Master Of Descending Darkness(DD)<br><font color=yellow>The Biggest b00bs on Zeb</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udrenthaod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DrenthAoD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 6:30:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=504.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Dutch, what server on UO?<br><br>I'm assuming Darktide for Asheron's Call?
