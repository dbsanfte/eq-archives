I don't expect Saalron to apologize for being like he is. Why would I?  He is who he is. <br>

He sees the difference between why he trains and why I have on occasion done the same.

Everyone knows you have to pull the well grouped mobs just past and through the target objective making sure aggro is achieved and\or pathing after the FD results in the mobs aggroing on the objective. <br>
<br>
Motives sure are different. Very different. Night and Day. And certainly I did not begin my existence in EQ &quot;meating out justice&quot; on my own. At one time I held the, I guess in retrospect, &quot;niave&quot; idea that GMs could actually perform that task. Only after they have miserably failed at that task while in the face of /reports, logs, etc....only then did I take a NECESSARY step towards the &quot;dark side&quot; if you will. <br>
<br>
And what's more.....I actually told the GM (amato fyi) that what Verant\SOE was doing by failing to deal with antisocials was forcing decent players to adopt the very tactics of those people to deal with them. Interestingly, he uttered not one word of protest after I indicated by dissatisfaction. We just both went on our merry ways.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saalron@vazaellecommunitycenter>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 720<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 4:44:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1891.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hehe</span><hr size=1> Giving them aggro is training.

<br>
And you're right about GMs not giving a fuck. I enjoyed saving someone or CRing someone that was pretty much doomed as much as wiping out people who were pretty well fortified.<br>
<br>
I had more than 1 admin person send me tells about a person that they officially could not help. Down the well were 3 level 30ish corpses. So I petitioned that somehow the game moved me from thurgadin to the hole after I crashed and the gm moved me to dorfland and I went in and dragged them to the back exit and ressed them myself. Actually, more than once I'd gone down there to bail out some level 30s, what's the allure with the well, eh?<br>
<br>
They'll also send tells about a person that they officially can not warn or ban. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Welcome to the internet, as long as someone has to run the game/board/application, there will never be completely unbiased admins.

<br>
Maybe. But also recall that Norrath exist only because people fork over their 12.95 a month. Most Internet MB's etc do not necessarily have that arrangement. <br>
<br>
Now of course if every SoE employee got down and /worship their customers with respect I still don't think that unbiased ingame administration would necessary follow. It's just a human nature thing imho to express bias. The level of sophistication in that bias is low in the case of SOE...heh. If what is said about your average guide\GM is true(ie they'd be likely to confuse Vulak Err with A moss snake in EC given their experience levels in EQ), then maybe the image of the sought after and idealized &quot;uberplayer\guild, etc&quot; in front of them makes them act differently than when it's a few ppl in who /pondered   &quot;What down der in dat well.&quot; <br>
<br>
To a degree it's human nature to think that because person X adorned in the best gear\great guildtag standing in front of you they must be right or telling the truth etc. Sometimes people want to believe that that which they idealize is pure. <br>
<br>
This realization sort of hit home recently in case of the PNPing Humpmydonkey Ranja /petitioned the evil Venthos and immediately had his petition upgraded and dealt with etc. <br>
<br>
The typically joe doesnt get that immediate escalation in a simple grouping situation that deals with an issue like KSing or some other non-guild raiding event situation. If I had a dollar for everytime I(playing as an unguilded toon) was told to mail eqmail@verant or go to the website and circlejerk my GM...or blah blah blah...you know what I'm talking about.....I'd be stinking rich. The simple fact was that the Ranja in that case got special treatment. Yet more fuel in the &quot;solve it yourself&quot; category. <br>
<br>
OF course the problem, and I will readily admit this, with the &quot;solve it yourself approach&quot; is that not everyone is as leveled-headed, fairminded, and socially adjusted as me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Some people might actually don the EQ police rubric in a very Mark Furman manner(to borrow the crooked cop analogy from the OK trial). And clearly that would suck. <br>
<br>
So fuck ya...there is no PERFECT solution. But then again the problem wasn't caused by me or ppl like me. It was caused by grievers and other assorted antisocials.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=truthreason>TruthReason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm actually Goanad.</span><br>  Posts: 414<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 6:25:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1891.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> OK trial...wtf....could have swore I typed OJ trial bleh <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silvirthewizard>Silvir the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1083<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 6:54:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1891.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> last time i got trained by saalron i clearly remember a fd'd monk fairly close <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rangergoldeneyes>RangerGoldeneyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 991<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 8:16:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1891.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> now that i think about it...</span><hr size=1> ...I think Saalron did just that(parking for the puller) one day to a group i was with in Seb.

He's a solo prick.  Sadly, he seems to know how to not get caught.  He never stays in one zone for more than twenty minutes at a time, and usually logs off relatively soon after his infantile plea for attention begins.<br>

Why the fuck would he care if he died?  He's only training in PoP zones so the GY will always return his corpse to him.  He obviously couldn't care less about his level.  It's just a matter of time before his Feign fails enough that he drops to 44 and is forced to (gasp!) return to actually playing the game right if he wants to continue his little hobby.<br>
