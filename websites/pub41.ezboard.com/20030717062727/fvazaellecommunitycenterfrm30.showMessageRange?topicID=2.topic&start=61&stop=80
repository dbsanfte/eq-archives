What if Saddam destroyed his weapons under UN Inspection?  If he wasn't a greedy, powerhungry bastard and just did his little thing--no matter how oil hungry the US is, I don't think we'd be where are today.  <br>
<br>
The point is Saddam is a ruthless dictator...  but if played his cards correctly, he could be like the Sultan of Brunei.  <br>
<br>
I don't understand that military power desire.  <br>
<br>
I would much rather pump my oil, sell it for $$$ and hire a ton of American sluts (not to mention having a sweet golf course in the middle of the desert and having the best pros in the world fly over) than try to act all big and bad and piss off the US of A.  <br>

Then the UN could say that it was proven he had no WMD's and the US couldn't have justified invasion in the way they have.  The fact that they weren't able to verify destruction is entirely Saddam's doing.  He refused to comply with the UN as he agreed he would.  Thus I don't feel bad if he suffers for it.<br>

Hans Blix said there are very large amounts of WMD's missing and unaccounted for in Iraq.  Or are the United Nations and Hans Blix in on the conspiracy to fabricate reasons to invade Iraq so the United States can gank oil?<br>

Let me break it doen to simple terms.<br>

What has happened:<br>
1)  He has weapons.  <br>
2)  He claims to destroy them<br>
3)  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Inspectors find little/no evidence of any destroyed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
4)  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In addition he uses weapons claimed to be destroyed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
5)  He gets bust the f00k up.  <br>
<br>
What he SHOULD have done<br>
1)  He has weapons<br>
2)  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>He has the inspectors observe him destory them</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
3)  US wants his oil<br>
4)  BUT the US has no reason to go in<br>
5)  US goes to see who else they can bully, who has something they want or maybe even try to take care of that crazy North Korean guy<br>

They claimed he should have more detailed records, rather than what he's had.  It's NEVER been stated that there were zero records of these weapons' destruction.<br>
<br>
The facts remain that Saddam has not used these weapons in 15 years, when he killed 5,000 Kurds in 1988.<br>
The fact remains that of all the military compounds the coalition forces have overtaken to this point, not one evidence of a chemical weapon have been found, yet 6 months ago inspectors were claiming that Saddam was moving these weapons throughout military and factory installations throughout Iraq.  Yet now all of a sudden they're all hidden in Baghdad?  <br>
<br>
The terms of his cease fire after Desert Storm weren't negotiable. It's not as if he had much choice in the matter of what to agree to.<br>
<br>
Get real folks.  This is a military nation.  This is a government in which the only power he has is backed by pure force.  This is a nation of people that have been in wars for thousands of years with neighboring areas.  You think he's going to get rid of all his weapons?  Surely you can't be THAT naieve.<br>
<br>
I support getting rid of his ass.  I support our troops, and I support reforming Iraq into a country that actually contributes to the rest of the world.  I just don't support our bullshit reasonings for the war, when it's quite clear why we're there.  <br>

Perhaps some of the evidence is not fully there.  Perhaps the means they are taking to accomplish this is not correct either.  But that is not the same as reasoning.  That's justification of war.  That's evidence of guilt.  If you want to talk justification or evidence, that's a completely different animal.  That's the apple to oranges.  <br>

It's been proven time and time again that the US is far from the top of the educational food chain.  Why do so many people disagree with the war from countries across the war?  It's attitudes like yours that somehow think we're smarter than other nations that shows why other people look at us as insular and not understanding the world around us.  Get your head out of your ass, the American population is no more intelligent than the population of quite a few other countries out there.  <br>
<br>
You can try to knock my personal education level but I'm not the one here using the simple, kindergarten logic that if someone lies about something, they're guilty of another.  If that example was applied in any situation besides this one, you'd chastise others for the fucking morons that they sound like, yet in this one you defend it when you should be chastising yourself.  This country was built on the principle of innocent until proven guilty.  The hypocrisy is in ignorant folks like yourself who change this to suit their own needs. <br>

You sound like a fairly intelligent guy.  Why then is it so hard to realize that I'm not against the war, merely the utter, retarded bullshit reasoning that they tried to show as a coverup for their true intentions? <br>
<br>
You want to talk about lying?  Bush and other representatives have gone on TV and stated they KNEW WITHOUT ANY DOUBT that Saddam had these weapons.  If they knew this without any doubt, where the fuck are they?  They left NO DOUBT that they were positive that he had them.  Now you're claiming that their justification is because there's no evidence that he destroyed them.  That's NOT what Bush and others have stated lately, they said that he had them without any possible doubt.  <br>

Answer this question since you ignored it last time.  What military nation would possibly destroy every weapon they possibly have and leave themselves defenseless?  I'm assuming you know history beyond last week and realize that the area around Iraq has been in wars for thousands of years, you think these people give a fuck that the UN, which was formed less than a hundred years ago, is telling them that they can't protect themselves?  You don't end thousands-year long conflicts through a piece of paper.<br>

Excuse me?  Not a single weapon of mass destruction has &quot;popped up.&quot;  Don't start spewing misinformation now to try to get a point across.  All that's been found is chemical suits which were also found as far south as the Iraq border with Kuwait.  The reason they'd find more as they get closer to Baghdad is because that's where the vast majority of the Iraqi military is.  With the exception of a few larger Iraqi cities, the US military has already stated that they've met fairly small amounts of resistance.<br>

I know for one if I had a choice of destroying the weapons under my power or getting destroyed and having them destroyed for me--I'd choose the former over the later.  <br>
<br>
It wouldn't surprise me if Saddam thinks he's gonna win this thing.  Either that or he just doesn't give a fuck anymore.  <br>
<br>
As for the WMD not being found yet...  The war isn't over yet.  You can go off on me if I'm wrong and no weapons are found.  As coalition forces get closer and closer to Bagdad and more damaging information is collected--I would be very surprised if the evidence of Saddam's possession of WMD type weapons are not found.  <br>

Shut the fuck up already. Your worthless drivel isn't even worth reading.<br>

You tell me how someone is to disarm something that we haven't even proven they have yet. Fucking moron.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah the typical argument of the weak when they have been owned.  Attack the person, because you can't attack the arguments with generic terms like moron, worthless, drivel, etc.<br>
<br>
We have entirely proven he had WMD.  This is not in question.  Iraq is not even disputing this.  God, pay attention here... IRAQ ADMITTED AND STILL ADMITS TO HAVING HAD WMD.  The only point of dispute is whether they have been destroyed or not.  It is 100 percent known.  It is listed in the terms of the UN resolutions ending the Gulf War in 1991.  He might have had more, we don't know for sure, but we do know for sure that he had large amounts of WMD which were catalogued.  I have a good link about this, I will post it in a sec when I can find it.<br>
<br>
All he had to do to avoid the entire war was quite simple.  Comply with UN inspectors.  He had to take every single item that was catalogued in the 1991 surrender and he had to destroy it with UN inspectors watching.  If he had done that, he'd be in full compliance and there would be no war.    That is all, it was quite simple.  This is basically what Bakxs is saying too, I don't see what's so hard to understand about that.<br>

As far as shutting up, I would bet that far more people on this thread wish you would stop posting than me.  Your theories are bizarre and unsupported by facts or reason and when this is pointed out to you you simply respond with anger against whoever posted it.<br>

It's not as if he had much choice in the matter of what to agree to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah he had a choice.  He could agree or not.  If he didn't agree, he was going to get removed from power.  If he did agree, the conditions of the agreement became binding, and his remaining in power became contingent on abiding by them.  Granted it wasn't a nice situation he was in, but gee, umm, how did he get there?  He put himself in that situation, he gets no sympathy from me for being in it.  He agreed to the terms of surrender, he has to live by that agreement.  It's like when the Germans agreed to the terms that ended WW2 in which Germany was broken up into 4 separate occupied territories.  They couldn't say later that that wasn't fair and didn't count cause they were under duress when they agreed to it.  A surrender agreement is binding like any other.<br>
<br>
Get real folks. This is a military nation. This is a government in which the only power he has is backed by pure force. This is a nation of people that have been in wars for thousands of years with neighboring areas. You think he's going to get rid of all his weapons? Surely you can't be THAT naieve.&quot;<br>
<br>
No one said he had to give up all his weapons, only his WMD and those weapons which were designed to distribute WMD.  (i.e. scuds)  He was allowed to keep all his tanks, aircraft, naval vessels, most artillery, etc.  The list of what he had to destroy was not that long and was very specifically targeted at a certain class of weapons which he shouldn't be using to defend himself as doing so would be a violation of the Geneva conventions.<br>
<br>
There are also a lot of logical holes in what you are saying about the current state of proof.  First, just because we haven't found something yet doesn't mean we won't find it.  It's only a few days into the war, you have to be more patient.  Second, he has used scuds, which he said he did not have, making him in violation of the surrender agreements and justifying his removal from power.  Third, knowing he has weapons is not the same as knowing where the weapons are.  It's quite possible intelligence came across documents listing his inventory of WMD yet not listing their location.  Intelligence is a very difficult business and you don't always get complete information.  You do your best to get what you can and you go with what you can get.  Fourth, even if the weapons aren't all in Baghdad, perhaps the information we need on their location is.  It is after all the capital and seat of government.  If the US had top secret documents, where do you suppose they would be?  Washingtong would be a good guess.  Perhaps that information has been destroyed either by bombs or even more likely by shredding machines.  Finally, we don't  have to find WMD.  The fact that he failed to live up to his agreement to document the destruction of WMD is enough reason for me to remove him from power.  It's that simple.  Even if he didn't have WMD, and he destroyed them secretly and made it impossible to prove their destruction, he is out of compliance and that is sufficient reason to boot his ass out of power.  He had simple instructions to follow, he didn't follow them, this is the price he has to pay.<br>
<br>
We may never find WMD, we may find them.  It doesn't change the fact that Saddam did not comply with the terms of the surrender and in the process created the reasonable possibility that he has them and is hiding them, an unacceptable situation in which he failed to live up to the burden of proof imposed upon him.  This doesn't even count the intelligence that Bush has on his desk.  I think there is sufficient justification to remove him from power just based on what I know, and I imagine Bush has much more incriminating info.<br>
<br>
If he had just done as he was told and as he agreed to do the whole thing would not have been an issue.  Instead he thought he could play games with the world and no one would do anything.  He miscalculated severely.  Now he must suffer the consequences of the choices he made.<br>

<br>
Read what I wrote.  The reason I support removing him from power is not that he has WMD.  I support removing him from power because he has failed to prove that he destroyed his WMD and has thus created the reasonable possibility that he has them.  This is an unacceptable level of risk.  The situation was created by his failure to comply, thus his removal is a result of his own doing.<br>
<br>
Bush very well may have concrete information that he has WMD.  I don't have this information.  I believe Bush probably does, but whether he does or does not has no impact on my opinion as to whether or not we should remove him.  Assuming Bush has this info, I understand totally why he cannot release it and why he must rely on us to trust him.  That information is on a need to know basis, and you and I frankly do not need to know.  The only benefit is that we would have more information to argue with and post on VCC.<br>
