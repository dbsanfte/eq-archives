Do you even play the game EQ at all? I mean with all the energy and time you put into this board i dont see how, and have a family?? I might troll for all of ten minutes on these boards, and look at /bazaar some for shit i cant afford, but really c'mon.<br>
<br>
I can understand you being angry at what was said, but clearly it wasnt meant as a real threat as stated by his mail to Anika, and to think that you can shove a rule down someones throat just shows us what a close-minded person you are. <br>
<br>
I dont know you at all or have anything against you, but you are comming off like a &quot;tool&quot; trying to gain some respect from the community here by following this as you are. Try to direct some of that to the game or better yet to keeping a open mind in life and see what life has to offer. It might change the way you look at things and people look at you. /shurg<br>

Applaud Anika for being a fair moderator.<br>
<br>
Tendalus (whatever) did go overboard, and i think he should have posted an open apolgy if he was truly remorseful for the crud he posted, but instead followed up with many hostile posts.<br>
<br>
Goanad, you got to get a grip. It appears that you deliberately GOADED Tendalus in becoming over hostile to you. I do agree with you that his post is in violation with rule6, and then go on to RANT Anika. Eventhough Anika is/was PO and must spend eternity in the pits of DOOM!! he does a fair and just job of moderating this board.<br>
<br>
You are a twit.<br>
<br>
Tendalus, the post was way beneath you.<br>
<br>
Anika, good job again.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Are you going to ban people who make death threats and threats of physical violence? The rule says YES.

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 4. CONTENT ACCESSIBLE ON THE SERVICE<br>

<br>
Now, bring out the legal hounds of war sir, let them know that there's a drunken Real Life threat to you that wasn't serious, and that has been apologized for roaming around a board.  Compared to what goes around on message boards, that's childs play.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> BTW sir, any attempt to characterize me even partially at fault here is completely without factual merit. I am no more at fault with respect to &quot;personal attacks&quot; than countless others in the Rants and Flames section of VCC. You ban me for my opinions or the manner in which I have expressed them, you'd have to ban at least a dozen others for the same reasons. My opinions simply tend to be unpopular and not embraced by the maintstream and predominately younger crowd. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Your opinions are irrelevant to me, in every way.  Everyone's opinions are irrelevant, and I'm certianly not going to ban someone for posting an opinion.  That's not what we're discussing here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You appear to have missed the part in the thread in question where I warned Tendalus about moving towards the direction of making a violent threat. He and I used to be guildmates and he had made a threat of violence before on that guild's website. I tried to ameliorate the situation. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Then perhaps a successful strategy would have been to stop egging him on.  If you poke an animal enough, eventually it's gonna get angry, and likely do something irrational.  That's a horrid analogy since I don't see many animals that make drunken posts on message boards, and then apologize for them, but perhaps I'm one of those folks in the 'younger crowd' that doesn't embrace your views.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do you want a community where &quot;lines are crossed&quot; like that? Do you? How do you think my family feels? They perceive this community as &quot;anything goes&quot; where if you are in the group whose ideas have the most support you can do ANYTHING against those that you don't agree with. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Now wait a minute, hold on...  There's a core, fundimential problem in this paragraph.  What you just said is that your family percieves this forum as a free-for-all where you can do, as you say, ANYTHING against those you don't agree with.  My question to you is, what on earth have you been telling your family?  You do realize this is a message board, right?  For a game, called Everquest, where people pretend they are Elves and Ogres and slay dragons?  And that the whole world is nothing more than 1's and 0's on a hard drive in San Diego?  C'mon, you're not stupid, even you must see the reality of the situation.<br>
<br>
If you have actually worked up your family over something like this, then shame on you.  You're an adult, and you should know better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The community needs to know the status of rule #6. It deserves an unequivocal response.....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Fine, play it by the numbers then.  As of this moment, he'll be banned.  However, I will amend the rules shortly, becuase apparently I didn't add a COMMON SENSE clause to them for the reality-challenged.  My oversight, and I'll correct it.  I suppose I would point out that doing so is only <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> grounds</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for banning, but that wouldn't satisify you, I'm sure.<br>
<br>
So, your holy crusade is at an end.  However, something still bothers me.  If you really work your family into a franzy over the VCC, as you indicated they are, then perhaps, for your own safety and the safety of your family, I should exercise Rule 9.  Of course, as you've made perfectly clear, the rules are the rules, and I shouldn't be allowed to apply a measure of common sense to them, so perhaps I shall life by the letter of the rules instead of the spirit of the rules, and save you and your family any undue emotional stress that might be inflicted by the VCC.  I'm sure EZBoard would certianly sigh with relief if I did so.<br>

Didn't think you'd let him goad you into an undeserved ban, but whatever. If that's the kinda tight control you think you should exercise (which is quite overboard), without banning Goanad also (which would serve the purpose of the board: entertainment), then fuck it, laters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukerai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Necrobish</span><br>  Posts: 2710<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 6:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sowned.com/bleh/kerai2.gif height=85 width=66></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You hussy destroyed my ILLUSION!!</span><hr size=1> he was suspended, not banned Saal, but dun leave us =/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uanikacrystalwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anika Crystalwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Admin Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 1169<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 6:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: laf</span><hr size=1> Well, before you leap to conclusions, I will say this sad, sorrid tale isn't quite over.

<br>
The above is a reply from Goanad to Tend.  It is quite apparent he didn't feel threatened.  He refers to it as &quot;rough me up&quot; in quotation marks.  This reply in itself is, IMHO, an obvious reference to an empty threat that Goanad is neither worried by nor threatened by.  It's really fucking hard to take him seriously and think that him and his entire family is threatened when you read his own words.  He is playing a stupid game where if he can, he will use and abuse every rule here to get everyone banned/suspended.  He looks in game for &quot;cheaters&quot; and he obviously does here.<br>
<br>
Anika, I understand your position that you have to enforce rules even when someone is obviously taking advantage of them and basically mocking them.  But Tend's threat to make a baseball out of pure gold.  I mean, if we have to take everything literally (i.e. Goanad fears for his life and views this as a real threat), let's look at the threat itself.  If you were to make a baseball out of pure gold, it would be extremely soft and wouldn't be able to do much, if any, damage.  It's only when you mix pure gold with other metals that it becomes hardened.  Second off, Tend doesn't have the money to pay for EQ currently, hmmm seems highly unlikely he could afford to have a baseball made out of pure gold.  Lastly, no one even knows where in that horrendous, hogshit state Goanad lives.<br>
<br>
I'm just highly pissed off that someone can take a stupid, meaningless &quot;threat&quot;, respond to it as he has (which if you are really threatened you aren't going to encourage more threats by responding) and then cries about it after the fact just to get his way.  It's apparent to me (and I'm sure I'm not alone here) that Goanad is abusing the rules and twisting them for his own personal satisfaction.<br>
<br>
So, where does this all end?  What happens if someone threatens Goanad with a wiffle ball?  Is that real?  Or if someone says, &quot;I'm going to keel you&quot;?  Or &quot;I hope you die&quot;?  Goanad, you are an idiot in the fact that there are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> real[/r] threats that people can make and do and Anika now has to either ban/suspend anyone who makes any kind of remark that can be perceived as a threat or takes no action.  If no action is taken because he discerns it as fake and becomes a victim to the threatening person in RL we will have you to thank.  You are like the woman who gets drunk, sleeps with someone she regrets, then cries rape.  Taking advantage of rules and bending them to fit your needs does no one any good.  You are setting a horrible precedent and I for one am perturbed by your action</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uammerique.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ammerique</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/02 8:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: laf</span><hr size=1> Goanad,<br>
