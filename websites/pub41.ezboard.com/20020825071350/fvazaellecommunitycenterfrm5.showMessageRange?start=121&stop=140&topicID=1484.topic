My guild tries to use chat channels whenever possible. The last 4 raids I've been on, though, the chat channels have suddenly and mysteriously stopped working and we've been forced to use OOC, Auction, and Shout.<br>

That's probably the best reason to use zone channels instead of chat channels....<br>

They were working wonderfully up until then. Maybe the lag your experiencing isn't becuase of the chat channels, but because you're in the high end encounters in Luclin. The only lag I ever see or have had on chat channels is when I'm on Luclin or my lag-o-meter starts counting up to 100%. (And if you're starting to go LD, not even using public channels will save you from screwing up timing in a Cheal Rotation.)<br>
<br>
Without the chat channels, organizing the pickup raid would've been a huge mess of tell's, mistell's, half-assed group/shout/ooc chitter chatter and would've taken twice as long.<br>
<br>
I may not be an uber raider, but I do understand why some people are worried about lag.  If yer the only ones in a zone, use public channels.   But if you're raiding a zone that is also home to other people doing XP Groups (SolB is a good example in this case) then using OOC and SHOUT leads to a huge mess and annoys people trying to find a group there for XP.<br>
<br>
And you can't ignore an entire raid with only a 30 person ignore list.  Filtering the ooc and shout channels reduces your chances of getting a group there. So it's rather polite to use Raid Channels if  your raiding places similar to SolB.<br>
<br>
So if yer guild is going to be a bunch of fucktards and ruin other peoples enjoyment of the game, then expect to be petitioned for disruption of a zone.  Unless y ou can say chat channels are broken (like yesterday), the shut the fuck up and take whatever the GM gives ya.<br>

On a raid tuesday night the channels worked great to get messages across the zone, but, they started getting really, really bad at times.  First time I witnessed how bad they could be first hand.  Couldn't shout instructions so I had to move to shout once everyone was in the zone and the channels decided not to relay messages instantly.<br>
<br>
You can't really appreciate how aggravating this is till you're helping shout instructions and the channels aren't showing them.

I never said I was an uber, moron. I was sitting in WC with my LFG tag on, hoping for a group in Sebilis, but I got a tell asking for some help on a Naggy raid, and well... I was bored, so I went.  I ended up running the chat channels since I seem to be one of few who spent some time learnign the commands.<br>
<br>
Yes, the recent instability of the chat channels has lowered their vaule considerably.  And I've seen XP groups in Akheva, where I've seen friends in EA raiding.  And I wasn't just directing the channel stuff to uber guilds.  I was directing it to all guilds in general.  If you raid, and there's people there grouping for XP, give them some common courtesy (although that seems to be as rare a spawn as the Kraken in Lake Rathe).<br>

<br>
Spamming auctions back to back to back to back to back is bad in bazaar.  Auctioning your wares every once in awhile isnt nearly so annoying.  And often times, people are selling MQ rights, so if you turn auction off you lose access to the ability to purchase MQ rights, in a zone designed for trade.  Seems sort of silly to turn off auction in the trade zone, no?<br>

It's amazing how someone can comment on one's intelligence from what has been written...  without reading it all.  To do so only goes to shows your ignorance, arrogance and sheer stupidity. <br>
<br>
Your obvious petty prejudice against me only makes you seem even more stupid and ignorant.  This prejudice has lead you to make retarded blanket statements such as never agreeing on anything I would say...  Makes me wonder how you could agree or disagree with me, WITHOUT EVEN FUCKING READING WHAT I WROTE.  <br>
<br>
Ignore me if you think of me as irritating or feel free to flame me, but if you are going to comment on what I have to say, you might want to read it first.  For all we know, you might actually agree with what I have to say.  But then again, a close-minded, ignorant, prejudicial individual such as yourself probably would go against me, &quot;just because.&quot;  heh.  I could care less either way.  If you make an intelligent post, good for you.  If you continue to be the ignorant tard that you have been, more fun for me...<br>
<br>
As for my &quot;NT = No text&quot; thing...  since you admittedly don't read what I have to say, you probably wouldn't understand the point.  If you couple that with your lack of intelligence and reading comprehension skills, it makes sense that a dimwit as yourself would think of that as a waste of space.  When I can come up with a clear argument or point in one short sentence, how is it a waste of space?  Especially when someone like you claims to only read the first or second sentence I post...  you should be appreciative of those short NT type posts.  <br>
<br>
It's pretty clear you are grasping at straws to try to attack me.  Your attempt to attack me has only made you look sillier.  These irrational and simply ignorant statements has only re-affirmed what I have said in the past...    <br>

P.S.  &quot;Cuz fucking names never makes sense. It's just like Zen Ho. Does that make sense to you? No, because it's a fucking chinese name in pin yin. It's like you are asking people, why this thing is called &quot;horse&quot; Why? Cuz it's a fucking horse.&quot;  <br>
<br>
If names don't make any sense...  it would be alright to call you Mrs Tree Slover, right?  =P   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udulyendetrimental.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DulyenDetrimental</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.gamers.com/i/icons/monsters/electricskeleton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 539<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 4:07:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1484.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raiya: Please read the executive summary on the bottom..</span><hr size=1>  Rofl bakxs.  <p><img src=http://www.electronicexpress.com/images/who_are_you.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utreeslover.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1049<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 4:11:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1484.topic&index=136>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raiya: Please read the executive summary on the bottom..</span><hr size=1> I only read the executive summary myself because once again you're just incredibly windy.

About the issue at hand, stop the freaking whining. We had four guilds co-existing in ToV one and a half year before chat channels were even introduced (Nameless, not Vazaelle). Noone had a freaking problem then, so why the hell can´t you whiney ass bitches just shut up and use the filters like the rest of the EQ-community.<br>
<br>
Oh and go read Anikas post if you are too lazy to read through the entire seven pages of this crapola, she sums it up pretty well. <br>

It's jus' that I can't help myself when I'm dealing with a dumbass like the wondertwin foolios, Ayiar and Raiya.  When they continously make retarded statements, am I wrong to comment?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I will agree that I've probably carried this a bit too far...  but you mus' also admit that those two tools didn't help any either.  For you to just mention just myself makes it sound you are just running to protect your stupid guildies.  (Or maybe it's because you are used to the thoughtless crap coming from Raiya &amp; Ayiar, and that you expect more from me or something?  =P)  <br>
