Keep your eye on the ball<br>
Brent Flynn<br>
Practically Rational<br>
<br>
<br>
Talk about revisionist history. It's as if the whole world is Winston Smith, the main character of George Orwell's book &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four.&quot; We are being asked to forget what we know to be true in order to remain loyal to the United States government's official version of reality.<br>
<br>
Although Bush hasn't officially declared victory in Iraq yet, it's just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
The ease with which our military toppled Saddam's regime will be held up as proof that the neoconservatives were right all along and that the &quot;defeatist&quot; liberals were once again on the wrong side of history. The scene of jubilant Iraqis taking sledgehammers to the statue of Saddam Hussein in Fardus Square is the new justification for our pre-emptive invasion of Iraq and, supposedly, irrefutable evidence that US soldiers are liberators, not conquerors (Never mind that there were fewer than 200 Iraqis present at the event and that the more widespread reaction of Iraqis to liberation has been burning and looting).<br>
<br>
But not so fast, there. Nobody said we couldn't whip Saddam--not even the bloodiest bleeding heart liberal. And I don't remember anyone arguing that Iraq would be better off if Saddam Hussein remained in power. No, it was always about the legality of a pre-emptive invasion of Iraq, the true intentions of the Bush administration, and what would happen after the fighting stopped. Oh yeah, and then there was the small matter of the death, destruction and chaos that would be a direct result of the war.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that the official title of the invasion was &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; and the sole focus of the media right now is the liberation of an oppressed people, that wasn't the reason why we circumvented the UN and strained relations with our closest allies to invade Iraq. We were told it was a matter of national security. Saddam, the evil madman, had the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction and wouldn't hesitate to use them. He posed such a grave threat to the most powerful nation in the history of the world (that's us) that we could not sit idly by while the danger grew. Every day that we waited Saddam grew stronger.<br>
<br>
I didn't buy that argument then and now that we have seen how fragile the Iraqi military is, I have an even harder time believing it. We have initiated two massive conflicts against Iraq and in neither situation did the Iraqi military put up a significant fight, nor did Saddam use his alleged arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. In this latest military action the very existence of Saddam and his regime were threatened but no weapons of mass destruction were used.<br>
<br>
Now we are being told that finding the chemical and biological weapons that are supposed to be there--and were the stated reason for invading--is not our top priority. Our top priority has been to secure the oil wells. Which is interesting because we were told that the war had nothing to do with oil and one of our major concerns was supposedly that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction could fall into the hands of terrorists. So if we really believe that is a possibility, shouldn't we be securing those weapons first--even before we secure the precious oil wells? And if the reason for invading was to help the people of Iraq, why didn't we secure the hospitals? They have been looted of medicine and supplies while US Marines watched from the sidelines.<br>
<br>
We have to keep our eye on the ball because the government and media are trying to juke us out of our pants.<br>
<br>
Just before the fall of Baghdad, a government minister in England was preparing the world for the news that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But that's okay because a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 69 percent of Americans still support the war even if no weapons of mass destruction are found.<br>
<br>
It is no secret that Americans are gullible, but some of us still have functioning brains…don't we? This is the oldest trick in the book: the &quot;bait and switch&quot;--also known as the ol' switcheroo. And the use of this tactic is not limited to justifying the most recent invasion.<br>
<br>
We are reminded of how tortured and oppressed the Iraqi people were under Saddam's rule by the constant media coverage of their emotional reactions to the fall of his regime. But how many Americans have forgotten that it was a CIA coup that brought Saddam Hussein's Baath party into power in the first place? How many have forgotten that it was the United States that helped Saddam consolidate his power as a counter balance to the Islamic fundamentalist government of Iran? But more importantly, how many times did our government and media remind us of these historical facts? Still thinking? The answer is zero.<br>
<br>
The Reagan administration turned a blind eye to the torture of Iraqis and assisted Saddam's regime in the use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops and Kurdish civilians during the '80s. The picture of Donald Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam Hussein in 1984 is just one example of many Bush administration officials' complicity in the crimes against humanity committed by Saddam Hussein. The combination of Operation Desert Storm and 12 years of sanctions are responsible for the deaths of 500,000 to a million Iraqis. We bear great responsibility for the suffering of the people of Iraq.<br>
<br>
While the &quot;liberation&quot; of Iraq from Saddam's tyrannical rule is a good thing in and of itself, there is no guarantee that the new government will be a true democracy free of US control. And our government's unwillingness to address its role in creating the monster of Saddam Hussein indicates that it has not learned a lesson from history and, quite the opposite, is hell bent on repeating it.<br>
<br>
Unlike the fictional world of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four,&quot; the majority of the world's population doesn't have such a short memory. It is only in the United States where you will find so many people willing to forget the past. But it is not only ignorance that enables our government to do what it does. Many Americans simply don't care what happens in the Middle East as long as they get their SUV and tax cut.<br>
<br>
I guess being the world's only superpower means you don't have to justify your military adventures to anybody and you damn sure never have to say you're sorry.<br>

<br>
Certainly the media hasn't given undue coverage to the securing of oil wells. I recall seeing a few stories about capturing the loading stations early in the war to prevent flooding the gulf with oil, I recall seeing a few mentions of wells and I recall a few mentions of finding wells rigged to blow. I also recall that each and every time we found a facility that might house weapons of mass destruction that those stories were repeated every 15 minutes until the facts became clear.<br>
<br>
Also his comparison to &quot;1984&quot;, the title is not 'Nineteen Eight-Four&quot;, is spurious at best.<br>

We fought the war for many reasons.<br>
<br>
We didn't fight the war to secure the oil wells and prevent them from being lit on fire.  This is dumb.  If that were the goal, then not fighting the war would have worked just fine to prevent the wells from being lit on fire or massive amounts of oil being drained into the gulf.  The actions we did take to secure oil wells were to prevent the environmental disaster that would have ensued if Saddam had had a chance to effect one last heinous act against his own people and the world and light the wells on fire again.<br>
<br>
Essentially, this author logic is very flawed.  He hears that American/British troops secured the oil wells to prevent them from being lit on fire.  He then assumes that we went to war to secure these wells and prevent them from being lit on fire.  If he paused to think for a second, he'd realize that if we didn't go to war in the first place, the wells also would not be lit on fire.  Thus, securing oil wells cannot possibly have been a reason to go to war, as going to war is the only reason in the first place that they needed securing.<br>
<br>
As far as chemical weapons, I don't know what we'll find.  If they were so easy to find, we could have worked with the inspection system.  However, it's not so easy to find stuff that's that well hidden.  Maybe we can find some of it if we interrogate enough people.  I have already seen that some chemical warheads, an underground nuclear development facility with radiation lvls off the charts and no conceivable peaceful use, and manuals and documentation on the fabrication on sarin and vx nerve agents have been found.  How much more do you want?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the new justification for our pre-emptive invasion of Iraq <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It wasn't &quot;pre-emptive&quot;- it was honoring the unconditional surrender from 12 years ago, and 12-years of attempted diplomacy that couldn't possibly work when the diplomatic table is hosted by veto-holding members that are politically bound by &gt;$300 billion. <br>
<br>
The unconditional surrender of the first gulf war placed very clear restrictions on Sadamm's weapons program.  Inspector's were removed as cooperation ceased..  They were re-admitted years later and still none of the resolution regulations were honored (turning over of the 300 scientists for interviews.. brought only 80.. after a week of debate, they brought forth 20 more.. still 200 shy.  No allowance for external interrogation, etc.etc.).  The first gulf war presented enough evidence that Sadamm was quite capable of continuing his weapons programs even with inspector's in the country (Israeli nuclear reactor target anyone?).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>(Never mind that there were fewer than 200 Iraqis present at the event and that the more widespread reaction of Iraqis to liberation has been burning and looting).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Also incorrect.  There have been media reported events from every section of Iraq, including Basrah, the northern Kurdish areas- hell even hundreds of Shiite muslims that stormed the Iraq embassy in Tehran, Iran that tore down all the Sadamm osters and images.  This guy assumes the US media &quot;hoax&quot; has a cast of thousands and is implemented across three countries, including Iran.  Nothing but paranoid delusion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nobody said we couldn't whip Saddam--not even the bloodiest bleeding heart liberal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually lots of liberals said we couldn't whip Sadamm.   A particular (now unemployed) reporter doing work for National Geographic comes to mind.. with words explaining how the milititary was &quot;beaten&quot; and had to turn back and would be taking a 1-week break to come up with a new battle plan.  <br>
<br>
The A.N.S.W.E.R. folks at west coast rallies were also petitioning that the US never stood a chance against the Republican Guard, and that a multi-year Vietnam-style guerilla war in the streets of Baghdad would be the end result, and after losing 10's of 1000's of Marines and Army personnel, a retreat would be the only result.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We were told it was a matter of national security. Saddam, the evil madman, had the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction and wouldn't hesitate to use them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It was/still is a matter of national security.  It's just the paranoid quotient seem to think a few regiments of troops can somehow fight resistance from the Kuwaiti border to central Baghdad AND also thoroughly inspect &gt;2500 known sites all inside of 20 days. lol.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now we are being told that finding the chemical and biological weapons that are supposed to be there--and were the stated reason for invading--is not our top priority.

<br>
This is more pure, unadulterated BS.  The only high-priority concerning oil wells has been to put out those that have been set afire.  (duh).  At current, the top priorities as have been clearly illustrated by actions AND reports from every media agency the world abroad has been:<br>
1) Removing the remaining groups of resistance... which is complicated by the droves of foreign/Syrrian and Palestinian kick-murder squads still pouring into the country.<br>
2) Getting local policing setup (with a lot of ex-Iraq police now returning to work) to reduce the looting and crime.<br>
3) Getting humanitarian aid/medical services in all regions of Iraq.<br>
<br>
There hasn't been a SINGLE emphasis on securing oil fields.  Polish and Italian crews have been dispatched to help secure damaged or ablaze oil rigs but this is mostly a done deal.  There are several that were damaged by attempts to blow them up, and these are being serviced as well to prevent ecological disaster.  (again, duh).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is no secret that Americans are gullible, but some of us still have functioning brains…don't we? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's apparent the only person insanely guilible is the individual writing this hogwash.  They must read WAY too much BBC and Guardian.<br>
<br>
The rest of the article is even more humorous as it labels ancient history and tries to hang the Baath party as the doing of the USA, which is total comedy.  The Iraq military has 100's of billions in dept to Russia and France, and the US military was going against Migs, Russian tanks and French airfields, nuclear reactors and trucks.  lol.  <br>

The exception is...Saddam had a legitimate reason from not only an historical perspective, but a criminal breach of international law by the Kuwaitis.<br>
<br>
Am I defending Saddam? Hell no, he is probably a bastard to the Nth magnitude.  You don't get to the top in any country, especially the middle east, without being a badass.  Kill the bastard I say, if you recall, I originally called for nuking the middle east and drilling through the glass for oil.<br>

But don't kid yourself, he's probably the most stable and enlightened regime of that area prior to Gulf War I.  <br>

This is all history.  I'm not going to give you links because even if I do you'd strawman the provider, regardless of the source.  <br>
<br>
However, current technology should allow you to search on key facts and get enough documentation to satisfy most people.  <br>
<br>
I'm not trying to change your mind either believe it or not.  I just think that most people cruise through life basically.  Many people come to message boards, including me, because on the whole, people they meet are more intelligent than your everday casual acquaintance.<br>
<br>
And as for the people who are saying that getting the oil wells wasn't our highest priority after the fighting was done...let me just say<br>
<br>
TAKE THE BLUE PILL.<br>
<br>
Seriously folks, if you took the red pill, you wouldn't be very happy.<br>
<br>
Hospitals, Government Facilities, Libraries and Museums were all trashed with either onlooking Marines or because the soldiers were re-routed to nearby Oil Fields.<br>
<br>
I keep asking myself and in other posts:<br>
WHY the war with Iraq now, WHY are we losing the Public Relations war so badly, WHY such a concerted effort by this administration focusing on Iraq now, WHERE is OSAMA BIN LADEN,  WHEN are the crooks from ENRON, WORLDCOM, GLOBAL CROSSING et al going to actually be punished,WHY are we repealing the sunset clause on Patriot Act I, WHY are we even considering Patriot Act II, and WHEN are we going to get around to a real investigation of 9/11?<br>
<br>
Seriously folks, break away from the war coverage for just a minute and look around. A lot of history making shit is going down, not just this war.<br>
<br>

Lowfyr: I know some guys that helped the mayor campaign, so that makes me an excellent source of information on Global politics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treeslover>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1325<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/03 6:34:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yes Anika but, Saddam is no Hitler.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>WHEN are we going to get around to a real investigation of 9/11?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Didn't Saddam's chief scientist surrender to the US army,<br>
and still insist that there were no wmd's.<br>
<br>
You would think that it was in his best interests *if* there actually were any, for him to show the US where they were.<br>
<br>
You know. In here I read various people saying they have already found this and that, and portraying it as solid evidence of WMD's. Then I hear the UK prime minister say categorically in the house of commons that NO evidence has been found. I know who I believe.<br>
<br>
I mean really, if they had found some solid evidence it would be plastered all over the news and other media. Instead we hear rumours of shady looking oil drums that turn out to be pesticide. Or other shielded containers that contain industrial isotopes. I think these are the containers that Ammelen references in saying radiation levels off the scale, and can have no peaceful use.<br>
<br>
If they find any then fine, the invasion is legitimised somewhat. But what if they dont ?<br>
<br>
Bush and Blair are going to look like a pair of wankers.<br>
Remember this war was about Saddam having WMD's<br>
not about freeing the Iraqi people of an evil tyrant.<br>
<br>
I think the US needs to tread very carefully here.<br>
The noises from Washington to Syria etc are very disconcerting. Tony Blair desperately tried to distance himself from Bush's comments today in the commons.<br>
So if it does come to a conflict with Syria. I seriously doubt that the UK will be involved.<br>
<br>
Right now the US is probably the most hated nation on the planet. Bush seems not to care though.<br>

<br>
Heh, no.  Stable yes, enlightened no.  He has just about the worst human rights record in the region.<br>
<br>
As for Enron/Worldcom, they are being prosecuted, many are in prison already.  I don't think you can possibly put these people in the same category though as Saddam Hussein or Osama Bin Laden.  I'm not excusing their actions.  I just think they are not in the same league.<br>
<br>
The United States is making every conceivable effort to track down Osama and dismantle Al Qaeda.  They have done a very good job of it imo.  It's not easy to find 1 man among 6 billion.  Taking out a regime is actually much more doable.  Finding 1 man is largely luck.<br>
<br>
As for the WMD's, we're seeing a lot of news here that they have found no actual WMD but a lot of stuff that's strongly tied to it.  For example, they found information on the production of Sarin and VX.  That's not a WMD, but it's pretty incriminating nonetheless.  The nuclear stuff is not referring to the pesticide drums, that was an earlier find.  I'll try to find a link for you.  They are still saying that the information is not conclusive because they are cautious and don't want to mislead the public, but a lot of it will pretty obviously test out to be incriminating.  You seem to believe that they would be saying they had it when they aren't sure.  On the contrary, people like Bush and Blair aren't going to say anything until they are sure, and they just aren't sure yet, more testing needs to be done.<br>
