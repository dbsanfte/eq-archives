I hadn't heard about this case before 10 minutes ago, but apparently a black guy was riding his motorcycle at over 100 MPH. The police chased after him and he crashed his bike and died. Over 300 blacks from the town went out to the street to loot and riot, and there are 250 police on the scene.<br>
<br>
This is unbelievable IMO because you can't even begin to make the case that the cops did anything wrong, what are they supposed to do, allow this guy to speed at over 100 MPH?<br>
<br>
For the segment, O'Reilly interviewed two black PHD's, who both seemed pretty sympathetic to the rioting. The whole segment they were complaining that there were so few opportunities for blacks in America. But the funniest part came in the last minute when O'reilly said &quot;obviously there are opportunities for blacks, as both of you are PHD's and no one just handed them to you&quot;. The black woman on the panel disagreed and said &quot;no I got it because of affirmative action&quot;. O'Reilly refused to believe it and said no way, and she said yes it was affirmative action. O'Reilly still refused to believe it and said &quot;come on, I know you worked your butt off for that&quot; and she said &quot;no really, I got it only because of affirmative action&quot;. And that's how the segment ended.<br>
<br>
I thought it was pretty funny, and I could tell O'Reilly was disappointed with her answers. Hopefully a few whites will begin to question the racial myths due to this segment.<br>

Fuck that, sounds like a bunch of fucking out of control people w/ less than a high school education running a muck.<br>
<br>
I was watching CNN this morning and from what I saw, police/resident issues had really smoothed out in the town in which this is taking place, but the officers didn't mention what sparked the issues in the first place, they were avoiding the question with answers like, &quot;I'm not sure, there's just never been a good trust between the law enforcement and the citizens here...&quot;<br>
<br>
People need to wake up and realize that rioting and looting is only proving they are a bunch of heathens running around destroying anything in their path.  They aren't getting any point across by being violent.

Sure, people are getting upset with the Police State we live in but every incidence of anarchy just gives the government more excuse to crack down.<br>
<br>
As far as O'reilly goes, he's a windbag with elements of truth.  His unwavering support for the war without asking any tough questions, his baseless repetition of weapons of mass distraction without reporting the facts just points out his hypocrisy.  He's also a fox reporter and that tells you right there his emphasis is on entertainment and not reporting.<br>
<br>
I wonder if any of you saw the segment with him interviewing jeremy glick, the son of a victim of 9/11.  Glick was questioning 9/11, what the government knew beforehand, etc.  O'reilly went off.  The clip if floating around the net, its hilarious.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 The following day, Bill O'Reilly continued his attacks on Mr. Glick by falsely claiming that Mr. Glick &quot;was out of control and spewing hatred.&quot; The transcript from &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; itself shows that these statements are wrong. What Mr. Glick said was &quot;Why would I want to further brutalize and punish the people of Afghanistan…” “The people of Afghanistan … didn’t kill my father,” and the CIA “…that trained a hundred thousand Mujahedeen” bore some responsibility. Mr. Glick remained calm, focused and dignified throughout the entire show. The video shows it was Bill O'Reilly that lost his composure. After the interview he told Mr. Glick to &quot;Get out, get out of my studio before I tear you to f**king pieces!&quot;<br>

Personally, I think the guy is a moron, but I don't recall him getting removed for anything in particular other than the Eagle's management/format going frizzy for a year or so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=treeslover>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1501<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 2:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Radio biz</span><hr size=1> Forgot to mention my point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In Radio Biz, not getting your contract renewed during a format change is not the same as getting dropped because of Listener/Management feedback. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anywon>Anywon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I can't decide on a title</span><br>  Posts: 805<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 8:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Radio biz</span><hr size=1> I was listening to Stern the day it happened.<br>
<br>
He was talking about how the station just been acquired by someone who doesn't like him personally, and as a result they had not renewed his contract.  He was not expecting them to renew his contract, either, but was a bit ticked because no one from KEGL had ever talked to him about it.<br>
<br>
So he sent Stuttering John to KEGL in Dallas, with a cell phone in his hand, and live on the air.  As he was knocking on the door of the station manager's office the boradcast was dropped.  That was the last time Stern would be heard in Dallas until he was picked up by 105.3 a few years later.<br>
<br>
Lets get the terminology straight:  If your contract is cancelled, then your contract was &quot;terminated&quot;.  If your contracted is not renewed, then it was &quot;dropped&quot;.  He was &quot;dropped&quot; from the KEGL morning programming.  He was later &quot;picked up&quot; at 105.3 for their morning program.<br>
<br>
KEGL's new owners just didn't like him because they had worked with him before.  Their music format hasn't changed in at least a decade. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=herdervazaelle>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2291<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 8:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kultar</span><hr size=1> Kultar, you don't remember O'reilly banging the war drums, counting off the inventory of weapons in Iraq and our urgent need for &quot;regime change?&quot;<br>

Herder, you list the my point in your statement...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Bush could have been misled by Tenet.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
COULD is the operative word here.  Is it possible?  Certainly it is.  Is it possible the Bush flat out lied to us?  Sure it is.  But that would have been one huge ass mistake, and I don't really think he's that stupid.<br>
<br>
I'm still confident they'll find something somewhere.  Many of those captured to date have been given polygraphs, and from what I hear, failed them.  But now I supposed you're going to tell me that polygraphs can't be trusted or we doctored the results. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anywon>Anywon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I can't decide on a title</span><br>  Posts: 806<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kultar</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyone, HE opted not to renew his contract there.

<br>
This is completely untrue.  His contract was not renewed and he sent Stuttering John to find out why (live, on the air).  The station pulled the plug on him as soon as they found out their manager was on the air.<br>
<br>
KEGL dropped him in the midst of the live broadcast and he was out of the Dallas market for a few years. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=herdervazaelle>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2292<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 11:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You are proposing a conspiracy Linale</span><hr size=1> Linale, why are my conspiracies nuts and you're conspiracies accepted facts?<br>

<br>
Herder:  Just giving ideas from the opposite viewpoint.  No where did I say your idea was nuts, or that mine was true.  I said both were possible.  You make a valid point, you'd think SOMEone would have spoken up by now.  But you also have to wonder why so many are lying.  I think they also know Saddam is still alive.  They still fear him.  When/if he is caught, I think tongues may loosen a bit.<br>
<br>
Do people conspire to thwart others?  Of course they do.  It would be silly to say otherwise.  You just seem so completely convinced that we're all being snowed by the govt.  Like there's constantly some big cover up.  This kinda goes towards your theory about a handful of people knowing/dealing with WMDs in Iraq.  Do YOU really think there's only a handful of people who know  what's going on in DC?  Someone from one party or the other would blow that wide open if they thought they could benefit  politically from it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raolfcq>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1118<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 7:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You are proposing a conspiracy Linale</span><hr size=1> Why would tenet be trying to mislead him about wmd when the cia was one of the elements of the government arguing for more time for inspections?
