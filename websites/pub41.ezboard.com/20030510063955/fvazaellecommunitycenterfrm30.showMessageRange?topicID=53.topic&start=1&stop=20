This seems like it runs under alot of the debates I was having here last week, but it doesn't really fit in any one thread and it'd prolly get buried anyways.  Why is property the fundamental right that should be used to judge the rightness of any other rule?<br>
<br>
1st off, Im a big beleiver in the concept of a social contract, so if you can explain in those terms it would be alot more useful.<br>
<br>
The way I see it there's this state of nature, and people form a society in order to avoid it, because everyone is more or less equally fucked in this state, no one can accomplish much.  So people agree to live by certain rules, including that you won't hurt each other and that you can own stuff, this much I follow.  Here is where I start to get lost, is why are these the only rules that are agreed upon?  Libertarians come out against a variety of social programs claiming that taxes are legalized theft ect, but I dont see why.  I can easily envisage a society forming that also has rules like, &quot;hey, if I join this society, I want to make sure that no matter how bad it gets, its not going to be worse than that state of nature.  I want guarentees that I won't starve, that I will have some chance at employment, that I will have a place to live.  This seems like the minimum I will accept in exchange for allowing you to accumulate whatever obcense quantities of goods you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
Basicly I think Libertarians are selling a lie.  They want the benefits of the social contract but they don't want to pay the costs, the costs being, whatever is nessessary to convince everyone that they are better off than they would be just killing your rich ass and taking your stuff.  I don't see why the contract should care so much about your property rights and not about others rights to a minimum standard of living.  Why is property so special?  What convinces me as a poor person to buy into a contract that offers me nothing?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dmhcas>dmhcas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 12:06:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.lp.org/issues/platform/sop.html">Libertarian Platform</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
I never concerned myself with their platform until I did a search this morning. I will in no way try to interpret their platform. I am not a Libertarian either.<br>
<br>
I can only speak about being a property owner. When I first purchased land to farm. I thought (WOW!) now I can do as I please. I have learned that if I raise a crop that is government subsidized I must cultivate my land in the way the government premits. This goes towards protecting the environment. Like topsoil runoff, waterways, grasslands. I understand now how better to use my land. But without the governments insight I might have terribly misused my land.<br>
<br>
I no longer have subsidized crops. The knowledge I learned from government land studies has stayed with me. I now have total control over my land and use it wisely. I have learned owning land and having cattle on it is guaranteed money in the bank. Something I did learn soon after purchasing land. I may own the land but, If I don't purchase the mineral rights a coal/geology group can purchase them and come in and mine my property. <br>
<br>
Due to the location of my property I would never expect the government would condemn, confiscate it. So I'm not concerned over that issue as are the Libertarians. This maybe naive of me but it's how I live.<br>

They really are a throwback to the old Adam Smith school of thought as it pertains to gov't having two appropriate purposes: <br>
<br>
1) National Defense <br>
2) Enforcement of Contracts. <br>
<br>
The rationale for even this low level of gov't intervention in peoples lives is still based on the social contract theory you mention. This is, however, 18th century social contract theory developed largely by men of power and position with democratic urges in the face of monarchists of the day who reigned and seized wealth capriciously to raises armies and provide for themselves and their subjects from some type of divine right justification. <br>
<br>
This capriciousness on the behalf of the crown just didnt sit well with these American colonial leaders OR with anti-monarchists of the day in Europe. Do not forget that the American revolution, the French revolution, and subsequent machinations leading all the way up to WWI, are largely the unraveling of monarchies everywhere. Political authority was not resident in an individual any longer. That was viewed as illegitimate. <br>
<br>
I think by and large the movements against the crown in America were from what Marx called the bourgesie(sp?) and the upper class landholders. These people wanted elected parliaments to decided when and if taxes where to be levied for purposes that they had some control over. <br>
<br>
Nowhere in all of this was a concern for the peasant in regard to his position vis-a-vis the social contract of governance.<br>
<br>
As countries, including the US and all across Europe, passed through the Industrial Revolution and urban centers became the population loci for various societies, changes began to occur which began the process of broadening the meaning and stake in the social contract for men and women of lower class status. <br>
<br>
Along with World wide conflicts in WWI and WWII, bringing people of various groups closer to each other had many consequences. To make a long story on the broadening of political rights for minorities, women and the like, shorter....these new franchised groups understood that those from whom they were asking a fairer shake were not in a position to grant them an equal result. <br>
<br>
These emerging groups wanted genuine opportunity. They wanted to attend the allwhite schools, own property themselves wherever they wanted, and to not be confined by there gender to particular life possibilities. <br>
<br>
These groups of people did not expect the government to return to them as a part of their new social contract, equality of outcome. <br>
<br>
Certainly social contracts are not homogeneous in result for all. They will never mean the same thing for me as for John Rockefeller. But if &quot;the game&quot; was restarted tomorrow with neither Rockefeller or myself knowing where we would &quot;Start&quot; so to speak, it is a lock that both of us would first like to sacrifice our natural state of complete freedom only if after our safety needs our met, that our goverment could provide an equality of opportunity for each of us. <br>
<br>
And from equality of opportunity it is natural that the justly earned rewards of our efforts should be next in line of importance relative to being free from government confiscation. The valuable and necessary &quot;incentive&quot; portion of our equality of opportunity requires that the government entity subsequently respect our property. <br>
<br>
Think about it this way:  How could I have equality of opportunity if my earnings were subject to the caprice of confiscation by either a king or a parliament OR a Marxian state that seized the same because as the owners of production they laid claim to the fruits of my labor?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jhardzia>jhardzia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 4:22:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Something I did learn soon after purchasing land.

I believe it happens here too.<br>
I also believe - they dictate the price - and also contract to leave the land as the found it - after raping it.<br>
Just seems so unfair.<br>

You outline one contract people could agree to sign, equality of opportunity + basic safety.  I will let you go back and define safety if you want, but Im going to assume you mean military, police, ect and not guarentee of minimum standard of living.  It's basicly a game theory problem, what you outline would be the most romantic contract possible.  You maximize your maximum possible gain.<br>
<br>
There is another way to look at this however.  You can say, well sure I might strike it really rich, and it would be great if nothing was done to my wealth.  But Im here in ths state of nature, I dont know how Im going to do in this system.  What I want is a system that will prehaps not allow as dramatic a success, but will in turn guarentee that I will not absolutely lose.  No matter how poorly things go, I will be provided with the bare necessities of life.  This is the classical game theory response, you maximize your minimum possible gain.<br>
<br>
It's worth nothing that in most random games, for example poker, the classical approach is the most rational way of maximizing long term average wins. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=truthreason>TruthReason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm actually Goanad.</span><br>  Posts: 1051<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 5:26:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> What I want is a system that will prehaps not allow as dramatic a success, but will in turn guarentee that I will not absolutely lose. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I had a longer response typed out but really what this comes down to is understanding that within the opportunity for dramatic success in this &quot;Game&quot; we speak of, is the provision of the correct incentives such that all but the physically\mentally impaired could avoid &quot;absolute loss.&quot; <br>

I do not think that people in the United States are there yet, so to speak. <br>
<br>
However in terms of &quot;relative&quot; opportunity, the US really does stand out. <br>
<br>
I think you need the higher, absolute standard, before you really attain the best possible status for the social contract between society and gov't. <br>
<br>
Finally, this &quot;absolute&quot; standard is going to be something that changes. It used to be that speaking from a general perspective, just a high school diploma was adequate if you were speaking of attaining the highest echelons of success. Now that simply is not the case. For every high school dropout come millionaire, there are 999 who float between min wage jobs or languish on welfare rolls. It's about the averages, not the exceptions.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raolfcq>RaolfCQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1063<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 5:54:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> I don't think we really disagree then.

I tend to think that if you have more than 70% of the taxpaying population(35% on each side of the median--fyi, using the mean is wrong with societies where you have a skewed distribution of income) effectively taxed &gt; 45% then Gov't is too big and\or maldistributed in it's benefit schema AND it's depressing economic incentive that you should be promoting.<br>

<br>
The United States is not a pure free market economy nor is it a purely liberatarian state with minimalist government involvement in peoples pocketbooks and lives....much to the dislike of libertarians I'm sure. <br>
<br>
The United States is also a long ways from being purely socialist or communist like Cuba, where the gov't owns all the factors of production and decides how much of what will be produced. <br>
<br>
We are somewhere in between. We are a mixed free enterprise system in an economic sense. Politically, we are a social democracy where gov't is basically limited in powers but still looks after people from a safety standpoint in its regulatory\policing function and does tax at varying rates to support this function and the social function of providing some basic support for those who cannot support themselves, ie, mentally ill, handicapped, unemployed, poor, elderly, etc. <br>
<br>
Finally, even under the umbrella of &quot;social democracies&quot;...America is just one of many countries with this type of governmental setup. I made the suggestion that you could determinae where we are versus other social democracies by looking at overal taxation burdens for the middle majority of taxpayers. Effective tax rates in social democracies vary anywhere from 40% to 80% in the case of some european countries with higher degrees of socialism.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dmhcas>dmhcas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 8:51:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> Thank You<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 822<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 11:10:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> I guess my views come from my fundamental views on the role of government and the rights of individuals.<br>
<br>
As I see it, government has no right to forcibly alter the behavior of individuals so long as those individuals are not doing anything that harms others.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that individuals are obligated to put forth effort to help others.  I do believe that they are obligated to not harm others.<br>
<br>
That which you earn/possess is a result of your labors, which come from your energy and your talents, gifts that you were born with and are innately yours.  What you produce with them is innately yours.<br>
<br>
I do believe that people have a right to property, a right to not have their bodies violated (assault/rape/murder/etc), a right to do what they want so long as it does not infringe on the above listed rights of others.  I do not believe that people have a right to eat.  I believe that they must earn the food they eat and if they don't it is not the obligation of any others to provide it.<br>
<br>
This is the distinction for me, sort of a distinction between positive and negative action.  I don't think that you have the right to do anything negative to anyone else, but I don't think that you are obligated to do anything positive for anyone else.<br>
<br>
Thus I think that you are obligated to not hurt anyone else, steal their property, etc.  However I also don't believe you are obligated to feed them, clothe them, educate them, or otherwise use your time, energy, resources, etc for theri benefit.<br>

If only one of us agrees not to hit people, someone will still get hit.  Wether this violates a &quot;right&quot; or not seems to have meaning only in the most abstract sense.  All rights are the result of social negotiation.  I don't hit you because in return you don't hit me, I allow you to accumulate far more than your share of property because I have the potential to do the same, and because I know that I will always have certain basic nessessities.  I think true libertarianism (not that it would ever be implemented because its not something that you would rationally agree to under negotiation) would be overthrown bloodily within 50 years. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 829<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/03 12:11:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> Again, this is a fundamental point of disagreement, I do not believe that rights are determined by social contract.

No one can say as we have left the realm of logical deduction and gone back to the basic principles that simply must be accepted and from which other things are derived.<br>
<br>
If you were looking at it in terms of mathematics the following pattern is followed:  You assume a set of postulates, you then prove/deduce a set of theorems from those postulates.  The postulates are not proven but rather accepted by all involved.  We aren't agreeing on the postulates here.<br>

<br>
Social Contract theory proceeds from the notion that rights &quot;just exist&quot; in a hobbesian &quot;state of nature.&quot; So if by &quot;determined&quot; you mean &quot;given&quot; or &quot;granted&quot; then yes, the contract with gov't and individuals does not provide the initial grant of rights for individuals.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 830<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/03 1:26:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for the Libertarians</span><hr size=1> Yep, it's really a good thing.  I think that that is the source of our fundamental disagreement.  In summary, you believe rights are granted to individuals by social contract, I believe rights to be innate and to precede social contracts.<br>
<br>
So I guess maybe this is the answer you are looking for as to where the libertarian philosophy comes from.<br>

<br>
Consideration is defined as something of value, often times money or property. <br>
<br>
In the case of a Social Contract.....what do individuals have to &quot;give&quot; as consideration if not a partial grant of their individual liberties and rights which they possessed prior to the contract formation? <br>
<br>
If the rights do not exist until the contract in formed(Raolf's position), then what did individuals &quot;give&quot; to the gov't as consideration?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=53.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showPrevMessage?topicID=53.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showNextMessage?topicID=53.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.threadControl?topicID=53.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=53.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=53.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administration<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm28">Legacy of Ykesha<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm27">Artistic Endeavors<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm25">Tradeskills<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm30">The Real World<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Lists and Links<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle.com Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30>The Real World</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.vazaelle.com">Vazaelle.com</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
