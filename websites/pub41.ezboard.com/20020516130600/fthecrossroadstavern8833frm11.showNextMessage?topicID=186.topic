This hate bs is just that. BULL SHIT. Those of you who read my posts understand the relivence when I say it's shit. Because it is. You wanna know why? HERE's WHY.<br>
<br>
Because little boys and little girls can't grow up. I wasn't even affiliated till today. (I am testing out LoRD to see how I like it)<br>
Sunday I ran a private invitation Hate raid. It worked GREAT. i KNEW It was my first time running a hate raid and I didn't have the power to do second so when I was asked, By three different guilds, I gave the second floor to whom I KNOW could get there without endangering myself and the groups, and who wouldn't hesitate to help - DBN. They were wonderful about everything, even an epic mob spawn Baldruss and I worked out.<br>
WHY? Because it's a GAME - it needs to be FUN. GROW UP about it!<br>
<br>
Yomarbalthasar - You said that LoRDS members wouldn't be getting blah blah blah. Well you know what? While I am in LoRD you can ignore me if I need help - but fuck that. I am GOING to help you if you ask and I am GOING to ressurect you if I see your corpse. Why? BECAUSE ITS A GAME AND IT NEEDS TO BE FUN. <br>
<br>
Yes, LORD was rude about the way they handled it but you know what. You made the asses out of yourselves with your obviously one sided posts. Do you know how many times CiW has ks'ed Lodizal or CoP has ks'ed lodizal or who cares who knows oh well. Do you hear about it? NO they handle it on their own, on their own boards and quietly. LIKE big people do in the real world. <br>
I FUCKING hate posting long posts because It goes all Mysty and I believe in but GOD DAMNIT this is such BULL SHIT.<br>
<br>
IT SUCKS ass that your raid got ruined but if you really did just walk away and smile you know what I would have read on that damn raid board?<br>
Topic &quot; LoM - Raid to CONTINUE Sept. 29&quot; Then in there, &quot;Since LoRD FCFS'ed Hate, we will attempt it again on the previous date. I hope since we respected their being there, they will respect us.&quot;<br>
THAT would have been the mature thing to do. Not whine all over dozens of boards.<br>

 Adirya, if you would, please go to the LoM board adn read the rather lengthy post that Aurreal made of his chat logs with your newfound guild leader, a GM, and himself. It's rather educational, and rather instructive of the level of respect your GL has for other players. <p><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 45 Mojo Troll<br>

I think we all know that LoRD had no reputation to speak of, and therefore no reputation to lose by making an ass of itself.  I like how they've lost members over this.<br>

 Rep makes all the difference, it makes or breaks your guild when it comes to assistance. When push comes to shove in this game we all find ourselves looking to others for help. Lucky me I've had several very good LoM people around to help when I needed it. Kalthek, Aurreal, Hybren, and several others, Members of CoP have helped me before, same for Lodestar, Spirit of Fire, and even CoF when they were around (/mourn). <br>
 I've found myself contemplating this game alot lately, and comparing it to a game I'll most likely move to when it's released. I find the biggest joy I get in EQ now is finding some poor soul who needs assistance, and rendering what aid I can. Making someone elses day is my greatest pleasure in EQ now, how odd to think that it used to be hearing that noise and seeing the golden text that meant I was that much closer to hunting with the high level people. Maybe I should have been a cleric.<br>
 Anyways, the point of this long diatribe, when I read a chat log, or hear of an event like what's happened it saddens me to think that people would actively attempt to destroy the sense of community that we hold here. It's a damn shame. <p><br><font color=Red><b>Onker Purdydense<br> Level 45 Mojo Troll<br>

Straight up the truth, I don't give two coppers if Lom says LoRD did this or LoRD says LoM did this. Unfortunately I couldn't make it to Hate that day, or who know's what would of transcribed. <br>
All day while I was at work =( all I could think about was &quot;how's hate?&quot; Alas when I returned home, I was greeted by this log:<br>

Q: &quot;Did noone of your guild ever read the Hate reservation post on this board that was present 3 weeks ahead?<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
A: Yup, LoRD knew. They knew the night before when Hydial was trying to figure out what to raid next. When the potential conflict was brought to Hydial's attention, his response was more or less, &quot;So what?&quot;. I even asked Golom about the potential conflict an hour before insertion. It's totally within their right to call FCFS. Hell, I REALLY wanted to go to Hate, too. But I couldn't do it knowing that I'd be stepping on some friends to do so.<br>
<br>
That's about the point I went ahead with my /guildremove. I need a guild with a sense of &quot;Nobility&quot; and LoRD has none.<br>
<br>
There's quite a few good souls in LoRD. But under leadership like that, it's bound to happen again, and it's bound to start shit I don't want to be caught in the middle of just cause I'm wearing a LoRD tag and all for the sake of loot. Sorry, guys. <br>

That's all I need to know, to know that this was wrong. I know it's FCFS, I know you can't reserve jack on this server, I know not all members of LoRD agree with their leadership. I know I won't be posting my raid intentions for my guild here ever again, and hope my friends in other guilds knows our webpage. I know I will never forgive LoRD for this, and will hold a grudge, cause if / when I don't they'll take advantage of it again. <br>
Why not forgive the entire guild?~ simple, Leadership represents the followed, the followed represents the leader. The leader's remarks are noted, and the actions that the followed took (continued in Hate) reflect their desire to be with the Leader. It's all in the guild tag.<br>
<br>
If you read this thanks, if you didn't /rude ... but I can't blame ya cause it is bullsh*t. <br>

There are of course, some exceptions...they know who they are and I hope they get some sense and join guilds that have some decency and respect for others.<br>

The others I can't speak for, I have had some dealings with Golom but that was only when he came on a raid or two with us, think he wanted into CoP *shrug*.  Trouble is, when you have a guild tag you are representing your guild, not just yourself and people forget this.<br>
