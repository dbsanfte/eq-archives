I think it would be a complete disaster.  I've studied the medical systems of several of the world's major industrialized democracies (England, Australia, and France) and they are vastly inferior to our system in so many ways.  There is care rationing, wait times, increased bureaucracy, reduced innovation, lower payment for medical professionals leading to less talented professionals, and loss of patient choice.<br>
<br>
Our system may have its flaws, but going to socialized medicine is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Let's keep what's good about our system and fix what's bad.<br>

We have medicare for the elderly and medicaid for those who are not elderly but too poor to afford medical insurance.  People who become permanently disabled qualify for medicare.<br>
<br>
People who make too much money to qualify for medicaid can pay for insurance if they choose to.  I know that Connecticut has subsidized insurance programs that these people can qualify for under the Health Reinsurance Act.  The quality of coverage is very good.<br>
<br>
There are more safety nets than people realize.  One problem is that people don't know how to navigate them.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem I see is children.  Say your parents are morons and decide you don't need medical insurance, and then you get sick.  It's not your fault you got sick, or that you don't have insurance, but you can suffer for it.  I think we need to address that situation.  However, non disabled adults of sound mind should have the right to decline medical coverage if they so choose.  It seems like a stupid risk to take and I have always been careful to maintain insurance, but I don't think I should have the right to make that choice for others.<br>

  I remember back like 8 years ago when I had gone like 2 weeks with a building strep throat, it got to the point where I couldn't breathe air without difficult and swallowing food was getting impossible.  I went into the Emergency room and was treated immediately (within 15 minutes) without them asking me to fill out forms or questionaires or what not.<br>
<br>
  I would like to see some sort of baseline national health care as that alone would do more to prevent the massive costs we incur as taxpayers because people just let themselves go until it's life threatening usually if they have no form of healthcare. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1838<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/18/03 5:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Socialized Medicine or Moral Obligation?</span><hr size=1> If we decide to expand the scope of national healthcare, it would have to meet certain requirements for me to support it.<br>
<br>
1) It must increase the quality of health care or maintain it at the level it is at for everyone in the country.  If it will lower the quality of the majority and raise the quality of a small minority, as would socialized medicine, I obviously will not support it.<br>
<br>
2) Costs must be reasonable.<br>
<br>
3) It must be privatized to the maximum extent possible such that competition ensures quality and cost efficiency.<br>
<br>
Ayiar does have a very valid point that often postponement of care until it becomes emergent or avoidance of preventive care causes a long term increase in cost to the system as a whole.  This is a very real problem.  If we can improve the quality of medical care while at the same time reducing costs across the entire system, it would be foolish to do anything else.<br>

Here in Ontario, we supposedly have socialized health care, which sometimes has waits, sometimes doesn't. For example... last Sunday, I broke my foot playing baseball. I wisely forgot running shoes, and played wearing sandals. Then to make matters worse, after hurting my foot, I took the sandals off, and played for 2 hours barefoot. Smooth.<br>
<br>
However, when I went for X-Rays on Wednesday at the pleading of my physiotherapist, I was in, and out with developped pictures in less time than it took for my ride to go to the bathroom. Last several times I went in for medical attention, there was zero wait. Even at the emergency room. (though to be fair, that was a life-threatening emergency, I had an allergic reaction to some mushrooms)<br>
<br>
Personally, I like socialized health care. I like not having to worry about a guaranteed minimum standard of living. I also like the idea of some services being opt-in and not covered by socialized health care. If I want homeopathic treatment, I pay for it. If I want physiotherapy or a chiropractor, I pay for it. I like it that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ammelen>Ammelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1840<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/18/03 6:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Socialized Medicine or Moral Obligation?</span><hr size=1> Emergent or urgent care rarely has a long wait associated with it in the United States or in modern industrialized societies with socialized medical systems.<br>
<br>
The problems with wait times are generally for non emergency conditions.  If you have a broken foot, they'll probably see you fairly quickly.  If you are having a heart attack, you're pretty much guaranteed immediate treatment.  How about if you need knee replacement for arthritis, an operation on a slip disc in your back, or anything else that, while medically important, is not going to kill you if it isn't dealt with immediately.  In the United States, the wait will be much less (and there are many studies that have shown this to be true).  Canada and Great Britain both have long wait times for operations like this.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I know that in Great Britain care is often rationed.  For example, the state will not pay for dialysis treatment of ESRD (End State Renal Disease) in people over a certain age (60 or 65 I believe).  In the United States, such care is covered at any age with just about any insurance program you might be a part of.  It scares me to  rely on a government that can decide I'm not worth spending money on.  Give me private care where if I don't like the coverage, I can leave and choose other coverage.<br>

Heh...then we'd have the same issue w/ doctors as we do w/ teachers.  We don't have enough teachers in public schools because they don't get paid enough, instead they go to private schools or universities etc.  Same would happen w/ doctors I think.  You would have a majority of doctors going after privitized health care because it pays more than the government would be willing to pay for health care.<br>
<br>
Like what's been said before, there's plenty of healthcare available to anyone, some people just don't make it a priority in their lives to figure out how. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41221">Haels Alottapeeps</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

(Well, not everyone, I pay for mine entirely privately, but most americans do not.)<br>
<br>
It would adversely affect wages and drive down the quality of physicians and other health professionals.<br>
<br>
It would cost a shitload, so now people are paying for private AND public health care, it's just too expensive.  You would prevent people from being able to pay for private healthcare because they'd be forced to pay for a private system they didn't use at all.<br>
<br>
Governments simply cannot manage things efficiently.  They never do, because they create monopolies and there is no competition.  Without competition, you cannot have quality or price control.<br>
<br>
It would deny people the right to refuse health coverage, which I think should be a choice for all adults of sound mind.  If they would prefer to keep the cash and not carry any health coverage, I don't think that it's the government's business to decide it knows best.  I think people should make their own choices.<br>
<br>
Hospitals and doctors could be forced into taking payment from the centralized medical program or not be able to survive.<br>
<br>
If anything, I'd support a slight expansion of Medicaid upward in income levels to cover more of the people that cannot afford private coverage without making significant sacrifices.  I could also support legislation ensuring a minimum level of care for children, as they shouldn't be punished for having stupid/lazy/poor (not implying those 3 always go together) parents.  I would like for the current system to remain in place for the vast majority of people, and possibly add coverage for those individuals who cannot afford it.<br>
<br>
Basically, I want to improve or maintain everyone's coverage, socialized medicine will lower the quality of care for many while increasing it for a small minority.<br>

The doctor stongly urged the person to stay but they couldn't afford it. This is true of all insurance companies not just one.<br>
I don't think socialized medicine is the answer, but I do think something needs to be done. <br>
And I also do think some people are too lazy to go look for some solutions that are available to them.

Prices would go up in a single payer system because there would be no competition.<br>

I agree that there are real problems with insurance companies essentially breaking contract.  You pay them premiums, and it's then their job to pay for needed medical care for you, as determined by your doctor.  Sadly, that isn't what happens sometimes, and they decide it's their job to determine how long you should stay in a hospital or what meds you need etc.<br>
<br>
These issues are even worse in socialized medicine where some services are denied to you based on age or illness in order to save money.  Not all insurance plans in the US have these issues, the trick is getting on an indemnity plan rather than an HMO.  HMO's are really a problem, but they are dying out because people hate them so much (for the types of reasons you list above).  We want to keep our health care between us and our doctors without the insurance companies deciding what we need done.<br>

What system you know denies services to &quot;save money&quot; ? That isn't a characteristic of socialized med care. Just because you might see it happen in some systems doesn't mean it is something that always happens in socialized systems.<br>
<br>
The problem is often the lack of availability of services (not to save money). In socialized medicine it means a choice would have to be made on who would get the most probability of full recovery (or factors like that) out of an organtransplant, in private systems it just means the person with the most money gets it.<br>
<br>
Medical care is something all humans should have a right to by birth. The thought that money buys better medical care is repulsive to me and that's the main reason I support socialized medical care. <p>---------------<br>

We studied this in a college course I took at Dartmouth called &quot;Health Care in American Society.&quot;   We specifically looked at the English system and the fact that people over age 60? could not receive treatment for ESRD due to the costs associated with it.  (It's extremely effective treatment, but also extremely expensive, and must be continued as long as the person lives.)  We also learned that such policies are common in socialized medical programs, although not universal.<br>

That's not true.  In private systems, anyone who had the forethought to purchase insurance gets it.  In the US, anyone poor enough also gets it for free as part of government programs like Medicaid.  Also, in the US, if you are elderly you get it as part of Medicare.<br>

I'm not quite sure that's true, but it sounds good.  I would like to see everyone have access to medical care who wants it, but that is not something socialized medicine gives.  I also think people should have the right to decline medical coverage for themselves (but not for their minor children) to save money.<br>

<br>
It doesn't really.  Anyone who buys insurance gets roughly comparable medical care.  Which doctor you happen to choose is a much larger factor in the quality of care you receive.  I guess maybe it gets a bit better at the extreme high end, but even the lower end insurance plans in the US that poor people are part of provide medical care superior to that offered in any socialized medical program in the world.  The people who get fucked in the system are those that do not purchase any medical care at all but are high enough in income to afford it (i.e. not qualify for Medicaid).  The others that can get fucked in the US system, which is imo the biggest problem, are children whose parents are too stupid, lazy, greedy, or irresponsible to get their kids insurance.<br>
