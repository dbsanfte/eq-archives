This isn't going to be a daoc sucks or eq sucks post.<br><br>Classes:<br>There are a lot more classes in daoc compared to EQ however many of them are nearly identical to other comparable classes in the different realms.  For example the Hibernian Hero is almost the same as the Midgard Warrior which is about the same as the EQ warrior.  Each of the three realms has a heavy tank type class, a rogue class, a cleric class, a nuker class, hybrid healer class, and a hybrid nuker class.  The difference is their spell and skill selections available to them.  For example the class that I play is a Midgard hunter.  I get spear skills for melee, bow skills as a main weapon, and some magic skills which include a permanent charm animal and insect for a pet and some dex and ac buffs.  The Hibernian equivalent is the scout which also gets the same bow skills but no spells.  Instead they get sword and shield skills which aren't available to me.  Both roughly the same classes but with some minor tweaks to make them noticeably different both play wise and PvP wise.  Now the classes available to you as a player are limited to the realm that you chose to play.  Looking at the number of classes in a realm compared to the number of classes in EQ, EQ wins this contest.  The number of classes in the entire game however is greater then number of classes in EQ, so DAOC wins when you compare game to game.<br><br>Verdict: Tie<br><br>Combat System:<br>I don't need to explain how combat works in EQ so I'll just stick to daoc combat.  Fights in daoc are over quick.  Mobs hit harder and dont have as many hps as comparable EQ mobs.  For example lvl 25 daoc mobs can hit for over 100 dmg against lvl 20-22 players.  However as an archer type I melee with my spear for about 30-40 pts of damage and the tank types are doing 60-110 a round.  <br><br>In EQ high level tanks have disciplines to be used when needed.  In Daoc tanks have combat styles which can be used repeatedley or under special circumstances.  The catch is these combat styles take stamina which drains and replenishes about the same rate it does in EQ however there's no invigor type spell that I know of.  Some of the combat styles can be used at any time, others only when to at the front, side, or rear of an opponent.  Some styles can only be used when you parry an attack or evade an attack.  Some of the more advanced styles have a 1-2-3 combo which must be used in succession with each following style doing more and more damage.  Kinda like a jab, body blow, then uppercut combo in boxing.  When a player succesfully executes a style he gets a message saying how much extra damage was done and you get cool lightsaber like animation effects of your weapons slicing away.  Now IMO a good 50% of the styles are worthless.  Imagine in EQ where you had to sit there and hit a button within one second after you riposted an attack followed by another button to execute a 1-2 combo.  Nice kinda thought but not always practical.  <br><br>Levels make an even bigger difference then they did in EQ.  In daoc you get bonus damage when fighting mobs that are lower level then you and you get damage penalties when fighting mobs higher then you.  For example at lvl 22 I can shoot newbie level mobs for over 100 points of damage and melee them for nearly 100 pts of damage.  Against mobs my level I shoot for around 40-50 and melee for 30-40.  Against mobs 3-4 levels higher then me I shoot for around 20-40 and melee around 20-30.  The same is true for spells, if your higher level then the mob, you do your base damage plus bonus damage.  It would be like a lvl 50 wizard with ice comet nuking a lvl 30 EQ mob for 1800 dmg instead of 1120 or whatever the max damage is.  <br><br>Verdict:  Fights are generally the same except daoc fights are over much quicker win or lose.  The combat styles make tanks stay alert and do something more then hit taunt/bash/slam repeatedley.  Slightly in Daoc's favor here.<br><br>Magic system:<br>Casters and healers get 3 schools of magic to choose from in daoc.  The number of spells available depends on how many skill points the player assigns to each school.  Typically all the spells are the same, the only difference is upgrades to your current ones.  The spirit master for example can have 18 spells for his whole career.  By the time he is lvl 11 he can have all these spells.  These are teh same spells he'll have for his entire career, as he levels up he'll get more spells which are upgrades to the ones he currently has.  So here the magic system is somewhat limited and favors EQ with its rich diversity of spells.  The spells that casters/healers do get are the core staple spells from EQ.  Spells like a DD, ac buff, AE dmg, life tap, etc.  There aren't many utility type spells EQ has.  <br><br>Here's one thing that most people will like though.  Imagine EQ with everyone having perma Clarity 5 and you have the mana regen system in daoc.  At lvl 20 you can go from OOM to FM in less then a minute.  Complete wipeout?  Takes about 5 mins to recover, one player can be resed in about every 30-45 seconds.  Buffs take virtually NO MANA (cheer).  No more 10 minute buff sessions getting ready to get ready.  Instead the game has concentration points.  A buffer can only have so many outstanding buffs out at once, after that they can't buff anyone.  It would be like having a lvl 60 cleric casting 10 Aegis buffs and use one bubble of mana, however after that he couldn't do anymore buffs.  I personally like that system because it cuts down on downtime when your playing while putting a check in to prevent rampant buffing without consequences.  <br><br>Verdict:  Spells variety favors EQ big time, just a ton more spells in EQ then Daoc.  The mana system favors daoc however because downtime is evil.<br><br>Leveling:<br>In daoc you fight nearly constantly because of the super fast mana regen rate and faster hp regen rate.  Also the fights are over about twice as fast in EQ.  However when it comes down to it you level about the same rate in daoc as you do in EQ.  I have about 3.5 days played time and I'm lvl 23 which is comparable to non gimp or twinked EQ leveling.  <br><br>Verdict:  just depends on what you like, a slower paced combat system and recovery rate or one that's faster paced but does require more work because its that many more mobs to kill for the same leveling rate.<br><br>Character development:<br>This is a BIG BIG difference here between these two great games.  Character development in daoc is diablo like because you assign skill points as you level up.  One lvl 50 sorcerer can be very different then another lvl 50 sorcerer unlike in EQ.  Not all characters are the same!  There is a definite distinction in this game which is good!  A healer class in Midgard for example has the unenviable duty of being BOTH Enchanter and Cleric in his group.  Now depending on how he/she spends their points they can be a better enchanter or a better cleric or be average in both but good at neither.  For the tanks there is what you could call weapon specialization in the game.  Axe users get different combat styles then sword users.  Dual wielders get different combat styles then two handed weapon users.  A warrior can specialize in two handed weapon usage and parry skill while another warrior could specialize in one handed swords and shield usage.  Its all in how you decide to make your character and the game puts you in control of how your character is made.<br><br>Verdict: Daoc<br><br>Graphics:  Daoc's graphics are just a touch better then EQs however the EQ engine has been the same for the last 2.5 years so I would HOPE its better.  When SOL comes out I'm sure they will be equal or maybe better in EQs favor.  The 3D engine in EQ is better then daoc's engine IMO.  I played EQ in 1024x800 with good FPS, but in Daoc at 800x600 I get bad FPS with my PIII466.  Spell graphics are comparable, daoc melee graphics are better then EQs because when a tank does a combat move you can graphically see it rather then just get a one line text when a tank uses a discpline.  <br><br>Verdict:  EQ has a better 3D engine IMO.  Graphic quality is about the same but EQ has better FPS.<br><br>Loot:<br>Everyones favorite thing isn't it?  It what most people play the game for, to find exciting new items for your character and it makes the game fun.  Here is another major major difference in the game but I can understand the reason for it.  Magic loot in daoc is almost nonexistent.  There is hardly anything magic to find in the game, the few magic items I have came from quests which anyone of my class can do.  EQ has loads and loads of magic items and the items is what seperates the big boys from the kids in EQ.  This is why daoc has few magic items.  Its because the high end game is going to be PvP that they don't want really poweful magic items out there.  They want the player to win by skill and not by loot.  Sure skill can take you a long ways but you can't tell me that loot doesn't make a major difference in EQ.  Take 50 lvl 60s into NToV armed with planar armor, lamentations, and 30/45 two handed weapons and they'll get hosed.  Now take 50 lvl 60s with full kael armor, primal weapons, dain dorf belts, yelinak gloves, and they'll do good if they have the tactics.  Also who is going to win in a 6 on 6 battle between a group with planar armor and planar weapons against another with SoV armor with a few choice NTOV drops and primal weapons?  That is exactly why there aren't many good items to be had so far in daoc, they want the PvP fights to be player dependent and not item dependent.  <br><br>Verdict:  EQ<br><br>The end game:<br>This is largely a matter of personal preference.  If you like PvM then EQ is your game.  Eq easily wins the PvM game.  There aren't many if any uber mobs in daoc to kill.  I'm sure you would get very very bored in daoc if you played the game for the PvM, it just doesn't have the content that EQ has.  An EQ raid is a raid against an uber mob of some kind, a raid in daoc is a raid against player held lands.  Big difference.  I personally like the PvP aspect of it because after you kill Trakanon 10 times it becomes routine, its always the same and nothing changes.  However a raid against a player held realm keep will always be different and interesting.  EQ grew stale for me because I had experienced almost everything there was in the game.  I think the longevity in daoc will be better for me because I love multiplayer games.  That's why games like Starcraft, Halflife, and Quake are still so popular because of the PvP.  PvE is good and fun but it has a point where it can't offer anything new.  PvP is always different and has more long term viability.  <br><br>Verdict: its your choice on what kind of game that you like to play.<br><br>Final notes:<br>Mythic entertainment recognized the negatives and positives of PvP.  They seemed to have succesfully taken away almost all the negatives of PvP while keeping all the positives.  When you die in daoc in PvP the following is true:<br>-you don't lose money or items<br>-you don't lose experience<br>-you don't lose anything at all!  Its kinda like Team Fortess, you respawn at your starting point with all your equipment.<br><br>When you kill someone in PvP you gain realm points which has been a mystery on what they are used for because nobody has acquired enough of them yet.  So the victor gets a reward and the loser isn't punished in anyway besides being sent back to his start spot in some nearby town.  <br><br>Also the d00D factor is eliminated in PvP in the game.  The game effectively dehumanizes the opposing players.  When you target the other team you don't see any names, you just see their race.  Click on that big guy over there and you get Troll for your target.  Click on the smaller one and you get a kobold for a target.  You can't communicate with the other team at all.  Anything you say they don't see and vice versa.  Tells can't be sent to members of the opposing team.  For all intents and purposes the other players could be GM driven pcs in a big battle.  That means if you get PK'd you don't get any &quot;Joo suck&quot; messages sent to you or any other taunts.  That also keeps crossteaming from happening which is good since we all KNOW that would happen otherwise.  <br><br>Well I'm sure I'm forgetting something but oh well. <p>----------------------- <BR>Zartuul the Tactician <BR>Grave Lord, Zeb <BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uhybren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hybren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(10/21/01 11:24:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My review of DAOC and comparisons to EQ</span><hr size=1> Very good review Zartuul!

The best you found was still something with a pathetic dmg/delay by todays standards. Heck, back then fine steel was awe inspiring. I'm sure when DAoC has been out for 2 years like EQ we'll see tons of uber armor sets and weapons for classes with cool procs. But for now there are magic weapons which give +stats +skill which is about the same as EQ was. Plus not everyone has gotten to some of the higher level dungeons where were just recently itemized, there are some proc weapons in the game which proc cool spells and there are some armor sets (ala Bloody Leather Armor off Hobgoblins, Ancient Plate, Arwanite Armor, Lion Embossed Plate) more of these will pop up in each realm. Again it's too early to be sure and things are being added to the loot tables behind our back, of this I'm sure. <p><B>Arioc Murkwood</B><BR>Elven Champion<BR><I>Galahad Server</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uverbalsabre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Verbalsabre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://verbalsabre.50megs.com/images/lsabre.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(10/22/01 5:10:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: objective?</span><hr size=1> Nice review.

To compare DAoC (out 2 weeks ) to EQ (out 2 and half years and now 3 expansions ) is somewhat one sided. Some things that should be brought up is the reason people like playing DAoC ... ie convience ... e.g. Food/Drink/Resses/zone vrs Bubble tech/class choices ( casters are IMHO very unique to each other depending on the realms ), Spell/melee effects/ down time/med time/HP time/Quests/Quest Journal/Groups.

Some of the things I think Zartuul is missing:<br><br>The big thing is levelling.  So far, (at 15), DAoC blows EQ away.  Up until level 20, you can get tasks which you can do for xp.  These tasks generally encourage you to travel.  You can run errands for non-guards (big travelling time, learn the world, but not really worth the time) or kill-tasks for guards.  The kill-tasks rock.  Instead of in EQ, where you find a camp and stay there until you ding, you get asked to kill something that you can solo... and that thing will differ, sending you to different areas around where you are.  In short, it encourages you to get to know the area.<br><br>Additionally, most everyone can solo an xp mob.  If you don't want a group, you don't need one.  Solo is typically the best way to do the kill tasks (as they are typically blue mobs and groups need to kill higher cons to be worthwhile).  Or you can group, get a bonus for being grouped, fight higher cons which are nice xp, and benefit from things like Group Bonus (a bonus for fighting multiple mobs at once).<br><br>Mobs are also worth more xp if they've been up for a while or if they are part of a camp of mobs (even if pulled solo).  This encourages you to hunt where others don't.<br><br>Because cons change quickly, you're looking for something new to kill in pretty short order.  None of this kill Frogloks for 20 levels.  Move around, explore.<br><br>My verdict: As far as xp'ing goes... DAoC blows EQ away.  DAoC encourages you to explore a bit, EQ encourages you to sit and camp.<br><br>Loot:<br>Another big, big advantage for DAoC.  In EQ, you are your gear.  Your gear makes you different from person X.  You give a melee twink a fungal tunic and he's god.  You want to make money or improve your items?  Camp it or camp something else to make money to buy it.  In DAoC... you kill a named and can get its item 1x.  So again, move on, go find something new.  Quest loots are also something that isn't camped.  No people camping the AC to make money.  Items exist... and they help melees and casters equally.  Get the right gear and your level 5 spell gets more powerful.  Try and do that in EQ.  Gear also cons.  You want blue con armor.  Get stuff thats beyond your level and it degrades fast plus you don't get all the benefits.  In short, most people are pretty equal.  That's right, you don't need to be in a NToVable guild to get good stuff.  You can play with your friends, in a nice small guild, and be happy.<br><br>My Verdict: DAoC, by a long shot.<br><br>Quests:<br>Another big, big thing in DAoC's favor.  See, quest loot only drops if you've been given the quest and are at that step.  And the items you get are very nice.  Better than drops you can get at the same level.  Again, this discourages you away from mass power levelling and encourages you to explore.  At 11, I got myself a staff that adds 10 to my 3 spell skills.  I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sounds impressive and it blows away anything else that I could get at that level.  The quests are also more interesting in that they give some history, can trigger things (sort of like Coldain Ring war 10), and you can't skip steps.  Go see the world.  Of course, you don't need to have the quest rewards, if you don't want to do them, you don't have to, but they are nice to do.  EQ low level quests... uhm... well, they suck, enough said.<br><br>Additionally, the game helps you keep track of what the next step in the quest is.  You can do this for tasks too.  I do wish the info included a bit more, at least for delivery tasks... the town of the person to deliver in really should be listed.<br><br>My Verdict: DAoC.<br><br>Tradeskills:<br>EQ made their game dependent upon drops.  As such, things sold from merchants or by players have no value.  If not today, then when the next expansion comes out.  After all, as Zartuul said, loot is the primary motivation... in EQ.  Not DAoC.  Here tradeskills would appear to have a real future.  Players basically make the same items the npc vendors sell (more durable though), but can make them for less.  Now, magic items do drop from mobs that are better because of their bonuses, but the con system means people outgrow them or can only use them for a limited set of levels.  As items aren't too pricy, people will let items leave the market by selling them to vendors and because items do get worn down through use, there is always a demand for new, unscuffed stuff.  In short, as far as I can see, tradeskills won't grow useless and need to be bolstered not by making them useful, but by making them a component in a quest.<br><br>My Verdict: DAoC by a longshot.  At least that's the verdict of this disgruntled tinkerer.<br><br>Dieing:<br>Another biggie for DAoC.  The xp loss is sorta hefty.  No 96% resses.  You basically lose 10% of your current level's xp.  But your first death has a significantly reduced penalty.  You don't need a ress.  You want half of the xp back?  Go to where you die and type /pray.  You do lose con, up to a max of 3 (1 point for first death, 2 for second, 3 for every one thereafter) and you need to pay a healer to get your con back, at a rate that goes up each level.  But the fee isn't anything you can't afford.  If you die in a nasty place, you just /release, take the xp loss, and don't go back.  Why?  Because you don't need to.  All your gear pops up with you, nothing gets left behind.  As a last added bonus, you can't lose a level.  So if you've just dinged, it's a great time to go explore.<br><br>My Verdict: Another biggie for DAoC.<br><br>Boats and Port Dependency:<br>DAoC doesn't have them.  Instead, take a horse to where you want to go... if you are near a town that has a horse that goes where you want to go.  Hopefully they'll add more and more horse routes.  <br><br>My Verdict: Another biggie for DAoC.<br><br>Now, there are things EQ does better.  <br><br>Communicatios:<br>For instance, the /who system in DAoC sucks right now.  Can't do /who &quot;dark brethren of midgard&quot;... that's just /who dark.  Can't do /who 1 viking.  That's just /who 1.  Very annoying.  There isn't a hotkey to send a tell.  You can't cycle through different people to reply to.  I miss shout.  I miss OOC.  The lack of these serve to isolate you.  Hopefully they'll add a limited range shout at some time in the future.  The communications window is split in DAoC, a semi-nice idea.  The problem is you can't set the font size... so unless you make a huge window, you've got limited number of lines there.  You can miss a lot of info that way.  Additionally, some fool put the tabs for different communication modes on top of the chat box, where you click to target things.  The smart thing would have been to put them on the bottom, where you won't click on them by accident.<br><br>My Verdict: EQ for now, until DAoC wakes up and fixes up their system.<br><br>Feedback:<br>I can't see how hard my pet hits.  I'd like to be able to.  I don't know how much my damage shield does to mobs.  I'd like to be able to.  I also can't /bug or /feedback to give them my opinions in game.<br><br>My Verdict: EQ, by a pretty big margin.<br><br>Another biggie for me is variety.  In EQ, I'm running around in a world with a ton of races.  In DAoC, there are 4.  Yes, there are 8 more in other realms, but that really doesn't matter.  My guild, my friends are playing in Midgard.  The other 8 are the enemy.  So effectively, that means 4 races.  While you can dye your armor to different colors, so far I haven't seen much variety in looks.  The constant updating of gear also somewhat discourages efforts to customize the look early on.  For character creation, you basically can choose one of 3 sizes and a few faces/hair colors.  But they don't make that much of a difference.  Basically, in EQ, it is a lot easier to recognize someone by their looks.  On the opposite side, you can buy a guild emblem, which should be pretty cool to have on your cloak.  And then there is spells.  I'm level 15.  Since level 8 or so, I have had every ability I'll get.  Henceforth, it's just new versions of the same spells, more powerful.  I hope that they'll add some spell lines that start at 30 or 40 in the specialities.  My pet, even though I've upgraded it 2x now looks the same as it did at level 1.  At least a bit of a tint or size difference would be nice.<br><br>My verdict: EQ.<br><br>Escape potential/short duration travel:<br>In EQ, get SoW, outrun the mobs.  In DAoC, all SoW is a combo of bard speed song and Scale of the Wolf... it drops in combat and you pretty much need to be grouped with the person that casts it to have the benefit.  No asking someone for SoW to make a quick run to something that, in EQ terms, if a few zones away.  If you aren't at a place with horses that go near where you want to go, run at your slow rate.<br><br>My Verdict: EQ, but not by much, as DAoC travel isn't the hassle that EQ travel is.<br><br>Lag:<br>Framerate in DAoC is definately worse.  Especially in the capital city.  They are trying to fix it, but for now, run through the capital, click left to turn left a bit, and you jump your facing 90 degrees.  Very, very annoying.  Other smaller towns also somewhat suffer from this, although not as much.  In the capital though, it's like being on a dragon raid a year ago with full particles on.  It definately makes the capital an unenjoyable place to be.<br><br>My Verdict: EQ, until DAoC fixes this.<br><br>In summary:<br>The game has potential.  At the very least, it's a break from EQ.  From the need to camp, the need to group, the need to do this or that, the frustrations of it all.  It's great to play casually.  And that's the beauty... so far, it's a game.  Not a chore.  If it'll stay that way after I've played for 2.5 years, I don't know.  But for now, it's a welcome break from the monotony that is EQ.

Sure, EQ may win in overall amount of different spells, but DAoC casters are more versatile overall. Why? Customizable spell paths. In the high-end EQ game, every caster has a specific role. Wizards nuke, Mages CoH and damage shield, Enchanters.....buff, and Necros are mana batteries. <br><br> Not so in DAoC. Let's look at the Hibernia realm as just an example of versatility. Mentalists, the DAoC enchanter-style class, can dd, stun, mez, heal, charm humanoids, dot heal, and confuse the enemy into attacking themselves. Enchanters are the EQ mage version of the realm, but can slow, cast group sow, stun, dd, and cast a point blank aoe. All more useful than any EQ mage. Eldritch can dd, aoe, dot, debuff str/con, debuff dex/quick, stun, and aoe mez.  I won't even get in to the healer classes because their versatility blows EQ totally away (druids that can res, wtf). <br><br> My verdict: DAoC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usumguror.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sumguror</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(10/25/01 6:02:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Is EQ or DAoC More Friendly To The Casual Gamer</span><hr size=1> I usually can only play for about two to three hours at a time.

I'm sure Verant is amused whenever they read people talking about how much they hate downtime, how they wish they could leave EQ, they are only playing for their friends, etc.  Verant knows the truth, however:<br><br>Lack of sufficient downtime = lack of player interaction = lack of game longevity <br><br>Games that try to completely eliminate downtime will end up being a 3-6 month &quot;diversion&quot; game between EQ expansions...smart MMORPG game designers will avoid 100% action at all costs:  that's what single-player games are for.<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uaxterixenobelix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Axterix EnObelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grumpy Ol' Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(10/25/01 8:41:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: magic system</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;How does DAoC compare to EQ regarding the ability to log on and play when you don't have a large chunk of time to get into a group of people who are near your level? <br><br>Well, at the low levels, most classes can find something worth xp to solo.  Higher level mobs tend to group together more or are found on the frontiers.  Sort of sounds like most people will want groups at that level.  However, there isn't too much high level content yet and I'm quite a distance from it, so I can't say for sure.  I will warn you that 40-50 are very slow, so slow that they put halfway points where you get additional skill points and can't go below once crossed.  By EQ, for the equiv levels you have the 96% ress at that point.  In DAoC, you lose a lot of xp even if you pray, so it is painful.<br><br>In terms of soloability, it does vary a bit by class.  For Midgard, one of the rogue classes is a relatively weak solo'er (their class isn't quite finished yet, missing its spells).  Warriors are also not supposed to solo well due to being defensive in nature, means a bit more downtime.  But I've yet to find a class that can't solo much easier than possible in EQ.  Do keep in mind though that this is still at relatively low levels.<br><br>&gt;&gt;One point I don't think has been made. Sure, EQ may win in overall amount of different spells, but DAoC casters are more versatile overall. Why? Customizable spell paths. In the high-end EQ game, every caster has a specific role. Wizards nuke, Mages CoH and damage shield, Enchanters.....buff, and Necros are mana batteries. <br><br>&gt;&gt;Not so in DAoC. Let's look at the Hibernia realm as just an example of versatility. Mentalists, the DAoC enchanter-style class, can dd, stun, mez, heal, charm humanoids, dot heal, and confuse the enemy into attacking themselves. Enchanters are the EQ mage version of the realm, but can slow, cast group sow, stun, dd, and cast a point blank aoe. All more useful than any EQ mage. Eldritch can dd, aoe, dot, debuff str/con, debuff dex/quick, stun, and aoe mez. I won't even get in to the healer classes because their versatility blows EQ totally away (druids that can res, wtf). <br><br>This isn't entirely true.  To look at Midgard again, yes, our healers can SoW, buff, clarity, heal, and mez.  Our Spiritmasters can play with pet, buff pet, life tap, transfer health, ae mez, and debuff.  However, your skill levels impact resists and ranges of damage/healing.  So a healer that works entirely on healing is a huge asset to a group.  His healing spells are a ton more power effecient than those of a healer that has split up his points.  The same applies to other classes.  To illustrate, my spiritmaster is all summoning (makes me basically an EQ mage).  My pet heal heals about over 1/3rd of my pets health, every time.  The other spiritmaster in my guild is diversified.  He can mez, nuke better, life tap, and transfer health.  But his pet heal is about half as effective as mine and his pet itself would get owned by mine.  Apply that same logic to a healer and you have the difference between having a shaman as healer (can do lots but not that great at healing) and a cleric (super healer, not much else).<br><br>Basically, you have more options, yes.  But you pay a price for it.  When you get a healer, you don't know exactly what you are getting.  You could be getting super heals... or a guy that can mez.  It's a way of taking basic classes and allowing a lot more personalization, a lot more 'classes' than are actually listed.  It is customization.  But when playing my big hp'd warrior, I'd prefer to have one healer that is a near max spec'd healer and another that is more specialized toward the buff and mez aspects.  In short, I want a cleric and an enchanter.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessageRange?topicID=557.topic&start=21&stop=30>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=576.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=575.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.emailToFriend?topicID=557.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.threadControl?topicID=557.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=557.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=557.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm39">GUILDS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">Flame Forum<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm34">Bottom Feeders<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm35">Camelot Connections<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm37">Beastlord's Scratching Post<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm36">Moderators/Admins<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Admins Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F4CC10>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#F4CC10> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8>The Tavern</a> <font color=#F4CC10> - </font><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/">Zebu's Zanadu!</a><font color=#F4CC10> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
