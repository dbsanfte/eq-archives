<br>
I hope this is something I can work on later when I have free time, but for now it's just the EQ Atlas map with some spawn information (blue/red dots, and cyan/mudgreen lines, pathetic I know). It's 6 am now, so expect some *edits* too. Feel free to correct me anywhere or add to this. Let's make KC a better place. <br>
<br>
Here's the link to the map<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.optushome.com.au/sutantyo/karnor1.jpg">members.optushome.com.au/...arnor1.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Ripped off from EQAtlas, and dotted with mob spawn points (blue and red). The cyan and green lines are places roamed by mobs.<br>
<br>
Karnor Castle started off with two Drolvarg before the first bridge. These can be Drolvarg Sentry (lvl 39-44) or Drolvarg Guardian (45-4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . The small red boxes indicates their spawn points. These Drolvargs are on Venril Sathir faction, so they are non-kos to evil races. <br>
<br>
After the first bridge, there are 4 more spawn points. I am not sure about the level you need to single pull the Drolvargs, but I believe it to be 56. Notice if you pull one it will move slightly to the middle, hence aggroing his friend on the other side. It's very likely for you to get two Drolvargs. There is also one roamer here that stops right in the middle of the 4 spawns.<br>
<br>
Everything past the 2nd bridge has no VS faction. There are two popular camps here, LCY and RCY. Popular? Yes. Safe? Definitely not. Both camps takes some effort to break due to multiple mobs, and they share 3 roamers shuffling around between LCY and RCY. You get a shot at Caller of Sathir and Skeletal Captain though from above. <br>
<br>
Specific Camps.<br>
<br>
Hand Camp (Labeled 10)<br>
<br>
Hand spawns are in VS faction, so if you have good faction with OT outpost you will not be KoS in here. It could be a good idea sending in someone not KoS to check the room spawn before breaking it. <br>
The possible mobs in here are A Cursed Hand, A Construct, Hangnail, and Construct of Sathir. For lvl ranges, please go check Allakhazam. Generally a balanced group of 4 50+ would do allright in this camp, can be combined with Jail/Warlord camp. The bane of this camp is the Construct of Sathir who hits for up to 143 and also Harm Touches. What worse is that the room can spawn more than one (never seen 3 or more though). A puller walking in the room with two of these might die instantly. <br>
You will need lvl 58 to single pull Hand Room, although named will still assist even at 60.<br>
The nasty thing about breaking this room, is that everymob will go to the center of the room first before coming out, thus aggroing all 3 other mobs inside the room.<br>
<br>
Warlord Room (Labeled <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
This is a small room with 4 Drolvarg Bodyguards, with the occasional Drolvarg Warlord or Drolvarg Pawduster. I believe all mobs in this room are between lvl 48-52, they hit for 130-140 with tons of AC/HP. Warlord also summons. A lvl 60 still cannot single pull this room due to assist. A possible solution to break this room is using Ranger/Druid harmony. After you open the door, if you stick to the wall you shouldn't get aggroed. <br>
<br>
Notes about KC:<br>
<br>
Recommended lvl is 48+. <br>
<br>
Pull with HARMONY, KC is an outdoor zone, and we know how many druids there are in the world LFG. Use them. <br>
<br>
Monk/SK puller is recommended, or bring a crowd control. 56+ can single pull most places except for Hand Warlord Basement. Also named might assist, as well as Skeletal Watcher. 58+ can single pull hand<br>
<br>
Get a BALANCED group. Good luck having a group with 3 warriors and no healers, don't bite more than you can chew. No crowd control ? Then make sure you can handle adds if you want to do LCY or RCY.<br>
<br>
Time the respawn, all mobs are on a 26 mins timer. Get a stopwatch and remember the order of spawn points where you pull the mobs. Granted this can be hard with the roamers, hence try not to camp where the roamers roam.<br>
<br>
Safe spots in KC<br>
<br>
Generally, try not to camp where there are roamers. It's much safer to camp inside the warlord room then it is in RCY. It is much safer to camp in one of the rooms north of LCY than it is in LCY itself. Roamers sometimes get delayed because they decide to buff or heal their friends. With static spawns, you know when the mobs gonna come every time, no surprises. <br>
<br>
Left Moat, Right Moat. Push the mobs into the wall so they don't get heal from Curates.<br>
<br>
The room that connects from A on the map (upper left hand side). It has two spawns, but if you camp on the southern side of the room those two won't aggro. <br>
<br>
Hand Room, if you stick to the East wall you won't get aggro, but you can't do anything much either. Moral of the story, keep the hand spawn broken.<br>
<br>
On top of VS prep room (13), that tunnel west of the letter 'F'. Pulls are a bit light from there though. <br>
<br>
On top of VS prep room (13), now to the east of the letter 'F'. That path on top of the rightmost 7 has no roamer (or one at most). Pulls are long, access to RCY mobs though.<br>
<br>
Finally, this is untested, but there is some sort of a platform on top of 'D'. You can get there if go up the stairs from LCY. That area seems to be safe. <br>
<br>
In accordance with Risk vs Reward, the popular camping spots are<br>
- Box Room (12) with 2 roamers<br>
- LCY with 3 roamers and 3 static spawns. Prone to trains.<br>
- RCY with 3 roamers and 4 static spawns<br>
- Captain's camp with 3 roamers and 1 static spawn. Stairs to the captain is MUCH safer in my opinion<br>
- Entrance for the uniniated. Easily the worst spot with 1-20 roamers. Only pull here for breaking camps.<br>
<br>
There ... I've done it ... <br>

 <br>
The main prob with KC(and i dont mean this in a bad way) is it is where the people from(LOIO to OT to DL) go thinking its the next LOIO at lvl 50, and havent really been dungeon crawling.So they dont really have the experience that most do who have more fun in dungeons.<br>
<br>
I think KC will always be one of the worst zones in the game.(aside from blackburrow gotta love the 30 mob trains coming to the zone lmao) <p><font color=purple>Thar Wungudi 56 Barbarian Myrmidon<font><br><font color=yellow>Toor Surefoot 35 Wood Elf Druid<font><br><br><br><font color=silver>"Don't hate me cuz ya ain't me."<font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#564E39><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usumdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sumdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(1/27/02 3:36:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=841.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Karnor Castle Guide</span><hr size=1> Always sucks there, but the best for learning trains and grouping skills and fast heartbeats <p>Sumdar Md<BR>

<br>
Can't imagine what's so horrible about that, or how exactly are seb (horrible to get to without a port, cr takes forever), velks (booooooooooooooooooooooooring, no loot other than dogs or frenzy) or any other pick-up dungeons so much better. Guess it's a highly subjective thing, everyone likes their own dungeon. <p><center>

<br>
Let me explain, karnos is an outdoor dungeoun making it possible to cast spells like, I dunno, HARMONY in there.  In other words, find yourself a somewhat competant druid or ranger over level 45 and he should be able to pull.<br>
<br>
The other half of the problem?  Well, no offense to monks or sks or anyone else that likes to FD, but alot of you use it as a get out of jail free card way too often.  And in a zone like karnors where ever mob paths down the same little walkway no matter who pulls to where it's a bad idea.  Sometimes you get careless, you notice 4+ mobs on you, hit fd right in the middle of where 3 or 4 other groups (sometimes more) have to pull through causing them to get their original pull, plus your little train..........sure you have fb but maybe they don't.<br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind is most things in karnors come in pairs.  Without harmony and being under level 55 or 56 you're generally going to pull 2 mobs no matter what, more if you get repop on the way back.  If your little group can't handle 2 mobs at the very least it would be best for you to either find a more effective means of pulling, or find another zone to hunt in.<br>
<br>
Overall the zone really isn't all that tough, you just need to use the tools you've been given.  I hunted there for 15 levels not counting AA  points so I have a bit more experience in there then most, but trust me, a smart ranger/druid can in fact get all the way to venril sathir at full pop without agroing a single mob....that should speak volumes about their ability to pull in there. <p><center>

2) Puller with harmony<br>
3) Puller with feign.. if they suck they'll have to feign consistently =p  I'm biased, i hate the zone anyway and i term anything in any zone i hate as sucks. VS sucks, the pawbuster sucks, everything sucks in this zone. Its just how it goes because i hate it<br>
4) Puller that actually aggros the mob well enough to drag it by ppl without it stopping to whack them.<br>

It, like MistMoore is not very well understood by most of the people who play this game, and as such, you have a lot of people who screw up while there.<br>

The experience is relatively decent up to level 55ish, there are enough mobs to feast on, and they go down almost as easily as spiders in velk's.<br>

If I pulled more than one and no chanter then  just root em....preferably not by another group or in the pull path right down the center.  Hopefully people will pull close to group root one then pull second to someplace to fight.  If you get pops or adds have the back up tank pull em off and if they can't root cleric cast a quick root.  Never thought this method was very hard to do.   Very rarely I would pull a train and that is pretty simple to handle as well.....STOP AND DIE.  You can more than likely get a rezz of some sort in this zone.  Just words on how a nonFD or Harmony type can pull. <p>Golath Heartyhacker<br>
