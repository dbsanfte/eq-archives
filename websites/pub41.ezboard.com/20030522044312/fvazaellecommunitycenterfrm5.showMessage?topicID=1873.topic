<br>
Ranger and pal 2manning mobs.<br>
Venthos scoops up a few that were already pulled.<br>
Ranger complains to Venthos.<br>
Venthos explains to the ranger that 'fuck you'.<br>
Ranger complains and nothing is done, and stops making exp for a while, while Venthos continues to make exp.<br>
Ranger thinks admin staff will solve problem (did you just buy your first character or something?).<br>
Admin staff gets nothing done.<br>
Ranger logs off and after clearing his eyes of tears, gives us a log to laugh at him.<br>
<br>
Next time, just train Venthos or dispel his mobs. You wasted time by consulting the admin staff.

which is wrong just crap - as anyone who knows me over the years will testify. As for training - dispelling his mobs yada yada - no thankyou sir - I do have the spells and I guess the motivation - however I choose not to play the game that way .<br>
<br>
Wonder what you mean by *gives us log to laugh at him* ??<br>
<br>
I merely posted a log reaffirming Baldriks comments on how this individual perceives the game and its rules.<br>
<br>
Clearly - your comments on dispelling his mobs and training him show you to be a fool, a chartalan (look it up) and a person not worthy of further comment - bye<br>

<br>
well neway just a few pointers why u could infact have been wrong in this case.<br>
1) as can be seen from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>your</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> logs, you werent standing at the mobs spawn point all of the time, <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Wed Jan 15 00:24:01 2003] You begin casting Camouflage.<br>

and not being within a certain radius of a mob at all times prohibits you from recording all the activity happening which includes the mob u are wanting to monitor.<br>
<br>
2) Now for the part where venthos could of infact been right about having first aggroed that mob.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[/b][Wed Jan 15 00:20:38 2003] [/b]A Razorfiend Subduer says 'Guarding with my life..oh splendid one.'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

pay attention to the times on those.<br>
<br>
3) looking at how u may not have aggroed that mob<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Wed Jan 15 00:24:01 2003] You begin casting Camouflage.<br>
[Wed Jan 15 00:24:01 2003] Your body fades away.<br>

notice that the intial aggro script is missing? that script u see on most mobs when aggroed from rest. And normally isnt retriggered after aggro has been changed untill that mob is reseted. <br>
<br>
but i guess since whining and bitching is the &quot;in&quot; thing to do, you're excused to miss key stuff and always be right.~ <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2rwd9/Images/sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

PoN - No idea what you are talking about - take that up with the relevant people.<br>
<br>
Regarding aggro - and pulling. I was pulling from inside the cave to outside. Hence the use of innate camo as often you will get pops inside the tunnel on the way in.<br>
There is also a mob that spawns behind the rock inside the first cave, that is obscured from view. One method of pulling this is to drop camo within its aggro range, and pull via proximity aggro, make some distance - and then ensnare.<br>
<br>
And yeah I was pulling via ensnare - so... ??<br>
This gives time to root park/snare any pops in the tunnel on the way out. And btw - he did it twice. Once is an error maybe, the second time was wanton.<br>
<br>
Believe what you will - I know how to pull, as people who know me will testify. I also know how to play fair.<br>
The n00b comment really says it all about you and your type of player. Bye ~  lala  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
