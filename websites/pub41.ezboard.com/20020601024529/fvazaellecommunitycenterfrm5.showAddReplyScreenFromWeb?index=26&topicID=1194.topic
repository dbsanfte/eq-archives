Any 15 idiots can go there and farm themselves some of the best attainable loot in the game (at the time, and for up and coming guilds), let alone primal, which is a mistake in itself because it's just too good.<br>
<br>
but Vulak?  Maybe, maybe if Vazaelle didn't take that 6 month break from tov, I would see your point.  Since most servers have guilds with several members in multiple Vulak items (especially warriors), but Vaz doesn't (well only 2, and one of those people's items are two fairly weak ones, hi bald).  This is why Dozekar is currently one of the, if not the, most contested mob on Vazaelle right now/still.  Even funnier, most of the Vulak loot on Vazaelle is spread evenly throughout guilds, so I don't see where you get off saying a guild is more powerful than you because of vulak loot.  We can count if you want, but I'd say CC only has a little over half of the vulak loot on the server on currently active members.  <br>
<br>
Also, like people were saying, almost every item on Vulak can be replaced in an easier or faster way, hell a simple quest involving master yael or chardok faction and you blow those items out of the water.  If all you're concerned about is getting your char some pretty numbers on the top of your inventory, Vulak was certainly a pretty fast way to do so.  Really the only quicker way, is the rest of ntov.  And guess what?  If Vulak still existed, no one besides Caer would be seeing Vulak more than once a month (tops) still, just because of the time difference.<br>
<br>
So you choose, 25ish pieces of loot that ppl care about, or 3?<br>
Sure, it's nice to dream about eventually getting &quot;the best&quot; item in the game but realistically, 4 &quot;very good&quot; items leave you better off in every case concerning vulak loot (aside from the dagger, because all rogues do is damage and the tap/bs mod are nice, and hps are pretty meaningless after a point.)  And as long as we have a euro guild here, even if he was put back in, which he won't be...you'd have a better chance getting it from the ring of fire type event which he's supposed to spawn at the end of.<br>

I don't have 12 hours to play every day, I have a life (just as real as yours, no doubt),  but fortunately for me I have killed Warders.  You are shit out of luck because of you (and perhaps for Verant to create a zone which one event changes it so drastically).  For whatever reason, you were not in a position to kill them--who's to blame for that?  You.  They poofed because CC released Ventani.  Oh well.  Can't kill Warders?  There are a ton of other Dragons (heck, some look just like them) that drop nice stuff for your to kill.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> this isnt a personal attack, and you'd be an idiot to take it that way. this game rewards people who have tons of free time to sit and sit and sit. there's a reason they call it evercamp, its because ppl who have tons of free time excel at it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
EQ is nicknamed EverCamp because the game often involves long and boring camps.  Granted, people who have more free time tend to excel at it, it was not named it BECAUSE of it.  Just as someone in your field of work should complain that you get paid more than them because you work more and/or work harder...  just as you should stop complaining (and your weak-ass whining) just because someone has more time to devote to EQ and are &quot;ahead&quot; of you.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ppl who think that its a race should be shot. if you want to race and race, go somewhere gay like a PvP server since you're always wanting to beat the crap out of other ppl.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't understand how does racing = PvP?  Some people want to be the best on their particular server.  They want to be the first.  I don't think these people want to be killed by their fellow players.  Nor do they want to kill other players (okay, maybe sometimes it'd be fun to slay others, but that's what the Arena is for).  <br>
<br>
Why do you worry if it is a race or not?  Everyone plays the game how they want to be play it.  It appears that you worry 'bout the speed of others is because you want to sit down, play a couple of hours at your leisure and be able to kill Mighty Gods &amp; Dragons and take all their great treasure.  I'm sorry sir, but it jus' doesn't work out that way.  It's not a race, but if you want the good stuff, it's not jus' gonna sit there waiting for you to kill it.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> just because you're 900 days of playtime ahead of me, shouldnt mean i cant have every opportunity you did. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You have the same opportunity.  Unless the person unplugged your internet connection or blocked you from your computer, you had the exact same opportunity as anyone else who play on Vaz.  Whether it was your personal decision or something beyond your control, you did not take advantage of that opportunity...  it's not the other players fault.  <br>
<br>
BTW...  I like how you started your post by callin' 'em an idiot, then you said how they are an idiot if they take it that way.  I won't beat 'round the bush--your sir, are an idiot.  <br>
<br>
Verant stated it pretty plainly--everyone will not get to experience every single thing this game has to offer.  Not everyone will get UberItem_05.  Not everyone will get to kill UberMob_07.  Deal with it.  <br>
<br>
Actually if you want to cry and complain 'bout it--you can do that too.  Some people enjoy the attention of being ridiculed, I supposed<br>

your ranting about not having access to the same content in eq playing 2 hours a day as i have playing 16 hours a day is quite equivalent to someone working 6 hours a week part time being upset that he gets paid less than someone working full time and overtime.  if we had access to the same content, what would be the incentive to play more than 2 hours a day?<br>
<br>
life is all about decisions.  decide what's important to you.  all decisions have consequences.  be careful of what decisions you make, and don't whine about the consequences afterwards.<br>

incidentally, i had nothing to do with waking the sleeper.  i'm not in caer cadarn.  not that it matters though, i could have seen myself doing it under certain circumstances.<br>

In all seriousness, i dont care what i end up doing as long as its entertaining.  Boring things like camping for epic i think is pretty damn gay.  I do not like thinking I have to get on at some weird time just to see if some mob has spawned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubakxs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakxs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/17/02 5:29:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1194.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Damn jus' noticed something...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This IS what this part of the board is for. /bonk<br>

P.S.  Takkle...  you don't have to get on at a weird time to check for an epic mob spawn--all you do is stay on 24/7.  =P  <br>
