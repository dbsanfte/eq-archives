<br>
Solve the problem. Don't delay it, don't appease it temporarily. Make a plan that is realistic that will solve your problem permanantly, then execute that plan.<br>
<br>
I don't think being drunk while at work will solve your problems. It might feel like they're farther away for a little while but it won't stop them from being there the next day.<br>
<br>
You're a parent. Do you really want your child growing in the shadow of someone who's solution is alcohol? Even if you're raising one hell of a little monster, the kid deserves a mother who's going to try a little bit harder than getting &quot;toasty&quot; at work, don't you think?<br>
<br>
When your kid's older and the kid starts making your life hell, are you just going to get &quot;toasty&quot; at home so that you don't recognize you have problems?<br>
<br>
If you're strong enough to still be alive and a single mom, then you're strong enough to get past this work problem too. Just buckle down, get a plan, and start busting your ass to improve your life and the life your little brat has too.<br>
<br>
Last suggestion for you: if you have someone you can talk to, who's life isn't in shambles, maybe they can give better advice than random people on the message board for a video game? Maybe there's some sort of family planning clinic or government advisement office you can visit and get some ideas if all you can come up with is booze, I dunno, not a situation I'll ever wind up in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bouncerlunarx>Bouncer LunarX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/3/03 2:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1916.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> All of Saalron's points are valid and realistic.

I walked away from a &quot;great job&quot; last year because it was making me batshit and a real piece of shit to be married to.

<br>
Having said that, the economy is a big stinking pile of poo. Start saving as much money as you possibly can for a nest egg, and start slamming out those resumes.<br>
<br>
If work gets to the point where you just HAVE to go, you have your nest egg. But in the meantime, resumes, constantly, no excuse for not getting them out at least on a weekly basis.<br>
<br>
This is your life. In 20, 30, 40 years, do you really want to look back and say &quot;well, I hung in there for five years, even though I hated every fucking moment of it and made my kid's life hell?&quot; I doubt it.<br>
<br>
The situation sucks, but you already know what you gotta do. The bottle ain't it, as much fun as it may be to fantasize about it. (And vodka &gt; Everclear. With vodka you at least have a chance of making it through the day. One extra twitch or two of Everclear and you're wrapped around a telephone pole at lunchtime.) <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz_toon.gif" height="104" width="390" alt="stats" border=0></a>

Look at your finances, and decide if you can live off of your current assets for a substantial enough period of time to quit and get another job.  If you can, then just quit.  If you can't, then start looking for another job while maintaining your current employment.  It is always easier to find employment when employed, kinda like dating, when unemployed/single you are perceived as damaged goods.<br>
<br>
When I graduated from college, I chose to pursue a horrendously stressful job in which I made a lot of money (Investment banking, complete with 120+ hour work weeks, showers in the office, and sleeping under your desk if you were lucky, not sleeping at all if you were unlucky).  Basically, I decided it would be better to work my ass off for a short time and be miserable but finish up early and have enough money so I was financially independent.  This is one school of thought.  The other is to find a lower paying job that you actually enjoy and can do throughout most of your life.  Only you can decide what is best for you.<br>
<br>
However, if it's not the nature of the job/profession itself, and rather is just because the person you work for is particularly unpleasant, then you just need to find a comparable position in another company.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you know that no drugs/alcohol will make the problem better and are just blowing off some steam.<br>
<br>
While drugs in your coffee will not solve the problem, perhaps drugs in your boss's coffee could substantially improve your working environment.<br>

Don't drink on the job, don't do drugs.  Neither of these will solve any problems, nor provide a stable life for your child.  I don't know what industry you work in, but you run the risk of getting fired and losing everything you have worked for.<br>
<br>
Find other ways to deal with the stress.  Solve the problem, don't mask it with a superficial, temporary fix.  There are many proven methods to reduce or control stress out there, use one of them.<br>
<br>

<br>
However it is the general tone that seems unforgiving.<br>
Yeah Ammerique is having a hard time, and getting pished at work is not the answer. Nor is doing drugs. Hell do that shit when you are happy otherwise it will just make life worse and even more depressing.<br>
<br>
Amerique, as much as I hate to do it I'm gonna quote Rathic<br>
in saying *Rolling over and dying is no thx*<br>
<br>
Only one person can help you initially, and that person is you.<br>
Good luck to ya lassie.<br>

Only one person can help initialy. That is you. But my guess is if you take some inital steps to get out there are alot of people that can help. One of the ways I found that helped was finding another single mom to live with. It helped having someone else in the house that allowed me to go to the grocery store alone. We traded off babysitting for each others kids so we could date. The help she was able to provide with finaces made it possible to take a job with a slight pay cut. Anyway we have all said it, even Rathic in his incredably insensitive way; start helping yourself because if you don't you are damaging your kids. Any parrent probably begins to understand how child abuse can happen, but I have to say I got to close to understanding than I am comfortable with. I hope I would have never crossed that line if I stayed in that situation. In honesty though, I don't know. I do know if I added drugs or alcohol into that mix I probably would have. Good luck and sorry for the lectures. <br>
