<br>
Now that i recently discovered VCC i've read a LOT of posts and i've come to undertand that 99% of all posts are complaints. Most of them with merit of course, but my question is, how does complaining on a Msg Board fix the problem? You all go on and on and on about how &quot;newbs&quot; act and how you hate it. Here's a small idea, how about instead of complaining on a msg board that most of those &quot;newbs&quot; have never even heard about, you send them a /tell and you DIRECTLY tell them what they do that bothers you. Maybe i'm insane, but i think most of them would listen, or worst case, i sure as hell would. I don't want everyone on Vaz to hate me ( even though writing this may do just that ) and i don't even know about it. If someone hadn't told me about VCC i would have NEVER known that people we're angry about my spamming. If someone had sent me a tell i would have stopped instantly, no questions asked, like i did when this nice player told me i was in trouble with &quot;Anika&quot; someone else i had never heard of.<br>
<br>
Once again, maybe this is just false hopes, but i always thought of EQ as a community thing. Where we sort of work together and teach one another. Those &quot;newbs&quot; will never learn how to not be &quot;newbs&quot; if you smart, long term, veterans don't teach them what you know.<br>
<br>
I've been on Vazaelle for about a year now and i'm still dummer than shit when it comes to EQ. I have no problem admiting it, and i hope by doing so, it will get people to show me around. And by dummer than shit i don't mean i don't know the basics, I consider myself a good cleric ( call it cockey or w/e ), i mean using hot keys isn't hard at all. But i need people to teach me more, you know show me around, say Do's and Dont's, and a lot more.<br>
<br>
Some of you will try to say its because i'm new age and didn't do it the hard way, but i did, Oasis, Loio, OT, DL track ( with the hell lvls ) just like most of you people did. Yet i still only know how to be a Cleric! Now i want to know how to be a Member of our community that is Vazaelle, cause i don't want anyone angry at me.<br>
<br>
Until the day you folks that know what the hell they are doing spread your knowledge there is ALWAYS going to be a huge # of n0000bs. I know spreding will never get rid of all of it, especially because a lot of asshole's will just think your being mean for telling them how to play, but i know that i would clean up my act. If someone in the bazaar had told me /auctioning was considered spamming i would have stopped on the spot.<br>
<br>
I don't know, i'm probably being stupid for hoping you all will even give a shit, but i think it needed to be said. Plus worst case i can go back to Prexus. *shudder <br>
<br>
I am the first, and hopefully not the last, person to realize he's ignorant when it comes to EQ. But just wants and asked for a little help in becoming smart when it comes to EQ.<br>

&quot;I am so and so class, and I think I know how to play it,&quot; is an answer I have received all to many times.  After a time, you get frustrated with the resentment that develops from trying to be helpful.<br>
<br>
No, as much of a bitch as I am on the boards, in game I am usually a pretty sweet person.  When I offer advice, I usually try to phrase it in the least assertive manner possible.  Still doesnt work, it almost seems as if people are insecure about their abilities.<br>
<br>
You know what I think the single most useful attribute to possess as a player is?  The ability to take constructive criticism, to seek it out even.  Hell, I even took criticism offered in negative terms, if it somehow led to me being a better player.<br>

You want to know something, lots of the ones who say STFU are veteran EQ players on alts who think they know everything and also are most likely 15 to 18 years old.  I actually think Vaz is a good server, as good as any that is and would suggest you leave only if you have serious problems with a few people.<br>

And yes, this is the rant and flame section but geez, give people a touch of respect and common decency.  He made a post suggesting things to help, he did not flame anyone and WHAM first reply is a scorching retort with no merit.  Oh well, go ahead and do the same to me because I really don't care, I play the game for my enjoyment and to talk to great friends I have made here, not to rip into newbs who are just trying to learn.<br>

I guess, in retrospect, that if you didn't comprehend the true nature of VCC R&amp;F, it was also highly probable that my post would be similarly misinterpreted.<br>
<br>
We don't live in a Care Bear world.  We do not email Hallmark Cards here; this is an open forum to discuss a multitude of topics and vent steam, with very few rules and zero moderator ass-kissing.  I wouldn't change any aspect of this forum, and especially not for someone who clearly does not comprehend its true nature.<br>
<br>
This forum is moderated by probably the most level headed, fair, open, not-obsessed-with-false-power person I have ever seen.  It allows us to communicate thoughts, opinions, and frustrations unlike any other place I know.  Don't like it?

Don't shout to sell things in the bazaar that can be found on the search for cheaper.  People find this annoying because if we want an item we'll search for it.  Finally, don't complain when you don't sell stuff cause your prices are too high.  No one likes complaining.<br>
<br>
And, in my opinion, people don't offer advice cause they feel like they shouldn't need to.  No one had to tell me it was shameless to ask for free gear and 'pp for spells.'  It'll just take up more time.  Venting here with other people who know what you're talking about is much funner than trying to convince the person of their newbness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1914<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/1/02 1:04:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1501.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Evil Booblet</span><hr size=1> Indicative of the decay of the EQ society, someone needs to be told they are annoying by spamming a zone with redundant tripe.<br>

It means nothing if a good player has end game gear at level 60 with a ton of AA, or if they have a brand new account. Look at KB and see what IV is doing. They weren't newbies on the day it opened and their velocity has made their position a strong one.<br>

It means nothing if a newbie has end game gear at level 60 with a ton of AA, or if they have a brand new account. Look at people who purchase their characters at 60. The majority of the time, 3 months after they assume control of the character, that character will be in roughly the same condition, or worse. Their velocity didn't give them progress.<br>
<br>
The problem here is that veterans should not have to teach people to want to become better players. In the real world, I supervise a lot of people. I don't try and teach people ambition or work ethic. I simply promote and aid those who already have it and make friends with them. Then I demote and fire the newbies. Someday, after being fired from enough jobs, they will light on fire and grow ambition.<br>

Damn I see your point of view clear as day.  Not sure why people think you are an asshole if you are stating facts.  To make the point crystal clear I will try to eloborate.  Tell me if I am wrong here.  I high end guild doing NTOV does not want a level 60 with diapers.  I expect that before I apply for a position I be somewhat qualified.  This game involves knowledge and in my experience if you are seeking it you can find it.  For example read up on a fucking zone before going there.  Make sure you know how to get there.  Do not get a party killed is the bottom line.  This game is about time and people don't want to waste it especially in the end game.  I know that everyone has an agenda, but to complete high end mobs you need to have an ability to complete the mission with the least amount of fuck ups.  This is the main point it is a rat race and peoples time.  Being lost in the end game is really no thanks.  Some people don't like it if you tell hey dickhead get your shit together, however that is the way things get done.  I for one agree with the philosophy of people like Akethadar and Saalron.  They get the job done and do it well.  Have knowledge of the game and make things happen.  No wanna wants to babysit a huge CR.  People are here to get things accomplished with the time they got not teach a game that they put time into to learn.  Please experience the differant zones than come back and ask questions.  I think Saalron said it best when he did the coldain ring quest.  Experience shit for yourself and live a little.  If you die you will learn lots, but don't do it on the account of other people.  Bottom line is you can do much with exploration and insight.  Just my 2 cents flame it if you want!!!!<br>

<br>
Almost but not quite. There are many times where 1 person, paying attention, knowing what to do, can take a wipeout and turn it into success.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
You zone into fear planning to break on the west wall with 3 teams. Someone makes a wrong turn and is approaching the camp with a train. At this point, a melee should charge that person and run through the train, sucking it back away from the camp. Probably using their dodge-all disc and sitting to get aggro. Then they should start to kite in a tight circle. The camp can harmony and peel mobs out of the train. If you have a monk, rogue, or warrior, who is not the main assist, this is what should happen if someone screws up, and they should be watching for it. Could also happen in WW with some big drake or whatever.<br>
<br>
Step 1 is getting to the point where you aren't a negative impact on the raid. But after that, it's time to explore every way in which you can make the raid more successful, speedy, and fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukahel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kahel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/1/02 2:29:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1501.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: almost</span><hr size=1> In every post Saalron point has always been simple:<br>

<br>
But there's a fine line between spanking and child abuse. When you start seeing bruising, bleeding, and broken bones that's child abuse and you should be sent to jail and your kids taken away. You don't punch a kid in the face, or kick them in the ribs. That ain't spanking.<br>
<br>
My parents spanked me when I did something pretty bad - which was super rare, because I knew the consequences. Sending them to their room works, IF it's a punishment. If they've got a TV or computer in there, I'd say that their room is not a real good place to take the timeout. Maybe your room would be better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I may have done my fair share, hell, more than my fair share of bad illegal things.  But I tell you one thing, I respect my parents.  I dont backtalk, raise a hand, or disrespect them in any way.<br>
<br>
I wont ever have children for many reasons, but one of them being with modern day laws you cant properly discipline your children without threat of legal repercussions.<br>
