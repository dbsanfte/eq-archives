Is that was this was all about? <br>

You didn't feel like you were getting the attention you deserved?  So you fucked over everyone in the guild, even those who were nice to you?<br>
<br>
Sorry but I just think that's funny......<br>
<br>
And I dunno about harassment, I haven't played in 4 weeks, Keleios has a small mana pool compared to the others clerics and hmm, maybe 20 AA points and Akethadar is never rude to me nor does he harass me about it, and I speak to him everyday on AIM......<br>

But then again I don't steal from the guild or jump up and down looking for the &quot;attention I think I deserve&quot; when I do log in.<br>

<br>
Why?  Cuz I call a shit a shit.  And the other officers all have this &quot;Humanity&quot; thing that makes them want to find the best in little fuckwads like Forse, and there was nothing in this one to find.<br>
<br>
Because i told you that if it was up to me, you wouldnt be guilded any more?  That why you did it Forse?  Cuz you dont have the motherfucking balls to bring anything to the person that pisses you off so you strike blindly like a drowning tard looking for something to keep it afloat?  <br>
<br>
Or maybe it was with your bullshit about the Warrior Strike?  (For those of you who arent aware, the PO warriors threatened to STRIKE! if we didnt go back to NToV and stop doing AoW and Luclin content).  Funny thing you were the only one i ever heard that from.. as for the other warriors being &quot;afraid&quot; of me, i call bullshit on that too, as most of them send me plenty of tells bitching about shit, but that wasnt one of them.<br>
<br>
Did i bitch about your HP?  Fuck yes i did, you joined the guild and then disappeared you little cack.  Every other warrior in the guild had nd3 and ae taunt (everyone that logged in and mattered anyway) and you didnt even have ND1 you worthless fuck.  Then you bitch to me about your motherfucking hp, fuck you.<br>
<br>
As for the guild being bent, and this little lesson you taught us.  The only lesson you taught those 45 people that log in every fucking day is &quot;no matter how hard you work for something, and no matter how hard you push, a cocksucking little fag that doesnt no jack shit and isnt even worth his mother's love can waltz in and fuck you up the ass like a catholic schoolboy.&quot;  Great lesson fucktard.<br>
<br>
As for what i think of you, that hasnt changed, and yeah.. i always told you.  YOU ARE A WORTHLESS FUCK (oops.. raidmode...sorry Baps).  <br>

I might have even given you the prod but you lllustraded what a cocklover you were.  <br>
<br>
 Even when you made it public on the EA boards you appologized to me and kissed my ass because at the time you were applying to EA andyou know you had no fucking chance in getting in because you pissed off 3 members that night.  Even when you did apply i wrote you were a piece of shit cuz i knew your appology was a crock of Armadillo shit and i saw thru that.  Too bad you thought we were actually cool and sent me tells.. only reason i didt tell you to fuck off for months to come is cuz i didnt want to deal with a fag like you. <br>

 You were always a gimp ass fag no matter what you did and i cant beleive PO wasted their time on you.  You have a rep of being a gimp peice of shit so i feel sorry for anyone who buys your acct.  fag<br>

Maybe getting out of the game was a good thing for you sir… because the need for emotional or other types of attention in a game from people you don’t even know irl is just pathetic. Also the need for sympathy due to what, people ‘harassing’ you is jus lame glad the game jus fell short of a person like you (good riddance)… does the remaining people in game a drastic favor. I mean c’mon ever heard of “JOKING”…<br>
<br>
You were slick enough to hide behind an illusion and have people think you’re all cool and shit, but you know what? it was just a matter of time till people saw you for what you are worth. And I’m so fricking glad to be around to see your identity unfolded =p<br>

Bullshit.  If you actually believe this stuff is true Forse, then you have a problem dude.  I honestly dont think you are dillusional or stupid, but this story you have about how you were mistreated somehow is pretty nuts.<br>

There I stood in the PO boards giving you the fucking benefit of the doubt and defending you.  I see your name on the active logins as the argument goes down, and you ignore the posts?  Clearly some people cared enough, and you just ignored that fact.  As Dariath said, there were many people upset you hadn't received a BoC yet, the times never seemed to hit right for you.  Just think about this.  Ake clearly didn't care, he doesn't give a flying fuck about the pieces of shit that seem to float to the top.  You clearly didn't hurt him at all, you hurt those that actually gave a shit about you, that's just fucked.<br>
<br>
I still can't believe this fucking shit.  What the hell were you thinking?!? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usiggymk5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SiggyMk5</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Led Ezra</span><br>  Posts: 2445<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/16/02 12:31:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1717.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.in-your-ear.net/rejkid.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a warning</span><hr size=1> *popcorn* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uherdervazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerderVazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 2023<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/16/02 12:41:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1717.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What a fugging ass</span><hr size=1> Unbefuckingleviable.<br>
