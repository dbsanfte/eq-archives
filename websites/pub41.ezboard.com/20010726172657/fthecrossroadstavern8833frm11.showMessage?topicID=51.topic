I just hate it when a person gives their word then goes back on it. It not only proves poorly on them but for their guild as well. Greed can be overwhelming with this game but serves no one in the long run. To the person that did this I have this to say...how are your actions today in game a mirror for your real life , think about it. <p><P><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Lalanu Soulhealer<br> </strong></font></center>

&quot;Sure&quot;<br>
<br>
that was the extent of the conversation... he said that cuz he didnt know i could get mine if we just extended the camp a little... then he sent a tell about it and you flipped<br>
<br>
your the cleric that we got the ixiblat sceptor for when you asked us too... we had other things to do that day but we did it anyways... then you wanted to camp rage, and even though you knew we were going for him later that week you enlisted the help of someone else to try unsuccesfully to get him for like 2 or 3 days...we didnt come to a message board and whine<br>
<br>
now we killed naggy and you say we are being greedy for wanting to finish 2 epics? if he had realized we could do both he wouldnt have said &quot;sure&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Can i have rage camp after you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure&quot;<br>
<br>
That right there is good enough to have someones word. Someones word defines that person I believe in this everywhere I go. I also do believe in second chances though. I know set person and set guild did this without the knowledge of the other person that they had ready, but that should not be any reason to go back on your word to any friend that you had/have.<br>
<br>
&quot;** edit : you can still have the camp when we are done&quot; <br>
<br>
That right there is a very nice thing to do in my opinion.<br>
<br>
*Lalanu's whole flame*<br>
<br>
Lal you should not have posted this in my opinion, these people are nice people and wish to most likely help you in anyway, posting a flame about them was wrong, I do hope you see that after Neverbee's post<br>
<br>
*Kaejz whole flame*<br>
<br>
How dare you post something like that lol god that whole phrase is just horrible it makes it seem like you are coming after Lalanu. First off A) She did not mention ANY names under respect and you come after her with something like that it is EXTREMELY rude sir. <br>
<br>
&quot;If it wasn't for this person, you wouldn't have had our help getting to this step. Is this the gratitude the person gets for helping you out?&quot;<br>
<br>
Think about that quote sir. I am sure if you did not help Lal she could have found someone else to help in someway. Using something like that against something shows a lot of weakness in a person.<br>
<br>
Lastly I would like to state it was wrong of set guild to go back and their word, but in turn it was wrong for Lalanu to post this. This whole ordeal is just wrong. I hope you all can fix these problems and become friends again. I am not taking any sides here I really do enjoy the presence of both sides of this being set guild and Lal. Ok that is it I am done, I hope no one takes offense to this post I tried to not post anything real rude I hope =). Now lets all be happy ok =). <p><IMG SRC="http://www.iland.net/~jewell/typhon.jpg">

<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Can i have rage camp after you?&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Sure&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; if he had realized we could do both he wouldnt have said &quot;sure&quot;<br>
<br>
-- That would constitute a single person, not 'any perhaps that can come along'.  Maybe better wording should have been, &quot;let me see if anyone else in the guild needs him first.&quot;<br>
<br>
Have you ever waiting for a camp to play at waiting for a guild to finish, but they say sorry, but were going to keep rotating without you no matter how long you've been here.  Wouldn't the kind generous thing to give them the fair chance especially if it was implied that they would get that chance? From your post Neverbee, you do accept that there was that implication.  Nothing will come of it either way.  <br>
<br>
Just hope you remember how you treat others when you are treated the same in the future.  Don't take that as a threat from me, hell I'm only a level 14 Enchanter on the Server.  I have no idea who any of you are, nor do I care.<br>
<br>
Now you'll come back and say, &quot;what do you know! you don't know anything &lt;throw in various insults here&gt;&quot;, or you can reflect on whats said, and the situation and look at other pespectives and plan on future courses.  Whichever path that it leads you to: best of luck.<br>

It applies to me because Subo and some other ID's are my friends and have been for a while, Lalanu is also my friend. A while back Lalanu and you guys were supposedly friends (why else would ya help her). I don't like seeing my friends fight, that is how it applies to me. <br>

Frankly, it's none of my concern; however, Lalanu *is* a concern of mine.  We've known each other, and grouped with each other, for over 55 levels and two years.  She's my friend, my sister, my confidante.  She is also caring, giving, and follows the KCoH (uhmm...that's Knights Code of Honour in case none of you are aware) more closely than so many I have seen both on Zeb and the Rathe.  There's been many a time (at least weekly, but usually more often) that Lalanu spends time in newbie zones buffing and healing.  There's nights and days of her running (no, not getting ports, but actually running across the zones and taking the boats) across Norrath to rez's that poor soul who lost 3 bubs of xps, or was bound hours' travel away.  She spends a hellava lot of time helping others.  The way I can tell this is that at one time, she was 3 levels above me; now, however, I'm 4 levels above her.  And that's a hell of alot of time at levels 55 and 59.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Lala shouldn't have posted, but she saw a promise (perhaps it wasn't meant that way) that was broken, and she has been waiting a very long time to get into this last camp for her epic.  She has gone thru much to get this far, with no large guild behind her every step of the way like alot of us have.  She's counted on her friends and family.<br>
<br>
I beseech you all to cease this flame...please.  It is only hurting people...namely, Lalanu and whomever she was speaking of.<br>
