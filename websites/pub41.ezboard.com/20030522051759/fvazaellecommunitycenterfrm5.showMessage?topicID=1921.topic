<br>
Our meager group of four had been crawling to Orem Wavecrasher in the BoT and my thoughts were of whether or not we could do it.  To my surprise we had an exceptional group and were rolling along destroying all in our path with impunity.<br>
<br>
As we rounded the corner to Orem we saw his four bodyguards... a quick scoot in to the left, we engaged the first one and he went down with a thud.  It had taken a while to get there but we were feeling pretty good.  We owned that room and were down to our final two.  I was excited as we engaged the last two... Orem was pacified and his buddy was now our pet... time to drop Orem.<br>
<br>
Engagement and initial success as we had his high HP down 10 percent. All were healthy and mana was plentiful when a very large (30 or so) group of Appotus Dominus (sp) arrived at the entrance to the room.  My initial reaction was one of pleasure as I thought they would think our little group of four was rather mighty for being able to take down Orem.<br>
<br>
The horde, rather than watching, jumped in at full force and started to beat Orem.  I was shocked and our group began to /say  /ooc that he was ours and we were engaged in battle.  All this went unheeded and we were even mocked by one member who answered yes to our &quot;are you ksing our mob&quot; question.  Needless to say Orem was down in a flash, looted (they left the ring, how generous) and they were gone in an instant.  <br>
<br>
We were in shock and angered .... for the first time ever, I was more angry than I have ever been at an act.  I even petitioned what they had done only to be told by my group and others in the zone that I was wasting my time.  They said that AD has done this before and nothing was done.<br>
<br>
I sent a tell to Dapper who I was advised is GL er of AD, my /tell was ignored.  /oocs complaining were generally ignored and my petition was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
My comments here are directed to the guild and it's act, and not at any individuals as I have many great and noble friends in AD like Justwysper (and others). <br>
<br>
I simply post this to express my extreme disappointment that such things like this happen.  I know they are indeed a mighty guild, but the actions of AD that day were inexcusable and reeked of greed and disrespect.  You could have let our frail group finish our kill and go zerg other mobs.  After all the rules state that when a mob is purposefully engaged by a group, it is their mob until they die, yell for help or leave. We were in GREAT shape and he was ours.<br>
<br>
Again, to my friends in AD, I am not angered with you individually but rather at the actions your guild took.<br>
<br>
Be well friends.<br>
<br>

Dapper, I hope to see your apology here.  Ganking a mob from xp group is one of the worst things a guild can do.  This just sucks bad. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=376166">Raiya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>People say AD can't compete, and maybe that is because we have some moralle issues, mobilization issues, buffing issues, or whatever. People can think this. One thing that I have learned from Valon, Sithka, Nisk, Jermz, and many other people is that EQ is for the TAKING and not to show any remource. This means whether its a guild of 40 going after a mob that have cleared the way, or a group of 6 that are working towards a named mob in BoT, the correct action is just to TAKE what we want.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
So who's telling the truth here?<br>
<br>
Robaz posted that you guys were engaging the named while AD there and ganked it from you.<br>
<br>
Now, Kerai posted the xp group wiped.  So did you wipe or you didn't wipe.  Cuz if you wiped, it's a free game, there's nothing you can complain about.  But if you didn't wipe, AD just walked up and killed it while you were on it then that's KS.  So, anyone would like to tell the truth here?  The truth is going to have a big effect on how I will treat AD members in the future. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=376166">Raiya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

In one of the threads here AD members claimed they had class. That was my opinion of them also when I still played on Vaz. They could provide healthy competition without arguing, without griefing.<br>
<br>
Ah well, of course I don't know what really happened here. There's many good people in AD, regardless of what happened. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26345">Merrahar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
