The addage of The toes you step on today may be connected to the ass you kiss tomorrow always applies.  It's often better to work things out rather than run headlong through them.<br>
<br>
That being said, there needs to  be some kind of Happy Medium.  Avaran knows he gets an invite the next time OoH does PoG ... but there still needs to be some kind of limit on the time people wait for an event to occur.  Waiting 10-15 minutes for them to port around was acceptable.  Waiting 30-60 minutes was just excessive.  Especially because it'll be up again and it's not a one time deal.  It's just a delay.  That is sort of why we didnt just engage.  We realized it'd be up again.  <br>
<br>
Spook .. thanks for the kind words.  I dont know if you're still deployed with Operation Enduring Freedom, but if you are, stay safe!  If not .. look me up in game some time under either Rex or Kham.<br>
<br>
There have really only been a few instances where we've come up with this kind of situation.  Once was in PoG .. but that was settled when the other guild that claimed to have the Plane wiped 3x in a row and decided to move on.  Part of me wants to be diplomatic and work it out like VSR.  But the native New Yorker in me wants to just do what i gotta do and move on.  <br>
<br>
I also dont want to get the rep of being a wuss and letting other guilds think they can just roll up on us and take what we're staging for.  I'd be super pissed if we staged for Trak (which would probably be a bit longer than say CiW, DH, or COP for example), then all of a sudden have Douche_Bag_Guild_001 walk up be buffed and take it.  <br>
<br>
Anyway .. it's over and done with, just looking for the community views.  <br>

My question is this though.  What if the mob you were after didn't always drop 2 stones .. what if it were 1 stone, always?  You would have come up, after prepping your group, ready to go, and found a couple people there who were NOT ready to go.  So what do you do?  I hear a lot of people tossing out time frames .. 15 min, 30 min.. So let's say you waited 30 min, they still aren't ready, and you KNOW only one of you is going to get a stone.  Do you go?  Or do you tell your groups to stand down, that you weren't there first, and sorry for wasting peoples' time?<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned that FCFS should work even if there is only one person at the spawn .. that first is first.  So guild A sends ONE person to EVERY uber mob area and claims the spawn, while the rest of the guild takes down one mob at a time.  Should this work, because there is SOMEONE there &quot;holding the spawn&quot; until the proper forces arrive?<br>
<br>
It definately is a gray issue, but since you are asking for PERSONAL opinions, here's mine.  If you're at a mob, take it.  If someone else comes up on a mob and is gtg and can take it, then they should.  People might complain that &quot;they need time to buff/prep&quot; .. but you must realize, the other group needs to do that as well.  If they are already past that stage, they are better prepared / more efficient / whatever, and that just shows the initial group needs to work on their tactics.  I think that's what makes this server fun.  It's not always a race to every mob, but sometimes it happens.  So what?  It gets your heart going when you're rushing to do something.  You're asking yourself, &quot;We could really use another 20 minutes to buff, but during that 20 minutes, the other guys might kill it.  So should we rush it now, when we are sorta ready, and risk a wipeout?&quot;  I think that's great!  <br>
<br>
There should never be a cut and dry calendar or anything, because there will always be faults in the system.  Get to know your guild members / friends, what they are capable of, how quickly you can mobilize, and get what you need to do done!  Acting like this doesn't always mean you're the bad guy.  It doesn't mean you're out to screw everyone, or will never help other people.  This is in no way a talk about specific guilds, or a defense of mine .. I'm just saying that in general on EVERY server, there is animosity for the powerful people who have the most control, but if you don't fly off the handle when a situation like this arises, sometimes it can be worked out.  The 5 people sitting at VSR could have freaked and cussed Rexron out .. which may have driven him and his friends to say, &quot;Screw this, they are being asses, let's take this thing down.&quot;  And then there would be a post on here about how the Order of Hasson were a bunch of assholes and they jumped a spawn, etc etc etc .. which totally isn't the case at all.  Relate that to any other guild interaction that you will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HTML>

I know the situation and saw the log.<br>
As to commenting on /ooc. A lot of time people who don't want spam while in battle or preparing for it, turn off public channels. So you can't always expect them to respond. I'd recommend checking what high level group is there and sending them personal tells. <br>
Also:<br>
There were 3 people there.<br>
1 Level 56+ cleric, 1 level 56 Ranger, 1 level 60 Warrior. They were waiting for 3 other people who were one zone away when this happened. <br>
And you were not completely nice, a few indescent things were said.<br>
<br>
Just clearing up the story. <br>
<br>
I'm not gonna comment to who did the right thing - I was just giving the right facts.<br>

<br>
If you'd like, I can post my log to show what was and wasnt said in both /ooc, /shout, /gu, /tell, and /gsay.  Not once was anything indecent said about anyone.  The only potentially disparaging remark was made by me when I said it was "bullshit" that after however long of forming up at the zone, and us moving in, all of a sudden it's camped.<br>
<br>
Lufor .. i agree.<br>
<br>
If there was only 1 stone .. we could have /rand to see who got it.  We could have just all engaged and whoever got the exp or got to it first got it.  We could have just waited for them to engage and see if they were able to take it (chances are yes, it's not like it's a hard mob to kill).<br>
<br>
As more guilds become capable of actually doing things, this will become more of an issue.  I remember talking about this when the server first opened up.  At that time, it was really only KEG, CIW, SotS and maybe 2-3 other "smaller" big guilds that were capable like YH, COP, DBN.  Now as other guilds merge, recruit, or just grow, it's more and more common to happen.<br>
<br>
Long story short, cant please everyone.  We do our best. <p><b>...I chose my own fate. Drove by the fork in the road and went straight!<BR></b><body bgcolor="#000000">

I think at first we were all a bit hot under the collar, but then Avelynne from OoH contacted me and we were able to discuss how to handle the situation.  Kudos to her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And, for myself, it was the first time I was put in a position like this to negotiate with another guild at this level.  Rul was busy with getting his support team in place and the responsibility fell to me.<br>
<br>
I hope that now when things are all said and done we look back and are all proud of ourselves for *not* letting the situation degenerate into a fight.  That would not have served either guild well here.<br>

I don't mean to beat a dead horse but...it would really help me in the future to know what the majority think about FCFS, and an acceptable time limit to wait before ganking a mob.<br>
<br>
As I have said earlier, a group should be no more than 15 minutes away from just about anywhere in Norrath.  To me, that does not include buff time.  <br>
<br>
If you got a force together, getting ready to take a mob, that is capable, but not buffed and another force, that is equal in capability, but is buffed comes in, do they have a right to take the mob.  I say no, FCFS is FCFS.  However, the 1st force should only have so much time to buff and prepare.  <br>
<br>
I spose we could just say each situation will be different, and that it will depend on the prep time needed for the specific mob.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Those that are respected and act with good concience toward others are more apt to be respected at any given spawn.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are always those out there that are apt to make any excuse that they can to leapfrog someone else.  These guilds do in turn receive no respect at a contested spawn, as they have shown none in the past.<br>
<br>
It is the way things go.  FCFS means different things in different situations when dealing with different people.  It is completely subjective.<br>
<br>
FCFS means something different when dealing with Sev than when dealing with Rage.  It means something different when dealing with Zlandicar than when dealing with Trak.<br>
<br>
In every situation it is necessary to take into account everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessageRange?topicID=631.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=642.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=630.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=631.topic&index=35><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.emailToFriend?topicID=631.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.threadControl?topicID=631.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=631.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=631.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm39">GUILDS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">Flame Forum<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm34">Bottom Feeders<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm35">Camelot Connections<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm37">Beastlord's Scratching Post<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm36">Moderators/Admins<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Admins Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F4CC10>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#F4CC10> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8>The Tavern</a> <font color=#F4CC10> - </font><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/">Zebu's Zanadu!</a><font color=#F4CC10> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
