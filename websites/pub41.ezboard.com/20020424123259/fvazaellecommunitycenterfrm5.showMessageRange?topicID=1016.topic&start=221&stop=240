And to be a nice guy, I'll even explain how some of these things work, no charge<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Bind Wound Past 50%<br>
Using this trick, you can solo a non-healing class easily! You can even go up to 100%. If you're one of those high level melees with a bind wound cap of 75%, I'll show you how to go over that cap as well. Any class/race can do this. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, this is a no brainer. Take off all your hp items, then bind to 50% then put them on and they give you hp so you wind up being over 50%. Mildly useful to a soloing melee in the 20s-30s when you can start a fight at 70% and win.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Full Health when zoning<br>
That's right. Zoning is like a complete heal! Any class/race can do this. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
If you have enough dots or damage to 'die while zoning' then when you pop through on the other side, you are stripped of all icons and placed at 25% of your life + whatever % of your life you gain from hp items. Not super useful unless you're a low level twink or you will actually die from a dot but would rather not die.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Run Faster<br>
You will run faster than ever before! This works with normal running, walking, SoW, Bard Song, encumbered, sneaking, etc. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. Any class/race can do this.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Strafe while running. Anyone who's played a first person shooter already does this.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Recharge Items<br>
Ever have an item run out of charges? Did you ever want to recharge that Ivandyr's Hoop that has 6 charges of spirit tap? I'll show you how! Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. Any class/race can do this.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Yeah there's a way. I won't explain how but in order to do it, you need 2 copies of the item. If it's a lore item like that hoop, you need a twink with it that you can login quickly where you are. You also need the plat to buy both items from the vendor you just sold them to. I'll leave you to figure the rest out.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Clear Aggro<br>
Better than feign death! It only works in a few zones, but ANY RACE AND CLASS can do this one! The monsters will totally forget you exist. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I have no idea what this one is, if I did, I wouldn't be a monk. All I can figure is outrunning a mob so that it forgets you.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Root + Aggro<br>
How to manage aggro when a mob is rooted. Sound self explanatory? There is probably something you're forgetting when doing this... Rogues and Rangers, pay attention - this one will help you in your next group! Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
If you are level 30 or higher and don't understand this, you need to quit playing eq.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Invis around any player or monster<br>
It doesn't matter if the mob can see-invis - I'll show you how to get by them easily! Get to that sweet spot in your favorite dungeon without having to kill anything, prance around Lord Nagafen, sneak by your friends with see-invis on, this is fun! ANY RACE/CLASS can do this! Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No idea how this works. I think you'd have to be using the level 1 low aggro feature to do this.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Melee Gate<br>
Melee classes can gate? Yup! I'll show you how. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. Any class/race can do this. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Use items that port? Not sure.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
PvP-server plat trick<br>
This is a dirty trick to get you plat on a PvP server. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one, but people are going to hate you! <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No idea.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Plat Scam (all servers)<br>
This is a way to scam people on all servers. I haven't done this one myself because I don't believe in scamming, but it does get /petitioned a lot - and there's nothing a guide can do about it. I know what you're thinking, this is the one where you say, &quot;Give me the plat now I'll give you the item later..&quot;, or some lame scam that involves dropping bags. No. This one works. A lot. And GMs can't do anything about it, although if you're a serious repeat offender they may warn you. Do it with alt characters just to be safe. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Preying on stupid people is easy, but generally you can make a lot more plat, and more quickly, by being a higher level character who knows how to farm<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Fast Casting<br>
Want to cast spells faster? EQ Underground will show you how! Mez, Heal, Nuke, Buff, FASTER than ever! And no, before you guess, this is not using a magician fast-cast focus item :P This stacks with fast-cast focus items! Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one, and all casting classes can do it. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No idea, I hate being a caster<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Keep No-rent items<br>
Oh those nice no-rent items! Quest items, Magician summoned stuff (like the new fast-cast and extra damage bracers!), and neat weapons. Want to keep them forever, even days after you log? I'll show you how! Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. Any class/race can do this. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Leave them on a corpse, duh<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Target Anything in the Zone And Find it<br>
Great for finding rare spawns or players. VERY VERY Few people know about this one. TRACK NOT NEEDED! Absolutely no risk of being banned. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Guildinvite things by their name, one message means they are not in the zone, another message means they are there but you can only invite player characters.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Cast while running<br>
Cast while running? Even fewer people know about this trick. Yes, it takes some skill, but it's possible! Kite without stopping! Absolutely no risk of being banned for this. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Be a bard? I dunno<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Cast through knockback spells<br>
Ever get hit with a knockback spell and get interrupted? It will never happen again after you read this. Absolutely no risk of being banned for this one. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Walk back to where you were knocked from, higher channeling cares about your displacement, not movement total.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Pathing Exploit<br>
Pathing exploits - level your caster faster than you ever dreamed! High risk of being banned for this one, unless you're careful.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Go nuke something and run around and you'll find all the places where Verant was too lazy to make their game work. You should see the clouds of mobs with dots being sung on them as a mid level bard plvls like this. It's humorous.<br>
<br>
<br>
Generally, if you actually try to explore and experiment in EQ, you will learn and get to be a better player. And if not, there's people online who will be happy to sell you info from when they did it.<br>
<br>
Or you could just level up in Loio, OT, DL, KC, Velks and be a stupid fuck like Goanad, either way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=grumms28agony28>Grumms28AGONY28</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/8/02 1:27:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=223>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: laf</span><hr size=1> Another way to target mobs in a zone without tracking is to make a pet and type /pet attack Trak.

<br>
The only bards I've seen do this are the brats in LOIO.  Our ae songs are basically all point blank, and there's not a lot of bards who are willing to put up with judging the distance gap for the sake of ae kiting.  (I've heard about bards who ae the TD raptors, but never seen it done myself.)<br>
<br>
As a high level bard I usually kite by exploiting how Verant has mobs set up to assist each other.  I usually do have a horde of mobs following me when I kite, but generally they are there for charm kiting.  Take a mob as a pet, send it after a similar mob, and basically the target and the target's friends (up to four mobs total, blah) will start beating up my pet.  Same principle can reap...unusual (and bannable) results in places like Western Wastes.  (Or the pod/guard wars that the druids are so fond of.)  At the same time, I think it's kinda in character for mobs to assist each other, so I don't feel too bad about doing it (except in extreme cases like WW and pod, etc.  generally try not to do a lot of that).<br>
<br>
Or go fear kite in the Grey...pathing there is such a joke you don't even have to talk about finding a spot to 'sploit it...basically, anywhere in the zone is good.<br>

Don't be too hard on KC Saalron. That is afterall, one of your favorite &quot;training&quot; grounds.<br>
<br>
I think I have a grand total of 7 hours in Velks...hardly a regular. <br>
<br>
One zone I avoided completely was SolB....because of a fuckwit iskar monk who was the king of purposeful training. <br>
<br>
So, Mr. Assmonkey, you might want to consider that the reason people go outdoors is avoid training ilk like you. <br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

<br>
if your knocked back, then rooted in place (cough tunare cough)  assuming your agro is high enough could you get summoned back or does root prevent that?<br>
<br>
I think typically since agro has alot to do with distance from mob that you are just nocked off the top spot for agro...but I'm just curious, if in theory, it could happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umcnoob69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>McNoob69</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/9/02 4:29:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=235>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This thread has jumped the shark!</span><hr size=1> tunare summoned me once but rooted me directly after i was summoned =p dono <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umojokynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mojokynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 765<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/9/02 7:21:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=236>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This thread has jumped the shark!</span><hr size=1> mobs can only summon every so often (12 seconds or so?)... assuming the knockback would be a proc and the mob is ready to summon he would even if you're rooted... if not he'll run to you (if he hates you enough) =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saalron>Saalron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/9/02 8:22:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=237>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> goanad</span><hr size=1> please list for me the only places you enjoy playing so i can train them enough that you won't log in anymore.<br>

Those mobs in question (Mainly Grieg/Tunare) are immune to the root so its not really an issue. Against normal mobs its actually nice to remind people they should keep max distance.<br>
<br>
I dont know where you people got all l337 insider knowledge from. First of all it took awhile to find out the root proc was lure based and almost unresistable and could actually root big mobs. Then Roggel was using the sword against Lady N and I told him to pack it away. We had an argument about it for fun while we fought and he rooted her a few times doing this which made her breakdance abit. Half those who got hit was afk during the fight anyway.<br>
<br>
Its not like we are too stupid to not use those swords where it counts. You should be albe to draw the conclution from the fact that we already possess those swords to the fact that we are not morons but.....Well maybe we are. If it makes you feel better to think Roggel is a gimp while not knowing him from other places than seeing him Velketors Lab. Go ahead while Roggel have fun killing Tunare, Vyemm, Roy, Creator and bla bla.<br>
