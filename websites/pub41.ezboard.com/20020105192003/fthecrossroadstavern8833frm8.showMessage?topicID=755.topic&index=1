What does a guild really do for you?<br>
<br>
It depends on you and the guild really. Because you have /guildchat and know the members of your guild you tend to group with them when possible. Larger guilds have multi-group raids, usually with a goal in mind.<br>
<br>
If you are happy playing in casual pickup groups you don't really need a guild. If you want to do the more difficult zones and mobs, a guild becomes necessary - there are very few public raids on this server.<br>
<br>
3. Are some guilds better than other?<br>
<br>
It depends what is important to you. Some people like grouping with friends and aren't compelled to try the harder stuff. Some people strive to become uber-if their guild isn't growing more powerful they start to look for one that is.<br>
<br>
2. I know people that are very happy without a guild. This is more common with Luclin and the amount of content that can be accessed with just a group or two.<br>
<br>
At your level you can try guild membership. Don't expect much beyond efforts to organize group activities.<br>
<br>
Having come from E'ci, I felt fortunate that public raids (especially PoH) gave people in small guilds and the guildless a chance to experiance large multi-group raids. As a result, I discovered that I enjoy raids more than any other part of the game and have consistantly sought out raid-capable guilds.<br>

<br>
As far as guilds are concerned, check out Zeb's Zanadu (Link at the top of the main page inthis forum).  There you will see links and info. for various guilds on the server.  You can get a &quot;general&quot; idea about a guild from there and you can see what type of activities are done with guilds.<br>
<br>
At lower levels, you will not do a lot of raiding when you go into a situation with more than 2 groups.  However, it is fun to be in a low level guild to learn how the entire process works.  By the time you are in your 30s, you are finding more and more that requires multiple groups.  Like BB said, it's up to your interests.<br>
<br>
Basically a guild is a formalized organization that is comprised of like minded (for the most part) people who have similar goals and affinity.  If you find a group of guilded people you like, ask about joining.  And don't take &quot;no&quot; personally.  Different guilds have different requirements.  For the most part, all guilds are good. <p><html>

<br>
A guild can provide a network of information and friends to hunt and explore with. A guild can provide entertainment beyond the hack and slash of leveling.  Having a history of being in a guild for a long time can help you establish a solid reputation. People know your guild and over time, know you as a representative of said guild.  You may also want to ask yourself, what can you contribute to a guild? How can you help and where do you see yourself fitting in?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Should I try to find a guild to join, or just remain unassociated and live my life as a regular adventurer?<br>
<br>
I'd say this will depend a lot on you. Levels, experience with the game, desire to roleplay, desire to "beat" the game, are all factors in what you want to do. Why not solo for now, and look at the guilds of people you enjoy grouping with. http://2amstudios.com/eq  has a listing of guilds on Zeb. Through the people you talk to and meet in game, you should be able to find like-minded players to join.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 And my last question for now At least is, are there any guilds that are better than others or would that just be a guild members opinion? <br>
<br>
Again it depends on what you're looking for in a guild. There are LOTS of great guilds on Zeb, but finding the one to fit you takes time, patience, and perserverence. If you're able to specify what you're looking for and for what levels, perhaps more help can be available to your inquiries.<br>

Just a few things cause i am bored at work<br>
<br>
A lot of my guild has been together for 18+ months.  Actually, we were 2 guilds that were together for 18+ months that merged about 6 months ago.  We have helped eachother out in so many ways.  Whether it's questing, raiding, epic work, just grouping, advice, or general green spam :)<br>
<br>
It's good to get into a guild when you are "young".  You have SO much to learn in this game, that you wont do it just by casual grouping and relying on your guild is great for that.  However, some of the guilds that accept younger members or aren't built to last or wont grow with you and your needs.  I got lucky with my 2 guilds (1 really) and got in when I was about level 12 with my 1st char.  <br>
<br>
Guilds have their down sides. Sometimes we disagree on where we're going.  Sometimes, because we're only about 40 mains and of course not EVERYONE is on at once, we may be short a key class (luckily, we have friends who dont mind coming where we go).  Sometimes we want to raid when it's an "exp night" .. shit like that.<br>
<br>
But overall, i like being in a guild and what it offers.  Sometimes my guild gets on my nerves.  Sometimes I get on their nerves.  Some people leave, others join. Some leave, come back and leave again.  The ones that leave i stay friends with.  The ones that come back and leave, i stay friends with.<br>
<br>
Once you get to the 50s, the game changes.  Exp grinds can be done with pickup groups, as I have to 56 with my cleric.  But to gear yourself up, and to have fun at the high end game, you need a guild that's solid.  Whether that's your own guild, or just being good at what you do to be asked to go along with a guild when they go ... you still need them.  <br>
<br>
Some people are good at what they do .. so when a guild does a raid night, they get asked along.  So while they may not be in a guild, or are in a different one, they go along for the ride.  Sometimes they'll get loot, others not.  Mostly you go to have fun, see things you cant see solo, and play the game.<br>
<br>
Play your game .. have fun .. pickup groups, look at guild tags and take note of the guilds that the people you think play well belong to.  Make a friends list, and look for those people and group with them.  Maybe do a hotkey for a /WHO ALL GUILD to see where they are and levels and stuff.<br>
<br>
Some of the bigger guilds dont allow people under say level 50 to join.  My guild, while not big, doesnt allow anyone under 50 to join.  For those who have alts they play when they're in the mood, they have to be /ROLE if they arent 50.  <br>
<br>
Have fun <p><center>

But ya, guilds are there to help each other out in the hard times. Grow strong together, experience new things together. Reach plains unobtainable by just one person. In a guild, you (if not already) will find your best friends in this game. <p><Div align=center><B><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40775>Hybren Orcist</a></B><BR><Div align=center><I>55th Season of Hunt</I><BR><div align=center><I>Outrider of Zeb</I><BR><BR><div align=center><B><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47100>Hyten Orcist</a></B><BR><div align=center><I>41st Season of Heal</I><BR><div align=center><I>Cleric of Tunare</I><BR><BR><div align=center><B><a href=http://www.eq-stone.com>STONE</a></B><BR><div align=center><I>"Rock On!"</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F25><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/urexron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rexron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Pie Guy </span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#F4CC10>(12/26/01 2:09:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Are guilds worth looking into?</span><hr size=1> Hy ... i've found friends in other guilds too :)  Matter of fact.

Why? mostly cuz of what the folks ahead of me posted.. ready-made groups, help with stuff, the chance to ask other guildies for information, the chance to learn from them, etc.<br>
<br>
At lvl 13, you have two options.. <br>
<br>
First: stay unguilded for a while, learn the various guilds and their reputations, figure out which guild's philosophy suits your own and matches what you believe in.  <br>
<br>
then<br>
<br>
Secondly: either guild at lowlevel in a 'starter guild' or one you think will suit you from lvl 13 thru lvl 60.<br>
<br>
Thirdly:  You could also choose to remain unguilded until you are high enuf level to join one of the 'uber' guilds on this server if that is your choice. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53032
