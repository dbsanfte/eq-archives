<br>
rule #1. calender only used for planes and other many group activities, for example chardok royals, pof, poh, pog, pom, poa... but does NOT include dragons (nagafen, vox, serv, trak, kelorek, talendor, gorenaire, any of the WW dragons, yelinak) does NOT include VS, dain frostreaver iv, king tormax, yelinak, phinigul... does NOT include gods, cazic, inny, tunare, bristlebane... all of the latter half are single mobs and should not be &quot;scheduled&quot; but the planes and other multi-group (4 or more) raids should be scheduled so that no one is stepping on anyone elses toes...<br>
you can still post any raid you want to do on the calender, but only the afor mentioned will be respected.<br>
<br>
rule #2. hard  to put this one into words ;P example: slivers has fear this saturday, they cannot schedule another fear raid untill AFTER this saturday... that way no one guild can reserve a plane every saturday for the next month<br>
<br>
rule #3. have a designated guild member be the one who posts on the calender for your guild<br>
<br>
and rule #4. respect the calender<br>
<br>
that's all i can really think of, need some big time feedback, especially from IV, PO, slivers, and agony, and SF<br>
<br>
thanks<br>

I know for my guild we will depend on the calendar to keep track of a mob being up, particularly the two old world dungeon dragons. Maybe a good compromise to that would be posting when a mob was taken DOWN, that way it's easier for guilds to know when to expect the next pop.<br>
<br>
I agree that mobs like Phin shouldn't have to be on the calendar, on my old server you just run down and if Phin is up you can take him out. Dragons are a bit harder than Phin tho. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One thing that would be better too, is putting times on Planes raids with time zones. Not everyone is currently doing this and when scheduling our events, we would rather know what time we should start so that a full pop is available for the next guild's raid. Just my 2cp.<br>

On my old server, it was not uncommon for independents to gather large numbers of friends from all different guilds (and other independents) to kill a dragon.  How would an independent register something?<br>
<br>
Also, I think it makes sense to have the calendar reserve a mob, not a zone.  That way people have a fair chance at a particular mob.  For example, Cazic-Thule is a one week spawn.  The mobs in Fear are 16 hour spawns.  In my opinion, a one week spawn would have reason to be reserved, whereas a 16 hour spawn has less of a reason.<br>
<br>
The way the event calendar was handled on Bristlebane was simple.  Let's say you reserve Fear for next weekend.  That Fear reservation gives you an allotted amount of time to get your raid successfully underway and gave you rights to the god if it was spawned.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2F2F4F><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucaylanvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caylan Vazaelle</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>2</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>3/15/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>12:52:12 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Dragons &amp; times</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I too think dragons should be on the calendar.

<br>
1) Sotae, wow a Prexian hehe didn't know any of us were left(alot of the older server folks are quitting cus they can't be uber anymore cus of the cleric nerf's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...bah twink a druid and call it a night <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
2) Dragons were not included in the Prexian calendar system because they were put on a &quot;rotation&quot; system.  SOtae failed to mention this.  Basically rotations are held by primarily the larger guilds, in Vazaelle's case IV, PO, SF, Slivers, Agony, anyone else I don't know about.  These guilds would &quot;rotate&quot; the spawn (catching on yet?).  Then when a new guild became strong enough to challenge said dragon (or VS/gods) then they would get 2 shots at it, since we all know how bad the 1st run of a raid can go.  If they proved they could effectively handle the bastard then they would be added to the rotation.<br>
<br>
3) Also the calendar system gives only ONE reserve right per guild, meaning, if you have a guild with 300 members all 46+ then you still only get 1 day in said plane.  Also, the calendar allows &quot;alliances&quot; of guilds to only hold one reserve spot, meaning if three smaller guilds form an alliance and want to do a plane or get in the rotation they get only ONE day (hehe get it yet?).<br>
<br>
4) /CHEER...a couple of you have mentioned &quot;what about the independants? This is a question that I have raised recently on the prexus boards (hehe I got shut down quick by the folks who participated in the formation of the calendar cus 1)they think they own the server/game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  2)they think they did a good job on &quot;their&quot; calendar 3)they are uber....ummmm yeah 4)I understand how big of a headache it must have been to look through hundreds of posts about a calendar and it's rules and what not but still....)<br>
<br>
5) Basically independants do not get a spot since it could lead to abuse, and since out of the 3000+ folks that are registered on our board at Prexus can't think of a way to accomodate them...(god knows how I have personally tried), they are left out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps out a bit in the creation of your calendar here on Vazaelle.  I and my roomie have quit playing on Vazaelle and moved back to the other server (hehe) and he has now quit EQ all together.  I play cus I am bored and it's still gonna be a while till SB hits the shelves hehe.<br>

Sechduling dragons and what not is BS.<br>

Rotating is BS.<br>

Independants -  I'd advise that you get yourself a proven record as someone that can lead a pickup raid for the planes ect.  Then by all means be considered as someone that can add an event to the calendar.<br>

<br>
First of all, it's hard to swallow this post given the past.  Sotae, I've enjoyed chatting with you frequently in game.  I think you've got it together.<br>
<br>
That said, SF's officers have complained that the calendar here is unreliable because anyone can post on it.  They went ahead and ran Naggy despite our post.  Granted, there were no conventions established yet, but given that the calendar was on a message board run by an SF member, it's a bit disheartening. <br>
<br>
I also disagree with you dragon scheduling.  For dragons that are truly random spawns (Faydedar comes to mind), first see, first kill works fine for me.  PO may or may not do the old world dragons again, but given that they spawn in a set location on a set schedule and are spawned irregularly, I don't agree to first come first serve.  Whether we use a calendar system or a rotation system is irrelevant, but some kind of system needs to be worked out.  The same is true of VS.  Not every guild can assemble enough forces the minute the servers come up to take down those spawns.  <br>
<br>
At the moment, most of the other mobs you mentioned are only w/in reach of IV, SF, and maybe PO and Slivers for now, I suspect.  Hell, most aren't even w/in reach for IV.  (Yelinak and Dain Frostweaver... that's gonna take some time.  And have you heard about the upraded gods yet... heh).  Until such time as more than one guild can handle a spawn, I don't think it's a big issue.<br>
<br>
As far as the once per week thing:  Again, there are maybe 6 guilds that are planar ready.  (The Endless is one that you didn't mention, they're planning to go to Hate on Friday).  At this point, once per week means the planes will go unscheduled for certain days.  What's the rule then, ffa?  I would suggest, instead, a rule that no guild could schedule a given plane for a friday/saturday/sunday more than 2 times per month, and no guild could schedule a given plane more than once per Monday-Thursday.  Days that are not reserved are then FFA.<br>
<br>
Lastly, before we enter into any kind or agreement, I want to know if you have the power to commit your guild to it or if you are just making a suggestion?  In otherwords, is this a case of Sotae posting his opinion or Sotae presenting the position of SF?</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2F2F4F><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucerosofvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceros of Vazaelle</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>3</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>3/15/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:31:48 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: calender business</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">First, let me say that I'm absolutely not speaking on behalf of IV.  I don't want to get people paranoid about IV's intentions.  I'm just stating my opinions here, heh.<br>
<br>
Something to remember about Calendar systems is that Verant will not support/enforce Calendars.<br>
<br>
Policies on &quot;boss mobs&quot; seems to vary server to server, but they generally don't enforce the PNP.  I've read a fair amount on disputes and GM resolutions, and generally the policy is first come, first serve.<br>
<br>
So, the Calendar has to be something that every guild chooses to adopt and live by.  You can't expect guild X to use/support it, nor can you force it upon them.<br>
<br>
I've seen hostility to guilds who don't believe/have no faith in the Calendar system and choose not to abide by it.  No, they don't own the server, but neither does coalition_of_guilds05.  Popular opinion does not rule servers, Verant does, shrug.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that people should accept the rules of the game if they choose to play.  If every guild wants to support the calendar system, awesome.  If they don't, that's their choice, and it should be respected.<br>
<br>
Again, this is my opinion based on my experiences on Lanys and what I've read about such activities on other servers.  I've never even heard an IV member comment on this issue, so I again I must state that I'm not speaking for my guild.<br>

Here's why...<br>
<br>
1) When a plane is reserved, it is almost always used less than half of the time.  In some instances it is rare for the entire zone is not cleared (i.e. Hate) and is usually only cleared one time.  This means when a respawn is 10 or 12 hours (and a guild clears it only once) then half of the day the zone is completely unused because it is &quot;reserved&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) Calendars get abused.<br>
<br>
3) When calendars get abused, people get less access to the planes.  Animosity builds between different guilds, leading to hatred for no real reason.<br>
<br>
I would propose instead of a calendar system, how about each raid location has a common &quot;Jump Off&quot; point.  For Hate this would be South Ro.  Fear / PoG / PoM have very obvious starting zones.  Sky isnt an issue (even though it is my favorite plane) because it is rarely utilized to it's potential.<br>
<br>
A person could &quot;camp&quot; a plane by being at the &quot;jump off point&quot;.  He would then have 3 hours to start the raid (or some other realistic time).  If the raid doesnt begin within a specific amount of time he forfeits the camp.<br>
<br>
I would like to avoid the scenario where a certain group of people camps a plane most of the time because they are &quot;creative&quot; with who schedules a planes raid on a given day. (The Nameless comes immediately to mind).<br>
<br>
I also would prefer to avoid the scenario where a plane is unused 80 percent of the time because it is scheduled, yet no one is there.  (How many times did you want to do a planes raid, and couldnt because it was &quot;reserved&quot; -- yet the people who scheduled it didnt actually do the plane on that day?)<br>
<br>
It would be a much better server community if people were able to respect a &quot;planes camp&quot; the same way people (usually) respect a &quot;loot camp&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the same regard, there should be a time limit on a planes &quot;camp&quot;.  Say, 12 hours or one full pass of the zone.  After which time at least 6 hours has to pass before they could &quot;camp&quot; the raid jump off point again.<br>
<br>
I know there are many loopholes in this type of proposal, please point them out to me.<br>

Last time I checked this wasnt a PvP-Team server.  Just because someone is in a different guild, with ambitions similar to your own, doesn't make them the enemy.<br>
<br>
Now that the gods are beefed up, and (hopefully) class loot tables have been buffed, the animosity caused by guild raids will diminish.<br>

and only after our scheduled fear raid friday is done should we be able to schedule another fear raid... this is for each scheduled plane, so you can have PoG, PoM, PoF, PoH, PoA back to back if you want, but you cannot schedule more than one of each at a time... i hope i'm making sense ;P<br>

Why do you insist on bringing what your old server did here?<br>
leave it alone...pay attention to what is said, communicate...and don't try to set rules for 3000 + people. <br>
really pisses me off!!<br>
<br>
just respect what is what, don't try to be greedy, and remember how many people &quot;play&quot; this damn game....</font><P>Rewfist<br>

To me, sitting in South Ro 'camping' Hate for three hours and then not going is rather silly and also unfair. It would piss me off if we were scheduled for Hate but a guild was camping it and we had to wait three hours while they get their people together to see if they even go. When posting events people should be as time specific as they can and start on time. Monday-Thursday FFA jump off camps seem fair, but the calendar should be always used for Friday-Sunday. Another thing to consider would be if a guild goes on more than one FFA weekday planes raids, that guild should leave that weekend open to other guilds.<br>

Because of all the bazillion things that could happen with one week spawns (patch, server down, pops a little earlier than expected, pops later than expected.. etc.. ) I dont think anyone should schedule those. The Jump off idea is also dumb. p  Maybe when there are many many guilds who we KNOW can kill a spawn at any time and have the forces to do so<br>
at any time , a rotation would work..  otherwise.. mmm...no..  Thanks. ; p<br>
