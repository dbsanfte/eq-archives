Watching that growing crimson stain blossom around his broken body filled her with a panic that grew in proportion to his bleeding.  Nizzre’s eyes were not focused where hers were.  Instead, he was locked on Bwael, who had been summoned for a third time.  After having his ribs crushed on the first summon, Bwael had managed to duck away from the black reaver on the second call, but the third left him with a head wound as the reaver clubbed him across the side of his skull as the ranger skittered away.  How Bwael was managing to stay running, magically hastened or not, was beyond him.<br>
<br>
“I’ve got to do something!” Camille exclaimed, more to herself than to Nizzre.  She stood up abruptly, but then was pulled down to her knees by Nizzre.<br>
<br>
“You’ll kill them!” he warned her, but she struggled in his grasp.<br>
<br>
“They’re already dead if we don’t do something!” she retorted, trying to pull herself free.<br>
<br>
“We have to med.” Nizzre said, trying to control his own hyperventilation, staring her in the eyes.  “We have to clear our heads and med.”<br>
<br>
“We don’t have time!” Camille argued, finally pulling her arm free of him.  She turned back to River.<br>
<br>
He was gone.<br>
<br>
“River…?” she whispered.  The pool of blood was still there.  But River was simply….gone.  No blood led away from the body.  She blinked.  Was he invisible somehow?<br>
<br>
“Bwael is gone.” Nizzre commented, looking everywhere.  The reaver was standing there blankly, not moving, but no longer pursuing the fleeing ranger.  Bwael simply was no where in sight.  Summoning creatures once harmed would summon until you or it was dead.  But Bwael’s body was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
“What the hells?” Nizzre whispered.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the black reaver turned on its heels and marched back into the building, without a backwards glance.  The body of the first reaver lay ignored, jade reavers laying on the floor around it.  The second reaver took its post in place of the first, and stopped moving, going as deathly still as the first had stood when they first spied it through the now destroyed door’s keyhole.<br>
<br>
“Where did they go?” Camille asked quietly, afraid, even now that they were alone, to speak aloud.<br>
<br>
“Come.” a young voice said from behind them.  Nizzre and Camille spun as one, Nizzre’s sword extended.<br>
<br>
In front of them was a young half-elven boy, blonde hair unkempt, hands red with blood.<br>
<br>
The boy from West Commonlands weeks ago.  The boy Camille had saved from Kizdean Gix.  The boy who had lowered the rope down to them in Befallen.<br>
<br>
“Come.” he said again, extending those bloody hands towards the two paladins.<br>
<br>
“River…” Camille began.<br>
<br>
“Safe.” the boy said.  And again with his hands.  “Come.”<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Nizzre asked, not lowering the sword.<br>
<br>
“He’s a…druid…I think.” Camille began.<br>
<br>
“He’s a boy.” Nizzre said. “Too young to be of much help.”<br>
<br>
The boy just gave him an odd half-smile.<br>
<br>
“No.” Camille said slowly.  “We saved his life weeks ago, and he saved ours.  The druids of the Commons ring have been training him, and they say he’s…good.”<br>
<br>
“Come.” the boy said again.  Nizzre finally sheathed his sword.<br>
<br>
“If he’s a friend…” Nizzre said.  The boy just shook his head up and down.<br>
<br>
“What is your name?” Camille said, asking the question that had been in the back of her head from the moment she met him in West Commons.  The boy took her and Nizzre’s hands and his eyes began to light green.<br>
<br>
“Grelin.” he said, and they suddenly disappeared, poof.<br>
<br>
They reappeared at the entrance to the City of Mist, where River and Camille had first met Bwael and Nizzre.  River and Nizzre were both collapsed against the wall, covered in blood, but whole.  Both were breathing heavily, but they were breathing.  The wounds were gone.  The blood would take a little more work.<br>
<br>
“You’re alive!” Nizzre exclaimed, looking at his brother with wide eyes.<br>
<br>
Camille knelt tentatively at River’s side, wanting to embrace him but afraid of hurting him after the beating he had took.  River just grinned at her, and crushed her to his body, pulling her off her feet.  She felt ready to weep and decided instead to smother him with kisses.  The young boy watched them uncomfortably.<br>
<br>
“He healed us, the boy.”  Bwael said.  “Ported us both out of there and healed us.  He’s amazingly trained for a druid this young.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you Grelin.” Nizzre said, bowing low.  “You have saved my brother Bwael and my friend Riverdane.  I will not forget your kindness.”  The boy just grinned.<br>
<br>
“How did you know we were here?” Camille asked, looking at him, breaking away from River.<br>
<br>
“I watch.” Grelin said softly, as if that explained everything.  Well, Camille thought, the druids were wrong.  He’s not a mute, but he certainly didn’t like to talk.<br>
<br>
“Well, kid.” Riverdane said, shaking his hand firmly.  “You did good.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll be back.” Grelin said, murmuring something in elvish.  He quickly shimmered and was gone.  River raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Invisibility.” Bwael said, recognizing the spell.<br>
<br>
After a short moment, Grelin reappeared in front of them, lugging the two jade reavers.<br>
<br>
River looked at the young boy, who placed the reavers on the ground in front of them and stepped back away from the weapons.  Then he looked over at Nizzre, and something passed between them.<br>
<br>
“Grelin.” River said.  “You may be young, but you are skilled beyond your years…I could tell that from the first heal when you brought us to the front here.  You must be close to the level of skill where you could complete your epic.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” the boy said, a puzzled look on his face.<br>
<br>
“Bwael, take one of the reavers for your epic.  We will roll on the sword, and we’d like you to take the other reaver, Grelin, as a repayment for saving our lives.”<br>
<br>
The boy’s eyes widened.  <br>
<br>
“No.” he said.<br>
<br>
“No?” River asked, blankly.<br>
<br>
“No epic.” Grelin said.<br>
<br>
“You don’t want it?” Camille asked.<br>
<br>
The boy just shook his head.<br>
<br>
“What do you want, boy?” River asked, searching the boys face.  He couldn’t be more than eleven years old, at the most.<br>
<br>
“Adventure.”<br>
<br>
River blinked.  “You want adventure….with us?”  Nizzre was already shaking his head.<br>
<br>
“Aye.”<br>
<br>
Camille knelt in front of the boy and took his hands in hers.  “Where are your parents?” she asked gently.<br>
<br>
Grelin just looked at her.<br>
<br>
“Do you know who your mother is?” she asked.<br>
<br>
He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Your father?”<br>
<br>
“The rain.” Grelin said.<br>
<br>
“The rain?” Camille asked, confused.<br>
<br>
“…is his father.” Bwael answered for the boy.  “He means Karana, God of Rain.”<br>
<br>
“Ah.” Camille said.<br>
<br>
“You mean to tell us that your father is the God of Rain?” Nizzre asked skeptically.  “That you are the son of a god?”<br>
<br>
Grelin just shrugged.  Not yes, or no.  Just a guileless shrug.<br>
<br>
“I’ll assume you mean figuratively.” Nizzre said.  “The gods do not come to Norrath to leave children.”<br>
<br>
River glanced over quickly at Camille and shook his head subtlely.  Camille understood the look.  Keep his secret.  River wasn’t about to spoil his first friendships with the news that he was the bastard son of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
“He has no family.” Camille said instead.<br>
<br>
“What we do is dangerous, Cami.” Nizzre began.<br>
<br>
“But…” River said.  “What better protectors?”  He looked at Grelin thoughtfully, as if choosing a horse.  “He is already at our level of training, from what I’ve seen.  And he’s a healer.  With no where to go.  What do you think, kid?  Could you keep three tanks and a ranger alive?”<br>
<br>
“I did today.” he said with that odd smile.<br>
<br>
Nizzre burst out laughing.  “Aye, you did.  You got us out of a mess.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” the boy smiled.<br>
<br>
River looked at Nizzre, who in turn looked at Bwael.  Bwael just shrugged.  But it was Camille who decided it.<br>
<br>
“He comes with us.” she said, the look in her eyes daring anyone to challenge.  None of the men did.<br>
<br>
“So, Grelin.” River said, shaking the young man’s hand again.  “Welcome aboard.”<br>
<br>
The boy grinned widely.  Nizzre thumped him on the back.<br>
<br>
“Welcome aboard, Grelin.” he said.  “And now as for the loot…”<br>
<br>
“One jade reaver for Bwael’s epic, one jade reaver for Annir.” River said, “…and the sword…”<br>
<br>
“…stays with you.” Nizzre said.  Bwael nodded.  Camille smiled.<br>
<br>
“With me?” River said, “No no.  We had a deal.”<br>
<br>
“You’re our tank River.” Nizzre replied.  “You’ll need it more than we do.  You’re the only one of us that can’t heal.  So that’s going to put you on the front line.”<br>
<br>
River’s eyes ran along the edge of the serrated blade.  It was a beautiful weapon.<br>
<br>
“Just give me your old sword, River.” Camille said.  “Mine broke on the back of the reaver.”  River handed her his sheathed sword immediately.<br>
<br>
“Thank you.” River said earnestly, looking at all of them.  “I’ve never had… anything like this.”<br>
<br>
“Just be careful where you swing that thing.” Nizzre laughed.  “I think it would cut through my armor as though it were tin.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” River said, sheathing the sword.  It hummed against his leg quietly.  “Let’s get out of here.”<br>
<br>
“Where to?” Grelin asked.  River looked to Nizzre.  He shrugged.<br>
<br>
“West Commons,  to begin.” River said.  Grelin nodded, and with a word and a flash of green light, they disappeared.<br>
<br>
Arriving in West Commons, Grelin ran ahead, over the hilltops.  He looked so young.  Nizzre leaned in to the others.<br>
<br>
“Did we do the right thing, dragging a kid into our lifestyles?” he whispered.<br>
<br>
“It’s better than him running around alone.” Camille said adamantly.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly they heard a voice over the side of the hill.  Camille recognized it immediately.  Gix.<br>
<br>
“Ah, the spy returns.” Gix’s voice carried.<br>
<br>
“Let me pass.” Grelin said loudly. <br>
<br>
“Ah, and the spy SPEAKS!” Gix laughed in amazement.  “Go run, boy.  I promise not to take you down until you had a two pace lead.”<br>
<br>
“No.” Grelin said evenly.<br>
<br>
“NO??” Gix asked, still chuckling in amazement.<br>
<br>
River nodded quietly at his companions and they stepped over the hill.<br>
<br>
“No.” River said loudly.  Bwael notched an arrow and leveled it at Gix.  Gix’s mouth dropped open, eyes darting from Grelin to River to Camille and back again.  And then, finally to Bwael and the bow.  And again to River.<br>
<br>
“Wyldechylde!” Gix gasped.  “You’re…”<br>
<br>
“Dead?” River suggested.  Gix’s mouth snapped close.<br>
<br>
“Go run, Gix.” Nizzre suggested, looking at Bwael.  “We promise not to take you down until you had a two pace lead.”<br>
<br>
Gix blinked impotently at the high elf, all the color draining from his blue features.  <br>
<br>
“He eats inky babies.” Riverdane commented, pointing to Bwael.  Bwael just grinned evilly.<br>
<br>
Gix turned tail and ran.<br>
