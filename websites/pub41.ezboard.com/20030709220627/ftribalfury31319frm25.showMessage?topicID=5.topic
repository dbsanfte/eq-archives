<br>
Grimling Forest to about –500, -1200 and you will find a shopkeeper who sells polished Acrylia Spheres. Buy one sphere. Run to –800, -1200 and you will find Scout Husman. Hand him the Acrylia Sphere. Follow him to a Grimling Camp, which he will attack. <br>
<br>
You must keep Husman alive and help him kill the Grimlings. Several waves will follow the first 5 at the starting camps. These waves will consist of 4-5 grimlings each. You will need a group of 50s, or a few 55+ people. Make sure you have a healer, and someone that can taunt so that Husman is not taking all the hits. <br>
<br>
Eventually, after the waves, a Grimling officer with spawn. If the waves stop coming for more than 5 minutes, then restart the quest. The officer is a rare spawn, and does not always pop on your first try of waves. Just step away, let the grimlings at the camp pop, and let Husman die. He will respawn ten minutes later. Just fyi, Husman is level 30, so he doesn’t have a lot of hitpoints. <br>
<br>
It is farely easy to keep him alive after the first wave. Once you kill the officer, get his scalp, and give it to Husman for the Copper Medal of War. If Scout Husman dies anytime during the quest, you must start over.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Scouts<br>
<br>
Scout Janomin - Permafrost</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You will need to turn the seal into six different scouts. The first scout is in Permafrost. In Perma, first clear the caves with Ice giants and bears past the King room and Diplomat room. Then, hand in the Seal to Scout Janomin who is by the entrance/ladder behind some rocks and get immediately CoHed to where your raid is at. The Icebound Spirit will spawn in the pits. Have your puller (preferably a monk or shadowknight) pull the spirit to where your forces are. The Icebound Spirit is level 55 and hits for 225 max. If you are in a seasoned guild, you shouldn’t have a problem dispatching him. He has moderate MR, high Cold resist, and low fire resist. He is immune to slow spells and flurries. He has a lot of hitpoints. Once he is dead, loot his totem and turn it in to Scout Janomin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Scout Rahjiq – Lesser Faydark</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Scout Rahjiq can be found at 187,-1885. Hand him the Seal<br>
<br>
Scout Rahjiq says 'Keep your head down, mate! The spirit that you have come for is very close. I have spotted it several times today. It keeps appearing near that odd structure just over the hill. Be careful not to attract the attention of those invisible creatures that roam near the structure. Just release the spirit and return the totem to me. I'll prepare the totem for placement in the container that you were given. <br>
<br>
The air before the large monolith grows solid, as misty tendrils wrap together in the shape of a large wolf. <br>
<br>
A large white wolf named the Spirit of Malevolence will spawn just East of the Shadowmen altar. He is not hard to kill, has medium amount of hit-points and hits for 225. The most annoying thing is the AE blindness spell, which can be resisted if you have MR. Give the totem back to Rahjiq.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Scout Ahlikal - Feerrott</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Head to Feerrott and find the Scout Ahlikal at 374,-2440. Give him the Seal and Spirit of Decay will spawn North of the Scout in a stone structure. The spider casts an AOE snare with a side-effect DoT. The DoT spell does 100 damage per tick and adds 9 poison counters. The duration of the dot is unknown. I am guessing that you should have all your resists high enough so that the DoT does not hit you. Hand the totem from the spider to Scout Ahlikal to receive the Wrapped Spider Totem.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Scout Eyru – Swamp of No Hope</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Find Scout Eyru in Swamp of No Hope at –3514,2345. Hand him the seal.<br>
<br>
Scout Eyru says 'It is a relief to see you. I was beginning to fear that no one would be able to find me in this miserable swamp. I wanted to get word back to Shar Vahl about my location, but I was afraid that I would lose the trail off this spirit if I were to break off my pursuit. This location is as strange of a destination for our spirit as it is dangerous. I have seen the spirit several times and it is very out of place here. I can't help but think that the transformation has left the spirit confused beyond all repair. '<br>
<br>
Scout Eyru says 'If you move towards the large body of water just north of here, you should be able to find a vantage point that will allow you to see it. The spirit has been resting under the surface of the water there for several days now. Once you release the spirit, please return to me with the totem that binds it. I will prepare the totem, so that you may return it to Shar Vahl. '<br>
<br>
A giant reptile roars, as it sinks below the surface of the pond. It appears that it senses your approach.<br>
<br>
The mob is the Spirit of Sorrow. It is level 55, like all the other spirits, but this one is a bit trickier to kill. Since it it underwater, you will want the tanks to have EB on. All the resists are high, so do not try to nuke until it has been debuffed or if you are a wizard then you can use your lure spells. Your spells will only work if the monster is out of the water, which can be tricky to do, since it summons. Another twist with this mob is that it has a 10-15 second ae stun. Again, just get MR high enough, and it won’t hit you. Once you killed the mob loot the totem and give it to Eyru.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Scout Malom – Stonebrunt Mountains</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Now head to Stonebrunt Mountains, where you will find Scout Malom at 3650,-3530. Give him the Seal.<br>
<br>
Scout Malom says 'Thank you for coming. I am surprised that you were able to find me. I barely know where I am at this point. I followed the vile beast that has been corrupting the spirits, but he eluded me after I followed him to that ridge up there. Fortunately, the spirit that you seek has remained at the site of its transformation. Use levitation to work your way up the falls and return to me with the totem that you will acquire from releasing the spirit. ' <br>
<br>
Something glows brightly from high above the falls. '<br>
<br>
The Spirit, Spirit of Torment, spawns North of the Scout on top of the waterfall. He has low hitpoints, and only hits for 225. Quite easy to dispatch. He does proc a 10-15 second stun on whoever he is attacking. Hand the totem into Scout Malom.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Scout Vyrak – Emerald Jungle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Find Scout Vyrak at 237, 4212 in Emerald Jungle. He is not always up, because he is kos to wondering mobs. Hand him the Seal. A Totem Fiendling will spawn straight ahead, and will run to try and kill the Scout. Kill the Fiendling quickly before he kills the Scout. He is not a very high level, and is easy to kill. <br>
<br>
Southeast of the Scout in a building, the Spirit of Rage will spawn. The Spirit of Rage has an aoe fear spell and flurries for 225 each hit. Kill it and get the totem. Hand the totem into Scout Vyrak for Wrapped Gorilla Totem. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Battle with Draz Nurakk</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Head out to Timorous Deep and look up Scout Sihmoj. Hand him the Seal.<br>
<br>
Scout Sihmoj says 'Good to see you, now keep your head down friend. He may look out here at any moment, though he's been asleep most of the day. He's been staying in a ruined building on that island over there. I'm sure you can see it from here. You should be able to surprise him with little trouble. Just take care to avoid any traps he may have set. He's proven to be a very capable magic-user. '<br>
<br>
Scout Sihmoj says 'When you finish with him, please bring any evidence of his being dispatched back to me in this bag. I'll direct you from there. Good luck... I'll watch from here. '<br>
<br>
Draz Nurakk will spawn, but he will be very low, green con. He will spawn on the island on the opposite island. Pull him away from his spawn spot to where your groups are, and kill him. He won’t drop anything on this corpse but:<br>
<br>
Draz Nurakk's corpse explodes into thousands of brilliant glass fragments! '<br>
<br>
Now at his spawn point will be 6 Draz Nurakk’s Images. Five of these iksars are level 53, and the sixth one is level 55. One of the 53 cannot be snared or rooted, and one cannot be slowed. They can all be single pulled by someone 51 or higher, but you should have a 60 puller with feign just in case something goes wrong with the pull. All the 53s hit for around 140, and the 55 hits for 170. He is also not able to be stunned or mezzed. Each one of the iksars drops a Shards of Broken Glass. Put all 6 of the shards into the bag that the Scout Sihmoj gave you, combine it, and give it to Sihmoj.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Final Battle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You are almost done! Head to Fungus Grove and seek out Scout Halmia. She is in the small cavern right at the Twilight Sea zone. Give her the Seal from Dumul. <br>
<br>
Scout Halmia says 'I thank the spirits that you have arrived. I would not have been able to stop the dark animist if he were to attempt to leave. He has made camp in an empty set of huts. He has moved from hut to hut, but made no attempt to leave the area. I would be wary of traps if I were you. I must admit that I was afraid. That is why I moved to this location. He should still be there though. '<br>
<br>
Draz Nurakk will spawn on a hill over from the Caller Quest mobs. He can not be hit by anything but your claws and spells. It has also been discovered that Monks with only their epics equipped were able to hit Draz as well.  He can easily be done with one group, just make sure you have a healer backing you up. You can also have another tank taunting it and taking the hits, so that magicians, wizards, etc. can nuke without getting aggro. Draz himself hits for 125 or so (at the most) but up to 3 times per hit, unless a chanter or shaman slows him. Once Draz is dead, loot his head. Put the head, the claws, and the seal all in the box and combine it. Return this to Dumul for your epic. Note that if when you hand in the claws to Halmia, Draz doesn’t spawn, head back to Dumul, give him your claws and start over from that point. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319.showUserPublicProfile?gid=masakrex>masakrex</A> at: 3/6/03 11:59:13 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=5.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.showNextMessage?topicID=5.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.tribalfury.org/images/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.emailToFriend?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="tribalfury31319frm8">Open Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm9">Class Specific Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm10">Polling Station<option value="tribalfury31319frm26">Tribal Honorees<option value="tribalfury31319frm20">Humor<option value="tribalfury31319frm13">Raid Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm14">Quest Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm24">Membership Applications<option value="tribalfury31319frm25">Guild Library<option value="tribalfury31319frm19">Epic Progress<option value="tribalfury31319frm11">The Bazaar<option value="tribalfury31319frm12">Trade Skill Discussion<option value="tribalfury31319frm17">General Members<option value="tribalfury31319frm28">Applicant Discussions<option value="tribalfury31319frm18">Officers Lounge<option value="tribalfury31319frm23">Member Archives<option value="tribalfury31319frm22">Officer Archives<option value="tribalfury31319frm29">Applicant Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/btribalfury31319>Tribal Fury</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ftribalfury31319frm25>Guild Library</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.tribalfury.org">Tribal Fury Home</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
