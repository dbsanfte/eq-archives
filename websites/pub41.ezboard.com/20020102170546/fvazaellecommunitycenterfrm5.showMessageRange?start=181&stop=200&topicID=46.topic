My mage is 45 on TP.<br>
<br>
I also have to point out that both your enchanters that evening were damn bad and the cleric especially so.  Actually, I lied...one of the enchanters was doing REALLY well the other one..well..maybe they should have made a drood.  My enchanter is 53....my cleric 56 (my first character way back before there was a 50+ level).<br>
<br>
You obviously don't like my rants Kaz, cause well...one of them directly applies to you...and you can't really say &quot;Well yeah I did that but here's the situation&quot;...Because other people that chimed in on that thread KNEW you were an ass.  And I betcha didn't take a look at my posts on information about the SSS quest, the bard issues thread, the Nostrolo Tambourine information I waqs trying to get, armour questions..yadda yadda yadda.  No?  Guess not...probably, like Isys, you are selective.  You ignore anything constructive, cause its Faddle, and you look at the negative.  Guess what junior..I have news for you...you can do that to ANY person on the planet, and even the Dalai Lama comes out looking like a bad person when you do that.<br>
<br>
But I don't mention any names in my initial rants...and if you take a look at my posts...you will see that I *NEVER* do unless some wood chip decides that that WASN'T what happened...or likes to chime in and start taking pot shots at Faddle.  You know...people in glass houses and all that?<br>
<br>
Yep...I rant...and am fairly outspoken...it's one of the things that has gotten me in trouble alot..and one of the things that people like about me...if you are an IDIOT I will tell you...If I am..then TELL ME...don't look at a message board, and take a personal preference that I have (ie I don't like to interact with folks that tend to swear every second word), and tell me I'm a fool for being that way.  <br>
<br>
When a BAD GUILD group gets their only bard killed a couple of times.  It's time to pull out the idiot stick and start whacking.<br>
<br>
As for being a bad bard....I was told CONSISTENTLY by PO folks that I was grouping with I was a good one...so either your standards are only YOUR standards and no one else's...or you're a fool that doesn't trust the opinion of his own guildmembers.<br>
<br>
Oh...AoE songs are situational...but playing them in Highkeep is a bad idea.<br>
<br>
As for the mid-life.  31 is hardly mid-life.  All it means is that I'm old enough to do the things I want...make more money than whiney cheeseballs like you...and get to buy all the nice toys that come along with it.<br>

And I don't have to beg Mommy and Daddy for my allowance.<br>

Or it isn't meant to be a counterpoint to someone?<br>
<br>
I can take your initial comparison of walking into a party full of people and speaking German, and lets say I did that.  Chances are, that MAYBE someone at least speaks some German there and can get along in a conversation.  I've also found that when I DO go to a room full of folks and speak another language, most folks then try to ASK me what that means..or how do you say this?  At the very least, walking into a room full of people that I don't know the language at all..there are SOME people out there that extend the olive branch and try to communicate on different levels...at least giving me a modicum of comfort.<br>
<br>
Almost like the time I went to my friend Andre's Borthday party.  Andre is deaf.  Most of his friends are deaf , and one of his friends brought someone that didn't know sign.  The point your inital comparison would fail to take into account is that when someone is faced with a LACK of communication with someone due to some sort of language barrier there is an INCLUSION factor that arises.  Ie Just because the person doesn't speak the language of the party, doesn't mean they are shunned into a corner to fend for themselves.  Whereas if someone were to be speaking expletives every second word there is an EXCLUSION factor that occurs.  People tend to shy away from like that in real life...they are what we call SOCIAL MISFITS.  You know the ones....<br>
<br>
It's funny how when I was in Celestae...not alot of guildchatter (if any, I can't seem to recall any..and I don't have my filter on), had anything really negative about it.  When grouping with PO folks alot, again, nothing really bad was coming through groupchat, and now in Caer Cadarn, I have yet to hear anyone really go off on the wire and start swearing like a sailor. So your argument that the dynamics of the people in the game and that this is 'NORMAL' is flawed.  It may be normal for YOU, and at which point I start to question how intellectually uber you think you are, or the people that you seem to be around quite a bit.<br>
<br>
So I come to this message board..visit the rants section, and WOW...look at all the vitriol...geez.  And most of it isn't even real..its kids saying FUCK cause they know they can and their parents aren't around to catch them at it.  Wow...Like its recess time in the school yard. <br>
<br>
This all started when I said I really don't like to listen or read messages that don't have any valid content besides swearing up a storm.  If you're going to rant...rant away, but at least be smart about it, and get your point across.  If you are alienating your audience by your content, which isn't content at all, then you have defeated yourself in getting your rant across.<br>
<br>
The BEST rants that are out there are not rants that say &quot;BOB IS A LAME ASS FUCK HE IS SUCH A SHIT EATING FAG COCKSUCKER&quot;....And of course...those trained seals that start applauding when a rant comes out that says this...are right on the same level...perhaps worse..cause they should KNOW better..cause it looks so stupid to read..how stupid is the person that wrote it?<br>

That_, imo, is just prudishness, and to ignore a person's thoughts just because they happen to swear seems to me a really dumb argument, which is what got me into this in the 1st place.  Rather than clarify your thoughts, you proceded to get into a series of fairly funny but also fairly childish pissing contests with basicly everyone else who has posted on this thread, and use nearly every message board cliche and stock personal attack in the book to do so.  You see, you decided to get defensive and superior rather than make that small clarification you just did, 190 posts down^^  It probably wouldnt have stopped alot of this stuff, seems like some people have other axes to grind, but it might have stopped me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufaddlefiddlethebard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faddle Fiddle the Bard</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/01 11:21:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't usually rant but...</span><hr size=1> Ummm...And you posting a statement about dueling through a graphical MUD to prove your manhood is intelligent?<br>

<br>
Maybe if you spent less time trying to boost your ego by attempting to make yourself look intelligent than others, and more time listening to those that obviously have a firmer grasp of the game you wouldn't come across as such a crotchity old bastard.<br>
<br>
that run on sentence is my advice to you for having a more enjoyable eq experience<br>

Your insights, coming as they are from other people, are ASTOUNDING!<br>
<br>
Oh wait...That's not YOUR opinion is it?  You are just parrotting something someone else said.  Wow..Feel flattered Keadian (sp?)...Mimicry is the highest form of flattery.<br>
<br>
You may have noticed that I didn't critique Keadien on his performance.  I don't have any basis to work from, not having a warrior, so I can't really tell him he's a bad warrior (not saying you are, you actually did rather well when we grouped, as far as my knowledge as warriors go), because I don't have a reference point to work from.<br>
<br>
Good thing you don't let facts and experience get in the way of of the truth Isys!  Yeah..you give your opinion...(even if it is someone else's).  Shows you've got a mind of your own!<br>
<br>
So...you still wanna punch me out at recess Isys?  Wanna make another gay comment or something?  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. For anyone BUT Isys...I did not mean to come across as condescending.  I just hate messages with no other purpose than to test my profanity filters.  Content would be nice ya know?  If I came across that way..I APOLOGISE.<br>

<br>
Faddle, you think that cuase you played all those other classes that you were the best at them...why didn't you goto the Best of the Best tournies?? Or did they SUCK as much as you play your Bard...I bet you were one of the ones in the GFay shouting &quot;well my level 50+ did this and did this? Sounds to me like you came to this server to be &quot;uber&quot;. If in fact you do have those +50 char, Go back to those servers, or did the Gay community kick you out?<br>
<br>
Why you gotta lie to make friends?<br>
<br>
How many people actually care WTH you played and what level you got? I know I sure as hell don't.<br>
<br>
Faddle do you get yourself off in your lil make believe world were you think you are so better than everyone? Please STFU you make your self look more like the looser that was in the trash can everyday at school, trying to get your lil tarnished rep back.<br>
<br>
Faddle your just the person everyone love to anoy and loves to hate.  <br>

<br>
Lets just say your right, and a lot of the people you are arguing with are adolescents. What kind of 31 year old professional male who has a life and lots of outdoor hobbies allows himself to be baited again and again by 12 year olds?<br>
<br>
If I saw a 31 year old man arguing with the vehemence and passion that you seem to have with a bunch of 12 year olds and telling them how young they are with every other retort in real life, I would howl in laughter at the sheer riduclousness of it. <br>
<br>
Somehow you have feel you have to justify yourself and belittle your attackers everytime a comment is made. A reasonble and intelligent 31 year old, doesn't have to have the last word in an argument. Especially in an argument with children. <br>
<br>
So either they are not children or perhaps your not as reasonable and intelligent as you make yourself out to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ufaddlefiddlethebard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faddle Fiddle the Bard</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/01 2:30:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't usually rant but...</span><hr size=1> Uh huh.<br>
<br>
You actually may want to re-read where I said and I quote &quot;I don't tell other people how to play because they MAY actually be better than I was at that level&quot;...<br>
<br>
Where you actually read that a) I have played several classes to 40+ and a couple to 50+ and that I then went on to say I was the best at them is a complete mystery to me.  I don't tell other folks how to play...they maybe better than me at that level..or their play style DIFFERENT, but no less effective.<br>
<br>
As for me changing servers...why not?  Everyone else on this server has..your vacuous argument of GO BACK WHERE YOU WERE UBER, is kind of stupid.  If that were the case, almost everyone on this server would have headed back long ago.<br>
<br>
And how am I lying to make friends?  This statement stumps me...and all I can think of is that it came from the same place where I said I was the best at everything.<br>
<br>
And again...back to the better than everyone..I think if you had read my messages (like the last one), instead of letting Isys cry to you on the phone or something..you would have READ (try it), that I had apoologised to all and sundry that if I had come across as being condescending I APOLOGISED FOR IT.  sheesh..wasn't my intention..and I apologise.  <br>
<br>
Wanna make fun little things up with my name like Isys does?  you know...Faddle..Piddle..Puddle..wuddle...that kind of thing...I think I taught my niece that song..Faddle Faddle bo Baddle Bannana nanna bo baddle fi fi fo Faddle...Faddle..She's only 7, You two have at least a couple of years on her should pick it up real fast.<br>

<br>
I guess I just thought there was an age limit to the game, and why so many people choose to be griefplayers is beyond me.<br>
<br>
Procax said it best.  I SHOULD have posted more content to my message when it first appeared.  Sloughing off someone's opinion because they happen to be swearing through it does not invalidate their argument.  It just makes it harder for me (personally) to see it.  *bows to Procax*.  Then folks start talking old griefs and potshots...Sorry..I'll stop.<br>
<br>
On a lighter note....<br>
Anyone see that the Vancouver Grizzlies are NOT coming to Louisville?  Not that I'm a basketball fan.  Was just neat to see the Foyer of my office building make it onto National News <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I'm in the crowd somewhere on that news footage.<br>
<br>
Though re-naming the team the Colonels and the new arena calling it the 'Bucket' is just lame beyond belief.  Even if KFC is calling the shots.<br>
<br>
Makes me wonder if they are going to name the older players The Original Recipe Crew and the new acquisitions The Extra Crispy Crowd.<br>
