<br>
Rushes to a plane/mob/whatever are going to happen - we've had raids that were in planning for literally two months had to be cancelled because someone beat us to what we were after.<br>
<br>
That's how an FCFS server works.  If someone else gets there first, go find something else to do.<br>
<br>
IMHO there was absolutely nothing wrong with LoRD storming hate first.  There WAS something wrong with how they conducted themselves at a later point, but it was equally bad for LoM to keep trying to get into hate once it had been established that hate was already occupied by LoRD.<br>
<br>

<br>
I recall hearing shouts of &quot;Fuck you LoM&quot; etc, but maybe it was a figment of my imagination. I doubt it. NEXT!<br>
<br>
&lt;We also never asked a GM to disband your guild for any reason, this claim is very unsupported, as is the rest of your argument.&gt;<br>
<br>
Bullshit. Golom told me in tells that he had heard of guilds getting disbanded due to things like that. Why would he say that if it was not their intention?<br>
<br>
I took a neutral stance on the day this happened to help ensure an uneventful CR for my guild. I was friends with Golom and he and I spoke in tells regarding all of this. I must say he was much more mature while speaking with me than he was in the log posted by Aurreal. Golom, I thought you were a bigger person than that. I guess you proved me wrong. Congratulations!<br>
<br>
I have friends in LoRD as well, but my loyalty remains with my guild, Legends of Marr. Although I will not personally blacklist LoRD members based on that occured in Hate, I will be very careful to watch my back. (Funny that a rogue is saying that)<br>
<br>
Yes, both guilds were wrong, Arafain. I stated that many times on the day that this all happened. However, Golom came across as an asshole, and Aurreal, in defense of LoM, presented himself as a gentleman. <br>
<br>
It pisses me off that a guild would stoop so fucking low to ruin another guild's day. It pisses me off that people I *thought* were friends would be involved in it. It pisses me off that I felt the need to post this.<br>

Stop trying to put your FAULTS onto other people. YOU used them as a source - it doesn't matter if they were wrong. The fact that you used he-said-she-said and third party quotes is something YOU need to stand behind. If you're going to used the info - let your balls drop and be a man.<br>
<br>
YOU screwed up and got misinformed. YOU need to apologize. YOU did accuse, bullshyt don't lie we all read what you said. Stating the facts? You mean your neighbor told your cousin that his friend in Germany's third brother .. blah blah blah. If your not even going to quote the source - Admit you made it up because you were on a rant and looking for everything you could do to make LoRD look bad. This was just a convienent way.<br>

This is a FCFS server though some respect does go a long ways.  Posting your intention to do a raid is just that, its posting intent and does not give you the right to the spawn.  The problem with posting intent to do a raid is that mobs end up getting reserved for weeks in advance and everything gets booked up.<br>
<br>
However it hasn't gotten to that point yet which is good, mobs aren't being reserved 7 days of every week for a month in advance which is good.  I agree that posting your intent to do a raid weeks in advance so as not to but heads with another raid is a noble and good gesture.  I can also see why you would be upset if another guild used that information against you.  I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with either side here, just going to say a few things that some people may not realize.<br>
<br>
Posting your intentions to do a raid is generally an act of good will.  Your basically saying, &quot;hey everyone we're going to do this raid at this date, just letting you all know so we don't have a conflict&quot;  Nothing wrong with that.  However sometimes when you post a raid say like one week in advance  another guild may have been planning to do the same raid on their private guild board for the past month.  So because you have your post on a public board your raid &gt; their raid?  Now the best thing to do is for both guilds to get a hold of eachother and work something out rather then have a race for it when the day comes but thats just my opinion.  <br>
<br>
The other plan is to always have a backup plan.  So since Hate was being taken was Fear available?  What about Chardok raid on the royals for epic pieces?  Wuoshi?  Seveilrous, Goreniaire, or Talendor?  Any shamans need to do a raid to the bottom of the Hole?  You probably get my drift.<br>

How does 'getting to a plane first <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> on an FCFS server</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->' constitute 'knowingly and purposefully screwing someone else's day' ?<br>
<br>
Sure, it would have been nice of LoRD to respect LoM's intent, but they don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> have</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to. Any more than DBN has to respect a stated intent by RoS for trak. It's nice if they do, and we appreciate it when it happens, but if someone else gets there first, guess what? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Someone else got there first</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and no amount of complaining will change that.
