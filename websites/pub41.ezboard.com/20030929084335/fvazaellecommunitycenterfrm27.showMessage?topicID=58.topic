 Felelith cried to the freshly dug grave.  &quot;They have given me til the dawn to tend to your spirit.  I know, I know why pick me, one that is unblessed.  I guess that is my fault also, I have failed you so much.  If only you had done as they said when I was born and cast me out then you wouldn't be spirit-cursed.  Well the elders have already decided they cannot allow one such as me to remain here without someone who can keep watch over me so I am to be cast out tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Felelith then though her tears began to sing the chants she had heard the elders sing over the graves of her father's and grandparents' graves.  But she knew not what they meant for she had been deemed at birth damned. Only her family had ever been allowed by the elders to even get near her and they had been forbidden to teach her the ways.<br>
<br>
Felelith turned and called out, &quot;Delyni, why, why did you come. You shouldn't be here.  What if your husband's family finds out you came?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry little sister, I convinced Mother Caler to allow me to prepare dinner tonight, I claimed it would settle my soul after the unpleasantness of the day.  I used grandmother's old trick of slipping airbane into the stew when she wanted some peace and quite.  My family will be sleeping til daybreak without so much as even a dream.  I just couldn't leave you to this task alone.  You know I did talk to Mican trying to get him to claim you under his watch so we could still stay close.  But he is afraid you will bring down his house as you did our parents'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is okay Dear one, I understand.&quot; Felelith laughed bitterly. &quot;I am just glad you are hear tonight.  Now we must hurry for the moon is fading and Mother's spirit grows restless.&quot;<br>
<br>
So the two sisters finish their nights work, and as the sky took on the pinkish glow of the dawn, Felelith turn and hugged her sister. &quot;You must go now, I can feel the elders stirring from their sleep they will be here soon, you mustn't been seen take the back roads nobody is on them yet this day.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fele, I love you.  I hide some things for you in the grove behind the hill may it help keep you safe.&quot;  Delyni the slipped away into the mist of the morning.<br>
<br>
Felelith then knelt at her parent's graves and waited.  She didn't wait long until the elders came up the hill, of course they didn't get to close, for they were all slightly afraid of the woman-child's strange gift.  &quot;Felelith Anysia, you are hear by outcast from this place.  You have no family longer living that will claim you.  You are a blight on our village.  Go and never return.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarabet>Zarabet</A> at: 7/9/03 1:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarabet>Zarabet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/2/03 12:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outcast</span><hr size=1> Felelith turned to look upon the elder.  Her voice turned oddly cold and devoid of emotion to match the lifeless look in her eyes. &quot;Oh how you have waited for this day, waited so that you might be able to go about all those wicked this you think about in the night when you are alone, no longer having to worry that I might have been awake and felt that thought and tell someone.  I pity you for now half of you have no concise you had used me for one and now that I am leaving yours is dead.  I pity this village for there are many evil souls amoung you.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Felelith turned and walked towards the grove where her sister had left her supplies. She decided to stop there and rest.  After eatting some of the dried bread and fruit Delyni had packed for her.  She closed her eyes and began to daydream.<br>
<br>
She saw her mother and grandmother as they had been when she was small and still innocent, for she did not know then what the thoughts she heard daily were.  She saw Delyni and herself playing together in the same grove, before she wondered why the other kids played with Delyni but ran away from her.  When the sun finally past the midpoint of the sky and the day began to cool, Felelith stood packed up her few items and opened her mind.  When she finally found  a dirrection that she could not sence other being she began to walk.<br>
<br>
After about 45 cycles of walking Felelith finally was truely alone for the first time in her life, for she heard not one other soul in her mind.  For the first time there was a calm and peace that she had never known before.  She decided she was going to take this time to rest for the first time ungaurded.  To not have to sleep half awake constantly vigilant against a stray thought that might haunt her slumber.<br>

She quickly scanned the area but found not a soul around.  &quot;It is just your imagination, silly there is nothing there.&quot; Felelith said to herself.  Once again she began to walk, amazed at the quiteness of the wilds.  Having never expericaned hearing nothing but her own thoughts before Felelith was suddenly unsure of herself.  She had always acted upon the feelings she picked up from the others, it was easier that way, doing what was expected before they even asked.<br>
<br>
Felelith continued to follow the path of silence she had found.  Throught the dense woods.  These however were not the dangerous scary woods of her grandfather's stories had told of.  These were full of color, sound and warmth.  Felelith was mememized by the songs of the brids, the smells of the flowers in full bloom.  Being lost in the beauty of the day she paid no attention to the setting sun after all it was not her eyes she was using to find her path but her mind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarabet>Zarabet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/14/03 10:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outcast</span><hr size=1> For many days Felelith continued to walk, resting only for short amounts of time when she could no longer keep her eyes open.  It was on the tenth day just as the sun shone it first pink ray in the sky she saw it, and for the first time since she started her journey she was afraid.  For before her was a place she had seen before but only in her nightmares.  <br>
<br>
She was only a small child the first time she had heard the cries of an infant admist a great battle.  Blood shed everywhere. Murder in the hearts of men.  A people lost for they thought not of war but of peace.   Fire from the touches burning, people scream in agony as those touches set their homes aflame.<br>
<br>
Felelith tried to shake off the visions that she had always carried with her, but she knew the only way to do that was go enter the place before her to touch the ground where the bloodshed had occured.  She knew now that this was the heaviness she felt on her heart, she was being called here.  She was being called home. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarabet>Zarabet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/14/03 9:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outcast</span><hr size=1> Felelith walked slowly into the ruins of the once beautiful town, but even the tens of thousand of rains that had fallen since its end could not wash away the horrors that had befallen there.  Even the streets testified to it for even now they bore the rust colored stains of the blood that had been split.<br>
<br>
Then she saw it amidst all the destruction a lone plant covered in million of tiny flowers, each bloom containing in it every color of the rainbow.  Felelith was so taken by the beauty that she never sensed the old woman walking up behind her until at last a shadow fell upon the plant. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tis the Hopeflower and it only blooms when one of our kind comes home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Startled Felelith turned to the old woman, &quot;Who are you?&quot; For the first time she is unable to read the mind of the one in front of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not be alarmed little one, I am a keeper.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is a keeper?&quot; Felelith asked growing more uneasy in an already unsettling place.<br>
<br>
&quot;I keep all the memories of those that came before us within me.  All of our kind have different gifts granted to us from Calansa you see.  Ah but you have never heard of her have you.  Come sit beside me little one and let me tell you the story of how this all came to be.<br>
<br>
It was in the time of the great mist when Pytia was new that the Others awoke.  They each used part of the mist to bring forth the life that now thrives here.  Those that fly high in the night sky, those that crawl upon the ground, and those that lurk in the deepest of waters.  All but two had a hand in those.  The two I speak of are the only Others that bare names.  First was Anca who took some of the mist and created the Mosna, the name of who you call the elders in the forgotten tongue, those that would lead his other creation the Mora, a hard working peoples strong in the body but weak in the mind.  As these peoples began to spread across the lands, the last of the others Calansa came to the very spot where the Hopeflower blooms and created our kind, the Aryas.  She made us similar in appearance to the Mora, but full of passion, strength, and each with a special gift.  Some like myself known as the Keepers, to remember all that has past. Some known as the Foretellers that can see things not yet come to past, there are very ever born with this gift and there are none living now. And finally those like yourself know as the Seers, those that know the hearts and minds of those around them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But how did this place come to be as it is?  How was I born into a house of the elders if I am some other race?  Are there others like us or are we the last two?  Why was I drawn here?  And how did you know I was here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Slow down child, all your questions will be answered but the sun is setting and I am old and must rest.  We will talk more in the morn.  Rest now I know you are tired for I have made the same journey as you.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarabet>Zarabet</A> at: 7/14/03 9:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarabet>Zarabet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/21/03 11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Outcast</span><hr size=1> It was early the next morn when the older woman awoke, leaning over Felelith who was lost in the innocence of sleep she whispered, &quot;Oh little one, I would take this burden you must face if I could.  I wonder when you will learn you carry the hope of us all inside you?&quot;  Then she leaned closer and softly spoke &quot; You must awake now. For there is much more you must hear and time is growing short.&quot;<br>
<br>
Felelith was puzzled by the statement but let it go for she was eager to have her questions from the night before answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will start as the time of peace began.  All the races were living in harmony, creating towns and villages, making Pytia habitable.  For many generations all was well, because there were so few of our people we inner married with the Mosna.  We learned that the children of those unions would not bare our gifts, nor would those children's children.  We now know that it is in the tenth generation that our gift are reborn, and after they show again they can appear at anytime.<br>
<br>
Four lifetimes had passed since Calansa stepped upon this place when Ahmadiel was built.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is Ahmadiel?  I have never heard of a place bearing that name before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are sitting there.  This is all that is left of the once great city of Ahmadiel.  The early Aryas learned that when we where near the Hopeflower our powers would lay dormant.  So those that came before built a town here, a retreat to come to for rest when they needed peace.  Soon however it became refuge for all our people.  This place that was built as a place of rest became our home.  As there were more and more Mora and Morsa born, our kind became seen as strange and distrustful.  And then the Mist came again, it blocked the sun and the moon for sixty suns.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The darktimes, when the Evil one was born.  My grandfather spoke of it once to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Felelith, the darktimes.  The longer the sun did not shine the more fearful people became.  Soon the Mora were calling upon the Morsa to do something.  Evfan, the evil one, began to use the mist to corrupt the Morsa, telling them in their sleep that we caused the mist.  And if they destroyed Ahmadiel the mist would fade.  Because all our kind was now living here, we were blind to what was about to befall us.<br>
<br>
It was on the twenty-fifth night of no moon, when they came bearing torches and weapons.  That night they set aflame Ahmadiel, and killed men, women and children as they ran from their homes.  Not even the most innocent of lives was saved.  Infants fresh from the womb even bleed that night.  And as the blood of the Aryas split in the streets and ran down to the soil where they Hopeflower grows, it blooms began to fall and as the last of those living with gifts died the last bloom fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
After that night the Morsa forbid any talk of the Aryas.  Soon they were able to forgot what they had done here.  They also forgot one other thing.  While they did not bear the gifts they did have our blood in their veins and the power to pass our gifts on.<br>
<br>
As you know, that those that were later born with the gifts were set into the wilds to be carried off by the creatures there, as soon as they showed the signs they were blessed by Calasna.  You have walked in those wilds and know there are no creatures there.  You see we listen for the cries of those babes, and when we hear them we take them to Hepat. When we first heard your cry we came to your family and were going to take you there.  But your mother wouldn't part with you.  And when your gifts became apparent your grandfather used his power as the chief elder to keep you with them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is the Hepat you speak of?  And you still haven't told me how you knew I was here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You shall soon see Hepat, it lies over Mount Hermesch, where Blood River meets the Attis Sea.  As to how I knew you were here.  A foreteller, Derak saw your exile and knew you were coming here.  I was chosen to greet you for I was making the final journey anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The final journey?&quot;  Felelith asked not really wanting to know the answer for she had already seen it in the old woman's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;The final journey is a task all Aryas must undertake to be received by Calansa in death so that we might be taken to be with those that came before.  Do not weep though for I give my spirit willing.  And do not worry for there is another here to help you on your trek to Hepat.
