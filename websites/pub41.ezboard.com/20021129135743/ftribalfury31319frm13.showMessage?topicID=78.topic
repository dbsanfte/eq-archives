<br>
RAIDING 101<br>
 <br>
First off.<br>
 <br>
A raid is set up when there is something you want to accomplish what can't be done by one xp group alone. You call in reinforcements from your guild to get what you want and usually end up between 2 and 4 groups of guildies. This means only a few will get xp and only a handful (maybe only one even) will get a drop. That's what happens on every raid. It's not your normal xp group where everyone gets xp and everyone gets drops most of the time. With this in mind, don't whine if you don't get xp or drops, that's what xp groups are for. If there's a raid in one of the planes (which usually hold drops for every class) don't pester the puller(s) to pull the mob that drops your stuff. They will get to that mob eventually, or they won't on this raid. It happens, better luck next time as we learn more about pathing, mob spawn points, how hard the mobs are etc etc. You will get a drop on a raid eventually.<br>
<br>
Second<br>
 <br>
Raid channel(s) are not to be used for chit chatting. Use group/guild chat for that but leave the raid channel clutter free for the raid leader/puller/MT so that there is no confusion about what's going on. When there is a need for a complete heal chain clerics will get their own channel that's only to be used for timing the complete heal chain. Get rid of the I am assisting (insert MT name) with the extermination of (insert Target name) in the name of (insert God). It's spam, it's annoying and it clutters up the raid channel.<br>
<br>
Third<br>
<br>
You will not attack unless the MT tells the raid to attack. This will allow the MT to gain agro on the mob so it won't ping-pong all over the raid. Ideally the MT will be the only one that takes damage. This is achieved through a few simple rules. <br>
<br>
- All melee apart from the MT stand behind the mob. <br>
<br>
- IF you gain agro use the means your class has to get rid of agro (FD/Jolt/Evade/DIE) or if you don't have this option, turn off auto attack and wait till the MT has agro back. DO NOT RUN AROUND. DO NOT SCREAM FOR HEALS. If you run around you will piss off the MT because he'll have to run around and hope he can get agro back. If you scream for a heal you will piss off the healers because they are paying attention to everyone's health anyhow but keeping the MT alive is their primary job. If you have to, you will eat a death to prevent a raid wipe. You will get rezzed. <br>
<br>
- Debuffing is to be done only when you're close enough to the mob to see what brand of underwear he's wearing. Do not come out with full fire on the debuffs until the MT has called for the raid to attack. If you do you will get agro from the MT and it will piss off the MT. If you still get agro wait patiently till the MT gets agro back and back off slowly from the mob. DO NOT SIT DOWN. You might die trying to (or successfully) debuff a mob. There's a reason why Enchanters were commonly referring to tashing a mob as tashicide. It's a lot of agro. <br>
<br>
- There is no contest to see who can pull agro the fastest. Having a mob ping-pong between different players usually wipes the raid. Control your agro at all times.<br>
<br>
Fourth<br>
<br>
Communicate clearly to the raid as a puller what you are pulling and what is incoming. This makes it possible for the MT/ST/Chanters/Bards/Necro's to prepare for mezzing. Communicate as MT clearly which mob you are attacking so that the rest of the raid doesn't attack the wrong mob, the chanters can start mezzing mobs, the ST can off tank another mob etc etc. Without doing this most of the raid will stare blankly at their screen because they don't know what they're supposed to do.<br>
 <br>
Do not go AFK unannounced. You will be left behind if the raid leader tells everyone to move. If the raid leader tells everyone to move, you WILL move. On a raid the raid leader is god, simple as that. If he tells you to polish his shoes you will polish his shoes. The raid leader will also inform people when it's safe to go AFK to take a small nature break, grab something to eat/drink or whatever. Don't worry about not being able to pee for 7 hours, the opportunity will come.<br>
<br>
Last but not least. Wipes happen. A lot. There's a lot of info on the internet about all zones/mobs/drops but those cannot teach a raid what is learned by doing it. Expect to lose xp on a raid and return emptyhanded lootwise, but with a glowing feeling inside that you accomplished something with the guild FOR the guild. It is a wonderful feeling to go out with a large group of people that you like to call family and do something you normally aren't able to do. Enjoy the ride.<br>

All input imo is important, we are going from a guild that when we &quot;raided&quot; we had 6 or 7 people show up to having 15-20 show up! We are making strides along with our allies and friends and we need to keep disciplined and listen to those that have raided that particular boss mob_01 or epic mob_04.<br>
<br>
We can only get better. My biggest pet peeve is when people don't listen. You don't want to wipe a raid of mine because you didn't listen, you will hear about it from me but that's why I'm the guild bastard.<br>
