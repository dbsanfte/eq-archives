<br>
(room replies in unison) &quot;Welcome Bigemnose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh...  Lets see here... Where to start?  I have been playing Everquest for about two years now, and to date, it is the one game that I have been addicted to for the longest by far.  Before EQ, I was addicted to Counter Strike for a long time as well.  More or less, I bought EQ on a whim one day because it had been out for about a year, and I was curious how a game with out dated graphics could stay on store shelves selling consistently for over a year.  The first time I installed and ran the game, I created a dwarf paladin and ran around inside of Kaladim not knowing really how to get out of the town.  I thought the game was stupid, the graphics were horribly out dated, and I couldn't see why anyone would be so in to such a pathetic game.  I put the box away and walked away from the game that same day after running around Kaladim for about an hour jumping on tables and poking NPCs.<br>
<br>
I got curious again about a week later and loaded the game up again.  Low and behold I accidentally zoned out of Kaladim.  I was like 'wo... there is more here?'  I ran around outside of kaladim in the &quot;newbie area&quot; and got killed by skeleton.  I thought... hmmm that sucked, but I ran around after respawning and went up and stared at a bat trying to figure out how to swing at it (so much for using a manual).  Needless to say I died again.  After a few tries and pounding on the keyboard, I finally found the attack key.  A few more tries and I killed my first bat.  Woo hoo!  So anti-climatic.  I didn't even know I could bend down and pick stuff up from the dead corpse.  I ran around the newbie area the rest of the day killing stuff.<br>
<br>
Then something different happened.  Someone talked to me...  WTF!  It wasn't an NPC.!  After fumbling around, I figured out how to talk back.  There was dialog going on here... honest to God conversations between two real life humans hundreds if not thousands of miles away, but in this small alternate universe, we were standing right next to each other talking.  Suddenly this game shined in a whole new light.  I talked to some other people... and then something truely astonishing happened.  I joined my first group (yeah the had to tell me how).  Now, I was not only attacking mobs and gaining experience, but I was also carrying on dialoge with other live people and participating in group coordinated attacks on mobs.  The game had truely taken on whole new dynamics.  I never looked back from there...<br>
<br>
What is the point of this true story?  The point is that the game is more then just a game.  It is more then just a false reality.  It is more then just an escape.  It is an interaction of real life human beings made possible through an alternate reality that just happens to be a computer game.<br>
<br>
So that being said, is it an addiction?  Is it addictive?  Am I addicted?<br>
<br>
Yes, it is addictive, and yes I am addicted.  But, is the game addictive just on its own?  No it is not.  Take away the human interaction that is offered NOT by the game but instead by the players, and the game is 100% NON-addictive.  I am addicted, but what I am addicted to is the interaction with all of you online.<br>
<br>
Why was it so easy for me to break my addiction to Counter Strike as opposed to how hard it is to break my addiction to Everquest?  The asnwer is simple really.  In Counter Strike, you were almost annonymous unless you chose not to be.  There were thousands of servers, and you could choose your name to go by everytime you logged in to a server.  Even though it was possible to see the same person every single time you logged on, it was unlikely that you would every time.  The addiction to the interaction with real people in an envolved environment was certainly there in Counter Strike, but the one quality that was missing was the relationships.  That is why it is so hard to break the Everquest addiction.<br>
<br>
For instance, as I said before, I have played Everquest for 2 years now.  In that time, I have met some of the greatest people I know to date.  To simply turn off the game one day and walk away never to return, that would be like getting up from church, work, the local bar, etc that you frequent and NEVER returning again.  All of those people that you have met and all of those people that you are part of their daily life on EQ, they will be effected by your leaving and never returning.  It is almost impossible to just get up and leave.  And, I am not saying that anybody should.  I am just explaining why it is impossible for me to break my EQ addiction, and I am saying that I do NOT want to break my EQ addiction.  I am just tired of hearing from the press, my non-EQ friends, and my family that EQ is bad for me and is an addiction.  Yes it is an addiction, but so is eating, sex, and any other self indulging activities.  Life is made up of addictions, it is how you deal with them that matters.<br>
<br>
As for the people that say that EQ is just a game and that the people that you meet in the game are not real and don't matter, I may have never met them in person, but I know the person behind the avatar.  Does a blind man NOT know the people that he interacts with on a daily basis?  Of course he knows them.  That is the same thing with Everquest.  I do not see you, but I interact with you every day, and hense the fact that I know you.  You are my friends... You are my enemies...  You are my aquantences(sp?)... You are the people that I interact with on a daily basis.  So, in that regard, I know you as well as a blind man knows the people he interacts with every day.<br>
<br>
I said before that EQ is addiction, but that addictions are not the problem because the problem lies in how you deal with the addictions.  Eating is an addiction.  We are all addicted to eating, but those of us that allow it to get out of hand have a problem... hense obesity(sp?).  I have let my EQ addiction get out of hand.  I play Everquest from 7pm to 2am Monday through Friday, All day Saturday, and All day Sunday.  This is where I have a problem.  I have a hard time controlling my addiction with Everquest because I have very bad time management skills.  It is not Verant nor Sony's fault that I have bad time management skills, and I do not hold them responsible for my issues.  I choose to play 50 to 55 hours a week, and that is my choice.  It is a bad choice, but it is my choice.  Nobody holds a gun to my head and forces me to play 50 to 55 hours a week.  Is this any different then being an alcoholic?  Those who are against Verant and Sony because they deem Everquest to be a bad addiction would have you believe that it is the same as being an alcoholic, but I completely dissagree.  Being an alcoholic has a lot to do with chemical reactions due to the alcohol.  Being an Everquest addict has to do with not being able to manage your time in the game.  They are completely different kinds of addictions.<br>
<br>
Do I need to cut back on the ammount of time I play Everquest each week?  Yes.  I was certain as of last night that I would go home after work today and uninstall Everquest, but I know I will not.  Infact, I am certain that I will be online playing again by 7pm tonight.  Will I be worse off for it?  Time will only tell, but I can not see why I should discontinue doing something that does not effect my work performance, does not take away from the love I have for my real life family, does not degrade my value of life, and brings me great pleasure and satisfaction.  In a world where only 1% of the population will ever reach a high level of success, wealth, health, and prosperity, I see no reason to discontinue an activity that allows ME to strive for and accomplish goals that allow ME to reach a high level of success too.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I want to reiterate that I am an Everquest Addict, and I believe that it is a healthy addiction as long as I learn to control it appropriately.  It is time to stop feeling ashamed to be addicted to something so rewarding as Everquest.<br>
<br>
Send me a tell some time and I will buy you a beer online, and hell I might even building you a tool box or lantern.  My smithing skills are too high yet =)<br>
<br>
Peace.<br>

You keep doing something (drugs, alcohol, EQ) in spite of negative consequences.  Playing a lot is not necc a bad thing.  Playing a lot to the detriment of your real life is where addiction comes in.  If you find you don't have time to properly study, work, or be with your family and you keep playing away; you most likely have a problem.  <br>

For example, Counterstrike seems largely populated by adolescent, hyperactive, snot-nosed kids, whose vocabularly seems limited to &quot;faggit,&quot; &quot;fuck u,&quot; and &quot;pwned.&quot;<br>
<br>
Everquest, on the other hand, (well, it has its share, too) seems to possess a much more high-brow gaming community.  It has people capable of speaking in complete sentences and who are not wholly sociopathic.<br>
<br>
There are exceptions however, I have found an excellent West Coast server for CS, based in Las Vegas.  Look up TZLV on google sometime for the URL, since I can't remember it.  <br>
<br>
The clan is highly regulated, the servers are cheat-protected, swearing regulated, and generally do not tolerate any sort of crap that would ruin the game for people.  These guys compliment each other, actually work together in PUB games (if you can believe that) and use their mics for proper effect.  Even the younger kids that play here are well-behaved.  <br>
<br>
Just like real life societies, it seems the more regulated the environment, the more civil and enjoyable the company.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kilvensk>KilvenSK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/28/02 4:59:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3425.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Agreed.</span><hr size=1> It strikes me funny that in a game like CS that revolves around hunting people down and killing them that people would regulate profanity.

55 hours a week is neither healthy nor appropriate, unless you're a wealthy deaf mute invalid with a highly contagious disease who has violent physiological reactions from any exercise, contact with the outside world, fresh air, sunlight, or actual physical proximity to other human beings. <br>

I know this is not healthy, and I am trying to change that, but at the same time, I am not going to condem playing Everquest because Everquest is not the problem here...
