That way it would be more of an event driven thingy, which they love to do since PoP.  <br>
<br>
For example, if the PoNightmare hedge maze were one groupable but identical in all other ways, it would fit into this concept imo, and there's no way you could blitz it to get to the end. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blargon>Blargon</A> at: 6/18/03 1:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ashture>Ashture</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/03 7:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4253.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Any knew thoughts?</span><hr size=1> I know I am digging this one up from pages away.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any knew thoughts on this upcoming Expansion.<br>
<br>
They are being more vague on this expansion than others that I have been around for. They have touched up on a few spells and on Item Augmentation that I like.<br>
<br>
They have not writen of any new AA abilities. I am hoping they do throw out some New AA. If anything if anyone has some nice links to rumors,news etc. <br>
<br>
They have the release date &quot;set&quot; for under a month away. Would like to see more opinions and how you feel this will effect EQ.<br>
<br>
They made some &quot;raid&quot; content max of 36. While its larger than the first &quot;vision&quot; for this expansion. I think its actually worse for high end guilds. Who have been forced to increase their roster size to compete in highend POP. It was one thing to be a one group expansion, its another to have 50-60 people on wanting some raiding action and telling many of them better luck next.<br>
<br>
While the argument could be made that you just do two 36 raids, and this is semi valid. It doesnt take into effect class number balance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok Druid/Pally Raid over here&quot;<br>
&quot;Everyone else come with me.&quot;<br>

<br>
Let me say firstly that I like the idea/concept of this expansion, tho a few &quot;possible problems&quot; need to get cleared up for us consumers(why is SOE always so vague about new expansions?) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the biggest concern I and most of you have is &quot;instancing&quot; of the dungeons. 40 dungeons x max of 6 people per party = 240 people max using all the dungeons at once. If the programmers have any brains left in their heads they will allow more then 1 instance(&quot;version&quot;) of each dungeon, otherwise you have a max of 240 people that can be accomodated by all the dungeons at any given time. Who wants to take odds that there will be more then 240 people wanting to try the new dungeons on release day of the expansion? If they only allow 1 instance/version of each dungeon per 45-90 min period, you may have alot of pissed off people on release day. If they are smart about this, and Im hoping they are, they will allow like up to 3 instances of each dungeon, boosting the max number of people that can play simultaneously to 720.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>All members of the group will be able to enter that dungeon to face the dangers there, but other player characters will not....Parties of five or six characters will be able to travel the Lost Dungeons.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This opens so many questions and concerns about how many people exactly can go in. What happens if, after you accept the quest but before you actually go INTO the dungeon, people in your group have to leave for some reason? Are we forced to go all the way BACK to the quest giver and look for new people again? Sounds like a possible big timesink in travel time if the answer to this is yes. They need to find a way to allow new people to join the group AFTER you accept the quest but BEFORE you actually go into the dungeon. I dont want to travel 6+ zones with my group of 5-6 and finally get to the outside of the dungeon, only to have people leave for some reason, then we have to trudge all the way back to the quest-giver and find more people to start a NEW group. Again, if they only allow 1 instance of each dungeon, your shit outta luck if you cant actually do the dungeon after all. You have to get back into the waiting list at the end and hope people dont leave again when its your turn to do the dungeon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;As you prove yourself to them, they'll allow you to pick from a large variety of rewards.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sounds like going into McDonalds and ordering a meal off the menu lol. Im wondering how they'll implement the &quot;pick from a large variety of rewards&quot; thing. will it be a &quot;window-list&quot; of items each person can pick from? Also, can each item on the &quot;reward list&quot; be chosen more then once? Otherwise you may have greedy people picking the best items leaving the lesser stuff to the rest of the party.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tell us about the new in-game interface that tracks players' progression through the dungeons? Shawn Lord: It's really too early to discuss this. We will be working more in the future to track players' accomplishments, but what this will mean to them is still a bit of a secret.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This could be a 2 edged sword. What it sounds like is a &quot;save game&quot; feature after you finish each dungeon in the overall &quot;quest&quot;. But what happens if people have to leave midway thru the dungeon leaving you with less then 5-6 people? Does it save each person at a specific dungeon-location-level? What happens if each person progresses and gets saved at different &quot;levels&quot; of the quest? Do the people that are farther ahead in the &quot;quest&quot; have to go back in &quot;content/quest level&quot; if they wanna group with a friend that isnt as far ahead as them in the overall quest? Really wondering how theyre gonna do this &quot;progression tracking&quot; system.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How do players physically jump into the new locations? Do they need special items to gain access?  Shawn Lord: The NPC that gives you the adventure will also give you an idea about where that adventure will be located. Getting there is up to you. In fact, some of the challenge to a given adventure may be getting to it. Once your group arrives at the proper location, you will find an entrance. No special items are needed; you just need to have been sent on their adventure by the proper NPC.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, what happens if, after accepting the &quot;quest&quot; more then a few people have to suddenly leave? Are you sol for that dungeon crawl? If you are then that means lost time in travelling to said dungeon, and you have to find new people to make the 5-6 person group and go BACK to the quest giver and start over. If you HAVE to have 5-6 people in the group and cant add new people after you accept the quest, then this would truly suck. However, if they allow you to add new people somehow before you enter the dungeon, or allow you to have less then 5-6 people in the group, then I guess that would solve it.<br>
Whether you can have less then 5-6 people in the group, or if you can add new members after accepting the quest but before you actually enter the dungeon is a BIG question for me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Will you have to &quot;wait in line&quot; while other groups are in the dungeons?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, I hope not, seeing as this will be a new expansion, everyone and their mom will be there to try it out on the first few days. Hopefully they will have more then 1 &quot;instance&quot; of the same types of dungeons.<br>
<br>
Another question I have is will loot you get in the dungeons be &quot;tradeable&quot;(hi Bazaar mule loot) or no drop? I vote no drop but I've never been a big fan of the bazaar hehe.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;I wished they would of addressed CR's in the article, with the information I have presently, (admittedly not much) CR's look to be a huge pain.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, from the sounds of it, the only pain in doing CR's will be the travel time back to the dungeon, if you dont have a rezzer in the group. You wont have to worry about getting back to your body in the dungeon once you're back inside the dungeon, as all previous mobs will already be dead if you killed them all. You just walk back down to your body. If it works this way though, I would kind of hate it actually. Some of my favorite memories were having to do a CR deep in a dungeon w/o a rezzer and no way to get back down to your body easily(hi Sebilis! lol).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;I would hate to show up only to find my team is #39 on the waiting list.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, I think this is one of my biggest questions about the expansion. Waiting lines are no thx. Especially on release day of the expansion when everyone and their mom wants to try out the new dungeons at the same time. Will they allow more then 1 instance of the same &quot;dungeon&quot;?? Big if, and I hope the answer is yes. If not, then you'll have 40 dungeons x 6 people per group = 240 people can only use the new expansion at a time max. Not very big numbers imo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and these are just dungeons - i'm pretty sure big bosses will still require 2-3groups<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Do you mean the big bosses at the end of each dungeon? If so, I dont see where they said you can have 2-3 groups for it in the article. If you're talking about something else, sorry for the mis-quote hehe.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long post, I like the idea of the new expansion, but theres so many questions that need to be answered before the release date. Tho knowing this games' track record, we wont get much more explanation than what we have, and there will be alot of turmoil and needed patches everyday for the first 2 weeks after release.<br>
<br>
Hopefully they allow more then 1 instance of each dungeon(like maybie 3 or so). Hopefully they figured on every player on the server wanting to try the dungeons at the same time, and made preparations to allow that. Hopefully. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
First of all, it is single groupable.<br>
<br>
Second....Funny you should mention the hedge maze since it has been a &quot;multi-crawl&quot; system for quite a while now.  When you tell the NPC you're ready to go, they put you in the maze.  Another group comes along and also tells him they're ready, they're not in the same maze you are.  There are 3 groups that can do the quest at once.  At least that was the way it was a few months ago =P.  Been a while since i've tried that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Point being...i think this is how they'll adress the issue about waiting in line for crawls.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and the &quot;boss mob&quot; in a paticular dungeon crawl should be the same difuculty dependant on the number/composition of the party.  I believe they'd make the dungeon difficulty by making the mobs to the front easier than further in.<br>
<br>
But everything is speculation and we could all be wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p>Gen. George Patton — &quot;Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!&quot;<br>

<br>
Lost Dungeons of Norrath Adventures<br>
The Lost Dungeons of Norrath is our largest expansion to-date, featuring the most content ever delivered in an EverQuest expansion. The Lost Dungeons expansion features 48 new dungeons that span the old world of Norrath, focusing on several long lost locations, including the Rujarkian Hills and Deepest Guk. Encounter never before seen monsters that prowl the halls of these dungeons, waiting to challenge any explorer brave enough to venture in.<br>
<br>
In this expansion, players are introduced to several exciting new concepts in adventuring through the world of EverQuest. After joining the Wayfarers Brotherhood, you and your group undertake perilous new adventures into the recently unearthed Lost Dungeons of Norrath. These new adventures offer many benefits, including a clearly defined goal, the ability to play and make progress in a couple hours per adventure, and the confidence that you can set a time to meet your friends and have a dungeon fully available for you right away - no competition and no waiting!<br>
<br>
Additionally, one of the most important gameplay improvements we've made in Lost Dungeons of Norrath is the introduction of personalized dungeon adventures for single groups. When you and your group receive an adventure, you're provided with a full dungeon exclusively for your own use. There's no need to worry that you're competing against others to reach the same goal, or that someone might already be camping there. All the focus is on having fun, which allows you to get lost in the adventuring and fighting to accomplish your objective. The challenge is the dungeons themselves - if you can best the Lost Dungeons, you deserve the rewards.<br>
<br>
Lost Dungeons of Norrath breaks the mold of traditional zones by allowing every zone in the expansion to provide adventures for all groups between levels 20 and 65. Each time you embark on a new adventure, you're sent to one of 48 distinct dungeon zones, each customized with challenging monsters and traps tailored to the level of your group. This means, as long as you're over level 20, you'll have 48 challenging new dungeons to explore and conquer! <br>
<br>
Beyond the hundreds of single-group adventures in the Lost Dungeons expansion, you can also join up to 36 of your friends for powerful raid encounters! Take part in several new raids that you can do on your own schedule, with no competition or racing against other guilds. Set up raiding times that are convenient for you and your friends, with the knowledge that the dungeon will be there waiting for you when you log in!<br>
<br>
The Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will redefine EverQuest by providing an enormous amount of adventuring possibilities, with the addition of massive amounts of content to the game - far more than any previous expansion. <br>

hmm sounds good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Wonder if that means you can set a time on a different day, like the next day, and still be &quot;flagged&quot; as in that &quot;quest&quot; and just be able to go into the dungeon? That would be sweet I think.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lost Dungeons of Norrath breaks the mold of traditional zones by allowing every zone in the expansion to provide adventures for all groups between levels 20 and 65. Each time you embark on a new adventure, you're sent to one of 48 distinct dungeon zones, each customized with challenging monsters and traps tailored to the level of your group. This means, as long as you're over level 20, you'll have 48 challenging new dungeons to explore and conquer!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
