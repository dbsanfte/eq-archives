<br>
Fifty, if not more people, cancelled all their real life appointments and reserved the entire weekend just to be able to participate in this raid. When the time was there and everyone was gathered at Greater Faydark, we found out that a guild called Legion of the Royal Dragoon (aka Lords) did not respect our reservation, even had a /guildmotd urging their members to arrive at Fear before LoM did, so that they could steal our reservation and claim the plane theirs.<br>
<br>
Not even one minute had passed after we inserted into Hate, until Lords members started scolding at us, cursing at us and carrying out personal attacks on us. Lords even called a GM to ask Verant to disband our guild for not respecting their Blitzkrieg in Hate. Our raid leader was summoned to Qeynos Catacombs to talk things over with Lords. The result of this conversation, that lasted 1-1.5 hours while the entire guild was waiting for instructions, was that the GM's decided to let us share the plane. Though the plane was rightfully ours, LoM agreed to sharing the plane, as the GM's did not give us any other choice.<br>
<br>
We continued insertion, only to be bashed, cursed and threatened again by Lords. However, we persisted and did not answer these attacks. Our guild policy is, and has always been, that whenever we are attacked, we smile... and walk away. However, several hours later, it turned out that the plane was too smal for the both of us. The Lords camp would die by trains caused by our camp (not intentionally) and our camp would die by trains caused by Lords.<br>
<br>
In the end, we thought it was best to stop the entire operation, smile... and walk away. We left the plane, 2000 plat of Hate stones poorer. I will not mention the incredible loss of experience and time (including 3 weeks of planning). Not to forget the incredible frustration of our guild members and all members from other guilds that were invited because of these great injustice.<br>
<br>
Golom, the guild leader of Lords, told us he was looking forward to the day on which we would be able to share a beer and laugh about all this. I have one advice for GoloM:<br>
<br>
Make sure your reservation at the bar gets respected. It might be taken by another guild.<br>
<br>
More information on this incident will be posted by one of our guild members soon, including screenshots and proof.<br>
<br>
What follows is just my decision and my decision alone:<br>
<br>
All Lords members I will meet in this game from now on, will, as long as they wear their Lords tag:<br>
<br>
- Not get ports<br>
- Not get TL's<br>
- Not get me in their group<br>
- Not get their corpses dragged by me<br>
- Not get any reply to their tells<br>
<br>
Instead, I will smile... and walk away.<br>

We do not have a reservation system on this server.  You can post your intent that you want to go somewhere on a certain date, but all the guilds have agreed and respected FCFS policy.  I think the only reason this section of the board is up, is to try and avoid conflicts, such as what you are talking about.  But, that still does not reserve the Plane for your guild, if another guild beats you into the Plane.  If we were going to have a reservation system, I am pretty sure we would have a calander up, like back on The Rathe *shiver*.<br>
<br>
Does sound like that other guild was being a bunch of asses, and should have tried to resolve the issue without the name calling and cursing or whatever was going on.  Sorry you didnt get to do your raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=yomarbalthasar>Yomarbalthasar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(9/23/01 7:13:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Unwritten rules</span><hr size=1> I think the main problem is the fact that Lords did this willfully and intentionally. They *knew* we planned going to Hate several weeks ago, and they also knew very well what they were doing when they made their guildmotd (on the day on which the raid would take place!) say &quot;get there before LoM today, so that we can own the plane&quot;. Lords knew very well what was going on, as some Lords members refused to port their fellow guildies up.<br>
<br>
I guarantee you that if all guilds start acting like this, none of us will ever be able to organize a plane raid, or a raid in any high level zone for that matter.<br>
<br>
I'm talking common sense, unwritten rules and tacit assumptions here. This act was foul and childish. I have no other words for it. This was aimed not only directly at LoM, but to all other guilds that participated in the raid, and the entire guild system on Norrath. <br>
<br>
Basically Lords is saying to all guilds in Norrath: we give you the finger, no matter what you plan, when you planned it and how much work you put into it. Remember this, because this is their message.<br>

<br>
1) I have rarely seen a situation where shouting verbal insults has changed the actual outcome of the situation. It does however make the shouter feel better about the situation as its a good way to vent frustration. Therefore, its easy to ignore lew and indecent comments. <br>
<br>
2) My understanding is that this server is FCFS for planes which means basically that they are like all the other zones in the game. Which means its a &quot;share policy&quot; which is difficult to work even in easy zones much less more challenging ones. Some zones just don't work well for sharing. I've heard that Fear is one of them.<br>
<br>
3) This could be the catalys that makes folks stop announcing their raids on planes. If you tell everybody that you are going to Hate on a particular date, then folks can get the jump on you. Its the same reason that folks don't bother using the turn signals on their car when driving in Boston: you are just giving the other guy ample warning to cut you off.<br>
<br>
I'd be very interested in hearing LoRDS side of this story right now. Especially why they chose to ignore the announcement and beat LoM to the plane. Yes, its not illegal but I think this is the first time we have had anyone invoke the FCFS rule in this way.  If it had happened before, I would have thought that folks would have had a bigger stir on the Crossroads.<br>

This is a FCFS server you were beaten to the plane...and then proceeded to train our party that was already engaged against the mobs. <br>

Of course there were insults flying (heat of the moment anger)  dont make it into more that that.<br>
<br>
In addition dont claim experience of hate, when your party was sat high on the wall and in your ignorance managed to pull down the second floor on both guilds for a second wipe out.<br>

Maybe next time you go to a plane and find someone else already there you will be more mature and go elsewhere...not train the raid already going on.<br>

<br>
I know you had issues with Yomar when you left, this is not the time to express them. <br>
<br>
Now Moldar, I want to hear from you in all honesty what happened that day. I hope I can still consider you to be a friend and beyond guild politics.<br>
<br>
Can you confirm that your guild rescheduled your plane raid that day from 4pm to 12pm or sooner?<br>
<br>
Can you confirm that the /guildmotd once asked everyone to scramble since LoM would insert at 12pm?<br>
<br>
Can you confirm the /guildmotd was changed after a while?<br>
<br>
Can you confirm that some members in your own guild refused to go to hate, or port others, once they realized what was happening?<br>
<br>
Will you state that your guild didn't know about our intentions of raiding hate that day at that very moment?<br>
<br>
Will you state that no matter what planning is being used, FCFS will overrule this?<br>

Game or not a game...What LoRD did is total Bullshit.<br>
<br>
I, and many other have put friends on complete ignore that are in LoRD.  As long as they wear that guildtag, they are not a friend of mine.  I will not buff a LoRD, Port a LoRD, or group with a LoRD.  <br>
<br>
I will click-off buffs given by LoRD's, I will not accept a Port from a LoRD.  I'd rather get a revive than stoop to the level of getting a rez from a LoRD.<br>
<br>
I hope you guys rot in peace. <p><BR><BR><BR><BR> <font face=</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uadonborealis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adon Borealis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tunare's n00b</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#333333>(9/24/01 2:18:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.legendsofmarr.com/membersonly/memberspictures/Adon.jpg height=322 width =143></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Someone bring this to Inferno </span><hr size=1> /sigh<br>

<br>
*Foreground Info: I was in Hate, as part of the first Legends group ported up. I did not die in Hate. I did not train anyone in Hate, nor witness *any* intentional training by either side.  I did see a lot of childish and moronic /ooc's and /shout's from Legion of Rejected Druids.*<br>
<br>
I wasn't going to comment but here goes:<br>
<br>
The only thing worse than FCFS being abused to the point of changing raid times and gmotds (&quot;WE HAVE TO BEAT LOM UP THERE&quot;) is asking for PNP.  For that reason I am glad that we as a guild decided to let the children have their toy, and moved out of Hate.<br>
<br>
I *do* like a handful of LoRDs, Laterius and Akuna in particular.<br>
<br>
The others I have had the displeasure of meeting appear to be just left overs from other guilds they were thrown out of.<br>
<br>
It really shows.  <br>

You say, 'We still have no problem with working together'<br>
Golom says, 'of course you would welcome it cause you cant do it yourselves'<br>
You say, 'if not, then we each take our seperate mobs and respect each others right to be there'<br>
You say, 'then so be it, we will die, then you will have the 2nd floor all to yourselves'<br>
Golom says, 'heh i garuntee LoM will get us all killed in 2nd floor '<br>

Isn't Golom a wonderful orator? Such diction! I wonder what dialect &quot;garuntee&quot; is? South Kaladim perhaps?<br>
<br>
Moldar, I thought you were in Forever Alienated? Aurah and I had a great chuckle when I saw that guild tag.<br>

<br>
He thought this was the 1st plane raid for us. Even though this would be the first Hate raid as a GUILD.  I have attended many Hate raids, and many members have been on many also.<br>
<br>
I guess the fact that we have 126 mains in our guild makes us newbies... <p><BR><BR><BR><BR> <font face=</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=174.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessageRange?topicID=174.topic&start=41&stop=57>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessage?topicID=181.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showMessage?topicID=176.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.emailToFriend?topicID=174.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.threadControl?topicID=174.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=174.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=174.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm31">ANNOUNCEMENTS<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm8">The Tavern<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm4">Raid Planning and Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm11">The Inferno<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm32">Thanks and Praise<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm34">Bottom Feeders<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm6">Non-EQ Discussions<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm5">Trader's Table<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm7">Polls<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm14">The Epic Quester<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm9">Legends and Lore<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm15">Bard's Studio<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm26">Cleric's Temple<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm16">Druid's Glade<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm23">Enchanter's Circle<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm22">Magician's Element<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm28">Monk's Dojo<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm21">Necromancer's Crypt<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm27">Paladin's Hall<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm30">Ranger's Lodge<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm17">Rogue's Hideout<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm20">Shadow Knight's Barrow<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm25">Shaman's Shrine<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm19">Warrior's Arena<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm18">Wizard's Tower<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm12">Need access to GM Den?<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm10">GM's Den<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm2">Moderators Discussion<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm13">Testing for Art<option value="thecrossroadstavern8833frm35">Camelot Connections</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bthecrossroadstavern8833>The Crossroads of Zebuxoruk</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11>The Inferno</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/">Zebu's Zanadu!</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
