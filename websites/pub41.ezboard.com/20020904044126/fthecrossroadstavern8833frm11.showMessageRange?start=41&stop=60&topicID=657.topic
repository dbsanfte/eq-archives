Now...I am confused here.  This whole flame loses credibility since your behavior was equally intolerable.   Your response to the other people's posts makes you look like you almost deserved to be trained.  Learn some tact, don't be a hypocrite, and I guarantee your chances will improve of actually resolving an issue without making yourself out to be the bad guy.  Sorry, I am sure it sucked for you, but I am finding a lot of trouble sympathizing with your plight if you can even hold yourself above acting childish.  What I quoted is actually more ideally why Seb and other places suck so bad.  Immature people with guns a blazing coming in trying to attack anyone regardless if it's an accident, misunderstanding...sounds like you didn't even care to hear the reasons.   <p><center><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117254">Ciffu Longwinded</a></b><br><I>The Token Monkey</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ulaeninraidge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laenin Raidge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://147.4.150.5/~jercole1/laenin.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/02 11:35:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cs.hofstra.edu/~jercole1/pics/laenin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Hmm, wait, I'm confused.

Then his first post is not too bad, and then people start flaming him for his initial post, and he is supposed to sit back? Wait . . . he loses credibility for using creative words such as chucklefuck in a flame forum? I got a laugh out of it. I love people who flame a flamer for flaming, and then don't expect to get flamed back. Assinine - get lives. They'll help with this whole reality thing . . .<br>
<br>
And Dethen II? I think not. I don't know the guy, but I've seen his posts. I think they're a lot more creative than Dethen's. <br>
<br>
The fact that some of you people cry about someone flaming in the flame forum is pitiful. You don't like it? Go read the Tavern messages. They're nice and family oriented . . . Either that, or get your friends in a line, synchronously pull your pants down, and have someone club the back man in the ass so you could train fuck yourselves for being so stupid!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucamoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Camoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 441<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/02 1:26:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> To me the funniest quote in this whole thread is:<br>

As for Herbi..he's still smartin' from a lashin' I gave him some time ago (and no, it wasn't &quot;their fault&quot; they were trained, Herbster...even time doesn't change facts) and he refuses to drop it. His only purpose in being in this thread is to attempt to flame, which, like most things, he fails miserably at. Which is fine, but he must expect more of the same from me...and I am an obliging sort, if nothing else. Hell, he probably still thinks he &quot;owns the /auction channel&quot; as he once told me, rofl. Were ye raidin Exit when ye died there, Herb? /guffaw<br>
<br>
If you are an insulated type who view other people in the game as obstacles to yer goals..why play a community-based game? The quality of EQ in general, and the upper-level zones in particular will be dictated by the quality of the people in them, and whether or not they can work well as a community. If all yer in the game for is to wreak havoc..well, there is room for that sort of thing, within certain parameters (&quot;I am an evil race, therefore chaos shall reign supreme!&quot;) but I doubt any roleplaying was going on in the instances I've listed. To me, being oblivious to another group and disrupting their gameplay as a result, is no less a sin than ninja-looting.<br>

You say that I wont drop it?  I didn't say a damn thing about the past until you felt the need to misrepresent a situation in which you didn't know the facts.  It WAS thier fault, they were in a stupid place fighting, right in the pull path of 4 other groups, I tried to FD before the mobs would add on them but it didn't work.  That is not purposely training someone, I would never do that.  So quit trying to make the claim that I am a trainer.  Go fuck yourself.... <p><html>

That is why I think your own actions need to be taken into account if you wish for this to come to fruition.  It's not a one way street.  How you handle yourself when being the victim or the one accused, speaks highly of your own character.   We have all had incidents similar if not worse to this one, and 90%+ of them are resolved peacefully, not like this.  There are better ways to handle it, and no Laenin, I am talking about &quot;in game&quot; not the flame forums, sorry you were confused by this. <p><center><B><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117254">Ciffu Longwinded</a></b><br><I>The Token Monkey</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uelmasoulseer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElmaSoulseer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/02 8:16:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the last thing you expect to see is a monk with 10 mobs behind him running at you FROM disco when the campcheck revealed that NOBODY was in disco/lib when you started working yer way there.

<br>
Ok, which is it? Was the monk coming FROM disco, or going TO disco?<br>
<br>
You've stated TWICE that he was coming FROM disco, but now you claim he was going TO disco? Make up your mind.<br>
<br>
It makes you sound all morally superior that he was training you while  you were on your way to disco, but there aren't enough mobs in that hallway to train 10+ on you. Which leads me to believe you are lying and he came FROM disco with the 10+ mobs and wass doing an AE group with friends.<br>
<br>
Obviously from comments like &quot;he was gonna make a massive pull, dammit, and impress his friends &quot; you have no concept of AE pulling. Yet you brag about how you're &quot;one step up from the KC crowd&quot; and you've &quot;Been in seblis for 4 months now!&quot; Get over yourself. You're not special because you've been going to seblis for 4 months.<br>

<br>
&quot;The ability to speak does not denote intelligence.&quot;<br>
<br>
So WHAT you've been there for 4 months? Do you want an award? This does not make you special and automatically qualified consultant on seblis etiquette and camp policy. Which becomes highly evident when you have no concept why a monk is pulling what you deem as &quot;trains&quot; when it is in fact a WEAK pull for his group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> when the campcheck revealed that NOBODY was in disco/lib when you started working yer way there.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> In this phrase, you imply that you called a camp check, and nobody &quot;RESPONDED&quot; to you.

Yay!<br>
<br>
We are working our way to disco, in Seb, which you and your 45 ranger twink are so well familiar with. It is late, there are not that many in the zone, perhaps 15. While working our way in the hall towards disco, you will encounter 4 spawns at the bridge, a single spawn on yer right, 3 spawn in an alcove on yer left, 2 roamers, 2 more spawns at the end of the hall on the left. This will put you in front of disco, where there are 2 beetles, a golem, a roamer frog and another frog which goes back and forth from left to right on the balcony. Inside disco you will find 15 spawns. With me so far Elma? Do I need to slow down? Ok, lets continue.<br>
<br>
We are at the first solo spawn in the hall, having cleared the 4 opposite the bridge. A monk comes from behind us, that is, from exit area, trailing behind him a frog. Ok, no big deal, the frog adds as he passes us on his merry way to disco, we take care of our original frog and are working on his add when Lo! Behold! Here comes the monk FROM disco, with 10 frogs on his back. As we are engaged with a mob, and these mobs in Sebilis are what is known as &quot;social&quot;, it can be easily deduced what happens next:  Mainly, all 10 of the mobs that were chasing the monk are now busy chasing our cleric and casters. &lt;Pause to let Elma absorb this&gt; Guess what? Our wizard, a 60 wizard I might add, goes down. Not much of a tank. So, our chanter mezzes all the mobs, our cleric who is oom now goes to exit, followed by the rest of my party, except myself, who, having gotten consent, proceeds to drag the wizzie's corpse to entrance and then I, too, must zone. <br>
<br>
Where during all this, do you suppose the original puller was? Nowhere in sight, one might wonder if you were in his shoes, my god, what happened to my great big pull? Wouldn't you wonder that? Maybe stop and turn around and see where they went? Not our faithful hero! He had tore ass back to Bar, where his group was. Upon zoning in, I asked him, I said..&quot;WTF?&quot;. Now, do you suppose that he would admit that he had made an error? Nooooo. Just like Herbi (and truthfully, I don't have PC names on, so I couldn't tell at the time, but my first impression was that it WAS Herbi, lol...same tactics I've seen from him in the past, i.e.-NO FD, No attempt to right the wrong, total denial, followed by reluctant admittance, never ever a &quot;Sorry about that&quot;) he would like to play the game whereby the whole incident was just a figment of our group's collective imagination. <br>
<br>
Now, is there anything in that that you would like to cut/paste? You sure are good at that, I bet you can find something in there, but basically, you'd be wasting even more of our time, wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
As for the subsequent camp steal event, its pretty simple. As we approached our camp and were fighting beside rock, we saw Alwayyz sitting there. He hadn't pulled anything, and we sent him tells (we being our cleric and also for good measure our chanter) that we were returning to our camp after a brief delay. Now then, do you suppose he responded? Do you suppose he acknowledged this information? Nope, of course not, and just before we had killed the final mob between us and our camp, he decided he had best pull the named beetle. These decisions are made entirely in a world of fantasy, in an electronic game....and of course there is nothing that can be done about it. I record these events for posterity. So sue me. Get yerself all in a tizzy. Hell, you've got nothing better to do..here, let me make a suggestion.<br>
<br>
This post of mine could have been entirely unnecessary if people had mastered the basics of reading comprehension in 4th grade. I want to help. I don't expect any compensation for this advice. Here's what ye do-Buy yerself a newspaper. Using whatever means at yer disposal, try and find the comic section. I recommend starting with Marmaduke or Beetle Bailey. After ye feel comfortable with these, work yer way up to Garfield or even Helga. By now, its probably taken you oh, a month..and yer ready for yer next step! Go for the Sunday Edition! It's gonna be rough at first, there can be as many as 8 frames for you to work on at once, but have faith. Ok, once ye've got Sunday down..go to the store and buy yerself a comic BOOK! Oh my, yer in the bigtime now! No need to thank Uncle Savej...Eventually, you will find that most, if not all, your misconceptions will disappear as you master the art of reading!! Congratz in advance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ubburlydorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BBurlydorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#333333>(7/12/02 7:08:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> I want to be sure about my reading comprehension level -<br>

Some monk pulled through your group, a Wizard died and you had to zone?<br>
<br>
A Paladin pulled a named beetle while your group was working it's way to that camp?<br>
<br>
Now let's check your reading comprehension level. This is the Flame Forum. See it at the top left corner of your window? Flame Forum - not the I've Got a Knot in My Pantaloons and It's Starting to Chafe Forum. Got it?<br>

You gave a tell about a half hour after I thought I may have trained some people that looked as if they were chasing a &quot;runner&quot; but went ld after kills and came back and no corpses were in the area so assumed it was alright.  Anyhow ya based the whole thing on me bein the only unanon iksar monk in zone and went off for no reason since ya weren't even certain.  Anyhow I still offered to help out and CR even after you bein a complete prick because i felt obligated to since I thought there was a slight chance it coulda been my fault.  And got a &quot;fuck off and learn how to play your class&quot; remark so I didn't even bother tryin to find out more as to what happened...but by what you say now I know it wasn't me.  Anyways I tried to be helpful and give the benefit of the doubt only to get bitched out so whatever, have fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/udadethemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dade the Mad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.theglobe.com/Dade_the_Mad/WEEDISINFO.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#333333>(7/12/02 8:18:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.miratos.com/forums/avatar.php?userid=121&dateline=1013055285 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> What I don't get is if you're so classy why can't you say &quot;bah just a game, you get rezzed you move on.&quot; -DrOak ;p<br>

 #1 Succor takes you to the entrance and wipes your aggro. I'd figure you know this, you're acting like a druid solo'er.<br>
<br>
 #2 Alwayzz didn't respond to your tell....there are a number of reasons this could happen. Alwayzz is well known, he could have been in a Tellstorm. He could have been talking to his group. He could have been masturbating furiously while picturing your corpse. Just because someone doesn't respond to you dont think that validates an arguement. I get so many tells that I usually miss or drop at least 3 conversations a night.  Not that you could understand that, see, I'm an asshole not a dickhead. People talk to assholes cause they're funny. People don't talk to dickheads because they're dickheads. <p><center>

Can't succor when yer wizzy just got killed, can ye?<br>
I would love to use less words here, yet here we are with 2 rehashes, etc and people still don't know the plotline. And yes, with 15 people in a zone, and the one monk wearing the exact same outfit and wielding the exact same weapons and who grudgingly admits he did train someone earlier, not sure who it was cuz he doesn't bother looking back, an assumption was made, based on information he was giving me..in tells, I might add. It is the sum total of events in the zone that prompted me to flame, and I have no problem being flamed back...I'd just like to see a little more creativity here, dammit.<br>
If you disagree with my point that people should be held accountable at the risk of zones being turned into train-fests like KC and ME, by all means get on it but try and justify these asshole's actions. There cannot be the alibi that they were &quot;ignorant of the situation&quot;, unless you believe OJ was innocent and Al Gore invented the internet. Ignorant in general, perhaps...but not in this instance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usavejarete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Savej Arete</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(7/12/02 1:16:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sebilis-The death of a fine zone (</span><hr size=1> *edit*<br>
