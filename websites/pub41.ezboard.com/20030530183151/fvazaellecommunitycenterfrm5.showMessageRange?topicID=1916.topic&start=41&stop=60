<br>
I was looking to drink at work, not get wasted just something to get me by.  That doesn't mean I wanted to be a drunk 24/7.  I drink at home occassionally but only when my son is in bed.  I'm not a drunken, abusive mother.  And I posted this half jokingly (HALF!!!) because:<br>
<br>
a.  I was drunk at the time<br>
b.  I am pretty fucking desperate<br>
<br>
Yes, I had a child.  No, I didn't plan on being a single mom.  I raised him in a two parent household for 5 years out of an 8 year marriage where we owned a $150k house in Wisconsin.  I never thought I'd be a single mother so I didn't bring him into this world thinking that would be a factor.  I had a husband with an addiction that I could not beat and he has yet to beat.  I chose to discontinue raising my son in that environment.  Is he better off now?  I don't know but I made that decision and I've been doing the best I can to do right by my decision.  I do not have family support financially (no, Goanad they do not live in a trailer but rather a house on a valley in Hawaii).  I no longer have friends because:<br>
<br>
a. The significant other in my life fucked one of them<br>
b. The other friend I had pursued my significant other while I was still with him<br>
<br>
I'm not looking for sympathy, my original post was for advice.  I appreciate those who are understanding and can relate and to those who don't....well, it's not all black and white out there.  There isn't one band aid that will fit all wounds.  Sometimes things happen in life to you believe it or not, and without your desire or willingness to have them happen.  I didn't ask to get downsized and laid off.  I didn't ask to be in a relationship where I was taken advantage of and used.  But I am trying to make the best of things that I can.  As you get older you will see that there's not always an easy and quick answer to all.  And someday you'll be in a situation where you can't figure it out and it will hit you.<br>
<br>
Yes, I have seeked out help, what help I can afford.  I do have a therapist I see twice a month (I have no insurance and it's all I can afford).<br>
<br>
I can assure you that my child is neither being abused nor neglected.  I think that everyone who knows me thinks I'm a good mother.  My child is very well taken care of.  He's in the gifted class at school and has never once been in trouble.  He's a straight A student and will continue to be so because I am there for him.  I don't know where he gets it from and it's truly a testament to who he is that he is so good.  I was never this good as a child and he amazes me.  He inspires me to be a better, kinder, more caring person because he says things (which he comes up on his own with) like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Just because you are better than someone at something doesn't mean that you should tell them you are better than them, you aren't actually better than them because of that&quot;<br>
<br>
He's very compassionate and caring and no matter what, I will always make sure that I foster that in him and don't ruin that regardless of whether I drink at work (which I probably won't).  <br>
<br>
Yes, I tend to numb my pain through pot and alcohol.  I know it's not healthy but it currently gets me by.  I'm just in the worst rut of my life right now and I know it won't last forever but it sure seems like it has.  I'm pounding the ground like mad looking for another job but it seems that, like me, everyone is taking a job they are overqualified for just to get by.  <br>
<br>
Rathic, I don't recall ever conversing with you on anything other than another thread where I disagreed with your views on single parenting and working at 7-11.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening to me ramble...<br>

You picked a tough state to come to and work. At least in the sense that attitudes on employee\employer relations are not all that progressive here in Texas. Probably like that in the south, in general, actually. <br>
<br>
Not sure how this would work, but Texas is a large state with metro areas in not only Dallas, but Houston and San Antonio. If relocation is not out of the question, then perhaps widening your search to these other areas? <br>

stress of a single parent?  <br>
working two , three jobs to pay for a nice house and letting daycare raise our kids, and hardly spending time at home. getting your 3 year old child up at 5:30 am cause you have to work. <br>
listening to rat faced punks spew forth the moral majority crap they learned the past 15 years and knowing that your cars right outside and has a chainsaw in the trunk.<br>

Ammer, <br>
best thing you can do is try to get into a munincipality, state city, county, whatever. the pay is not great but most have flex-hours for single parents, theres planty of training for any number of careers, benefits kicks ass, (example) i can take 9 days off as civic days during the year, for fieldtrips or volunteering or jury duty.<br>

Rathic, you pubescent, arrogant, ignorant misogynistic boil on the scrotum of a botulism infested rat. You sir have proven that human beings have at last thrown off the shackles to Darwin's laws. As much as I would love to believe your sex life will continue to consist of masturbating to prurient fantasies of lascivious, loose women spread-eagled to receive your holy sperm and trap you into fatherhood, I know it is not true. There is always some women debased, and degraded enough to put up with almost anything. But know this young man: She will be there because she doesn't think she deserves or, or can do any better. <br>
<br>
Not that I can get through your little mind, but almost no  one plans on being a single parent.<br>
<br>
The eighteen down the street just became a single parent when her boyfriend got put in jail after he put her in the hospital for the second time. She will take him back because she learned at home that she deserves whatever beatings she gets. The hard part is, who gets to raise her kids when he finally kills her. The home that produced her, or the one that produced him? <br>
<br>
There was my mother who became a single parent at 34 when my father drowned.<br>
<br>
There was a friend of mine, when her husband started beating her son instead of her finally realized she had to get out. One night when he was passed out she loaded the kids in the car one only 2 months old) and got out.<br>
<br>
There was another friend who was brought up as a vegetarian. His mother found that if she didn't feed her kids meat she could afford go to school to get a degree for a better job. She became a single parent when his father left for another women. The father made 300k a year, but hid all his assets and had the money to hire lawyers to keep it hidden. The chore that this friend hated the most was chasing the rats out of the rice, or the rice wouldn't last out the winter.  <br>
<br>
There was my sister who walked out of her marriage of 10 years after a suicide attempt. She realized if she stayed she would die. After she left she realized that 13  years of emotional abuse and alcoholism combined with a tenancy to clinical depression was the problem, not that she was nuts. She wound up with the kids when he hit a parked car with the kids in the car. He totaled the car and didn't even know he had hit it. His blood alcohol level was 3 times the legal limit. <br>
<br>
Another friend who had been planning a pregnancy for 2 years, and when she finally got pregnant her husband decided maybe he didn't want to be a father after all. <br>
<br>
Of all these people, and several more I can mention, I don't know one of them that fits your fantasy Rathic. In the long run it doesn't even matter. The parents of these children have to be able to provide a good home for them and educate them. Society will pay for it at one end or the other. If we help those parents now then perhaps we don't have to build jails for the kids. <br>

Hats of to you and all the other single moms (and dads, of course).<br>
<br>
Rathic, you are a prejudiced asshole. You don't know her situation, maybe she was unresponsible for having a child, maybe not, but who the fuck are you to comment on it ? Nobody chooses to be put in a situation like that.<br>
<br>
Life isn't something you can plan, if you want to be sure you are really 100 % ready for children before you have 'em, you can't have children at all.<br>
<br>
Sure, nobody forces you to have sympathy for her, but you don't have to be an asshole about it.<br>
<br>
On one hand I think, maybe Ammerique shouldn't have posted it here, on the other hand, only narrowminded pieces of shits like you make a problem out of it.<br>
<br>
All I know, she didn't conciously choose for this situation and I sincerely hope it gets better for her, regardless of whether it is her own fault or not. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26345">Merrahar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The Liquor you are looking for is Capella Hazelnut, it goes great with coffee with no alcoholic aroma to it. Just like a coffee condiment with a hell of alot more kick to it<br>

Drinking does not solve your problems but it does make the seemingly unbareable... bareable.<br>

Sometimes I wonder if the teen-to-twenties crowd in EQ realizes that sometimes when an older EQer gets all hot and bothered when they are normally quiet, that perhaps it's because someone's pushed a &quot;hot button&quot; issue like this that taps pretty deep seated feelings\memories like this. Sometimes all you hear from the younger crowd is &quot;god damn, soandso is tripping balls over nothing.&quot; <br>
<br>
Of course I really don't thinkg 25 to 40ish is necessary &quot;old&quot; but I'm prolly in a minority on that.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=finelen>Finelen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/03 8:42:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1916.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gah</span><hr size=1> Well. There are some very good suggestions on these boards. While government jobs hardly seem sexy you do have a lot of recourse for changing supervision or reporting a truly evil boss to their superious for their abusive idiotic ways.<br>
<br>
As for alcohol. Its a well used legal drug. But not, I think, appropriate for you at this moment. You can glean a lot of staisfaction from education and the fact is, school = better pay. Especially if you are persuing an education specifically tailered to a profession that pays well.<br>
<br>
Pot is another problem. Right or wrong, it is illegal. I would hate to see you swept into some silly police sting that landed you in court with social services later taking your child. There are some things we just have to give up when we are parents and this is one of them.<br>
<br>
I am guessing that your therapist is pointing out that there are better coping mechanisms than substance induced escapism. As a few have already pointed out, having a plan to make things better then working a little bit each day on that plan can be very satisfying.<br>
<br>

AMAZING.  trully, you all know everything about me, just because someone i dont like came onto a message board based about a fantasy game into a forum about RANTS AND FLAMES, and i FLAMED her for posting that she cannot cope with being a single mom and wanted some type of alcohol or drug to deal with work.  I AM COMPLETELY AND 100% OFF BASE.  clearly she came on here to spread sunshine and lollypops and i just twisted it didnt i.<br>
<br>
secondly, FIGURE OUT YOUR FUCKING CONTEXT.  with out a doubt fact is - IF U FUCK WITH NO CONDOM U MAY HAVE A CHILD.  and in such u should look to the responsibility of having a child and not BITCH about it.  yes, having your husband drown would blow major ass, and im sorry to hear it, it must be hard... THIS IS NOT THE FORUM IN WHICH TO EXPRESS YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS.<br>
<br>
we r not all friends here, im not someones personal fucking support group.  perhaps when i decide i wanna talk about some unusual growth on my back and want people to fall all over me to prevent me from offing myself i should post here?<br>
<br>
marrying someone is accepting the responsibility of life, and life happens... its not always pretty.  an 18 year old mom should know fucking well enough shes not well enough off to be supporting a child, and shouldn't stay with an abusive boyfriend regardless.  but im an asshole cuz i think she made a mistake and now she refuses to better her life.<br>
<br>
what i love is that all the late 20's and people who r 35 in here, bitching me about this shit... YOUR PLAYING A FANTASY GAME MORE THAN YOU SPEND TIME WITH YOUR CHILDREN.  (no dont go omfg i spend more time with my kids than i do on here, thats some assinine petty BS - im making a generalization)  i feel im smart enough not to get in a position of having a child.. and if by chance i did, i wouldnt bitch about it, id handle my responsibility to myself AND my kid.  so dont be so fucking quick to judge.  last thing id be doing as a single parent would be to play this fucking game - i know better.<br>
<br>
if your gonna talk down to someone, at least grow the fuck up.<br>

<br>
I haven't looked at this thread because by the title I assumed it was something stupid as fuck.  Someone asked me to look at their reply so I read it.  This was the last type of post I expected to see in rant and flames, let alone an EQ forum.<br>
<br>
Here's my stance whether anyone likes it or not.<br>
<br>
You are what's wrong with the world.<br>
<br>
You were ignorant, you fucked up.  Can you deny it? Nope.<br>
<br>
Now your life is shitty, you're having a hard time 24/7, and pissed off.<br>
<br>
Boom, we now see a great example of Cause and Effect.<br>
<br>
What was the cause? You were a stupid trashie ho.<br>
What was the result? You fucked your life up beyond all reason.<br>
<br>
Was it worth it?  I sure hope so.<br>
<br>
Now let's forget all that for now, and look at this new one.<br>
<br>
Potential cause: Turning to alcohol as a resolution for problems.<br>
Potential effect: hmm.. wait.. is anyone seeing a pattern here?<br>
<br>
My life is all fucked up blah blah blah, my pussy hurts, blah blah blah, i fucked up when i was young and had a kid because I thought billbobjoe loved me. BLAH BLAH BLAH.  What should i do? I KNOW!! ALCOHOL ON THE JOB!<br>
<br>
WOOT! UBER IDEA!<br>
<br>
Let's see how much I can fuck with my life further.<br>
<br>
*fastforward to new resume*<br>
<br>
Previous Job and why you left: Jimjim's Business - cause of leave, fired for drinking on the job and things that ensued as a result of it.<br>
<br>
Albeit no one would ever put that on their resume, I was just making a point. We have the cash in right there.  CHA-CHING, thank you and good night.<br>
<br>
I have not even the SLIGHTEST hint of sympathy for you.  You made a bad choice, and now you're living with the result.  In fact, I know your post said you're not looking for sympathy but advice.  I would never ever even lift a finger to assist a person like you, let alone give advice. I am even a quite caring and helpful person in real life contrary to my EQ persona (ask anyone who's talked to me or met me).<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for your kid.  Unlike you, he was never presented with the choice to pick whether he wanted to fuck his life up.  He was forced into this world and will most likely now never have the opportunities that would be presented to him with parents who cared about their own lives.  Imagine that, that kid could have possibly made a great life for himself and had such motivation to become someone who made a difference in the world, and you're stiffling that opportunity because you wanted some h0t sexx0r with billybobjoe.  Christ almighty.<br>
<br>
I'm sure i'll get flamed out the ass for this but why feign an opinion, this is what I think.<br>
<br>
I hope you do find your alcoholic resolution for your oh so unbearable job, just so I can come back and read the post of how you got fired or how it fucked your life up even more and you wish you never turned to alcohol.<br>
