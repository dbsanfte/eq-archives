First let me say THIS IS NOT A RANT ABOUT IV!  I just want everyone to understand the situation.<br><br>A group of us were heading to CS to get port teeth for Bojee and Yoshiki, and maybe some guardian armor for Diffo.  We made the run from IC to Skyshrine to find IV at zone line clearing the way to Yelinak.  We made the run out during a break from IV clearing the way and proceeded to CS.  <br><br>We obtained the keys we needed and where heading back to SS because Yoshiki wanted to buy his spells and we wanted to find a safe spot to camp out of IV's way.  None of us in the group knew anything about SS or where Yelinak was or where they were pulling him.  Yoshiki was checking a map trying to figure out where he spawned and if we would be in any danger zoning back in from CS.  I ran ahead to the SS port area.  The real rant starts there.  I have edited out all the guild chat, /auctions, spell casting, jboot clicking etc.  I know I should have taken screen shots also, but just wasn't thinking clearly.  <br><br>I would also like to say I do not know Lolith, nor have I ever seen her before.  I have been on Vazaelle since Jan 10, 01 as has Diffo, since he is my son I can attest to that.  I met Bojee in Oasis at level 16, and while Yoshiki is a late comer to EQ, he also has been here since day one of his characters conception.  <br><br>I am not sure what Lolith's problem was with us, but I certainly hope I never encounter another situation like this again.<br><br>Keleios 56 Templar<br><br><br><br>[Wed Aug 22 21:22:43 2001] Yoshiki tells the group, 'is kel with us?'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:22:46 2001] Lolith says, 'what posessed you to run iun the exact opposite direction from what you were told'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:22:48 2001] You tell your party, 'at port out'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:23:02 2001] Amenta says, 'I gotta go inside, have you talked to Snuggle yet?'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:23:09 2001] Lolith says, 'mdo NOT go inside'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:23:41 2001] You say, 'is it not safe to go in?'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:23:52 2001] Lolith says, 'go away Keleios'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:24:13 2001] Yoshiki tells the group, 'are they your friends?'<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:24:14 2001] Lolith begins to cast a spell.<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:24:19 2001] Amenta begins to cast a spell.<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:24:19 2001] Amenta fades away.<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:24:20 2001] Amenta's casting is interrupted!<br>[Wed Aug 22 21:24:23 2001] You say, 'that was rude, and uncalled for.
