<br>
Ok, first off, let's clear up a few things: This wasn't a rant directed at IV for those that couldn't follow what I was saying.  This was an explanation of the types of things that some individuals do that makes uber guilds in general and IV in specific disliked by some.<br>
<br>
In fact, I think I made it pretty damn clear throughout that in general I have no problem with what IV did, but that we were put off a bit by what one person in the guild said in /shout.<br>
<br>
Second: Yah, we wiped out in ToV twice.  How many times did IV wipe out their first time there?  Endless?  CC?  2 wipeouts in a 6 hour hunt in our first trip to ToV ain't doing so bad, I think.  Both of 'em came early in the night.  The first was when a drake ran.  We weren't ready for that, we didn't know how fast they run and we were all lagged out bad by the sudden influx of people into the zone.  We learned, changed tactics, and never had another runner.<br>
<br>
The second wipeout came after Krimzin suggested we alternate pulls.  I am fully aware that even alternating pulls slowed down your progress through the zone.  There is no way we can take the mobs down as fast as you can.  It was cool of you to suggest it and it did a lot to ease some of the tension.  Unfortunately, we can not handle the pulls at the same pace as IV can.  If we did, we would be killing Yelinak and Dain and Telk... When Krimzin said the next pull was a wurm and asked if we wanted it or not, I should have said no, we aren't ready for a wurm... but I didn't.  We weren't ready, we took too many casualties and we didn't have enough melee left standing to push the wurm or nukers to fry it and it gated.<br>
<br>
Yah Befb, we can't do ToV at your pace.<br>
<br>
Once you moved in and we were able to take it at our own pace, we did just fine.  We took the first 8 mobs out in 20 minutes or less each spawn rotation.  We managed a total of 6 drops... How is that possible with 30 minutes down time between pulls?  Answer: It's not.  No, we weren't ready for the wurm when you pulled it... but we pulled a few wurms of our own when we were ready and did just fine.  <br>

I don't think it was a legitimate threat, and I don't think 1 or 2 comments define our attitude as a guild, but i guess you see it that way. <br>
Frankly, I have a problem listening to someone who would willingly guild Sinlier/Demised/Phamen/Chantin/whoeverelse, and then make comments about us not being &quot;decent people&quot;. Those 2 fuckwads have trained how many people over the course of the servers' life? That's not really the issue tho, but i think you're overreacting to a comment made out of frustration and or impatience. Really, im glad i zoned in and was able to help kill Arreken Skyward or whoever, cause i know how much wiping out in there can suck. But rest assured i did it to help out the decent folks in PO, not you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/usolidsnakeiv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SolidSnakeIV </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Junior Member</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/01 3:22:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck Off IV</span><hr size=1> The warrior who tries to claim nbg on a siblisian cloak while wearing a CoF, will never have my respect either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uvehn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vehn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/01 3:27:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=65>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck Off IV</span><hr size=1> No Keadaian you can choke on my cock.

<br>
And please spew more bullshit.  Spells taking 20 seconds to cast?  Are you fucking joking?  Your fights with entryway mobs were taking about 3 minutes each.  Here's some VALUBLE RAID ADVICE: SNARE MOBS you fucking moron.  Actually that's about what I expect from someone who made the MONK PULLER main assist on a kedge raid, and then when he died and 3 swirlspines were trained 3 groups had to evac because no one knew to assist.  BRILLIANT PLAN.  Here's some more EXPERT TOV ADVICE: mana sieve gating mobs that are unstunnable.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not if IV wasn't there clearing the path for you you would have only gotten half of the ancient tarnished you personally looted.  That's the fucking truth, despite what you may think about your guild being ready for TOV - but you can continue to look for scapegoats as to why your constantly naked in kael, feel free to blame IV because 100% of us could care less what you think.  You are a complete ass, you are terrible at this game, you are a terrible leader, and I feel genuinely sorry for the people who stay in PO because they are guilted into staying by you.

And Solid, you and I said the same thing, up until the end.  I said you needed to clear the path, we understood and were cool with that.  I said the comments were inappropriate.  I said it's comments like that that make IV unliked by some.  I said I appreciated Krimzin's attempts to make it easier for both guilds lives easier.  Hell, I've never had a problem with Rhyu in the past, he's done favors for us, I've helped him out with some quest gems.  <br>
<br>
Ghol said that the reason so many of the large guilds have a problem with IV is because of clashes over some of the uber mobs, by which I assume he's referring to Trakanon, Wuoshi and some of the other spawns IV has recently had some degree of competition for.  To the best of my knowledge, PO and IV has never once been in that position.  When it came to ToV we stood aside willingly because we knew you weren't there to kill the same stuff we were and that you needed to clear those mobs to get to where you were going.  My response to Ghol's (legitimate) point is that there are other reasons some people don't like IV.  In doing so, I gave an example of a situation that did occur recently.<br>
<br>
As for Sinlier: I met him when he and I were both well into our 50's.  Grouped with him a number of times, alont with his brother.  Never found him to be anything other than a skilled player and a good person.  Never once saw him train anyone.  Never saw him act the least bit greedy or selfish.  Saw him doing a lot of pretty selfless things to help other people out.  So I asked around in the guild, and everyone else had similar things to say about him.  The only ones that had anything bad to say were IV members... so I don't know what your ancient grudge against him is all about, but I do know that whenever he's in the same zone as a few members of IV, he keeps his mouth shut, while they insist on flaming him in /ooc.  I give him higher marks for class, sorry.<br>
<br>
Sorry Vehn, I don't choke on small bones.  Save your cock for someone that cares.  Yah, spells take 20 seconds or more to cast when lag is that bad.  But hey, you're right: We let that one run.  Maybe it had nothing to do with lag, we just fucked up.  On the other hand, it didn't happen again, so we must have been lucky the rest of the night.<br>
<br>
I fail to see, by the way, how IV being there had the slightest thing to do with us getting armor drops.  After you moved through we had to start over with the entrance mobs and yes... we had to pull the first two simultaneously and no, we didn't wipe out on them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ukeadaiansongborne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keadaian Songborne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/01 3:51:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck Off IV</span><hr size=1> Whoops, got Skrim and Soliid backwards there... should have read &quot;Skrim, you and I said the same thing....&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 465<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/01 3:54:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck Off IV</span><hr size=1> Well I guess this thread is now dedicated to giving people reasons to tell us to fuck off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Comon guys chill jezus.

why? I believe it has to do with every friend I have who was ever in PO being stepped on<br>
by keadaian... going to let this rant flow, lets see how it pours out.<br>
<br>
want my respect keadaian? beat it out of me. think I want yours? or anyone<br>
elses? I could not care less.<br>
<br>
btw. you wiped out before we were in TOV. FYI.<br>
<br>
we got in and tried to push through, your highest tank was what.... 57? you<br>
had no melee power whatsoever (1 rogue? 5 warriors?). we wanted to get<br>
through and be away from you. we tried to let you have your way, it took too<br>
long. we tried to be courteous and do every other pull, and it didn't work<br>
out. so we pulled for you. sorry this robbed you of one leather bracer. I<br>
know what that means to you, the man who said he'd fight &quot;in rusty short<br>
swords and pw because loot means nothing&quot;. you, who when a COF dropped off<br>
naggy you were 46 and told the guilds loot officer, despite his strong<br>
resignations about the GuildLeader taking it, &quot;fuck it ghol, im taking the<br>
cof&quot;..... yeah, thats a quote. yes. I'm truly sorry we cost you a leather<br>
bracer from TOV, especially when your only leather class there already<br>
walked with 2 other drops. my most sincere apologies keadaian songborne,<br>
master of diplomacy. I do bow before you who listens to no officer yet puts<br>
them in the position for appearances then later ignores and walks over their<br>
opinions (lillya ayon lewdo samir zozz myself ). you who calls every<br>
departing member a traitor, who calls your most loyal members who decide<br>
they are better elsewhere perhaps, disloyal. you who steps on everyone who<br>
isnt with you. who despises those who dont see it your way. you who......<br>
after leaving PO leadership for &quot;a much needed break&quot; retook the position<br>
within 48 hours. And when some poor PO member questions you, you said, and<br>
another quote my good keadaian &quot;who are you to DARE question me?&quot;.<br>
<br>
 if I were a beleiver in reincarnation kead, I would say stalin has been<br>
reborn, or perhaps hitler dances in your veins... I'm not quite sure which,<br>
because truthfully it amazes me how many of my friends you can increasingly<br>
step over, and later backstab when they quit your guild after you step over<br>
them and over,  and still believe everything you are doing is right and<br>
lofty and you are doing it for the best and everyone else is fucking<br>
clueless. you are so much the enlightened one, I do courtsy before thy great<br>
and magnificent powers oh keadaian. were I to bask in your presence so I too<br>
could be so flawless as you were. to..... never make a mistake just as keadaian<br>
never has.<br>
<br>
my honest opinion keadaian, is that you are sick. you are fucking sick in<br>
the head with your fascination with enlightened dictatorship and anyone who doesnt see eye to eye with you is branded a traitor<br>
and you do everything possible to undermine their position within your<br>
guild.  keadaian is not to be denied.<br>
<br>
am I off base? uh uh. I've been there. I've been your favored, I've been<br>
your antichrist, and you know what? quite honestly I think you are more of a<br>
friend to me when I am your foe. at least then I don't have to continuessly<br>
pull out your love letters taped to the daggers you force into my back.<br>
&quot;from keadaian, with love.... this is for your own good ghol&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do me a favor though keadaian, when you put up the pro-third reich banners,<br>
tell me?  so i can then beleive in reincarnation over my present agnostic<br>
feelings.<br>
<br>
Ghol<br>
for purposes of this rant, I have no guild. these are my feelings, noone<br>
elses are attached. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uwayneotrayne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wayne OTrayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/01 9:24:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.preg.org/~terry/everquest/wayne.jpg HEIGHT=124 WITDTH=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck Off IV</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> From our perspective, we were being polite by standing down to let IV kill the mobs we were camping.

And you were pulling mobs every 30 minutes before we broke the spawn for you.

Thats pretty fucking bold Kead.<br>
<br>
And you were pulling mobs every 30 minutes before we broke the spawn for you.  Also, get off of Rhyu...ToV is a very time sensitive dungeon...with the fucked up spawn pattern in the main hall from the various wipeouts, he was left with a small spawn window to move us through the area.

Moussolini would be more appropriate, I think, although I doubt the trains run on time in PO land so even that may be a stretch.<br>
<br>
I also disagree that the subject of your rant believes he is acting for the good of his guild. Rather, I think he acts out of selfishness and spite in almost all regards, and merely pretends at concern for the good of the people he has conned into helping him attain his goals.<br>
