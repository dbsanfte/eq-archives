<br>
Was a good movie and the W. brothers you could tell got to play around a lot more in this movie. The ending however, not even Carrie Anne Moss's right ass cheek could make up for that. I would tell people to go see it but just ignore the urge to look deep into the movie.<br>

I was actually understanding it, or somewhat grasping what was going on until the archatect scene. What the fuck was he talking about. Not only was he speaking like the smartest fuck around but he got me completely confused by saying their had been more than 1 neo. That in it self confuses me but then he picks the door that every neo before him has picked. Why is he so special this time? How is he going to save the world when all the other neos couldnt. Then he kills the sentinals or whatever. Where did he get that power in the real world? Or is it the real world. DEAR GOD help me......<br>

<br>
The fanboys will love it. But I think this is just one of those movies, like the SW prequels, where you WANT it to be good, but it just falls short. <br>
<br>
I wasn't impressed with Xion. What was with that 'rave' thing? Morpheus gave his speech, then he was like: &quot;Lets party!&quot;. Stupid. And I think Trinity should have died. It would be a much better cliffhanger if Trinity was dead, and Neo was comatose. Instead, I was left not really caring what happens next. I didn't even stay for the Revolutions preview at the end credits.<br>
<br>
All in all a good movie, just not GREAT. As a SW fanboy, it took me awhile to admit the prequels weren't all that great. But if Star Wars can be bashed, well then by God anything can.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dulyendetrimental>DulyenDetrimental</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>teh rewl~</span><br>  Posts: 1242<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/15/03 7:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix 2 Spoilers: Discuss</span><hr size=1> I think there is a Matrix inside the Matrix,  like the architect said there was 6 matrix's before but all failed right? \<br>

<br>
Can't say I have any idea what happened when they were outside the ship, but yeah, it was pretty weird.  I don't think it's a Matrix within a Matrix at all.<br>
<br>
Not sure where the trilogy is going from here, but I still enjoyed the movie a lot.  <br>
<br>
Not too crazy with how it ended but then again, it's not too often that an obvious cliffhanger does much to appease you.  X2's was better, but it still wasn't the best one ever.  LOTR1 wins the award for having the worst ever, I think.  I think the best cliffhanger ever was Nightmare on Elm St. part I.<br>

I'm a little fuzzy on some points but here goes anyways. What the architect is saying is that there has been previous incarnations of the matrix, the one that Neo is in is the 6th one obviously. While the Matrix is plodding along, the machines try to destroy Xion by digging down (and they are succesful all 5 previous times). In each of the incarnations, there is the anomaly that is the One. The Oracle, who is a run-away program, and the &quot;mother&quot; of the Matrix, since she discovered several key aspects of the human psyche and how to program the Matrix for it or something like that, along with several other factors, sort of help to guide the one to the mainframe. At this point the one has to choose to either go back to the matrix and destroy it (which kills off everyone still connected, since as we see if you unplug a human without &quot;properly&quot; getting them out they die) or he can choose to unplug several people to restart Zion (17 females 6 males I think was the number, although if I remember right you need more than that to have a stable gene pool). In this way its pretty much a never-ending cycle (at least up to Neo), where the Matrix is re-designed to be better and is re-started, and the One along with some other people helps to re-build Xion. <br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why the machines allow the one to restart the human resistance at Xion, I think this is because the machines can't stop the one from actually coming about, due to something like 99.9% of the people accept the Matrix, but .1% don't (this basically comes out to be one person, the One, who then helps to liberate other people from the Matrix) so they can only kind of prod him along in the direction they want him to go (that is, to get to the mainframe and choose to restart Xion, rather than what Neo does and go back to the Matrix). As the architect said, if Neo goes back and can't stop the machines in the real world from destroying Xion then the humans in the real world are wiped out, and everybody still connected in the Matrix dies, henceforth there are no humans left on Earth. As the architect says earlier, the machines are willing to accept a lower level of existance (basically, they lose like 90% of their power source when the humans die, but they can survive on the remaining 10% from cold fusion and other such things, essentially going from the Upper-class lifestyle to living like a bum). <br>
<br>
IMO, humanity has been in the matrix much longer than Morpheus thinks (he says its close to 2199). I think if Xion starts off with 17 females + 6 males + the One, its going to take thousands of years to breed the human population up to what we see in the movie, although they do liberate people from the matrix I dont think its a very large number. So, for the sake of simplicity, I'll say it takes something like 2,000 years each cycle of the matrix to get to the point we see in the Matrix Reloaded. Times this by six, and I think humanity has been in the matrix for 12,000 or so years. I think it also follows a somewhat linear timeline (inside the matrix that is) where humans lived out the BC years all the way up through now. My basis for this is because we see some obsolete run-away programs like The Twins who are Ghosts, and also the two vampire guys. I think they were used in the earlier forms of the Matrix as Agents sort of, but as time went on they couldn't be used anymore for several reasons. My main reason is this: As we know people stopped believing in ghosts and vampires and other superstitious things a while ago. Henceforth I dont think they could be used anymore since word would spread of them really quick and ways to kill them as well (via modern communications) henceforth making them obsolete. As to how Neo stopped the sentinels at the end, I do think that they are in the real world. As you may recall, Smith says to Neo that part of him got imprinted on Smith when he blew up Smith in the first movie. I believe when Smith tried to copy himself on to Neo that part of him was imprinted on Neo, giving Neo the ability to sort of hear the machines (something like giving his brain the ability to &quot;pick up&quot; the machines communication and command waves?) as well as the ability to stop them (Im guessing through giving them a self-destruct order or something like that) kind of like how Captain Picard can hear the Borg and knows their weaknesses in Star Trek due to his being assimilated and then rescued.<br>
<br>
Anyways thats my take on some of the more confusing parts of the movie. I apologize for any grammar or such things, its kind of hard to voice my exact thoughts on the movie as it is more complex than the first one. Speaking of that, from a lot of the people that are complaining about it I hear things like it was all action and no story, or other such things. I think the movie just goes over most peoples heads, and people dont like not being able to understand something which pisses them off. Also, a lot of people have no patience, and they hate the cliffhanger things, and cant wait 6 months for the conclusion, and so condemn the whole movie for that. I personally love the LotR series, as well as the Matrix series so far, and am more than willing to wait, if more people were patient I think we'd hear less overall complaints. I'm not saying this movie is perfect, it does have its short comings, but IMO it was a great movie.<br>

<br>
The architect stated after saying 99% or whatever accept the Matrix that if the remaining people that don't accept it were to be let rampant, they would exponentially increase in danger and could become a huge problem for the machines.  That's another way of stating that if they aren't placed in a stable medium that they'll be more effective.  So instead, they guide a small number of folks to recreate another Xion after one is destroyed and as the 1% that don't accept the Matrix begin to emerge, human nature drives them to creating another Xion.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rithkorvazaelle>Rithkor Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/15/03 9:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix 2 Spoilers: Discuss</span><hr size=1> Ah yes that makes a lot more sense, I forgot about that little part of his speech, thanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbanderas>Mr Banderas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 377<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/15/03 10:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix 2 Spoilers: Discuss</span><hr size=1> I'm sure in the next few days we'll find a number of internet sites reciting a few of the more confusing dialogues in the movie so that they can be broken down better.

<br>
The techno/rave hardcore sex scene with Neo and Trinity was... awkward to watch.  What if I was watching that with my parents.  Jesus it was hardcore.<br>
<br>
The philosphy dialogues between Neo/Smith, Neo/The Orcale, Neo/ The Counselor, Neo/The Architect, etc.... was hard for most to follow I am sure.  Reading the matrix essays on the main site as well as actually having some philosophy knowledge should be a prerequisite for listening to those dialogues.<br>
<br>
My overall opinion (like it even matters), the movie was a mindf*ck to watch.  Had I been getting a BJ and viewing The Matrix Reloaded my heart would have exploded.  I would be dead right now because it was a sensory overload.  The W. Brothers bent us all over and did us dry with a metaphysics dildo and a CG gagball.  I look forward to the third flick. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=papersbish>Papersbish</A> at: 5/16/03 4:02:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prybutok@vazaellecommunitycenter>Prybutok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Live Here</span><br>  Posts: 1877<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/16/03 4:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4163.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://prybutok.homestead.com/files/djprymini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Matrix 2 Spoilers: Discuss</span><hr size=1> I liked the movie a lot but I did not appreciate having to see Keanu Reeves' &quot;O&quot; face. <p>Prybutok Agonista<br>

I liked this one more than the last (I actually disliked the first movie very much because it was just pseudo-philosophy with many action sequences).<br>
<br>
What I liked about this movie is that it goes beyond being an action movie and will probably piss off many of the fans of the last movie.  I just love film makers who stick their middle finger up at their fanbase. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Coolness.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think it is obvious that Zion is part of the Matrix or that AT LEAST the film makers want us to think that it is.  Neo having power in &quot;the real world&quot; and Smith being able to take over a &quot;human&quot; body goes a long way to support that theory.  Plus, if we are to believe the Architect then this may all be just a simulation of some kind.<br>
<br>
Neo is a program like everything else within the Matrix... and if he is not then he became a part of the Matrix (in the real world) when he &quot;killed&quot; Agent Smith and Smith became part human when he refused the programming of the Matrix to die.  That is how Neo was able to destroy machines in the real world and Smith was able to become human.<br>

The film basicly tells us everything. The matrix is a cycle, and every cycle its beeing &quot;resetted&quot; (kinda like when you reboot your computer) to keep it functionnal, from the errors growing due to the 1 % of human basicly uncompatible with the Matrix.<br>
<br>
Now, the thing is, how will Neo (the 6th one), who is a bit different (like the arch. says it), will save the current cycle from the machines &quot;rebooting&quot; (basicly save Xion from beeing destroyed)? The end gives us a hint, when Neo stops the sentinels only with his &quot;power&quot;.<br>
That probably will what the 3rd film will be about, Neo's new powers, he will discover than he is more than he though after he comes back from his coma.<br>
Imo, a new prophecy will emerge, something not created and though by the oracle, but something that will come from Neo because he is different from the other Neo(s)<br>
<br>
<br>
There is definitely good stuffs, in the story, but i was kinda sad because of a few scenes.. The rave party is ok, but the scene is wayyy too long. There is too many &quot;slow motion&quot; sequences, one from time to time is ok, one every 2 minute gives headaches.<br>
I think the strengh of this episode is due to its story, the actions scenes are ok, but first episode ones were better (because not as expected?)<br>
The music is not as good either, first one was better.<br>
I liked the idea of &quot;backdoors&quot; also, its really good imo. And the &quot;french&quot; program was funny too =p ( &lt;3 monica belluci ) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=473215">Karenne Kharne<br>

I have to admit tho, that another matrix, would explain why Neo can stop the sentinels, that would mean his power can &quot;break&quot; the second matrix, the &quot;never broken before&quot; matrix.<br>

I guess Revolution will tell us. After thinking about it, i liked the first matrix more compared to this one.., but im really curious to see how all of this is gonna end.<br>
