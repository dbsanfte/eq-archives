<br>
The official verant policy is: everything is free for all. As we have seen on the very competitive pulls for Ragefire, any guild that can pull first is supposed to be allowed the attempt. <br>
<br>
With that said, I think things like schedules are very nice. Even 'partial' schedules. Things like: Ntov is 'yours' this week and ST is 'ours' this week can only help smooth a fun playing experience. This is just my opinion. It has become clear to me that many people really do enjoy competing for mobs. The race to get them with enough force to win adds spice.<br>
<br>
Which model should we use? Well, since guilds are the only things capable of winning in either of these zones, and since targets are always chosen by guild leaders the decision on how to act rests there. Our leaders are very reasonable and honorable people. If Keadian works a deal with Baldrik to keep CC out of ST for a day (or however long) in exchange for something - you can rest assured it will happen.<br>
<br>
With this said, if guild leadership (both PO and CC) feels that the competitve model is best then we all have to accept all that model entails. <br>
<br>
Again, for me - I prefer a schedule system as I feel it cuts down on wasted time, hurt feelings,hasty preperations, and even taking days off work for that matter. But my preference aside, I will always follow guild policy and guild leadership.<br>

I said we re-scheduled our start-time(s) to step back for PO for a while and people logged to twinks and what not. Some went to do a quest for Examer in EW. I never said we had 18 people physically present in ST all the time. Read my posts before you post meaningless shit.<br>
<br>
The last list of 18 people were the ones in ST &quot;on time&quot;, read it and weap bard-boy. Yes, they were all logged in ST/on twinks/in EW from 7pm CET.<br>
<br>
Yeah, Befb joined as an invite before we charged Nanzata, I am sorry if you found him to tip the scales to us daring to charge past you...<br>

See invis ? Omg, is that a new spell ? I told you I was sorry if anyone was present in the tunnel when you whiped to FA, and I also said Aethina and Trypt were there a couple minutes before the rest of us (after FA died, since he died when we fought Prog), but if they had &quot;visited&quot; earlier then I will correct them and make sure they stay away from your proximity, since it clearly bothers you a lot.<br>

The point at which you guys jumped from 8 to 18 people in the span of 15 minutes also happens to be after we wiped to the Nanzata add during FA.<br>
<br>
I didn't say alot beyond you guys had 8 in zone at the time and had someone behind us nearly the entire time. Aethina was down there invis before yer mage showed up, safe to assume it's because she could gate, and Trypt was down there several times afterward.<br>
<br>
You started out spouting drivel when Anika made a post asking how things work on other servers and call me a liar when I say things that you obviously have no cluer wether they are true or not.<br>

&quot;but after having the other guild follow us down on our first run on the warders and sit in the tunnel in front of them and just wait for the opportunity for us to die so they could move in&quot;<br>
<br>
To which I responded that we could have taken FA/warders out at any point after our scheduled raid started (7pm CET) including the 3 times you failed to FA but didn´t. I doubt Anika really meant it the way she worded it though...<br>
<br>
Oh and it takes about 3 minutes to re-log from twinks, zone in from EW, and run down to FA tunnel. I am sorry if I didn´t force all 18 to stay in the zone for the entire 5 hours of waiting, but I will next time so you can get better attendance for CC in your total random logs.<br>
<br>
Btw, this was the &quot;lie&quot; I was referring to, maybe not a straight-up lie, but I took it as &quot;you didn´t have people to kill FA when we got there&quot;, my bad if you meant something completely irrelevant by it:<br>

&quot;I think you had 8 ST when we got down there and then folks trickled in from that point.&quot;<br>

I had never been in a situation like this, nor have most of the people in my guild.  I'm a sponge for information, so I was curious to know how that sort of situation was handled on other servers.<br>

You notice I never mentioned the servers or the guilds?  Notice my last paragraph disclaimer on my original post?  I never intended any malice or ill will toward anyone.

Jeebus<br>
<br>
Look, when we first engaged FA you had 8 people there. Passing us at anytime before that would've been lame in the extreme since we hadn't wiped and were moving thru the zone pretty well, and I assume it's something you wouldn't do. By the time you had 18 in zone, we were buffing and getting ready for the second shot so no real oppurtunity to pass us there either. After 3rd, I'll grant that you could have.<br>
<br>
So, you gave us 1 shot that you didn't have to. Coming here and saying that you GAVE us 5 hours implies that you own the zone much like saying that we should ASK you if we can raid there.<br>
<br>
If you'd rather work something out so we aren't racing to be in the zone before you then maybe we can(As suggested by Fubbik Nehvar, but thanks for playing). But last I heard was you were gonna take what you wanted whenever you wanted to take it.<br>
<br>
<br>
To folks reading this, like Nehvar, nothing happened in ntov. It's a pretty big area and the only folks we saw were some who had logged early or something and needed xloc'd out. The conversation shifted to ST which, if you've been, you'd know isn't designed to support multiple simultaneous raid. Ie, you can run by someone who's fighting/medding or run over the corpses of folks who wiped out cause there's only one direction to go and respawns are all very long. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/uhasuuuu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hasuuuu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.vazaelle.dk/menybild.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/19/01 1:34:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=574.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Alyen</span><hr size=1> If you people had any idea on when you are owned and should back off, this post should have ended after Vehns picture.

I'm not naive Vehn - if I would have made a dummy account, them someone would see it, still put two-and-two together, and suddenly it would be the same thread, just 'look what some anonymous loser posted' instead of 'look what Anika posted'.

<br>
Isn't there enough high-end mobs on the server for 2 guilds to share?  They aren't even in the same time schedule together. <br>
PO/CC have it extremely easy since the competition isn't heavy compared to other servers.  How would you like to zone into TOV and have a guild in West wing, a guild in East wing, the &quot;uber&quot; guild of the server clearing NTOV, and one smaller guild doing zone in?  I've seen it as i'm sure others have too.<br>
<br>
Well, i'm not nieve enough to think 2 guilds will come to a compromise.  It more fun to watch guilds work together against a mob they have never killed before, rather than each other.  <br>

Pulling kland before a fully buffed raid when they are about to attack and make em sit and wait while you battle ress and kit it around aint..well..fun..Perhaps you should consider your own actions before you go crying at others for what they do.. <p><img src="http://www.jonkoping.bonet.se/gurfa/examersig.jpg"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28576">Profile</A><Br>Member of Caer Cadarn</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/utreeslover.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Treeslover</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/19/01 2:20:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=574.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Alyen</span><hr size=1> Hey Keadaian, don't you guys have some sort of policy against flaming on the VCC regarding topics revolving around PO?<br>
<br>
Oddly, It was Anika who chastised me the most for not respecting the guild enough to follow this policy and here I see her jumping in the grand melee.  Alyen also mentioned some time ago that he was going to turn the other cheek.  I find it humorous that we're back to where we started on this whole thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
