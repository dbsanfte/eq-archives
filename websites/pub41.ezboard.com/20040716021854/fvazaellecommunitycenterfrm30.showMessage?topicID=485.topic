<br>
I work for an alarm center, we answer phones for business' after hours as well, one being a gas company. I came in at midnight on the 20/21 whatever u please. I recieved a call from a customer, Rose. She needed her furnace serviced. I took her message, and paged our on call tech. During my conversation with Rose she'd mentioned that she had been calling throughout the evening 3-4 times. We begin to answer phones at 4pm for this company. I'm gonna guess that one of Rose's phone calls did in fact come to us at our answering service and was handled by an employee here. It would be hard to believe that a customer needing service would leave a 9 hour gap before calling again to see why the fuck no one has come out.<br>
<br>
I mention the name to my partner that she'd tried to call and got no service yet. My partner springs to life sayin &quot;I remember her calling, we took a message but when we tried to give it to the gas man apparently it hadnt saved in our system right&quot; My partners shift was 4pm-midnight so she was here during all of  this.                                                                          <br>
                                                                             Facts here, 1. She remember the name and that the customers call came in to us here.<br>
2. Rose admitted when she spoke with me to calling numerous times in the evening, which logically one of those calls would have been handled by us, supporting my co-workers story<br>
<br>
Shortly after I spoke with our on call man, he called Rose, then called back. He said that she spoke to no one at the gas company itself and that we handled the calls from her. Again supporting my co-workers claim. That was well, Rose deserved an apology, from us, due to our &quot;glitch in the system&quot; I agree'd that Rose needed an apology and offered my personal apology should I take her call in the AM, to recitify the situation.<br>
<br>
So now the facts, <br>
1. My partner remembers Rose calling<br>
2. Rose admits to calling numerous times, during our answering times<br>
3. The gas man said she called as well during our times<br>
<br>
All of these things agree with each other........<br>
<br>
I believed this due to the story from Rose, the gas man, and my partner that we in fact DID handle at least 1 of her calls, that the call WAS IN FACT NOT dispatched at that time by a possible glitch in our system, the call WAS in fact dispatched by myself at 1:15am. So I reported this to my boss, letting him know that &quot;hey we may have a problem with messages not saving right...&quot; And I tell em the spiel<br>
<br>
He says &quot;It may be the software&quot; And takes it upon himself to search for the problem. He checked our messages for calls in which DUH U FUCKING IDIOT! If it didnt save it wouldnt be in the fucking system! Way to go u toad! Whether or not he LISTENED to the phone lines for a call from Rose is beyond me, and in all honesty I dont think he did.<br>
<br>
So.....facts now, refer above and add some<br>
4. I sent the service call out<br>
5. I reported this to my boss as a potential problem in need of a response<br>
6. he checked our systems saved messages and delivered messages, which there's no way an unsaved message would be located here or anywhere in our system.<br>
<br>
Now I come into work tonight on the 21st at midnight. I have an email from the boss stating......<br>
&quot;I wasted unnessecary time looking for the problem because you didnt listen.&quot; &quot;The calls were handled by the gas company alone&quot; Which goes against what my co-worker said, and the gas man. Rose was unsure what party answered the phone. &quot;Never say, 'I dont see where we wrote anything down'&quot; So I am to lie to our customers now??? &quot;You falsly accused us of making an error, to the gas rep&quot; FUCK NO MORON I said I dont know why we didnt have a message from her if she called at this time. The gas man accused us of fucking up not me. I only agre'd to apologize and rectify the situation. The email also said &quot;You wrongfully accused an employee of making a mistake&quot;  Again NO I FUCKING DIDNT! I said that OUR employee IF SHE TOOK the message, has been here ears and knows what she is doing. So it must be a problem somewhere else in our system. Which led him to believe that it was software.<br>
<br>
now the facts. refer above<br>
<br>
7. He's accusing me of telling the gas rep we fucked up, when I was never here during the calls that rose made during the day. When all I did was agree to apologize, that Rose needed at least that.<br>
8. I'm accusing my fellow workers of fucking up. Lies, I said its gotta be in the system.<br>
9. He's goin against what 2 people have told me and a 3rd person about who exaclty handled at LEAST 1 of the calls, aside from my call.<br>
10.  He's accusing me of not listening. Not listeinng to who? The gas man, whos story agree's with Rose's, who's story agree's with my partners. Sounds like I listened to 3 different parties sayin the same shit to me.<br>
<br>
And ends the email with &quot;I'm done venting.....now go to work....Dave&quot;<br>
<br>
To tell me that I wasted his time, when he was searching for a potential problem that may or may not have been there. Well by my understanding if you think there's a problem its best to check on it. Not sit and let it go. To &quot;vent&quot; on me for something that happened when I wasnt even there is bullshit. As well as change what I said around to that I am falsly accusing my fellow workers or making a mistake is ludicrious. I feel confident that my co-worker handled the situation properly and this was a software error. <br>
<br>
Now the final facts, refer above and revise....<br>
I handle a call properly, report a possible &quot;software error&quot; as the boss refered to it as. I offer my heartfelt apology in the case I handle her call again to rectify the situation. I am blamed for accusing my co-workers of fucking up, I am &quot;vented&quot; on for such behavior, that in my eye's and everyone else's was in BOTH companies best professional interest, no matter what party was truely at fault, which remains to be seen. And finally I am offended personally, because he is pinning this whole situation and saying I wasted his fucking jack off time, on me.<br>
<br>
Once again, sorry this is so long and if anything is un-clear please lemme know I'll try to clear it up for you. And let me know, is my boss a fucking cross eye'd, billy goat fucking moron? Or is he right by doing this to me?<br>

So i check it out, i call the service tech team and have them go through the system to have them explain that these devices will not lose specific data. If your inputting data,, A , B , C , D, E, F, G, E.... and you say you lose D but nothing before and nothing after, its probably operator error. <br>
Your system probably has a tool that will show all of your system details and what functions etc that happened that night, take a look if you see anything unusual call the tech support.<br>
<br>
kick your boss in the nuts anyway though, then tell him you were just venting.<br>
