<br>
I'm violating the Mystykal word limit policy to enter into a formal discussion of the present blight upon the server MSG board, and in particular the Inferno forum, which is quite beloved by some as an easy and often joyful outlet for their possibly pent-up emotions &amp; RL sucked-up spleen.<br>
<br>
Not that Nymrel has or ever will develop the basic humanity or social conscience necessary to actually care when his untamed actions harm or annoy others, but even he is somewhat wearied by this senseless class conflict and apparent inability to be fully or readily accepted by his fellow EQ enthusiasts.<br>
<br>
But in a way, this childish game of King of the Hill can be thought of as a social experiment which unfortunately has gone horribly awry.  One has but to think back to the time when a Mystykal Alpha-She-male held superior sway as the dominant force within the inferno and you may come to see or even appreciate my pitiful, long winded point.  She worried constantly over her imasculated flock like a mother hen gathering up her wayward chicks.  It became my first and foremost goal to either seduce or depose her from her coveted and highly regarded throne.  This I have finally done, although not quite as enjoyably as I might have liked.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the study of group dynamics teaches us that there are certain stages most human social entities or &quot;teams&quot; go through before they ever reach any ability to function productively.  Those stages are Forming, Storming, Norming &amp; Performing.  You may see these forces at work every time you play the game and form player groups, join a guild, attend a guild event or participate in raids.  It was obvious to me at least that this MSG board was close to the Norming stage when Nymrel Frostiger first charged &amp; barged in, while rudely &amp; carelessly violating everyone's partially established comfort zones.  And of course repeatedly attacking the informal leader did not help matters any.<br>
<br>
Then came Teakken Oakwind, who was the first and only of the Uber elite to take the time to point out this fact to Nymrel in a rational, sensible &amp; logical fashion.  Whether anyone noticed or not, Nymrel initially responded to this reasoning and for a very short time an eeiry calm seemed to settle over the Inferno.  There was some jostling for pole positions as we all tried to feel for our place, while still seeking some limited Mystykal approval.  <br>
<br>
But, as we all well know this was only the calm before the storm.  An unforseen turn of events brought about by an unintended miscommunication, left Nymrel deprived of some long standing noodleneck joy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     He felt slighted and to blame which spurred him on to the rampage we were then forced to bear either silent or chaotic witness to, or to just slither away and try to ignore.<br>
<br>
So I'm pretty sure we can all agree that communication was the primary factor which caused the greatest immediate rift.  Much like a non-English speaking Scandanavian Air Traffice Controller trying to &quot;lund de furkin Amerikan plaene!&quot;  But in my defense I must say that upon finding my way to this venue, where the EQ experienced shared their insights and angst; I myself had a very hard time understanding the more experienced Uber language and class specific dialects being used so freely and with such obvious passion.<br>
<br>
Since it is not my nature to sit back and watch, I took it upon myself to attempt to join the fray in an awkward and untentative fashion.  But alas as with any functioning group I was immediately looked upon as an unworthy outsider and pounced upon vehemently.  Fight or flight are the two most used defensive tactics for those of limited social resources and so I fought back with the only seemingly effective weapon at my disposal.<br>
<br>
To slash or not to slash, that was the question.  And so despite angry, desparate and soulful pleas to the contrary, I set sail and embarked upon a seemingly directionless course.  But believe me when I say my uncaptivating campaign will have an equitable conclusion.  And even despite the &quot;class conflict&quot; of the weapon I chose, it made me smile &amp; laugh every one of those very limited times when I knew the Uber were unsuspectingly goaded into giving the naughty noob their attention.  <br>
<br>
And so now, as I stand alone upon the mountain out of a molehill I so stubbornly crafted &amp; created, I do see the error of my ways.  Unfortunately, I still feel totally detached from the suffering and really don't care.  So someone who really does have the capacity or willingness to care must act, or this silly, senseless siege will never, ever end.<br>
<br>
Or can the uncaring entity who causes you so much grief also provide for an escape from the seething frozen flames &amp; deathly quiet of his self-styled Dante's Inferno?  Only time will tell.  Being omnipotent is a heavy burden to bear, but somebody's got to do it.  Being quite skilled at the art of leading &amp; influencing people, I know that you have to break them down all the way if you want to start building  them back up upon a firmer foundation.<br>
<br>
I can see that I've accomplished that here, and so I am more than somewhat satisfied with each step I took to fulfill my personal goal and have realized the fruits of this fantasically funfilled feat.<br>
<br>
For those who took the time to read this entire essay, you don't have any of my non-existant sympathy. For those of you who didn't, that doesn't matter to me either.  I personally enjoyed writing it, and drafting it, and editing it, and choosing the words and the flow and the follow through.<br>
<br>
And if I can't make myself happy, nobody can.<br>
<br>
Yes, you could say that this was self-serving or just impotent literary masturbation.  But hey, I came! I saw! I conquered!<br>
<br>
Last word of advice:  Don't worry Zeb.  Be happy!<br>
<br>
The /'r claims he is here to stay, and you could rue that thought, or  you can take comfort in the fact that the Inferno will certainly be a kindler, gentler, and quieter place.<br>
<br>
Can anyone else hear the crikets chirping?<br>
<br>
I can.  And it makes me smile. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
