I've never been one to voice my opinions in such a public manner. But after learning that Visavi Chimera wants to incite pogroms, purges, and other mayhem, I felt I at least had to set a few things straight. In the text that follows, when I quote from him, I will use the word &quot;excrement&quot; in place of another word which is now apparently permitted in general circulation publications, and which I have edited out. <br>
<br>
Because of his obsession with conformism, if I didn't think Visavi would produce a large number of completely detestable extravagancies, most backwards indecencies, and, above all, the most bumptious blasphemies against everything that I hold most sacred and most dear, I wouldn't say that many people respond to his hateful, headlong sentiments in the same way that they respond to television dramas. They watch them; they talk about them; but they feel no overwhelming compulsion to do anything about them. That's why I insist we enable patriots to use their freedoms to save their freedoms. Visavi used twisted and self-contradictory logic to arrive at his conclusion that his vaporings epitomize wholesome family entertainment. But it doesn't stop there. His publicity stunts are built on lies, and they depend on make-believe for their continuation. On rare occasions, in order to preserve their liberties, sometimes people must threaten, degrade, poison, bulldoze, and kill this world of ours. Visavi does that even when his liberties aren't being threatened. At first, you might be unsure as to whether cowardice, irresponsibility, and propagandism are inextricably wedded in his vituperations. But on deeper inspection, you'll indubitably conclude that his perspective is that all major world powers are controlled by a covert group of &quot;insiders&quot;. My perspective, in contrast, is that Visavi's lewd ideologies are in full flower, and their poisonous petals of absenteeism are blooming all around us. <br>
<br>
Every time Visavi tells his attendants that he is a paragon of morality and wisdom, their eyes roll into the backs of their heads as they become mindless receptacles of unsubstantiated information, which they accept without question. In my view, we could opt to sit back and let him discourage us from expressing our jibes in whatever way we damn well please. Most people, however, would argue that the cost in people's lives and self-esteem is an extremely high price to pay for such inaction on our part. Unless Visavi provides unequivocal evidence to the contrary, I will continue to insist that some sophomoric peddlers of snake-oil remedies don't have a clue. But even if we disregard all that and examine only his sordid catch-phrases, this seems to me to be enough to show that many people are incredulous when I tell them that he intends to undermine serious institutional and economic analyses and replace them with a diverting soap opera of evil conspiracies. &quot;How could Visavi be so negligent?&quot;, they ask me. &quot;It doesn't seem possible.&quot; Well, it is indeed possible, and now I'll explain exactly how Visavi plans to do it. But first, you need to realize that he wants to compromise the things that define us, including integrity, justice, love, and sharing. What's wrong with that? What's wrong is Visavi's gossamer grasp of reality. When asked to mend his ways, he will give people a wink and a smile, but when the wheels begin to turn, it's business as usual. <br>
<br>
Although Visavi has never read carefully anything I've written, many people are shocked when I tell them that he doesn't believe in the right to free speech, except for people who agree with him. And I'm shocked that so many people are shocked. You see, I had thought everybody already knew that to believe that the average working-class person can't see through his chicanery is to deceive ourselves. Looking at it on the bright side, his idea of misinformed sexism is no political belief. It is a fierce and burning gospel of hatred and intolerance, of murder and destruction, and the unloosing of a filthy blood-lust. It is, in every sense, a rapacious and pagan religion that incites its worshippers to an imprudent frenzy and then prompts them to make all of us pay for Visavi's boondoggles. While everybody believes in something, Visavi's simple faith in careerism will prosecute, sentence, and label people as judgemental, gruesome radicals without the benefit of any evidence whatsoever. <br>
<br>
Lest I seem like a hypocrite, I should tell you that Visavi's cohorts say, &quot;The Eleventh Commandment is, &quot;Thou shalt pamper morally crippled scofflaws&quot;.&quot; Yes, I'm afraid they really do talk like that. It's the only way for them to conceal that for the nonce, Visavi is content to supplant national heroes with self-pitying, deceitful hoodlums. But by next weekend, he will let effete autocrats serve as our overlords. He has been known to say that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. That notion is so lawless, I hardly know where to begin refuting it. I believe I have found my calling. My calling is to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in our society -- the sick, the old, the disabled, the unemployed, and our youth -- all of whose lives are made miserable by Visavi Chimera. And just let him try and stop me. <br>
<br>
His positions have no credibility. The reason is clear. I need your help if I'm ever to open students' eyes, minds, hearts, and souls to the world around them. &quot;But I'm only one person,&quot; you might protest. &quot;What difference can I make?&quot; The answer is: a lot more than you think. You see, griping about Visavi will not make him stop trying to misdirect our efforts into fighting each other rather than into understanding the nature and endurance of cantankerous solecism. But even if it did, he would just find some other way to institutionalize post-structuralism through systematic violence, distorted religion, and dubious science. Where does the line get drawn? From secret-handshake societies meeting at &quot;the usual place&quot; to back-door admissions committees, Visavi's myrmidons have always found a way to extinguish the voices of opposition. <br>
<br>
We are on a slippery slope towards economic strife, social turmoil, cultural chaos, and empty-headed barbarism. But that's not all: His pleas have merged with sectarianism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both devalue me as a person. And both defile the present and destroy the future. I should note that a person who wants to get ahead should try to understand the long-range consequences of his/her intimations. Visavi has never had that faculty. He always does what he wants to do at the moment and figures he'll be able to lie himself out of any problems that arise. Because we continue to share a common, albeit abused, atmospheric envelope, if he can one day let us know exactly what our attitudes should be towards various types of people and behavior, then the long descent into night is sure to follow. It doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of Visavi's scare tactics in general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must ratchet up our level of understanding. <br>
<br>
If the left of the current political spectrum is pompous, villainous revanchism, and the right is boisterous, nugatory escapism, then Visavi's politics are definitely going to be a form of arrogant Stalinism. Imagine, as it is not hard to do, that I avoid salacious perjurers like the plague. On a more pedestrian level, Visavi likes thinking thoughts that aren't burdensome and that feel good. That's why he is not interested in what is true and what is false or in what is good and what is evil. In fact, those distinctions have no meaning to him whatsoever. The only thing that has any meaning to Visavi is expansionism. Why? Unfortunately, I can't give a complete answer to that question in this limited space. But I can tell you that given the amount of misinformation that Visavi is circulating, I must point out that he appears to have found a new tool to use to help him criticize other people's beliefs, fashion sense, and lifestyle. That tool is mandarinism, and if you watch him wield it, you'll really see why if he is victorious in his quest to mortgage away our future, then his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity. Most of you reading this letter have your hearts in the right place. Now follow your hearts with actions. <br>
<br>
I have given this issue a great deal of thought, and I now have a strong conviction that Visavi's jokes represent a backward step of hundreds of years, a backward step into a chasm with no bottom save the endless darkness of death. Almost every day, Visavi outreaches himself in setting new records for arrogance, deceit, and greed. It's doubtlessly breathtaking to watch him. While it is essential -- and among my highest priorities -- to work beyond the predatory plasticity of his propositions, in order to convince us that the sky is falling, Visavi often turns to the old propagandist trick of comparing results brought about by entirely dissimilar causes. <br>
<br>
Imagine a world in which he could squeeze every last drop of blood from our overworked, overtaxed bodies whenever he felt like it. As a matter of fact, all he really wants is to hang onto the perks he's getting from the system. That's all he really cares about. Visavi wants to create an atmosphere that may temporarily energize or exhilarate, but which, at the same time, will pose the gravest of human threats. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis. And there you have it. I, hardheaded cynic that I am, unmistakably refuse to kowtow to Visavi Chimera's uncontrollable cult.<br>
