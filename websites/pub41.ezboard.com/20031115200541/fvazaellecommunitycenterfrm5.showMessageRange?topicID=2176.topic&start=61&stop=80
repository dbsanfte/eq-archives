You want to make fun of them for how they amuse you when you do stupid stuff and say it is just to get a reaction? I wasn't gonna say anything when I first saw this thread you started since you can be a pretty nice guy, but you went overboard and I just want to share the truth.<br>
<br>
I was an officer in Sanabiens guild, Jemand Verbieten. I joined JV about 3 months ago. His guild was advertised as a casual guild working towards raiding. Being a very casual player, I joined and was very happy. Everyone was friendly and it was casual as advertised. They were also in the Nato alliance, which seemed to be a nice bonus. I had found a home.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A few weeks later, the regulars on this site ripped Bigem apart for some stupid thread. Hell, I even defended him in a few of the posts.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He told the guild that he was leaving and starting over on Stromm where he could get away from the people he did not like, and escape the reputation that he had created. Now as will happen with smaller guilds, when the leader quits, people panic and leave. We lost some good players when Bigem announced his departure. I thought the guild was done and I was getting ready to leave.<br>
<br>
Bigem came back. He was gone less than a week I believe. People were happy again as the guild was not going to disband. I figured this was a freak occurrence and the guild was now stable. <br>
<br>
A month or so later, I log on and realize that we were removed from Nato. I go to our website and there is a big picture of Nato crossed out. As it turned out, some people in Nato didn't care for Bigem, and were taking a vote on whether or not to remove JV from the alliance. As soon as Bigem saw this, he freaked out and quit Nato. When people questioned him he blew up at the guild saying things like &quot;I AM THE LEADER, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN LEAVE!&quot;. Some took his advice. I chose to try to calm him down instead of leaving.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This was the second time he has gone off and made a rash decision on his own that would affect the entire guild. I figured not a big deal though, because we were to the point where raids were now possible on our own. <br>
<br>
Things are going well. We are doing some minor raiding and the guild is happy! Bigem constantly talks about how we don't have to be killing the hardest stuff in the game to have fun. He preached how dedication to our guild is much more rewarding than being random_guild_member_319 in some big uber guild. Everyone agreed because that is how most of the guildmembers actually felt. Me included.<br>
<br>
Hissy fit #3. I was not online at the time, but I guess one guildmember got mad at another during one of our raids. THe person got offended and decided not to participate in future raids. Well, Bigem freaked out and once again decided to leave. This time he actually gave leadership to one of our members. He didn't even wait to inform any officers, much less hand leadership to one of them. This was the final straw for the majority of our experienced players. Within days we had lost about 20 50+level players (about half of our active members). They are still trying to salvage the guild(I wish you the best of luck Norinth.) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Bigem then proceeded to write a long post in our forum about how he felt bad leaving the guild, but it is too stressful. He also posted about how he was going to start applying to Uber guilds! This is coming from the guy who preached dedication and ripped those guilds apart.<br>
<br>
Does it count as multiple personality disorder if you are talking out of your ass half the time? Fuck you Bigem/Sana. You and your lies about not wanting to be &quot;UBER&quot; cost a lot of people a lot of time. You say you could care less, but the truth is you want to be accepted as UBER so bad it eats you up inside. I can just imagine the spankathons that occur every time you upgrade one of your armor slots. &quot;ooohhh, Wisdom now at 249!&quot; <br>
<br>
Sorry about carrying on, but it felt good! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm just not mean enough for a good R&amp;F. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, almost forgot. <br>

This post is to Marteeny, so forget what I said before because this post is real.<br>
<br>
I am truely sorry for what I did to Jemand Verbieten, but there were things going on behind the scene that nobody knew about but me.  I didn't want to say anything to anybody because I didn't want to make an even bigger problem of the situation.<br>
<br>
To make a long story short, the person that got mad and was going to leave the guild was my brother.  Jesus.  Ok.  Let me start at the beginning.  Catflayer got mad because my brother cussed everybody out at the last raid.  My brother cussed everybody out at the raid because a lot of the people were not paying attention, and it was causing trouble.  Basically, he was trying to get people to listen.  Well, Catflayer took offense to it, and he told Cudden that he was going to create an alt character to play on Saturdays, so that he wouldn't get asked to come to our raids anymore.  I told my brother about this in hopes that he would stop cussing people out at the raids.  Instead, it pissed my brother off because he thought I was taking Catflayer's side on the matter.  So, my brother said fuck the guild and left.  This upset me a lot because I play the game with my brother all the time.  We are like best friends.  So, I knew there was no fucking way I could stay as the guild leader of Jemand Verbieten AND have any peace what so ever in real life.  I was literally torn between my guild and my family.  So, I did what any real human being would do.  I chose my real life over the game.<br>
<br>
Why did I turn leadership over to Frankk instead of waiting to talk to the officers of the guild?<br>
<br>
Simple.  I knew that if I did not turn over leadership of the guild to someone immidiately, I would end up NOT doing it at all.  I started Jemand Verbieten.  I was the original creator, and the hardest thing I have ever done in my life was turning over leadership of the guild to someone else.<br>
<br>
I wanted to turn over leadership of the guild to Kusta very badly, but Kusta was only in the guild because we are good friends in game.  As soon as he found out I was leaving the guild, he left the guild to continue his solo life as many great rogues do.<br>
<br>
In all honesty, I figured that Frankk would not be able to handle the preasure of running the guild, and I figured he would end up offering leadership to Snorker in the end.<br>
<br>
So, yes.  I freaked out and screwed the guild.  I take full blame for that, and there will not be a day go by that I don't remember what I did to you and everybody else in the guild because I care a lot for each of you.  And, that is not something I am saying just to get a rise out of the dumb fucks that visit this forum.<br>
<br>
Also... yes I did go to Stromm for a week.  I was looking for a stress free outlet, and it was great right up until I realised all of my friends (yourself included Marteeny) were on Vazaelle.  So, I came back.<br>
<br>
As for NATO.  NATO served its purpose for us.  It was time to leave NATO, and there is not a single officer that complained about us leaving NATO.  It wasn't handled properly by me when I pulled us out of NATO initially, but that was because I felt betrayed by the leaders of NATO.<br>
<br>
So, what does this all mean?  It means that I do have feelings, and I am human.  I jump to conclussions when I get my feelings hurt oftenly.  That much is true.<br>
<br>
But, what it doesn't mean is that I intentionally wanted to hurt Jemand Verbieten, NATO, or any members there in.  That was never the case at all.  Some of my posts on the VCC were very heart felt, and some of my replies were filled with emotion.  Not because I wanted to be accepted by the uba community, but because I felt attacked for even existing.<br>
<br>
So many people on the VCC go around looking for ways to improve their image by trashing other people at any cost, and it is extremely sick and twisted.<br>
<br>
That is why I started fucking with people.  I only started fucking with people when I started posting in the Rants and Flames section.  Everything else that I posted was from my heart and truethful.<br>
<br>
I just never expected to see so many of my so-called friends taking to heart what was said on the VCC Rants and Flames section.  I could name each of you, but I wont.  You know who you are.  Each of you for one reason or another turned your backs on me because you thought it would hurt your image to be seen with me BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU READ ON THE VCC RANTS AND FLAMES MESSAGE BOARD.  The same people that say, 'I dont take what I see on the VCC seriously were the same people who turne their backs on me cause they didnt want to tarnish their precious fucking image in game.'<br>
<br>
If there is anything I have learned from playing Everquest over the past few years, it is that when the chips are on the table, your best friends will stab you in the back to get what they want every time.<br>

Sana YOu are just sad. As much as I hate you for all the shit you've said and done (/snaps to Nato for finally getting you out ...

YOU are a small sad man and I doubt highly that you are any different out of game then you are in it.<br>

You have wasted all our time here and I seriously hope that you will be banned from the site asap. You have said your good byes now gather up some self respect and just go away. I know some of the Agony ppl and I know they have read this .... your *big project* can be done but no one here will ever take you (not that I speak for them, but would bet pp on it ) .... anyone know if you get enough ppl to petition if you can get a person banned from a EQ server ?<br>
<br>
Anyways I hope you learn what life is really about , unfortunitely children learn things thru the games we play and adults relax thru the same avenues, you have shown that you can not learn these lessons as you are now, move on and I wish you luck in your search. So let it be said I am not a complete asshole, I wish you well in your search for maturity you grave robbing, turd burglaring sorry excuse of a cum guzzling queen. <br>

You basically traded your EQ entertainment for VCC entertainment.<br>
<br>
It is due to your lame posts and moronic attitude on this message board that you are not able to do anything you want to in the actual game. Your application to Agony, yeah I think you might as well forget that. Application to any other top end guild? You will not get in. Sorry man but you burned your bridges long ago on Vazaelle.<br>
<br>
Your friends did not bail on you man. Shame on you for even trying to blame them for turning their back on you when you yourself destroyed everything they found good in the game. You destroyed their guild due to your antics here. You destroyed the NATO membership of your guild due to the crap you pulled here. You destroyed your reputation and your image due to all the moronic posts you wrote here. How dare you blame your friends for not going down with the ship that you alone chose to sink.<br>
<br>
And the reason for your antics and twisted attitude? Purely a yearning to be uber. Thats how it all started. You made a lame retirement post on how you could not finish your epic and not keep from dying and therefore you were quiting EQ (you lasted what, a week away?). I was the only person that seemed to read through that post to the true meaning, it was a sobstory crying pleading thread for help. Then you made your famous &quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot; post where all uber guilds and high end players should act like the big brothers association and carry all the softcores through PoP like a fucking charity case. Basically another post where you were crying for help from all your heroes who actually know how to play the game and get shit done.<br>
<br>
The saddest thing is though you have this yearning to be uber you wont do bugger all for yourself to get you there. You expect the end game of EQ to be handed to you on a silver platter. Gotta love the application to Agony where you apply at level 60. They say you need level 65. You get level 61 and think you should be getting some serious circle jerk action for the accomplishment. Then you say &quot;gee I am level 61 now, I am sick of leveling, I wanna raid, let me in the guild, I hate leveling.&quot; Yeah, real hardcore Bigem. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You fucked over and ostrasized yourself from all your casual friends by your attitude that you are somehow better then them and should be in a uber guild. Yet you are not hardcore, you are playing at the same level of your old guild, you are not a Agony, PO, CC, EA, AD, Triality, caliber player. You are a NATO level player and you fucked that up bigtime. Even the players at your true level want nothing to do with you now due to your crappy attitude.<br>
<br>
You love to blame everyone else for your problems Bigem, maybe you should look at yourself and take some of the blame for where you stand. You are the reason everything has happend to you. If you are truely not a kid then you should really chalk this down as experience and learn from this, you need a reality check into the way the world works that most of us learned before we were 18 years old. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bigemnoseandhow>bigemnose andhow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senior Member</span><br>  Posts: 566<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/3/03 6:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2176.topic&index=79>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: touchy!</span><hr size=1> Thanks TropicsDelight for that insightful sack of shit.

I couldn't give a rats ass about uberness, but I do give a rats ass about proving shit fucks like you wrong.<br>

I never made it to the uber levels cause I never played one character streight through.  Any dumb ass with a life to waste on this pathetic excuse for a game can make it to 65 with 200 AA.  ANYBODY.  Hell, give a monkey a computer and everquest, and he can do it eventually.<br>
<br>
Just to prove you wrong, I will start a new character, and I will make 65 and I will get 200 AA, and I will infiltrate one of your so called UBER guilds.  And, it wont stop there.  No.  I will keep on kissing your asses until I make it to being an officer, and on that day I will come back here to VCC and tell everybody who I am.<br>
