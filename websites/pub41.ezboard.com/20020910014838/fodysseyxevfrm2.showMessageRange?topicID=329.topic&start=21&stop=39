So I was grouped with my partner Bludgen and we heard Tuvoxii cybering Aelbram in the hut next to Gfay bank in /say no less. Just ask Bludgen he will back me up on this. :P <p><p>

I guess this thread should never of been made but it was late when Tuvoxii made it and he was pissed because he was told one thing and another happened...

I'm sure if he really didn't hold himself backwhile writing that you would of seen a lot more four letter words... and just for the record..
