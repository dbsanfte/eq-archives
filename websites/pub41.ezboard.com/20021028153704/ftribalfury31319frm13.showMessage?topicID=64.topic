I know many zones are crowded on weekends, but if you check on the Vazaelle Community MB, you might be able to sign up for a zone raid &lt;shrug&gt; ... otherwise, I may have to turn over main puller status to Myt .. who did a hell of a job with the tag pulls in Akheva.  I will do my best to make some of the mid week raids, but the 7am shift hurts my nights.

Haven't been to CoM inawhile, so I may go there, but I have always seen that zone as a single group attack ... just my opinion.<br>

Where would &quot;you&quot; like to raid?  how are you along in your epic, maybe we could target a piece of that.  boy sure would like to see you all hasted out....=)<br>
<br>
otherwise i wouldn't mind maybe raiding CoM again on saturday.  lemme hear your thoughts.<br>

<br>
Our only planned raid schedule for each month is:<br>
one raid every week on Thursday<br>
one friday and one saturday raid a month - typically on The 3rd weekend in month but not a religious rule.<br>
<br>
As there is no raid council as yet raids have been posted by whatever player felt like posting them.<br>
<br>
The rules for Thursday raids are tweaked to play just their way - EVERY allied guild has free access to have any member lock up raid based on what they want.  The catch:<br>
- they can have only one raid pending per player<br>
- they can have only one raid per thursday per level range. (can't raid Hole the same day someone has planned a UP raid - but you can have lowbies raid CC that same day)<br>
- AND, you call the raid - YOU LEAD IT!<br>
<br>
Based on Loarind's guidance, it looks like the new and improved raid council will be.<br>
Drannor - Epic/raid<br>
Meeras - Epic/Raid<br>
Serano - Alliance Raids<br>
<br>
This does not mean that we are the only raid leaders - means that unless the council is increased ( I would like to include a plate class melee into the council as well, Loar) all future TF only raids will be called by we happy few.  Of course we will take into account all suggestions.   <br>
<br>
I see Drannor doing some great work on looking at various players epics.  That knowledge will become invaluble in planning our epic raids to finish off the epics in progress.  We have a few players that are very close and a couple that have yet to start.  Constant feedback to Drannor/ Meeras on your epic status will assist them in desiding when and where the best next target will be.<br>
<br>
And as we get our Confederation greesed up - we might as well get them into the mix for our epics and to accomplish their epics as well.  We might very well see an alliance Epic council form up - with prolly Drannor as our rep.  Once our alliance is formed - we will likely see the members fall into whatever virginia plan we get rolling<br>
<br>
I envision us starting to use Tuesday quest night as a good designated time to put together some of our epic raids.<br>
<br>
We will have to deside as a guild or as officers (Loar's call) if we want to extend our Scheduled Raid days or keep them as they are.  At least the framework for our combine raids is in place.  Don't know the other guilds raid schedules at all so far.  Currently it seems they raid when scheduled or with us - but haven't seen a cycle in RDoF or Torture.  It might be right in front of me but I haven't found it in any regular format on their boards ( Yes I know Aboo and Bigm are going to read this /wave ).  <br>
<br>
So how those guilds regular raids fit into ours is yet too be seen.  This brings up Guild raids vs alliance raids.  In order to clear up any confusion that may occur on this issue I recomend the following terms to the alliance charter makers and our present allies:<br>
<br>
- obviously all Thursday raids are THE night to have joint raids<br>
<br>
- If you want to invite the other guilds to your raids - please xpost your raids on each of our raid / alliance forums.<br>
<br>
- If you would prefer to keep ANY particular raid as a guild only raid - simply don't xpost it to the other guilds boards and we will get the none to subtle message! (work for you pens?)  If any player trys to invite himself to your guild only raid either gratiously accept their offer or slam the door in their face - no hard feelings either way - deal?<br>
<br>
- AND - I would expect EVERY Epic raid - regardless of day/ time to be OPEN to all of the small ally network we have established.  As always no raids are mandatory - but joint participation makes incredible things available to us.  I don't expect we would ever have a problem with any of our player base helping on an epic raid.... Just be durn carefull if you bring ANY - ANY - I repeat ANY pick up players invited.<br>

Was why i stressed that the saturday night thing is in NO WAY obligatory.<br>
<br>
if you never go once, who cares is my attitude.  and if there is one time where there isn't a single TF person, that's fine too.  I just wanted to lay one small time when (if the mood saw fit) ppl could all get together, late night style, and get down and dirty with people from many time zones.  I know I got some feedback from torture regarding the topic of time zones, and believe me, i feel their pain. <br>
<br>
when i was in axiom, which was lead by ppl from france, with germans and pomeys and other time zones all mixed in.  my raid attendance was deplorable.  mainly cuz they got their raids &quot;underway&quot; by 3pm et...not to mention what about west coasters in a guild like that?  hung out to dry.<br>
<br>
personally, i know i am a late owl on the weekends, and usually the last to quit.  so i figure let's get these late night misfits together and get some ground covered.  <br>
<br>
so, once more, i DO NOT want ppl to think they ever have to do this.  and even if you are on at the time, you would never be hassled into going.  in fact, i don't plan on even sending tells to ppl about it in game.  i am just gonna open the channel should i be the first person on, or at least join the channel when i log on if it's a late nite on saturday, and hop on the bus!  <br>
<br>
IMHO, with all the allies we have now, i am bent on meeting as many as i can in order to better understand our growing family and friends pile.  it's quite massive i must say.  I am still impressed with the quick turn out from mondays trip to the Overthere.<br>
<br>
hehe, now that i think about what you are sayin a bit more pens, i can kinda read a familar tone in your words.  reminds me of how i feel when i see all these events going on, so many ppl to help out, so little time....<br>
<br>
so hell man, don't be afraid to take a bit of a vacation from officer life.  even general's in the military have to take some time out for perspective...<br>
<br>
take a load off for and do what &quot;pens&quot; wants to do.  it's not like by the end of the week of events we'll be sayin, that damn pens, he NEVER comes to raids, let's boot him out!<br>
<br>
hehehe<br>
<br>
so really, as far as actual obligatory raids where ppl really should be making a semi-regular appearance if possible, should (again, all IMO statements) be thursday and tuesday.  if those days are bad for ya, then make it up by goin to somethin that isn't required.  you'll get seen there, and it will be noted that you do go to events, even if you can't be at &quot;every&quot; event.<br>
<br>
did i miss anything?<br>
