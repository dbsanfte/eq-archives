Do you honestly play EQ so much it effects your life?  I mean I will clear a weekend to do PoA because it seems like fun, but that's about as far as I'd take it.  Do you think you need to balance RL and EQ?  If so you probably put too much stock into your toon.  EQ is for when you don't feel like going out and just wanna relax at the house.  In a year or 2 is it really gonna matter that you were able to get 2 lvl 60 toons?  After 2 years, EQ is still as fun as it was when I first played it.  I get a little worried when I see the same people on every day ALL day.  Go outside or something.  People talk about their marathon EQ sessions as well.  &quot;I've been playing 36 hours straight&quot;    Uhh why dude?  EQ is a really fun game and I plan to have a part in killing every single major mob in the game as I am sure others do as well.  I set goals in everything I do.  In EQ it's the same as most others.  60 with epic, but I will not sacrifice RL to do it.  All this is coming out of my head and onto this thread so it's gonna be a jumbled mess of crap.  Just stuff I've been noticing lately because I haven't been able to play much in the past 2 weeks.  People are asking me if I am tired of EQ or if I am quitting.  NO!!!  I am just busy screwing off in the world outside Norrath.  and if EQ is more important to you than RL then I suggest you log off a bit and go out with some friends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucaylanvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caylan Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 10:33:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't get it</span><hr size=1> wow, that came out like diarhea of the mouth.

<br>
I started a toon on this server day it opened and played hours on end to do the things that I wasnt able to on Torv, Prexus and Tholuxe. Had fun racing Vaclav and Fragile to level after level although I never caught up with either. Was able to do a few firsts on the server. Hunting in Sol A when no one else could save your butt if you died there, Oasis and WC covered in giants was an awesome sight. <br>
<br>
I played for months, night after night, sometimes many hours as you indicated (AC 27hrs thx). I met some of the nicest people and some also not so nice. Learned things about this game that I never new. <br>
<br>
Then some things changed. The fighting over spawns and camps. The server gained some individuals who I would have rather not met. Arguments over FFA and scheduling. Squabbling among the guilds and within the guild I was in. I lost friends who left the game. Or joined another guild and lost the closeness we once had. I was suprised at how much I missed these people even though &quot;It's just a game&quot; as many claim.<br>
<br>
I noticed that my work began to suffer. I was tired all the time, even fell asleep playing once. I wasn't spending the time I should have with my wife, kids and friends. One friend would even call up asking if he had reached the EQ Anon hotline. My motorcycle sitting in the garage ignored.<br>
<br>
The game changed also. As a druid people who used almost beg me to join their xp groups began saying, &quot;We don't really need a druid for this group&quot;. I was no longer hunting in the main groups for raids, relegated to back groups where you almost dont know what is going on in the raid. <br>
<br>
And yes before you even point it out, I know that many feel you have to put raids together with the precision of a swiss watch and heaven forbid if the appropriate class wasn't in the right group.  I'd rather not bring that or many other cans of worms up right now. <br>
<br>
I noticed that after reaching 57th I could no longer log on for a few hours of enjoyment, it was always turning into one big massive raid lasting hour after hour just to reach a zone where I would usually die a lot, get 0 xp get 0 loot and watch guild newbies reap the rewards. I was a faithful follower month after month early on but since I couldnt dedicate the time I once did was pushed to the bottom of the list. Kind of a &quot;What have you done for me lately&quot; thing. <br>
<br>
Maybe I was naive about how this game was played at the high level, this being my first toon above 30th.<br>
<br>
Maybe you're only as important as the last time you helped some loot whore monk camp the fungi tunic, who has neglected to tell you why he wants you in his Seb group, and that after he gets his tunic has to log immediately, but &quot;Oh sure I'll help you camp that Hiero cloak&quot;, but &quot;Sorry I cant right now&quot; is always what he says later. <br>
<br>
Maybe I didn't change with the game as many others have been able to. I miss playing a lot, but the last few times I logged in was tell bombed by newbs for port, sow etc, never been anon or /role so I kinda got used to it, but somehow its changed. Old friends too busy for a casual xp group, and me with not enough time to stay on for the hours required for long raids that seem to start at a time that an old man like me should be in bed, diddling his old lady. <br>
<br>
I'll probably play again, not like when this server was young and I was naive, for hours on end, but maybe to enjoy what a diifferent class can bring to the table, or see a zone that I haven't learned yet. <br>
<br>
I do love this game.<br>
Pyne<br>

<br>
i do know people that play EQ in a &quot;balanced&quot; fashion. i.e. they take vacations, sick days are not used up to finish raids, they occasionally go out. however i also know that there are only 24 hours in a day, assuming you sleep 6, work 8, spend 3 eating/driving/showering, etc., you only have 7 left and if you're on EQ daily for even just 3 hours (this is what, moderate EQ playing?) it leaves very little time to do other things. for those that are on 8+ hours a day, and there are lots of these, it's easy to see that EQ &gt;&gt;&gt; RL for you. or EQ = your RL. i mean i would know since i used to do that. didn't work, didn't go to school, seldom went out, and yet, believe it or not, there were still people who were on more than i was. scary. i still scare myself when i think about it.<br>
<br>
it happens though. i don't think addicts realize that yeah, EQ accomplishments/toon/anything really have nothing to do with how your RL goes, in fact, it's probably not so beneficial for your significant other or those family/friends who'd like to spend time with you but don't play EQ ;p. i know i lost sight of this for a while. playing EQ meant more than filling out my tax returns or getting my car checked up or things that actually affect my financial and physical wellbeing =/. oh well! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/ucaylanvazaelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caylan Vazaelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Contributing Member</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 11:53:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wah</span><hr size=1> That's exactly what I'm talking about.  I just don't see how some people can be on all the time.  Now I like some of these people and play with them frequently, but a 30 hour non stop session of EQ is just ridiculous.  I could see playing EQ alot if you lived in the middle of nowhere and had nothing to do, but I just thik some people lose track of the important things in life while playing this game.  EQ is a blast.  It's very fun and even fulfilling(sp?) at times.  I mean who doesn't feel all warm inside after doing a tough quest or getting another level?  But, you should not let it dictate your life.  If you are spending all your free time in front of the computer maybe you should take a little time off and re-aquaint yourself with the real world.  I have friends I had to set straight.  That's how all this came about.  Would ask them if they wanted to do something and it was always &quot;Can't I got a raid.&quot;  Or &quot;Can't I need to get outta this hell level&quot;  I've seen their lives start revolving around EQ.  What I am trying to say is it is not a bad thing to work hard in EQ to get to the endgame stuff, but not too hard.  There needs to be a balance.  As with all hobbies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub41.ezboard.com/umalikaiiscariot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malikai Iscariot</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~padgett/swirl.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 11:59:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~padgett/Malikai.jpg height=193 width=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wah</span><hr size=1> I've found EQ to be a good break from RL.

I save so much money playing EQ that it isn't even funny. If I wasn't playing EQ on the weekends I would be in the bar drinking like a fish with my friends and doing all kinds of crazy drugs. A typical weekend out with my friends starts on friday and takes a break around saturday noon when the drugs wear off and the clubs close ^^. Then it starts up again for saturday evening and repeat for sunday till noon. Add a good sketchy 3 days of recovery where I don't want to talk to anyone and next you know it's 25 cent beer thursdays at a local bar.<br>
<br>
The damage of that = <br>
1. Fried brain<br>
2. Eating total crap that costs waay to much<br>
3. Approx $250 of partying per week<br>
4. Some weird freaky chick that wears a soother around her neck calling you at all hours.<br>
5. No work productivity<br>
<br>
Eq is a sound financial investment for me at least and probably the healthiest addiction I could have formed given the alternatives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=344.topic&start=21&stop=32>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=353.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showMessage?topicID=252.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.threadControl?topicID=344.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=344.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=344.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub41.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm2">Vazaelle Server Board Rules<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm19">VCC Administrative Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm18">Title Requests<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm1">General Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm23">SoL Discussion<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm4">The Bazaar<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm12">Voting Booth<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm13">Retirement Hall<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm3">Event Announcements<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm8">The Gallery<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm5">Rants and Flames<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm6">Guild Links Submission<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm16">Guild Discussions<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm20">Guild Recruitment<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm22">Upcoming Games<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm7">Vazaelle Guild Leader Lounge<option value="vazaellecommunitycenterfrm24">VCC Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/bvazaellecommunitycenter>Vazaelle Community Center</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm5>Rants and Flames</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
